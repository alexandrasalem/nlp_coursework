Imitating the unmagnanimous cannot be taken as following the right standard."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Amendments to Immigration Law clears legislative floor</HEADLINE>

      <P>A raft of amendments to the country's Immigration Law cleared the legislative
floor Friday, which will offer better protection for new immigrants.</P>
      <P>Human rights activists chanted jubilant slogans outside the legislative chamber
to celebrate the passage of the Immigration Law amendments.</P>
      <P>As the amended law adds provisions to prevent and control human trafficking and
offer special protections for foreign citizens and migrant workers falling prey
to criminal acts, human rights activists hailed the new legislation as a giant
step forward in Taiwan's judicial rights.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, foreign spouses of local citizens who fall victim to
domestic violence and migrant workers who are at odds with their local employers
will not be repatriated immediately even if their legal stay period expires.
They can stay for a certain period of time to seek justice. Moreover, public
hearings or review sessions will be held in addressing those cases. In the past,
police have discretion over those disputes.</P>
      <P>The amendments also offer easier terms for foreign citizens with advanced high-
tech expertise or special contributions to obtain permanent residency in Taiwan.
The new amendments will take effect soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`Two-step' voting format invalid: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Nov.  30  (CNA)
12/01/07  11:38:09
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed no compromise Friday over the controversial
voting format to be used in the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative polls and two
referendums to be held alongside, claiming that the "two-step" voting scheme
broached by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is invalid.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a tour of Nantou County in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, who also serves as chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , pledged that he will not give way to or concede over the dispute and
cited the Central Election Commission (CEC) as terming the "two-step" voting
format as "unconstitutional."</P>
      <P>In response to an allegation that the Government Information Office spent more
than NT$10 million (US$330,000)  to run an advertisement promoting the "one-
step" format in print media and on TV, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey
argued that doing so was aimed at "correcting a widespread misconception" about
the KMT-initiated "two-step" voting scheme.</P>
      <P>Shieh strongly criticized the KMT-proposed "two-step" format, saying it would
breach the principle of "secret ballots" and make vote-buying and other illegal
means to rig elections easier.</P>
      <P>Rebutting KMT claims that the CEC-designed "one-step" format will create
confusion and chaos in the voting process, Shieh urged the KMT to stop its
wrangling with the central government in this regard so as to allow the 18 KMT-
led "pan-blue alliance" local governments to put an end to the dispute.</P>
      <P>The central government and the 18 localities have been engaged in a verbal
battle over which format should be adopted for the legislative elections and the
two referendums after the CEC decided Nov. 16 to adopt a "one-step" format for
the polls.</P>
      <P>No progress has been made in the dispute, with neither camp showing any
willingness to soften its position.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese, Japanese firms to cooperate in online shopping service</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Uni-President Group will cooperate with the Japan-based Rakuten Group
to operate an online shopping mall in Taiwan, a company executive said Friday.</P>
      <P>Uni-President Group CEO Jason Lin told a news conference that the group's
President Chain Store Corp. will form a joint venture with the Rakuten Group to
cash in on an online shopping boom in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first President-Rakuten online shopping mall is slated to be inaugurated in
2008, he added.</P>
      <P>President Chain Store Corp. is Taiwan's largest convenience store operator with
over 4,600 7-Eleven stores around the country, while the Rakuten Group owns
Rakuten Ichiba, Japan's largest online shopping site, with capital totaling
NT$174 million (about US$5.4 million).</P>
      <P>According to the plan, the Web site is expected to be generating profit by 2009,
with 3,000 online stores projected by 2010.</P>
      <P>The joint venture is the result of two years of negotiations, President Chain
Store Corp. President Hsu Chung-jen said, adding that President will own 49
percent of the joint venture's shares, with Rakuten Ichiba controlling a
majority 51 percent.</P>
      <P>The new shopping site will offer both Japanese and Taiwanese products, Hsu said,
adding that in the future, Taiwanese products might gain access to other
overseas markets via Rakuten Ichiba.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Charity organization calls for home for suspected HIV/AIDS babies</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Nov. 30 (CNA)
12/01/07  11:39:34
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An executive of the Taipei-based Garden of Mercy Foundation, a charity
organization dedicating to offering care and shelter to HIV and AIDS patients,
pleaded Friday for aid from the public for "six adorable babies who need a
home."</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairwoman Chang Su-li made the plea at a press conference to
celebrate the second founding anniversary of the Home of Mercy Infant Center,
which is now home to the six infants, born to local drug addicts infected with
AIDS.</P>
      <P>Chang said it cannot be ascertained whether the babies are infected with the
AIDS virus directly from the mother until they are 18 months old, but she added
that some of them are already being given preventive medicine.</P>
      <P>According  to pediatrician  Lu Chun-yi of National  Taiwan University Hospital,
the chance of newborns catching AIDS can be lowered from 40 percent to 1 percent
or even zero if they are given preventive medicine for six weeks from birth and
constant health checks until they are 1 year old.</P>
      <P>After three tests, Lu said, they can judge whether or not the babies are
infected.</P>
      <P>Chang said the AIDS-suspected infants are being cared for by nurses and
caregivers working at the center, while two of them are being sent to temporary
foster families at the weekend.</P>
      <P>Noting that all the people who are fostering or have expressed willingness to
adopt babies delivered from AIDS patients are foreign, Chang said with a sigh
that so far they have found no local families willing to adopt infants suspected
of having AIDS.</P>
      <P>She noted that one couple from Changhua County in central Taiwan adopted a baby
but "returned" the newborn to social welfare workers after discovering the
infant was born to an AIDS-infected mother.</P>
      <P>She expressed gratitude to the foreign friends who are either caring for the
babies sheltered at the Home of Mercy Infant Center or who have applied to adopt
one of them, Chang said.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Paula Perry, a 31-year-old British single woman, and
Finnish Tuija Heiskanen, both blondes, caught the media's attention because of
the black-haired baby girls lying in their arms.</P>
      <P>Perry, who came to Taiwan two years ago, is a researcher in molecular biology in
medicine at the Academia Sinica. The devout Christian became the first Home of
Mercy foster mother six months ago when she met five-month-old Sarah at the
infant center.</P>
      <P>Perry told CNA that she takes Sarah to church, shopping and swimming, or just
stays at home with her every weekend. She added that she loves the child more
and more dearly as the days pass and is considering formally adopting the girl
and taking her to the U.K.</P>
      <P>For Tuija Heiskanen, a mother of four, there is no likelihood of her adopting
the baby girl Mercy she is fostering, although she said she and her husband,
both of whom are Christian missionaries serving at the Hsinyi Church in Taipei,
very much want to make Mercy their fifth child.</P>
      <P>Tuija explained that they are too old to be adoptive parents under Finnish law,
which stipulates that only those aged under 45 can adopt children.</P>
      <P>Also in the media spotlight at the press conference was a 1-year-old baby boy
named Marshall. Chang said Marshall has already been adopted by a U.S. couple
and is set to fly there in two months.</P>
      <P>The couple told the foundation that they do not care if Marshall has AIDS, Chang
added.</P>

      <P>The 12 companies that have set up shop in Tainan County's Taiwan Orchid
Plantation have seen their business  turnover  growing  up to three times their
original investments, Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-chih said Friday.</P>

a liberal political party -- that the investments made by these companies in the
orchid biotechnology park have totaled NT$200 million and that in less than
three years, their combined production value has tripled their investment.</P>
      <P>Su accompanied the South African delegation on a visit to one of the orchid
greenhouses in the plantation and explained how the Tainan county government
realized its plans for the plantation.</P>
      <P>The plantation, located in Hobi township, has developed 23 hectares in the first
stage of the plan. When all five stages of the plan are completed, the total
area of the plantation will cover some 170 hectares.</P>

    <HEADLINE>50 years of Fulbright exchange program celebrated in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) hosted a dinner in Taipei Friday to
celebrate 50 years of the Fulbright academic exchange program in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stephen Young, director of the AIT's Taipei office, who serves as honorary
chairman of the Foundation for Scholarly Exchange that administers the program
in Taiwan, said that over the past 50 years, the program has created an
immeasurable wealth of lasting impressions on over 2,000 participating scholars
from Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Young said the program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State and many
partner organizations outside the United States, has for decades increased
mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States and the rest of
the world.</P>
      <P>Last year alone, the program awarded around 6,000 grants to students, teachers,
professionals and scholars to study, teach, lecture and conduct research in the
United States, and for Americans to pursue similar programs in over 150
countries outside the United States, according to Young.</P>
      <P>Many of Taiwan's leaders are Fulbright alumni, including former Minister of
Finance Paul Chiu, former Minister of Defense Sun Chen, Cloud Gate Dance Theater
founder Lin Hwai-min, National Chengchi University President Wu Se-hwa and
former Vice Premier Wu Rong-I, he noted.</P>
      <P>Also taking part in the event,  Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said the
Fulbright program represents the longstanding friendship between Taiwan and the
United States.</P>
      <P>Tu said the program has set a model for the Taiwan-U.S. cooperation partnership
and has had a profound influence on Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the number of Taiwanese students going overseas to pursue tertiary
education hit a record high, with the number of those going to the United States
increasing 59 percent over the 2003 figure, he said, adding that he hopes more
American students and academics will study and conduct research in Taiwan
through the Fulbright program.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AmCham unveils recommendations for Taiwan's presidential candidates</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
12/01/07  13:54:58
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (AmCham) has published a special
report titled Vision 2020 on Taiwan's future to serve as its recommendations for
the presidential candidates of the country's two largest political parities.</P>
      <P>AmCham said in a news release issued Friday that Taiwan has the potential to
enjoy immense business opportunities over the coming decade or more in high-tech
industries, financial services and other areas of the economy.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it pointed out that achieving such success will depend on numerous
factors, particularly how well Taiwan overcomes its current reluctance to tap
fully into the mega-growth taking place in China's economy.</P>
      <P>"It will also be necessary to boost competitiveness through such steps as
revamping tax policy, restructuring the financial system, carrying out
educational reform,  creating a more transparent, consistent and even-handed
regulatory regime, and liberalizing rules on work permits for foreign and
mainland Chinese professionals," said the AmCham press release.</P>
      <P>Even more fundamentally, the news release went on, Taiwan will need to maintain
stable cross-Taiwan Strait relations, adopt a more outward-looking  and
internationalist  mindset,  strengthen  its democratic institutions and build a
more collaborative domestic political environment.</P>
      <P>These are the major conclusions in Vision 2020, a special issue of Taiwan
Business TOPICS that was published this week, the news release said. TOPICS is a
monthly magazine published by AmCham.</P>
      <P>According to the AmCham news release, Vision 2020 contains 14 articles by
prominent Taiwanese and international commentators, attempting to look beyond
short-term issues to identify what Taiwan should wish to be like in the year
2020 and what will be required to attain this.</P>
      <P>In an accompanying editorial in the issue of Taiwan Business TOPICS, AmCham
Taipei states that the necessary progress can only be attained through vigorous,
clear-minded and enlightened leadership.</P>
      <P>"It is therefore particularly timely that Vision 2020 is being published in the
midst of the campaign for the presidential election of next March," notes the
editorial.</P>
      <P>The editorial further recommends that the presidential and vice presidential
nominees and their aides regard the special section as a useful source of
reference as they put together the policy objectives that will define their
candidacies.</P>
      <P>"After the election, the winning team might well give these papers a rereading
as a reminder of what needs to be tackled during their term in office to help
set the stage for a politically stable, economically flourishing and socially
just Taiwan in 2020," it adds.</P>
      <P>Following is a list of the 14 contributors and their major themes:</P>
      <P>-- Setting the Agenda: A Roadmap to Revitalization by Michael Kurtz, senior
managing director at Bear Stearns Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.With a fuller embrace
of mainland Chinese commercial opportunities, radical tax overhaul, financial-
sector restructuring, renewed commitment to a strong currency, and educational
reform, Taiwan could resuscitate economic growth and preserve its place among
the world's most advanced economies through 2020 and beyond. But if political
division and inertia continue to prevent policymakers from addressing these
vital challenges, future Taiwanese may be left to ponder nostalgically: 'What
went wrong?'</P>
      <P>-- Economic Development: Moving up the Global Value Chain by Chen Tain-jy,
professor of economics, National Taiwan University, and former president of the
Chung-Hwa Institute for Economic Research. We should look at industries that
will reap rewards beyond our time. To achieve this, we will have to vastly
improve the educational system, increase funding for research activities, and
provide support for industries that take time to develop.</P>
      <P>-- Regional Relations: The Need to Take Advantage of Location by Philip Bowring,
columnist for the International Herald Tribune and former editor of the Far
Eastern Economic Review.Taiwan has the money, the people skills, the geography,
and most of the physical infrastructure. But thus far it lacks the vision, the
will, and the level of governance needed to create an identity founded on its
role in Asia and the world, transcending debates on who is or is not Chinese.</P>
      <P>-- High-tech Industry: Infrastructure in Place for Further Expansion by Peter
Kurz, Managing Director and Head of Research, Citigroup Global Markets
Taipei.The tech-industry foundation formed over the past two decades provides a
uniquely powerful platform from which new industries can develop in the futurein
such sectors as materials science, branded products, IC design, and biotech.</P>
      <P>-- Service Sector: The Path to Greater Productivity and Higher Income by Peter
Sutton, Head of Taiwan Research, CLSA Asia Pacific Markets.Removing restrictions
on air travel to China and easing the issuance of business visas to PRC
passport-holders are the two changes to government policy that would do the most
to return head-office activity to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>-- Financial Sector: Opportunities from New Markets and New Products by Schive
Chi, Chair Professor of Economics at Shih Hsin University and former president
of the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance.Some huge opportunities will
present themselves to Taiwan's financial institutions in the period before 2020.
How well they are able to take advantage of those opportunities will depend both
on their own preparedness and on the regulatory approaches adopted by the
government.</P>
      <P>-- Democratic Consolidation: Inspired Political Reform Requires Effective
Leadership by Richard C. Bush, senior fellow and director of the Center for
Northeast Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.
and former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan. Effective political
leadership is neededto offer a sense of vision; to forge a centrist, reformist
coalition ... to get politicians to rise above parochial interests and focus on
national imperatives ... and to foster public support for change.</P>
      <P>-- International Relations: Toward a Win-Win-Win Future by C.J. Chen, former
foreign minister and Taiwan representative to the United States and the European
Union.To achieve our diplomatic goals -- assuring peace, stability, prosperity,
and the dignity of Taiwan in the international community -- we must try to reach
greater consensus on our national identity. We must face the reality of an
increasingly more powerful China ...</P>
      <P>--  U.S.-China-Taiwan Relations:  Focus on Forging Positive Dynamics by Bonnie
Glaser, senior associate at the Center for Strategic &amp; International
Studies, Washington, D.C.Based on an assessment that Taiwan's economic future
lies with the mainland and that it has sufficient capability to manage the
attendant risks, Taipei could remove barriers to cross-strait flow of people,
goods and services, and investment long before 2020.</P>
      <P>-- Defense: A Security Challenge of Towering Complexity by Eric A. McVadon, Rear
Admiral (Retired) , U.S. Navy.A strategy for the future designed to better
ensure U.S. support, develop complementary Taiwan forces, and influence
Beijing's thinking offers the prospect of deterring attack and changing these
entrenched attitudes so that Taiwan's situation becomes far less dire and
complex.</P>
      <P>-- Rule of Law: The Urgency of Tackling Judicial Reform C.V. Chen, managing
partner and CEO, Lee &amp; Li.The ending of martial law should have removed all
the restraints that had held back the development of our legal system.
Unfortunately, however, many psychological restraints still remain.</P>
      <P>-- Education: Shift the Balance from the Abstract to the Practical by R.C.T.
Lee, former president of National Chi Nan University.The biggest problem with
our educational system is the huge gap between the best and worst students ... A
second major shortcoming is that our engineering courses are too theoretical.</P>
      <P>-- Healthcare: How to Assure Both Quality and Affordable Cost? by Chang Ly-yun,
Research Fellow and Professor, Academia Sinica, and chair of the Taiwan
Healthcare Reform Foundation.The key issue for policymakers is how the
government can hold the mass healthcare sector accountable for quality standards
despite the incentives given to care provides to cut costs.</P>
      <P>-- Infrastructure and Quality of Life: Citizens' Movements Must Take the Lead by
Hsia Chu-Joe, director of the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning,
National Taiwan University.The state must invest more in urban policies and
infrastructure, and it is vital for citizen participation to be a central
element in the process.</P>

      <P>The Bureau of Standard Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs has decided to conduct safety examinations of toys being
marketed in toy shops, department stores, shopping malls and night markets
around the country in the next few days, BSMI officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made after the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)
recalled 62 toys produced in China from July 19 to Nov. 14 because they were
painted with lead-based paint.</P>
      <P>The recalled toys include magnetic train sets, toy jewelry sets, accessories for
Barbie dolls and stuffed toys, the officials cited CPSC online reports as
saying.</P>
      <P>The officials explained that their examination will focus on whether the
products contain excessive amounts of heavy metals, whether they carry safety
instructions, warnings and other useful information written in Mandarin Chinese,
and whether there are substandard products listed by the CPSC as recalled items
being marketed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>BSMI officials advised consumers to check before buying toys containing small or
magnetic parts that could choke toddlers, as well as toys with sharp edges or
those that are painted in bright colors.</P>

      <P>Nearly 10,000 women in rural areas are scheduled to complete a course of free
computer lessons subsidized by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) by the end of this year, a CEPD official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD launched the program earlier this year with the aim of narrowing the
digital divide between women in urban and rural areas, approving applications
from 11 non-profit organizations in June and earmarking subsidies of about
NT$14.5 million (US$447,255) from the Executive  Yuan's Sino-American  Fund for
Economic  and Social Development to operate the program.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out most Taiwanese women, especially those in rural areas,
dedicate more time than men to taking care of children and family chores and
thus have little time to learn computer skills.</P>
      <P>The subsidy program will give them basic computer skills so that they can have
better job opportunities, improve their interpersonal relations and create more
communication channels with their children. With their computer skills, they can
also acquire further education in many fields, the official said.</P>
      <P>The 11 organizations have provided 24 hours of basic computer lessons to the
course attendees, the official said.</P>
      <P>The program has been in practice in more than 100 townships since June, and one
of the subsidized organizations, Electronic Commerce Business Association, will
hold a students' performance party in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan Dec. 3 to
introduce the public to the students' achievements, the official said.</P>
      <P>He added that CEPD Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh and Senior Director of Community

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged Saturday that the government  will continue
its efforts to boost the development of Taiwan's information and communications
technology (ICT) to sustain the country's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Over the next five years, Chen noted, the government will funnel NT$55.6 billion
(US$1.72 billion) into upgrading Taiwan's ICT infrastructure, including NT$11.3
billion on promoting innovative applications related to everyday life, NT$26.5
billion on expanding the country's high-speed broadband network and NT$8.8
billion on promoting digitized services by government agencies.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing the opening of the 2007 IT Month, which
features a theme titled "In Love with Digital Life."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the theme precisely reflects the fact that Taiwan has become
an "island of digital life."</P>
      <P>Citing a report authored by the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
on Taiwan's digital divide situation in 2007, Chen said approximately 13 million
people, or 65.5 percent of the country's population, have access to the
Internet, with 74.7 percent of Taiwanese households connected to the Internet.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the penetration rate of mobile phones has reached 103.2 percent, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, these achievements are the results of policies
adopted by the government in recent years to improve the country's information
technology  infrastructure,  such as the "M-Taiwan  project" aimed at
universalizing  wireless broadband networking and the "Digital Taiwan project"
aimed at turning Taiwan into a hi-tech service-oriented island.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan's innovative competitiveness has been rated second in
Asia and sixth worldwide by the U.K.-based Economist Intelligence Unit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 14 Taiwanese businesses were included on the list of the world's top
100 performers in the IT industry released earlier this year by the U.S.-based
BusinessWeek, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Further pointing to the World Information Society Report 2007 released by the
International Communication Union, Chen said Taiwan's digital opportunities are
rated seventh best among the 181 economies surveyed worldwide for 2007, up three
notches over the previous year's survey.</P>

      <P>A group of autistic riders arrived in Taipei Saturday after completing a two-

Society Taiwan (AST), which organized the event.</P>
      <P>Yeh told CNA that the riders experienced blazing sun and typhoon-caused bad
weather, as well as rough roads during the trip, but proved themselves
courageous and with the ability to face challenges, she said.</P>
      <P>Six autistic people completed the tour that started Nov. 18, the youngest of
whom is aged 10 and the oldest aged 25.</P>
      <P>Before the journey, Yeh said all participants, including the six who completed
it, took a three-week training program. In addition, they were all accompanied
by their parents during the ride.</P>
      <P>Autistic people suffer from autism, sometimes called "classical autism, " which
is the most common condition among a group of developmental disorders known as
the autism spectrum disorders.</P>
      <P>Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction, problems with verbal and
nonverbal communication, and unusual, repetitive or severely limited activities
and interests. These behaviors can range in impact from mild to disabling.</P>
      <P>Yeh said some autistic children can live normal lives with proper education and
treatment.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the aims behind organizing the cycling tour, Yeh said the AST wants
to convey to society the correct information about autism and the autistic, and
to inspire other families with members who suffer from the disorder to offer

      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said Saturday that the ministry will abide
by the law in a dispute with the Taipei city government over a plan to renovate
the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, formerly named the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>Tu made the remarks in response to questions regarding whether the ministry will
proceed with a plan Tuesday to remove an inscription alluding to the late
President Chiang Kai-shek at the gateway of the memorial hall and replace it
with "Liberty Square, " and to also remove a tablet inscribed "Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall" on the top of the main monument, after a court ruling.</P>
      <P>The Taipei High Administrative Court rejected Friday a Taipei city government
injunction request to bar the ministry changing the inscription from "dazhong
zhizheng" to "Liberty Square," but it also ruled that the city government, which
has listed the memorial hall as a historic relic, has jurisdiction over its
protection and "does not need to request an injunction and can arrest anyone
caught destroying the historic relic."</P>
      <P>The city government's top cultural official reaffirmed that the city government
will deal with the matter according to the law.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-ping, director of the city government's Department of Cultural Affairs,
urged the ministry not to start the renovation work illegally lest innocent
civil servants and construction companies face criminal charges.</P>
      <P>She noted that the High Administrative Court has ruled that the city government
has jurisdiction over the memorial hall. If the ministry insists on going ahead
with its plan without applying for city government approval, related personnel
could be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>They could face prison terms of up to five years and the civil servants
responsible could see their prison term lengthened by one half, she continued.</P>
      <P>The renovation work is part of the government's campaign to expunge the last
vestiges of the authoritarian Chiang Kai-shek rule. The government renamed
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
Sept. 6, 2006 and renamed Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall the National Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall July 15, 2007.</P>

      <P>A high-tech tycoon will debate a cross-Taiwan Strait peaceful co-existence
legislation he envisions with local politicians Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>Robert Tsao, honorary chairman of United Microelectronics Corp., will meet with
former legislators Shen Fu-hsiung and Lin Jo-shui of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), the Third Society workshop Convener Chou Yi-cheng, and
incumbent Kuomintang legislators Chiang Hsiao-yen and Lai Shyh-bao, in a forum
on Taiwan's future that will be held at the Civil Service Development Institute.</P>
      <P>Tsao recently ran two front-page advertisements in major local newspapers to
elaborate on his suggestion that the two major presidential candidates -- Frank
Hsieh of the DPP and Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) --
should work together to draft a law that would provide a legal basis for
peaceful co-existence across the Taiwan Strait and safeguard democracy in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsao's ads aroused heated debate, with President Chen Shui-bian lambasting the
proposal several times, dismissing it as tantamount to capitulation to China.</P>
      <P>The ad claims that the law would resolve the cross-strait issue once and for all
and end the ceaseless political wrangling over the independence vs. unification
issue.</P>
      <P>Tsao also said the law should contain several points, including one that ensures
that no referendum will be held on independence because that would be contrary
to the nation's claim that it is already an independent and sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Also, Tsao said the "independence" he mentions, like the DPP's major "resolution
on Taiwan's future" of 1999, refers to "de facto independence" and Taiwan's
"status quo" --  not the "de jure independence," which he said will cause
unnecessary concern and tension, noting that under an anti-secession law enacted
by China in March 2005, it is stipulated that "non-peaceful means" will be used
if Taiwan moves toward de jure independence.</P>
      <P>Tsao also said Taiwan must not instigate a referendum on unification, so as not
to polarize the people on the island, but should only do so at the command of
China, which would have to explain in detail any substantive measures it would

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reaffirmed the government's resolve Saturday to
continuously improve health and welfare services for disadvantaged people,
including those with mental and physical disabilities.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks  at the 11th Golden  Eagle  Award presentation ceremony
held at the National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei. The annual award
is instituted by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to honor professional

      <P>Praising the award winners as "having spawned beautiful pearls" by achieving
exemplary success in overcoming their own disability with great fortitude, Chang
said the government will never overlook or forget improving care for the
mentally or physically disabled.</P>
      <P>"All of you are larger-than-life warriors and your determination and
perseverance is an inspiration to many others, " Chang said, adding that the
government will always stand with the disabled and help them overcome all odds
and achieve their life goals.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said he admires the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recognized Sunday the exceptional contributions that
traditional Oriental medicine has made to enhancing the health of all people
around the world.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the 14th International Congress of Oriental Medicine
held at National Taiwan University's International Convention Center, Chen said
traditional Oriental medicine has provided a major alternative to Western
medicine, particularly in the treatment chronic diseases and senility.</P>
      <P>Chen said that owing to the tested efficacy of Oriental medicine, the World
Health Organization suggested in 2002 that countries around the world
incorporate the research and development of traditional medicine into their
national health policy.</P>
      <P>He noted that in the three decades since 1976, when the first International
Congress of Oriental Medicine was held in Seoul, practitioners and researchers
of traditional medicine from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and many other nations
have made groundbreaking achievements and commendable contributions in the
struggle to treat the ill and improve the quality of life of all.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, thanks to the concerted efforts of the administration and members
from the private sector, the research and development of Chinese traditional
medicine and pharmaceuticals has progressed by leaps and bounds in recent years,
he said.</P>
      <P>The president expressed particular admiration of the Committee on Chinese
Medicine and Pharmacy under the Cabinet-level Department of Health; the
Taichung-based China Medical University; and the Bureau of National Health
Insurance for their promotion of Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals as a major
alternative to Western medicine in providing treatment to those in medical need.</P>
      <P>Over 2,000 professionals and researchers from Australia, Belgium, Hong Kong,
Japan, South Korea, Macau, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Russia and the United
Kingdom, the United States and the host Taiwan are taking part in the congress,
scheduled to run until Dec. 4.</P>
      <P>A total of 38 specialists, including Dr. David Eisenberg, director of the Osher
Institute, Harvard Medical School, are expected to deliver speeches during the
three-day international meeting, organizers said.</P>
      <P>The International Congress of Oriental Medicine -- a major undertaking of the
International Society of Oriental Medicine (ISOM) -- has been convened every two
or three years in Asia, the United States and Europe.</P>
      <P>The aim of ISOM is to facilitate the exchange of academic information and to
promote the improvement of human health through research and development.</P>
      <P>ISOM also seeks to facilitate cooperation in the field of Oriental medicine; to
organize regular scientific conventions; and to translate and publish important
works in the field.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung inspected the Taichung Harbor free trade zone (FTZ)
Saturday and ordered harbor authorities to map out more favorable measures to
help businesses stationed in the zone cut operating costs in order to attract
further investment.</P>
      <P>Chang was warmly welcomed by Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai
Duei; Lee Lung-wen, director of Taichung Harbor Bureau; and Jao Ping, director
of Taichung Customs Office upon his arrival to Taichung Harbor FTZ for his

      <P>During the tour, Chang was briefed by Lee on measures employed by the habor to
attract investment and operations of the FTZ, plus its advantageous conditions,
total import and export trade value and total cargo volume handled at the
harbor, as well as its future development given the implementation of several
projects under a BOT (Build Operate Transfer) approach.</P>
      <P>In addition to praising the zone's achievements since it began operations in
2005, Chang also reiterated the central government's resolve to push forward
with the development of the country's FTZs in collaboration with other related
government agencies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang gave instructions for the establishment of an inter-agency
coordination  mechanism  to help remove  obsolete regulations and measures that
might reduce the willingness of businesses to invest in the FTZ.</P>
      <P>Chang also exhorted the harbor bureau to make every effort to implement the
Cabinet-approved "Taichung Harbor Overall Planning and Future development Plan"
slated for 2007 - 2011, which aims to make Taichung Harbor an international

      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun, who has been appointed to double
as governor of the Taiwan-ruled Fujian Province, which includes the outlying
islands of Kinmen and Matsu, is scheduled to visit Kinmen Dec. 4 for an
inspection.</P>
      <P>Chen, in his capacity as the new Fujian governor, is expected to meet with
officials from the Kinmen County Government to exchange views on matters of
mutual concern, Executive Yuan officials said.</P>
      <P>He will also reach out to the grassroots on Kinmen Island -- which lies closer
to China's Fujian Province than to Taiwan proper -- during his visit to gain a
better understanding of the needs of local residents.</P>
      <P>Chen's predecessor, Governor Yen Chung-cheng, retired in May with the vacancy

swore him in as the new Fujian governor at a changeover ceremony held Nov. 28.</P>
      <P>Since then, Chen Chin-jun has reiterated that he is resolved to play an active
role improving communication between the central government and the outlying
islands. The Executive Yuan will harbor no considerations of electoral or
political party affiliation when it comes to affairs or policies concerning
Kinmen or Matsu, he stated.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun also said that he will see to it that Kinmen and Matsu are
developed into "islands of tourism" in the years to come to bring prosperity to
these two former anti-communist garrisons.</P>

      <P>Water supplies for both household and industrial use on Taiwan proper in the
first half of 2008 have been secured thanks to abundant rainfall brought by
several summer typhoons, Water Resources Agency (WRA) officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to WRA officials, reservoirs across Taiwan proper still contain
considerable volumes of water, including those dedicated to rice irrigation in
the coming spring, excepting only Nankan -- the major island of the Matsu island
group.</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, reservoirs on Nankan Island only retained some
129,000 tons of water, which WRA officials estimate will be sufficient to
sustain the use of about 1,600 tons per day until the end of January next year.</P>
      <P>If rainfall on Nankan remains scarce during the December-January period, the

      <P>Taiwan ranks fourth in terms of scientific literacy  in a student assessment
program  organized  by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) , according to an online preliminary report released by the
OECD Sunday.</P>
      <P>The OECD's triennial Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a
school-based survey of 15-year-old students in the principal industrialized
countries that assesses young people's reading, mathematical and scientific
literacy.</P>
      <P>The internationally standardized assessment tests how students near the end of
compulsory education have fared in acquiring some of the knowledge and skills
that are essential to fully participate in society.</P>
      <P>The PISA test asks students to solving a variety of problems in real-world
contexts by drawing on a broad range of knowledge and a number of skills and
competencies. As a result, the program is thought to effectively evaluate how
well young people have been equipped for the world of tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The 2006 PISA test was carried out in 57 countries that collectively account for
nearly 90 percent of world GDP. Most of these are advanced countries, and
include Finland, Switzerland and France, according to Chuang Kuo-jung, chief
secretary of Taiwan's Ministry of Education. He added that more than 400,000
students worldwide took part in the extensive two-hour test.</P>
      <P>Chuang said the results show that Taiwanese students scored very well in the
area of scientific knowledge and understanding, which he said speaks to Taiwan's
admirable  achievements  in scientific education.</P>
      <P>Noting that full PISA results will be published worldwide Dec. 4, Chuang urged
the media not to violate the stipulations set by the OECD by disclosing in
advance the full details and scores of the reading and mathematics sections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No change in adopting 'one-step' voting format: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
12/02/07  19:09:00
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed Sunday that a "one-step" voting format will
definitely be adopted for the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative polls and two
referendums, and claimed that a draft law by the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) regarding the composition of the Central Election Commission (CEC) is
"unconstitutional."</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments during a campaign rally in Banciao, Taipei County  for
legislative  candidates  of the ruling  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Commenting on a dispute between the DPP and the KMT over the voting format for
the coming polls, Chen said that the central government will not change its
decision to adopt the CEC-designed "one-step" voting format despite objections
from 18 local governments controlled by the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance, " which
insist on adopting a "two-step" format.</P>
      <P>"There will not be any alteration of the decision because all other countries in
the world use a "one-step" voting scheme when holding elections alongside
referendums," Chen asserted.</P>
      <P>One of the two referendums has been called by the DPP to demand that the KMT
return its illegally acquired assets to the state, while the other is a petition
by the KMT against government corruption.</P>
      <P>The president charged the KMT with refusing to accept the CEC-prescribed "one-
step" voting scheme, and accused it of seeking to ram the CEC bill through the
"pan-blue" controlled Legislative Yuan as a way of blocking the DPP-proposed
referendum and preventing the party's ill-gotten assets from being retrieved.</P>
      <P>The KMT-drafted CEC organic law would stipulate that the CEC be formed by
members of the various political parties in proportion to the number of seats
they hold in the Legislative Yuan -- something which Chen said is
"unconstitutional, " citing the composition of the National Communications
Commission (NCC) as an example.</P>
      <P>The NCC -- currently staffed in line with the principle of proportional
representation and an arrangement that the Grand Council of Justices has ruled
"unconstitutional" -- will cease its operations in January next year, Chen said,
adding that the "pan-blue" alliance's intention to expansively expand the
legislature's power will infringe upon the executive and judicial branches.</P>
      <P>KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said the same day in central Taiwan city
of Taichung that his party will insist on adopting the "two-step" voting format,
which is preferred by most local governments and a majority of grass-roots
electoral personnel.</P>
      <P>The central government should take the majority's opinions into account and
smoothly hold the polls, he said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker who also serves as head of the party's Policy
Coordination Committee, stressed that his party will not give way to the DPP
over the voting format dispute.</P>
      <P>Since the KMT began pushing for the CEC bill's passage in January this year, the
DPP has repeatedly resorted to physical tussles to block the draft law, Tseng
said, adding that the delay in enacting a CEC organic law is shameful in a
democratic state like Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the KMT will do its best to negotiate with the DPP over
the bill's passage, Tseng stressed that the KMT is poised to call a vote on it
before the current session adjourns in late December should the DPP refuse to
talk over the issue.</P>
      <P>The current CEC is under the supervision of the Executive Yuan, and has its
members appointed by the premier and approved by president.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 33-year-old terminally-ill cancer patient from Hsinchu County, northern
Taiwan, recently decided to cease treatment and donate over NT$1 million --
money budgeted to pay for her medical bills -- to the county government to help
build a foundation dedicated to aiding linguistically  gifted but poor students.</P>
      <P>At Tri-Service General Hospital in Taipei City, Chou Pei-shan, a teacher at
Chujen Elementary School in Chubei City of Hsinchu County, told a local media
outlet a few days ago that she hopes the planned foundation will be able to help
realize her wish -- fanning local students' interest to study the Chinese
language and literature despite what she sees as a decline in the literacy of
Taiwanese students at the same time as more and more people elsewhere are keen
to learn Mandarin.</P>
      <P>Chou discovered that she had colorectal cancer some two years ago, shortly after
she received her master's degree in language education from National Taichung
University.</P>
      <P>She was told at the time that she had only six months to live, Chou said. "But
my family wouldn't give up on me," she added.</P>
      <P>Since then, she has tried every kind of therapeutic treatment, including a
"natural killer cell" therapy costing NT$30,000 per treatment.</P>
      <P>"I received that therapy three times," Chou said.</P>
      <P>In addition, she said, "I have taken more than 900 portions of Chinese herbal
medicine, each of which costs NT$300, and over 100 bottles of liquefied
nutrients at a cost of NT$3,000 per dose."</P>
      <P>"Over the past two years,  I underwent 10 major surgical operations, and
seemingly endless courses of chemotherapy, constantly checking in-and-out of
hospital," Chou sighed weakly.</P>
      <P>"I feel heartbroken when I see my father daily drives from Hsinchu to Taipei to
bring me three homemade meals, and mother seems to live at the hospital to
attend to me," she said.</P>
      <P>Lately, Chou said she was advised to cease chemotherapy because she is too weak
to endure the cell-damaging treatment.</P>
      <P>Until then, she did not know that death was approaching, said the school
teacher, who now appears at peace with her fate.</P>
      <P>"Now my parents and I are well prepared to face my death."</P>

take prompt action against a gas station franchise that was found selling
diluted fuel.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Chen Ching-jun said that the Executive Yuan did not

Economic Affairs (MOEA) with looking into the details of the incident to learn
whether the state-run company committed any administrative errors.</P>
      <P>Chen made remarks in response to an Apple Daily newspaper report that MOEA
Minister Steve R.L. Chen lambasted CPC Corp, Taiwan for its handling of the
issue and said that he will not cover up the company's wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>The report noted that although Chen did not give a clear answer as to whether or
not Pan would be replaced, Pan himself offered to resign to take responsibility
if any administrative errors were found relating to the company's handling of
the event.</P>
      <P>The MOEA formed a special task force to investigate who should be held to
account for the incident, and a list of those at fault should be available

    <HEADLINE>Most Taiwan citizens recognize 'one-step' voting format: DPP poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of the Taiwanese public recognizes a "one-step" voting format adopted
by the Cabinet-level Central Election Commission (CEC) for the Jan. 12, 2008
legislative elections, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official
claimed Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-feng, director of the DPP Public Opinion Poll Center, quoted results of
the latest poll conducted by the DPP, released Sunday, as indicating that 56.2
percent of respondents agree with the CEC decision to adopt a "one-step" ballot
distribution and voting format for the next legislative election and two
referendums, which are to be held in tandem.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, as many as 56.6 percent of respondents said adopting a
"two-step" voting format, as proposed by opposition "pan-blue"  alliance-
controlled  cities and counties,  would be "inappropriate" -- a figure that is
nearly nine percentage points higher than the finding posted in a previous DPP
survey conducted Nov. 19 when 47.9 percent of respondents said a "two-step"
voting format would be "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>According to Chang, as many as 61.3 percent of respondents without political
affiliation agree with the "one-step" voting format, while 57.8 percent agree
that local governments should recognize CEC decisions.</P>
      <P>Among respondents claiming to be "pan-blue" alliance supporters, 31.3 percent
support the "one-step" voting format and 42.8 percent think the CEC resolution
regarding voting plans for the next legislative poll should be respected and
observed, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by telephone between Nov. 28-30, found that as many as 76.4
percent of respondents recognize the CEC as a neutral agency responsible for
national electoral affairs and think that seats on the CEC should not be
allocated based on the number of seats political parties hold in the
Legislature, Chang claimed.</P>
      <P>Chang also quoted DPP poll results as indicating that 79 percent of eligible
Taiwanese voters will go to polling stations to vote Jan. 12, representing a
rough voting rate of between 65-70 percent.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,009 valid responses were obtained in the latest DPP survey, which
has an error margin of 3 percent, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The CEC decided last month to adopt the "one-step" voting scheme for the next
legislative poll, under which four ballots -- two for the legislative elections
and two for referendums -- will be distributed from separate desks and cast
simultaneously into four ballot boxes by voters at every polling station.</P>
      <P>On Jan.  12,  two referendums will be held alongside the legislative elections:
one initiated by the DPP on the reclamation of the KMT's ill-gotten assets and
the other initiated by the opposition Kuomintang on wiping out government
corruption.</P>
      <P>The CEC decided earlier this month to adopt the "one-step" voting format,  under
which voters will receive two ballots for the legislative elections and two
referendum ballots at different desks and then cast them into four different
boxes.</P>
      <P>"Pan-blue"-controlled localities have insisted that they will use the "two-step"
format under which voters will receive and cast referendum ballots only after
they have cast their ballots for the legislative elections, claiming that the
"one-step" format could cause confusion and chaos during the voting process.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's pressuring of China-based Taiwanese business people to make known
their political attitudes will only lead to growing resentment among the
Taiwanese people, Mainland Affair Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tong said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments while offering analysis at a seminar co-sponsored by the
Central News Agency, the China affairs studies institute of Tamkang University
and Fuhsing Radio on the present situation and challenges of Taiwanese
businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Beijing has constantly stepped up its pressure on Taiwanese
business people with operations in China, forcing them to make clear their
political stance as a means of containing pro-Taiwan independence sentiment.</P>
      <P>To deal with those in favor of Taiwan independence, Chinese communists often
resort to pretexts such as cracking down on tax evasion or applying extremely
stringent customs inspections to make pro-Taiwan independence business people
afraid of openly lending support to "Taiwan-centric" polices adopted by the
government, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Worst yet, China is even leveraging the business interests of Taiwanese
enterprises and their workers' personal safety to compel businessmen to
pronounce anti-Taiwan independence statements in line with its united front
tactics, he went on.</P>
      <P>For instance, he added, the chairmen of nine Taiwan business people's
associations came out recently with public declarations opposing the
government's plan to hold a DPP-backed referendum to pursue U.N. membership
under the name of Taiwan and another planned referendum, initiated by the main
opposition Kuomintang, to re-join the world body under the official title of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  companies  are facing  great investment  risks and uncertainties in
China as the two sides have failed to sign an investment guarantee accord, he
said, pointing out that the number of trade disputes between Taiwan businessmen
and their Chinese partners handled by the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation amounted to 201 in the first eight months of this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A woman who had chewed betel nut for over 35 years recently won the top prize in
a contest organized by the Bureau of Health Promotion (BHP) under the Executive
Yuan's Department of Health to encourage people to give up the harmful habit.</P>
      <P>Yu Mei-ling, a member of the aboriginal Bunun tribe, won four round-trip air
tickets to Singapore when her name was drawn from among those of over 4,000
other participants in the contest.</P>
      <P>"I never thought I'd actually win a prize when I joined the contest, " Yu said,
pointing out that she only entered at the urging of a local nurse who suggested
that doing so might help her to quit betel nut chewing.</P>
      <P>Yu said that she began chewing betel nut when she was only five years old. And
at the age of 20, she even opened her own betel nut stand in the rural township
of Yenping in Taitung County. "Everyday, Iwould chew betel nut from the time I
woke up in morning until the time I went to bed at night."</P>
      <P>Yu would eventually close her betel nut stand after getting married at the age
of 32, but, in her own words, "I just couldn't break the habit of chewing betel
nut."</P>
      <P>A turning point for Yu came last year when her dying mother urged her to give up
the habit by telling her that "chewing betel nut makes your teeth turn red and
your mouth look ugly."</P>
      <P>Although Yu cut down on betel nut chewing after listening to her mother's words,
she didn't actually quit altogether until she joined the BHP-sponsored contest
in August this year.</P>
      <P>Yu's story marks a success in the BHP's efforts to end the betel nut culture in
Taiwan through the holding of such activities.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau's deputy director-general, Chao Kun-yu, major
international health organizations around the world now regard betel nut to be a
known human carcinogen, and there is strong evidence that betel nut chewers are
at higher risk of developing oral cancer.</P>
      <P>Chao pointed out that according to official tallies, the number of new mouth
cancer cases in Taiwan rose from 1,700 in 2004 to 4,700 in 2006 and that the
number of deaths due to oral cancer increased from 1,000 to 2,200 in the same
period.</P>
      <P>As for Yu, after successfully giving up betel nut chewing, she has now begun
working to encourage others to quit the harmful habit. "There are many
aboriginal people, both young and old, who chew betel. I try to encourage them
to quit the habit by using my mother's words that chewing betel nut makes your
teeth turn red and your mouth look ugly." Yu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) stepped into the dispute between the ruling and
opposition parties over the voting format to be employed in the Jan. 12
legislative elections Sunday by calling for distributing the ballots for
individual lawmakers and the ballots for specific party separately.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei said while stumping for a party legislative
candidate in Taipei that the separation is necessary as the legal qualification
for voters to vote for an individual legislative candidate is different from
that for voters to vote for a party. Citing the current electoral law, Huang
said only voters who took residence in a specific constituency four months
before the election are qualified to cast vote for a candidate in that
constituency, but any citizen are eligible to cast votes for a party in
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Given the difference in the qualification, Huang argued the ballots for
individual candidates and ballots for political parties in the legislative
election should be given to voters separately to avoid confusion.</P>
      <P>His calls complicated the simmering dispute between the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) government and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) over the voting
format to be used on Jan. 12 when the legislative elections will be held
together with two referendums--- one over the alleged ill-gotten assets of the
KMT and anther over an appeal to clear the government of corruption.</P>
      <P>In hopes of boosting the turnout for the referendums, the</P>
      <P>DPP administration decided to distribute the two legislative ballots-- one for
individual candidates, one for political parties--- and the two referendum
ballots at the same time when voters report to the vote stations. The decision
is opposed by the 18 local governments headed with a KMT chief which prefer to
distribute the referendum ballots to voters only after they had cast legislative
ballots in an apparent attempt to curb the turnout of the referendums.</P>
      <P>Both sides in the dispute have dug their feet in and there is no indication that
the impasse could be broken as the elections is drawing near.</P>

      <P>National  Police  Administration Director-General Hou Yu-ih traveled to Kinmen
Island Monday to gain a better understanding of the preparations being made in
the outlying county for the upcoming legislative elections and to urge police
there to clamp down on any irregularities in connection with the polls.</P>
      <P>Flanked by Criminal Investigation Bureau Commissioner Huang Mao-sui, Hou met
with Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng at Lee's office, where he exchanged views
with Lee on the preparations that the Kinmen County government has made for the
Jan. 12, 2008 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that competition is expected to be far more intense than in previous
legislatives  elections  as a new  "single-member constituency, two ballots"
electoral system will be implemented for the upcoming elections, Hou said six
candidates from across the political spectrum are competing for the single
legislative seat up for grabs in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Hou said he wants Kinmen law enforcement authorities to spare no efforts in
maintaining social order in the island county in the period leading up to the
Jan. 12 polls and to crack down on any irregularities in the voting process.</P>
      <P>According to the Kinmen police, the number of registered voters in Kinmen stands
at around 80,000, but there are some 2,600 residents who have never actually
lived on the island. The police said they will closely monitor the situation to
make sure that there are no irregularities in the elections, such as ballots
being cast by "fictitious voters" or "non-existent residents."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier  Chang Chun-hsiung  denied categorically Monday a newspaper report that
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has pushed publicly-run banking
institutions to foot the bills for DPP campaigning for the upcoming legislative
and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>"It's not the DPP's style to do something like that," Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to the report carried in the Monday edition of the United Daily News,
at least six banks have been instructed to chip in millions of New Taiwan
dollars to run propaganda for the DPP on TV talk shows and to host
"thanksgiving" dinners and workshops featuring officials from the DPP
administration drumming up support for the party's candidates in the Jan. 12,
2008 legislative polls and March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Discounting the daily's allegations, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said
that it is perfectly legitimate for DPP officials to speak at public functions
to clarify and defend the DPP administration's policies.</P>
      <P>"These  public  activities  should  never be distorted  as campaigning," Shieh
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin  said at the Legislative Yuan that
banks have the right to operate autonomously and that the Ministry of Finance
respects the decisions made by banks on their own.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks in response to questions raised by main opposition
Kuomintang Legislators Lo Ming-tsai, Lee Chi-chu, Pan Wei-kang and Fai Hung-tai
concerning the allegations involving banks supporting the DPP campaign.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen -- who was included on
the list of names of ranking officials alleged to have attended business
workshops or "thanksgiving" dinners aimed at soliciting support for the DPP's
candidates -- said that it is true that he delivered speeches at events
sponsored by banks and attended industrial workshops in recent days but that all
these functions were related to the development of small- and medium-size
enterprises and had nothing to do with the upcoming elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Department of Health approves balloon treatment to fight obesity</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
12/03/07  16:58:09
(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) recently approved the use of intragastric balloon
treatment in Taiwan, giving new hope to local citizens battling obesity.</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-chou, director of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs, said that
use of the non-surgical treatment will be restricted to patients suffering from
severe clinical or morbid obesity and patients for whom other treatments for
obesity have proven ineffective.</P>
      <P>The treatment consists of inserting a soft, expandable balloon made of a pliable
silicone material into the stomach through a tube in the mouth. Once inside the
stomach, the balloon is immediately filled with a sterile saline solution
through a small catheter attached to the balloon. The catheter is then removed
by gently pulling on the external end.</P>
      <P>The balloon floats in the stomach and gives the patient a feeling of partial
fullness, thus reducing their appetite. After six months, the patient returns to
have the balloon removed.</P>
      <P>According to Dr. Hsiao Tun-jen, who introduced the intragastric balloon
treatment into Taiwan in cooperation with Min Shen General Hospital in Taoyuan
City, the treatment has been proven effective in helping obese patients lose
weight.</P>
      <P>Between August 2006 and August of this year, Dr. Hsiao and the hospital
conducted clinical trials on 12 patients suffering from morbid obesity or for
whom other treatments for obesity had proven inneffecitve. According to their
test results, the treatment helped the patients lose an average of 12 percent of
their total body weight.</P>
      <P>Dr. Hsiao said the treatment offers an alternative to obese patients who may
feel too afraid to undergo surgery. He further said that the side effects of the
treatment, including, nausea, acid reflux and mild pain in the upper stomach,
can be controlled with medication. Furthermore, he added, the treatment is
reversible, so patients who find the device unbearable can have it removed
without any negative effects.</P>
      <P>Although the DOH has approved the intragastric balloon treatment for certain
categories of obese patients, the treatment is not covered by national health
insurance. So patients opting for the treatment  will have to cover the full
cost to the tune of approximately NT$120,000 (US$3,714).</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is planning to expand the coverage of vending
machines providing clean needles and syringes  around the island  in its bid to
cut HIV/AIDS transmission, a health official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang Shih-yang, a section chief of the DOH Centers for Disease Control (CDC),
made the remarks while reporting at a meeting of the Interior Committee of the
Legislative Yuan on the feasibility of legislation on alternative treatment for
drug abusers. Also in attendance were Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang and
officials from the DOH, the Ministry of Justice and the National Police Agency.</P>
      <P>Yang noted that since the DOH began a program to cut HIV/AIDS transmission by
providing clean needles and syringes as well as alternative treatment -- mainly
methadone therapy -- in July 2006, it has borne fruit.</P>
      <P>Methadone is a drug used to wean addicts off heroin.</P>
      <P>As of October 2008, there were 1,137 outlets providing clean needles  and
syringes,  and 66 medical institutions  providing alternative treatment.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hou Shui-sheng of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
suggested providing clean needles and syringes through additional automatic
vending machines,  instead of the current channels -- mainly drug stores and
convenience stores -- in some cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Yang said the CDC is planning to do just that next year, so that addicts can get
access to clean needles and syringes even after the drug stores are closed.</P>
      <P>On misgivings about giving methadone therapy to drug abusers, a lot of whom are
also HIV carriers, Lee said some addicts might have to spend more than NT$3,000
(US$93) per day for drugs, resulting in many to resort to crime to pay for their
habits, while methadone costs only NT$18 per day.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that robberies were cut by 30 percent last year, he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that in the future, drug prevention will move toward the goal of
stemming the problem at its roots, adding that the crackdown will focus on
illegal drug manufacturing, smuggling and cultivation.</P>
      <P>According to DOH tallies, a total of 2,942 new HIV/AIDS cases were reported in
2006, compared with 3,399 cases in the previous year, marking the first time in
22 years that the number has fallen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ratio of drug-addicted HIV carriers has also decreased from 73
percent in 2005 to 60 percent in 2006.</P>

      <P>Two professors at National Chung Cheng University (NCCU) have developed a new
system chip that can detect and remove computer viruses from mobile
communication devices with lower power consumption and smaller manufacturing
costs, sources at the Chiayi-based university said Monday.</P>
      <P>The new chip is capable of recognizing 30,000 viruses, compared to the limited
capacity of 1,000 to 3,000 of conventional anti-virus chips, according to
Professor Wang Chin- hsien and Chen Tien-fu, who have led the university's
research on system-on-a-chip  (SOC) technology for several years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the chip's power consumption is 48 percent lower than conventional
ones, while the design cost for the chip is also 40 percent lower, representing
a longer stand-by time for the devices and greater price competitiveness for
manufacturers, they said.</P>
      <P>Led by Wang and Chen, the members of NCCU's SOC Center have earned international
recognition for their achievements, including accreditation from the renowned
International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) for four consecutive
years.</P>
      <P>The results of the anti-virus chip have already been accepted by the ISSCC and
will be presented at the meeting next February, according to the university.</P>

      <P>Police in the central city of Taichung are monitoring closely a group of so-
called "baseball hooligans" from Japan and are determined to maintain public
order to allow the Asian Baseball Championship to proceed smoothly, Taichung
Mayor Jason Hu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu confirmed to the media that the Japanese police authorities have informed the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National Police Agency that some Japanese
baseball hooligans, who have been denied entry to baseball stadiums in Japan,
have made their way to Taiwan to watch the finals of the 24th Asian Baseball
Championship, in which teams from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are competing
for a place in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>The mayor said the Taichung police have prepared for the arrival of the thugs
and have increased personnel, including plain clothes inspectors, at Taichung's
Intercontinental Stadium.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, a leader of the hooligans has already been intercepted at the
Wuji High-Speed Railway station and was made to return to Taipei City in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some 20 other people who have been identified and targeted by the Taichung
police could mingle with other spectators for the crucial game to be held
Monday,  when  Japan  meets  Taiwan  for an Olympic-qualifying battle, Hu added.</P>
      <P>Japan now has a 2-0 record, and a victory against the hosts Monday would see
them qualify for next year's Olympics.</P>
      <P>With Japan beating South Korea in the previous night's thriller 4-3, Taiwan

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health authorities advised Monday that citizens who wish to get vaccinated
against flu should telephone the clinic before they visit because local clinics
have only limited vaccine stocks.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health
issued the advice after seeing more people visiting local clinics rather than
big hospitals for the shots over past two days since the government-funded free
flu inoculation program began Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>The CDC officials noted that National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) in
Taipei City had received only two people seeking the free shots since Saturday.</P>
      <P>They said the low vaccination rate at NTUH could result from the hospital's
higher registration fee compared to other hospitals and clinics. The
registration fee at NTUH is NT$300 while Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH)
charges just NT$200 and most local clinics charge just NT$150.</P>
      <P>On Monday morning, TVGH gave flu shots to around 50 people, they added, while
people were seen lining up for the shots at smaller clinics, the CDC officials
said.</P>
      <P>In light of the limited supply of the vaccines, the CDC advised citizens
intending to get the shots to first visit the CDC's Web site at www.cdc.gov.tw
or call the CDC's toll-free hotline 1922 to check which medical institutions are
still providing the free immunization.</P>
      <P>The CDC has procured 2.37 million doses of flu vaccine for adults and 320,000
doses for children aged under 3 for this year's free inoculation program.</P>
      <P>Priority inoculation has since Oct. 1 been provided to groups at high risk of
infection -- defined as those aged 65 and over, children aged between six months
and 2 years, children enrolled in the first or second year of elementary school,
health care and quarantine workers, and workers in the poultry and livestock
industry.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan expected to enter its annual flu season in December, CDC officials
urged the public to get immunized as soon as possible as it takes two weeks for
the injected form of the vaccine to impart full immunity.</P>

      <P>National Immigration Agency officials said Monday that the agency will set up a
task force to handle the repatriation of a Nigerian man who has overstayed his
visa in Taiwan for more than 11 years.</P>
      <P>Agency officials said Nwosu Qgonna Franklin, 43, came to Taiwan on a 30-day
entry visa for a business trip with a subsidiary of a Swiss company in 1986, but
because he did not pay arrears resulting from the business deal, the contract
was terminated and he remained in Taiwan illegally.</P>
      <P>He was sent to a detention center of the National Police Agency after a
crackdown, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that during his stay in Taiwan, Taipei police have attempted
unsuccessfully to repatriate him five times. The National Police Agency set up a
task force in 2001 to coordinate with the Nigeria Trade Office in Taiwan on the
issue. Nigeria sent two agents and the NPA and Taipei city police department
each sent one police officer to accompany Franklin from Taiwan June 4, 2002. But
the repatriation operation failed when the British government refused to issue
transit visas in London for the Nigerian.</P>
      <P>The officials said Taipei Detention Center officials visited the Nigeria Trade
Office in Taiwan Nov. 5 to ask for assistance in repatriating  Franklin again,
or to help coordinate  Nigerian expatriates in Taiwan to shelter him, but no
positive response was received.</P>

      <P>Several Taipei City councilors pleaded Monday on behalf of stray cats and dogs
for the establishment of a no-kill policy, replacing euthanasia with
sterilization and setting up a regulatory authority to deal with matters, such
as registration, medical care and adoption of stray animals.</P>
      <P>The short-term goal of such a policy is aimed at cutting down the number of
stray animals, providing rescue and medical care, and managing animal adoption
and registration, while the long-term goal is to establish a "no-kill homeland,
" according to the Taipei Municipal Institute for Animal Health.</P>
      <P>Councilors Jian Yu-yan, Li Geng Guo-fang and Yan Sheng-guan, along with
representatives of the Animal Protection Association of the Republic of China
(APA) , the Garden Homeless Animal Association and the Shibao Animal Protection
Association made the plea at a press conference at the Taipei City Council in
which they urged the government not to view stray animals as "trash."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan does not treat stray animals humanely enough, " said Garden Homeless
Animal Association Director-General  Rose,  who advocated that the government
should increase its budget for animal contraception and trap, neuter, release
(TNR) , while cutting the amount of money spent on slaughtering unwanted
animals.</P>
      <P>Councilor Yan Sheng-guan pointed out that contraception and sterilization is
regarded among the vast majority of experts as abetter option than euthanasia as
it costs less, is far more effective and is far more humane.</P>
      <P>Only 36 percent of the stray animals in Taipei City are neutered, which is far
less than the 70 percent in the United States, according to Taipei Municipal
Institute for Animal Health Director Yen I-feng. Due to the limited number of
shelters and insufficient foster families, there is no choice but keep using
euthanasia in the short term, Yen said.</P>
      <P>The city government has been trying to speed up the adoption process and has
made great efforts in animal rescue as well as registration, Yen went on, adding
that it is also taking steps to adopt autonomous regulations to unify policy on
solving the problem of animal abandonment and the release of strays after
neutering.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many incumbent lawmakers and legislative candidates suggested Sunday that the
government increase the number of legislative seats allocated for lawmakers-at-
large to "help improve legislators' performance."</P>
      <P>The lawmakers and candidates made the appeal at a forum organized by the Taiwan
Vision Forum and Association to generate thoughts on legislative reform and
improvement of the quality of lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The participants  reached consensus that the "single-member constituency, two
votes" electoral system to be applied to the legislative elections scheduled for
January next year will not necessarily improve legislators' performance.</P>
      <P>In the new electoral system, voters will cast one vote to elect a legislator for
a local constituency and one vote for a party to elect legislators for the
national constituency and for citizens residing abroad. A total of 34 seats for
lawmakers-at-large will result from the latter vote.</P>
      <P>Legislator Justin C. Chou of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said that
electing  all legislators  through  the proportional representation system is
the most effective means of preventing legislators from providing personal
services to their voters.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chung, a former ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator,
agreed with Chou's suggestion, saying that the current political environment,
which is unfavorable to legislators who concentrate on law enactment at the
legislature, will deteriorate as a result of the new system.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Chang Hsien-yao claimed that the public
tends to evaluate lawmakers' achievements according to the frequency of their
appearances on TV and how enthusiastic they are in attending weddings and
funerals, rather than on their professional performance.</P>
      <P>"More seats for lawmakers-at-large will give more opportunities to small
political parties, " said Jou Yi-cheng, founder of the newly established Third
Society Party.</P>
      <P>Tang Fei,  the association's president and former premier, expressed hope that
the nation's 11 small parties will gain enough votes to let the DPP and the KMT
know the public's need for a different voice in politics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai Hsing-yuan, an opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union lawmaker,
called for the abolishment of the election deposit money required for candidates
and prohibit public campaign rallies or campaign advertisements in the media to
give small parties an equal footing in the election.</P>

      <P>Social activists on the outlying island of Kinmen are to form an association
dedicated to emergency disaster relief and first aid services across the Taiwan
Strait, an organizer said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen Ta-jen, a former Kinmen deputy magistrate, said he came up with the idea of
forming the association in view of the increasing travel via direct shipping
services between Kinmen and Xiamen in China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Hoping to have the association established before the end of this year, Yen said
it is expected to provide assistance for people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait and has gained support from Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.</P>
      <P>The first preparatory meeting of the Kinmen County Emergency Relief and Medical
Service Association was held a day earlier at the Hongbo Ceramics Factory, Yen
said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, Lee said that human life is priceless and should be

      <P>"As the direct shipping services between Kinmen and Fujian have become more and
more popular, establishing an emergency disaster relief and medical service
system by civic organizations is needed, " Lee said, adding that the proposed
association is a good example of cross-strait cooperation.</P>
      <P>Noting that the direct shipping services will have been operating for seven
years in less than a month, Lee claimed that the government will ease its policy

      <P>The deputy head of the Special Service Center under the National Security Bureau

      <P>The news release came after media reports claimed that Hsu Li-meng was forced to
resign as a result of a recent spate of security incidents.</P>
      <P>The reports were incorrect, the NSB news release said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Legislative Judiciary Committee meeting to screen a bill aimed at bringing to
justice those responsible for the 228 Incident and government crimes during the
martial law period was aborted Friday after the number of lawmakers attending
the meeting failed to meet the quorum.</P>
      <P>Although the meeting was dismissed, Wang Hsing-nan, a legislative caucus whip of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and one of the 34 DPP lawmakers
who endorsed the bill, explained that his party seeks to uncover the facts
behind the 1947 tragedy by introducing the legislation.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the historic tragedy must be investigated by the judicial
authorities to help ease the ethnic confrontation in present-day Taiwan because
the incident should not be simplified into a matter about "Chinese mainlanders
oppressing Taiwanese natives."</P>
      <P>"Such rhetoric will fuel ethnic confrontation and is unfair to Chinese
mainlanders, " Wang said, arguing that the 228 Incident bill will not involve
innocent family members or relatives as it only seeks to penalize the criminals
and return justice to the innocent through legal means.</P>
      <P>To serve that end, he said, the Supreme Prosecutors Office should form a task
force to probe the 228 Incident and government crimes committed under the
martial law rule from 1949 to 1987 imposed by the then-ruling Kuomintang (KMT) .
The Supreme Court should also set up a special court to handle relevant cases,
he added.</P>
      <P>The DPP-drafted law sparked strong criticism from the KMT, which has accused the
DPP of "attempting to implicate innocent persons in crimes they did not commit,
" as it stipulates that even if the original defendants have died, their
spouses, children and third cousins must be held accountable.</P>
      <P>DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh said later the same day during a tour of
Taoyuan County that the 228 Incident draft law "aims to allow their offspring to
defend the criminal acts committed by their fathers, grandfathers or relatives
or to seek justice from the court."</P>
      <P>"It is by no means intended to put their younger generations on trial," Hsieh
claimed.</P>
      <P>Speaking that same day in a campaign rally for a KMT legislative candidate in
Hsinchu City, KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou questioned whether
enacting such a law is consistent with the so-called "peaceful co-existence"
stance broached by Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Ma said he suspects that the DPP is trying merely to create hatred and rifts for
political gain ahead of the legislative and presidential polls early next year.</P>
      <P>Although it is impossible for the KMT to entirely mend the hurt of the families
of the 228 Incident victims, Ma claimed that the previous KMT government has
"done its utmost" to compensate them by offering an apology and erecting a
plaque in commemoration of the victims.</P>
      <P>In response to the KMT's attacks, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey blasted
the KMT for trying to twist historic facts and shun its responsibility for the
228 Incident of 1947, in which thousands of Taiwanese people were massacred by
KMT troops.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the DPP-backed draft law is to unearth the truth behind the
incident and the white terror conducted by the KMT during the martial law
period, according to Shieh. But he added that no persons other than the
criminals will be involved.</P>
      <P>"There will be no reconciliation or peaceful co-existence if truth is not
uncovered and criminals not held accountable, " he argued.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang, a grandson of the late President Chiang Kai-shek,
warned the DPP not to "maliciously rehash" the 228 Incident because it would
stir up a "backlash."</P>
      <P>The DPP's scheme to bring the 228 Incident draft law to the Legislative Yuan
fully reflects its anti-democratic mindset, he claimed, insisting that "this is
not just a personal matter, rather it is a case critically linked to Taiwan's
democracy and judiciary."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, KMT legislative caucus
whip Kuo Su-chun urged the DPP to stop using the 228 Incident  to "deceive"
voters,  on the grounds that the DPP-proposed bill does not take into account
the desires of the victims' families.</P>

      <P>A project to dredge Lotus Pond in Zuoying, a district of Kaohsiung, began
Monday, with the aim of making the 42-hectare lake fit for water sports during
the 2009 World Games, to be held in Kaohsiung in July 2009.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu presided over a ground-breaking ceremony for the
project and entrusted officials of the city government's Public Works Bureau
with the work of turning the scenic pond into a world-class arena for water
skiing, wakeboarding, canoe polo, and an invitational dragon boat race.</P>
      <P>According to bureau officials, the project,  scheduled for completion in
September 2008 at a cost of NT$155 million, will mean emptying the lake before
the dredging process begins. The fish, turtles, shellfish and other water
creatures in the lake will be quartered temporarily in other facilities.</P>
      <P>The bottom of the lake will be dredged, excavated and leveled to make the water
at least three meters deep for the water sports.</P>
      <P>The officials said the dredging project will increase the water storage capacity
of Lotus Pond by 370,000 cubic meters, and that an added benefit will be greater
flood prevention in the area during typhoon seasons.</P>
      <P>Lotus Pond, called Lianchihtan in Chinese, is a well-known scenic spot in
southern Taiwan. The lake is 1.4-km long and 400-meter wide, drawing its water
from the Gaoping River. It used to cover 75 hectares, but has shrunk in area to
42 hectares. The lake is considered a sacred religious place because it is
surrounded by quite a few temples.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, the second largest city in Taiwan, has been awarded the right to host
the next World Games July 16-26, 2009, which are expected to draw 4,600 athletes

      <P>The government will help private bus companies serving remote regions, the head
of Directorate General of Highways  (DGH)  under  the  Ministry  of
Transportation  and Communications said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-yuan made the remarks after five private bus companies in southern
Taiwan, including the Chiayi bus company, Kaohsiung bus company and Pingtung bus
company, issued a joint statement last week saying that they will be forced to
stop bus service in remote areas later this month if the government does not
make up for losses incurred plying such routes.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the DGH is still communicating with the bus companies, adding
that it will adopt a cost-saving approach as well as subsidies to help bus
operators tide over the difficulties.</P>
      <P>He said that the DGH has appropriated NT$550 million (US$17.02 million) for
subsidies to bus companies serving routes in remote regions next year and that
the proposed appropriation has been sent to the Legislative Yuan for review.
Unless the Legislative Yuan agrees to additional funds, the possibility of
further subsidies next year will be minimal.</P>
      <P>He noted that some of the costly routes overlap, which he said is also a waste
of resources, and the DGH is trying to combine the routes to cut the number of
bus services so as to help cut the need for subsidies.</P>
      <P>The local governments should also share the responsibility, he said, adding that
private bus companies have shouldered the responsibility for serving remote
areas for a long time.</P>
      <P>"If the local governments can provide subsidies, then it will help solve some of
these problems," he added.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan provincial bus company association will convene a meeting Dec. 10 to
discuss the heavy losses facing private bus companies serving remote routes, an
official of the association said Monday.</P>
      <P>Association Secretary-General  Fang Sheng-teh said that bus companies in central
and northern Taiwan could follow the lead of their counterparts in southern
Taiwan by cutting unprofitable rural routes.</P>
      <P>Fang said that due to soaring gasoline price this year, as well as the rising
cost of tires, glasses and batteries, the bus companies have continued to lose
money.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the government began a mass transportation development
project in 1997, it had appropriated NT$800 million a year to subsidize bus
companies plying routes in remote region and that bus companies have reluctantly
accepted this arrangement.</P>
      <P>But he said the DGH cut the subsidies to NT$300 million a few years ago, and
after the protests only NT$550 million was granted this year, far less than the
actual needs of NT$850 million.</P>
      <P>He criticized the government for knowing of the huge losses facing private bus
companies but nonetheless being unwilling to make up for their losses, and said
the companies think that they have no "obligation to continue to shoulder this
responsibility."</P>

      <P>The population of Taipei City, Taiwan's largest city, is aging rapidly as its
annual birth rate is in steady decline, the municipal Department of Health
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the department's statistics, the city's average annual birth rate
of newborns dropped from 13.5 percent in 1997 to 8.1 percent in 2006, while the
number of elderly residents increased from some 230,000 to 310,000 during the
same period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of Taiwan's population aged under 14 years dipped from
540,000 in 1997 to 430,000 in 2006 -- marking a 19.7 percent decline, the
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten years,  Taipei City's 12 districts all registered decreases in
terms of annual birth rate, with Neihu district posting the largest fall from
15.6 percent to 8.4 percent, the tallies showed.</P>
      <P>Taipei City's 8.1 percent newborns birth rate is lower than Taipei County's 8.7
percent but higher than Kaohsiung City's 7.8 percent. Kaohsiung is Taiwan's
second-largest city, while Taipei County, which neighbors Taipei City, is
Taiwan's most populous administrative district.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's population continues aging steadily, it is set to have a major

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Monday recognized a local cancer-fighting charity for
its years of effort in helping the government raise public awareness of cancer
prevention.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing a ceremony held to celebrate the Formosa
Cancer Foundation's 10th anniversary and to honor 10 cancer fighters selected
from a campaign organized by the foundation for the first time.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the foundation is one of only a few dedicated to the prevention
of cancer and promotion of cancer-related medical treatments.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the foundation first started encouraging the public to consume five
kinds of fruit and vegetables every day to maintain good health, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the foundation collaborated with local supermarkets to further urge
locals to follow a healthy diet, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, the foundation established a care and education center for cancer
patients, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The foundation has also helped the government achieve many private diplomatic
missions, Chen said, citing the foundation's membership in the International
Union Against Cancer (UICC) as an example.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes that the foundation will be able to host the World Cancer
Congress in the future to share Taiwan's achievements in the field  with the
world  community  and to raise  Taiwan's international profile.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen also expressed his appreciation to the 10 individual cancer
fighters, noting that their passion for life has set a good example for the
public.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who also serves as the chairman of the
foundation, for his part, thanked Chen, Vice President Annette Lu, and American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director Stephen Young for attending the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Noting that serving as the foundation's chairman is demanding but worthwhile and
meaningful, Wang stressed that the foundation will continue to act as a "beacon"

      <P>Japan beat Taiwan 10-2 Monday in the final game of the 24th Asian  Baseball
Championship  at Taichung's Intercontinental  Stadium to win the tournament and
clinch an automatic seed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Undefeated Japan proved itself Asia's dominant baseball power once again by
beating Taiwan, South Korea and the Philippines in the round robin tournament,
which crowned the Asian champion and determined Asia's lone automatic seed in
the eight-team baseball category in Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to the tournament's tiebreaking rule, Taiwan not only had to beat
Japan but also needed to give up no more than one run to emerge as the
tournament winner in a three-way tie. Japan edged South Korea 4-3 and South
Korea beat Taiwan 5-2 previously. The tiebreaking rule would kick in if three
teams tied at 1-1 in head-to-head match ups.</P>
      <P>However, the home team's hope of clinching an Olympic seed was put on hold in
the top of the seventh inning, when Japan exploded for six runs to break the
game open, 7-2. Arai Takahiro had a two-run homer off Taiwanese closer Tsao
Chin-hui as Japan added three more runs in the ninth inning.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can still win a berth in Beijing as it and South Korea, Asia's runner-up
and the third-place team, will participate in the eight-team Olympic Qualifying
tournament next March in Taichung, Taiwan to fight for the last three spots in
the 2008 Olympics.</P>
      <P>Japanese starter Darvish Yu, a 21-year-old Iranian-Japanese who was named
Pacific League MVP in Nippon Professional Baseball last season, dominated
Taiwanese hitters in seven strong innings, giving up only three hits and two
runs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's starting pitcher Yang Chien-fu gave up seven hits, half of Japan's 14
in the game, in six innings.</P>
      <P>Japan quickly jumped on Taiwan with three hits in the first inning as Takahiro's
base hit sent third base runner Nishiota Tsuyoshi home for an 1-0 lead. Chen
Chin-feng's two-run home run helped Taiwan briefly take the lead 2-1 in the
sixth inning.</P>
      <P>South Korea defeated the Philippines 13-1 in seven innings earlier in the day.
South Korea blasted 16 hits in the game in which the Philippines scored its
first and only run in the three-day tournament.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will abide by the law in its move to change a
plaque on the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Park, previously known as the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Park, Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tu also urged all sectors to adopt a positive attitude towards Taiwan's freedom
and democracy in the plaque dispute with the Taipei city government.</P>
      <P>The MOE has been at odds with the city government since the park was renamed May
19 this year. The city government has vowed to arrest and prosecute those who
makes any modification to the park as the city government has designated the
park as a historic site.</P>
      <P>According to an MOE preliminary plan, the hall's current plaque bearing the
Chinese characters "Ta Chung Chih Cheng" and alluding to the late President
Chiang Kai-shek is set to be replaced by Dec. 8 with a new one carrying the
Chinese characters "Tzu You Kwang Chang," which translates as "Liberty Square."</P>
      <P>The park was inaugurated in 1980 to commemorate Chiang, who has been branded by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a dictator and the main culprit
behind a massacre that occurred Feb. 28, 1947 and the ensuing "White Terror"
period of the then-ruling Kuomintang's martial law.</P>
      <P>The installment of the plaque will come after the Cabinet-level Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) publicly announces the amended laws for the designation
and abolition of a historic site Dec. 5-7 at the earliest, MOE Secretary-General
Chuang Kuo-jung said a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Chuang noted that the MOE filed an application with the CCA Nov. 26 in an effort
to confirm the national status of the historic site.</P>
      <P>The confirmation will invalidate the Taipei city government's designation of the
hall as a historic relic, he went on.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry is also slated to remove a plaque inscribed "Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall" and install the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" by Dec. 8,
according to the MOE's plan.</P>

      <P>Mayor Jason Hu of Taichung City in central Taiwan will set off for London
Tuesday to attend the 2007 World Leadership Forum slated for Dec. 5-6 for the
forum-organized city leadership awards competitions, city officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu will present a briefing on his city and the efforts made to establish and
develop Taichung as a cultural and artistic center in hopes of influencing the
judges who will decide the winners of the 2007 World Leadership Awards at a
screening committee meeting to be held Dec. 6.</P>
      <P>Hu said he attaches great importance to the awards, noting that if Taichung
wins, it will help the city's international image.</P>
      <P>The World Leadership Awards were first organized in 2005 at the World Leadership
Forum in London. According to the organizer, the awards are a means of
identifying exceptional leadership in cities around the world and to use that
leadership to inspire other cities facing similar challenges.</P>
      <P>Each year, over 400 cities around the world are invited to join the competition
for awards in 15 different categories through the submission of projects
addressing a wide range of activities covering architecture and civil
engineering, communication, culture and the arts, economy and employment,
education and development of the young, health, housing, environment, law and
order, science and technology, sport, town planning, transport, urban renewal
and utilities.</P>
      <P>The best of those projects will be presented to the judges for screening at a
series of symposia in London slated for Dec. 5-6, with the winners to be
announced at the Dec. 6 presentation ceremony, according to a message on the
forum's Web site.</P>
      <P>Taichung is the first Taiwanese city named as a nominee since the awards were
inaugurated in 2005.</P>
      <P>According to the Taichung city government, Taichung signed up for the award in
the category of arts and culture in June. Also nominated in that category are
Lima, the capital city of Peru, and Albuquerque in the eastern United States.</P>
      <P>The central Taiwan city will also join the "Asia-Pacific City of the Year"
competition, city officials said.</P>
      <P>Expressing his pride in seeing his city recognized as a nominee for these
international awards, Hu said he wants to brief those judging his city in person
in order to ensure that Taichung receives the best possible score.</P>
      <P>The World Leadership Awards are given to cities whose leaders have shown
exceptional imagination, foresight or resilience in a number of key fields --
especially cities that have reversed negative trends, shaken off traditional
images, and provided positive examples and inspiration to others, according to
the London-based forum.</P>

Australia -- to serve the people to make the world a better place in addition to

Taiwan Normal University.</P>
      <P>Also present at the ceremony  were Education  Minister Tu Cheng-sheng and former
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwanese contestants win five gold medals and one silver every
year since Taiwan sent students to take part in the event from 2004.</P>
      <P>She said she hopes that Taiwanese students can stage a better performance this
year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lu said that nowadays, scientists no longer work individually in
laboratories. Rather, she went on, they have begun working together to improve
the lives of human beings.</P>
      <P>Scientific researches often play a key role in resolving many pressing
challenges, such as global warming and renewable energies, Lu said.</P>
      <P>If used correctly, scientific knowledge can also bring a ray of hope to those
who are living in poverty and suffering from diseases, rather than wars that
will cause destruction, Lu said.</P>
      <P>According to the event's rules, each team from each country is composed of six
students, with each's age being capped at 16. In addition, each team is allowed
to have three coaches.</P>
      <P>The participants will compete in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry,
biology, and earth science.</P>
      <P>The results of the contest will be announced Dec. 10 at an awarding ceremony

      <P>The housing market of the greater Taipei area saw a decrease in both the number
of transactions and prices in November, an executive with a major real estate
company in Taiwan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ling-chi, president of Evertrust Rehouse Co., said that compared with
October, the number of closed deals in greater Taipei last month dropped 10
percent, while the average price of NT$275,000 per ping -- an equivalent of 36
square feet -- also fell by 6 percent.</P>
      <P>Yeh attributed the market fall mainly to the uncertainties over the forthcoming
legislative and presidential elections in January and March, and the downward
trend on Taiwan's stock market that has sapped many people's purchasing power.
The stock market's weighted index shed more than 1,600 points, or 15 percent, in
November.</P>
      <P>He said the number of housing sales in Taichung, central Taiwan, in November
also recorded a decrease of 20 percent, although the average price remained at
the same level as October at NT$95,000 per ping.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the housing market has
maintained a moderate growth in the past two months. The number of finalized
sales increased 10 percent in October, and the average price remained stable at
NT$91,000 per ping.</P>

      <P>Chen Shui-hui said in a press release that the number of the aborigines serving
in the military has reached nearly 10,000, but there are currently no active
aboriginal generals in the military.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Chen said that she has suggested to the president several times

promoted to the rank of major general at the end of the year, according to
Legislator Chen.</P>
      <P>The legislator said that Chang, 44, was born of an Ami mother, and that his
father is a retired sergeant.</P>
      <P>The legislator noted that since the government relocated to Taiwan in 1948 after

      <P>Taitung county has accepted the "one-step" voting format for the Jan.  12
legislative elections and two referendums, an official of the Central Election
Commission (CEC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The Taitung Election Commission has agreed to accept the 'one-step' voting
format, " CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-you said after the dinner meeting
hosted by the CEC in its bid to solve the stalemate over the voting format.</P>
      <P>Teng said that agreements were reached on several points during the meeting,
including that a poster be placed outside of polls that states that voters can
claim one or two ballots for the referendums, and that the ballots cast in the
wrong boxes will be counted as "valid."</P>
      <P>Taitung was also the only local government of the "pan-blue alliance" led by the
Kuomintang (KMT) to send an election official to the dinner, Teng said. The
other five cities and counties attending the dinner were controlled by the "pan-
green camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>In response, a KMT official Monday quoted Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-
cheng as saying that no officials from the county government were authorized to
attend the dinner and the Taitung Election Commission is standing by its
decision to adopt a "two-step" voting format.</P>
      <P>Eighteen cities and counties from the "pan-blue alliance" earlier vowed to
follow the "two-step" voting format used in the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The dinner meeting  came after the Executive  Yuan warned repeatedly that a
"two-step" voting format is unlawful, and that the "pan-blue" local governments
lack legal basis to defy the CEC's decision.</P>
      <P>The cabinet is confident that the 18 'pan-blue"-controlled counties and cities
will eventually comply with the "one-step" voting format, a cabinet spokesman
said last week.</P>
      <P>On Jan.  12,  two referendums will be held alongside the legislative elections:
one initiated by the DPP on the reclamation of the KMT's ill-gotten assets and
the other initiated by the KMT on wiping out government corruption.</P>
      <P>The CEC decided earlier this month to adopt the "one-step" voting format,  under
which voters will receive two ballots for the legislative elections and two
referendum ballots at different desks and then cast them into four separate
boxes.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue"-controlled localities have insisted that they will use the "two-
step" format under which voters will receive and cast referendum ballots only
after they have cast their ballots for the legislative elections, claiming that
the "one-step" format could cause confusion and chaos during the voting process.</P>

      <P>A national chemical hazard response drill will take place at the Kaohsiung
Harbor in southern Taiwan Tuesday, featuring a scenario involving air, land and

      <P>Hsiao  Yu-cheng,  director-general  of the  Kaohsiung  city government's

      <P>An emergency response to a simulated terrorist attack on the World Games, to be
held in Kaohsiung City in 2009, will also be included in the drill procedures,
Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>During the drill, dock workers at the port handling chemical substances are
affected by toxic gases released by an unidentified terrorist and a serious fire
onboard ship is results in a chemical leak, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>The port's administration center will immediately report the situation to both
local and central government emergency response centers for aid and relief.
Coast guard patrol corps, army chemical corps and airborne relief personnel will
all rush to the port to conduct search and rescue operations, while the police
will arrest the unidentified terrorist, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao pointed out that the chemical hazard response drill is necessary for the
port, for it handles about 70 percent of the nation's shipping of toxic and
chemical substances.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will review the country's exit and entry
inspection system and make necessary improvements to prevent irregularities,
Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after a man disguised himself as a legislative aide to
secure an "airport protocol pass", which was then used to evade immigration
inspection and board a plane bound for Hong Kong Sept. 13.</P>
      <P>The man, identified as Yen Jui-yang who had been barred from leaving the country
for failing to pay a huge sum of income tax, returned to Taiwan Sept. 19 after
reportedly picking up a fake passport abroad. He left the country again Nov. 9
and was caught using a bogus Malaysian passport Nov. 29 when he returned from
Macau.</P>
      <P>Lee said both the MOI's Aviation Police Office (APO) and the National
Immigration Agency (NIA) are at fault in the incident. The APO should had
checked and verified the identity of any holder of airport protocol pass in the
first place.</P>
      <P>"We should take immediate steps to prevent a repetition of this incident in
which a man barred from leaving the country used a dubious Legislative Yuan
letter to apply for an airport protocol pass and then boarded an outbound
plane," Lee said.</P>
      <P>As to the NIA's role,  Lee said,  the incident manifests deficiencies in the
existing mechanisms involving commercial airline companies and the NIA's
immigration system. For one thing, he said, there should have been a final check
to determine whether passengers have undergone immigration inspections before
allowing them to board outbound planes.</P>
      <P>Noting that the deficiencies have existed for a long time, Lee said immediate
steps should be taken to plug the holes. The ministry will discipline relevant
personnel after a thorough investigation, he added.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu encouraged Taiwanese  students  Monday to set new
records at the fourth International Junior Science Olympiad that kicked off in
Taipei earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Lu further urged 204 student participants from 39 countries -- including the
United Kingdom,  Germany,  Russia,  South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands,
Australia -- to serve the people to make the world a better place in addition to
pursuing  scientific knowledge.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while addressing the opening ceremony of the three-day
event, which is taking place at the Affiliated Senior High School of National
Taiwan Normal University.</P>
      <P>Also present at the ceremony  were Education  Minister Tu Cheng-sheng and former
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwanese contestants win five gold medals and one silver every
year since Taiwan sent students to take part in the event from 2004.</P>
      <P>She said she hopes that Taiwanese students can stage a better performance this
year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lu said that nowadays, scientists no longer work individually in
laboratories. Rather, she went on, they have begun working together to improve
the lives of human beings.</P>
      <P>Scientific researches often play a key role in resolving many pressing
challenges, such as global warming and renewable energies, Lu said.</P>
      <P>If used correctly, scientific knowledge can also bring a ray of hope to those
who are living in poverty and suffering from diseases, rather than wars that
will cause destruction, Lu said.</P>
      <P>According to the event's rules, each team from each country is composed of six
students, with each's age being capped at 16. In addition, each team is allowed
to have three coaches.</P>
      <P>The participants will compete in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry,
biology, and earth science.</P>
      <P>The results of the contest will be announced Dec. 10 at an awarding ceremony

    <HEADLINE>Housing market of greater Taipei down in November</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The housing market of the greater Taipei area saw a decrease in both the number
of transactions and prices in November, an executive with a major real estate
company in Taiwan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ling-chi, president of Evertrust Rehouse Co., said that compared with
October, the number of closed deals in greater Taipei last month dropped 10
percent, while the average price of NT$275,000 per ping -- an equivalent of 36
square feet -- also fell by 6 percent.</P>
      <P>Yeh attributed the market fall mainly to the uncertainties over the forthcoming
legislative and presidential elections in January and March, and the downward
trend on Taiwan's stock market that has sapped many people's purchasing power.
The stock market's weighted index shed more than 1,600 points, or 15 percent, in
November.</P>
      <P>He said the number of housing sales in Taichung, central Taiwan, in November
also recorded a decrease of 20 percent, although the average price remained at
the same level as October at NT$95,000 per ping.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, the housing market has
maintained a moderate growth in the past two months. The number of finalized
sales increased 10 percent in October, and the average price remained stable at
NT$91,000 per ping.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taitung county accepts 'one-step' voting format: CEC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taitung county has accepted the "one-step" voting format for the Jan.  12
legislative elections and two referendums, an official of the Central Election
Commission (CEC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The Taitung Election Commission has agreed to accept the 'one-step' voting
format, " CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-you said after the dinner meeting
hosted by the CEC in its bid to solve the stalemate over the voting format.</P>
      <P>Teng said that agreements were reached on several points during the meeting,
including that a poster be placed outside of polls that states that voters can
claim one or two ballots for the referendums, and that the ballots cast in the
wrong boxes will be counted as "valid."</P>
      <P>Taitung was also the only local government of the "pan-blue alliance" led by the
Kuomintang (KMT) to send an election official to the dinner, Teng said. The
other five cities and counties attending the dinner were controlled by the "pan-
green camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>In response, a KMT official Monday quoted Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-
cheng as saying that no officials from the county government were authorized to
attend the dinner and the Taitung Election Commission is standing by its
decision to adopt a "two-step" voting format.</P>
      <P>Eighteen cities and counties from the "pan-blue alliance" earlier vowed to
follow the "two-step" voting format used in the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The dinner meeting  came after the Executive  Yuan warned repeatedly that a
"two-step" voting format is unlawful, and that the "pan-blue" local governments
lack legal basis to defy the CEC's decision.</P>
      <P>The cabinet is confident that the 18 'pan-blue"-controlled counties and cities
will eventually comply with the "one-step" voting format, a cabinet spokesman
said last week.</P>
      <P>On Jan.  12,  two referendums will be held alongside the legislative elections:
one initiated by the DPP on the reclamation of the KMT's ill-gotten assets and
the other initiated by the KMT on wiping out government corruption.</P>
      <P>The CEC decided earlier this month to adopt the "one-step" voting format,  under
which voters will receive two ballots for the legislative elections and two
referendum ballots at different desks and then cast them into four separate
boxes.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue"-controlled localities have insisted that they will use the "two-
step" format under which voters will receive and cast referendum ballots only
after they have cast their ballots for the legislative elections, claiming that
the "one-step" format could cause confusion and chaos during the voting process.</P>

      <P>Taiwan aims to achieve economic growth of 4.8 percent for next year and keep the
inflation rate at below 2 percent, according to the economic targets for 2008
unveiled Monday by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>While the government will work to control the unemployment rate at 3.8 percent
or below for next year, per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to
reach US$18,000, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said the government will stick to the objectives of the "mega
investment, mega warmth" policy next year to continue encouraging private
investment, enhancing the competitiveness of the country's exports and expanding
domestic demand.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has set the economic growth target at 4.8 percent after taking into
account the possible impact of soaring oil prices, which are expected to average
US$74 per barrel for next year according to a forecast by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, the officials said.</P>
      <P>For 2008, the CEPD expects Taiwan's trade surplus in goods and services  to
reach 7 percent  of the country's  nominal GDP, contributing 1.6 percentage
points to the GDP growth, they said.</P>
      <P>Exports in goods and services are expected to increase 5 percent next year,
contributing 3.3 percentage points to the GDP growth, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CEPD has set the target of 3.5 percent growth in the country's
private consumption for 2008, which is expected to contribute 1.9 percentage
points to the GDP growth, they said.</P>
      <P>On the industrial policy for 2008, the government will continue working to boost
the development of four emerging industries: the wireless broadband industry,
the digital life industry, the health care industry and the eco-friendly
industry, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>In particular, the government will take advantage of Taiwan's information and
communications technology edge to work to turn the country into a global
research and development hub for household digital products, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The government will also work to accelerate industrial upgrading as well as to
boost the tourism industry by simplifying visa application  procedures and
strengthening  Taiwan's image as a high-quality travel destination, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N.-bid referendum won't alter cross-strait status quo: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 4 (CNA)
12/04/07  17:29:41

    <TEXT>
      <P>A referendum to be held next March as part of the government's efforts to
promote the country's quest for U.N. membership will not change the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait or Taiwan's status, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said in a press statement released Monday.</P>
      <P>The press statement came in the wake of a joint statement issued at a summit
held in Beijing Nov. 28 by the European Union and China opposing Taiwan's
planned U.N.-bid referendum.</P>
      <P>Noting that the EU's comments on the Taiwan issue in the statement did not
reflect the facts, the MOFA said that the EU does not fully realize the Taiwan
government's many years of efforts in helping its people exercise their
democratic rights and that Taiwan understands that the EU may have made the
remarks due to pressure from China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will hold the referendum in a peaceful and democratic manner, and the
referendum will not constitute any change to Taiwan's status, the ministry said
in the press release.</P>
      <P>The ministry further said that holding the referendum will not affect the
security and stability of Taiwan's neighboring countries in the region.</P>
      <P>As an independent, sovereign country, Taiwan is not a part of China, and any
issues related to the status of Taiwan must be decided by the 23 million people
of Taiwan, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the U.N. membership bid is the common wish of political parties
across the spectrum in Taiwan, the ministry said that the bid also reflects the
determination of the Taiwanese people to take part in the international
community.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan hope to use the referendum -- a democratic process -- to
demonstrate their collective will to enter the world body, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the Chinese government enacted an "anti-secession law" in March
2005, which provides a legal basis for Beijing to resort to the use of force
against Taiwan if it declares independence, the ministry noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Beijing has deployed approximately 1,000 missiles targeting Taiwan,
threatening the Taiwanese people's basic rights and security, it said,
describing such moves as "unacceptable to democratic countries."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government understands that the EU made remarks unfavorable to Taiwan
as a concession to China, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the government hopes that the EU can adopt practical, rational,
and cautious attitudes to examine China's untransparent military expansion, poor
human rights record, as well as its counterfeit and substandard products
exported worldwide.</P>
      <P>The EU should also pay heed to imbalances in China's trade with other countries
and its undervalued currency, as well as China's excessive energy use and
ignorance of environmental issues, the ministry said, noting that all of these
will be detrimental to the global economy and regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government's promotion of the U.N. referendum is a demonstration of
democracy, the ministry said, adding that European countries often hold
referendums to allow their citizens exercise their power.</P>
      <P>If it continues to adopt double standards in its treatment of Taiwan, the EU
will hurt the feelings of the Taiwanese people, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, adopting double standards will not be beneficial to cross-strait
negotiations and dialogue or to efforts to establish mutual trust in the future,
the ministry said, adding that on the contrary, it may harm the EU's interests
in Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government will continue to communicate with the EU, the ministry said,
adding that it hopes that while working to develop relations with China, the EU
will not easily make economic and political concessions to Beijing and thus
sacrifice Taiwan's national interests and its relations with Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N.-bid referendum 'neither necessary nor helpful': AIT director</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Director Stephen Young on Monday described a
referendum being promoted by Taiwan's government on the country's bid to join
the United Nations under the name Taiwan as "neither necessary nor helpful."</P>
      <P>The referendum is slated to be held next March alongside Taiwan's presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Young made the remarks while delivering a speech on "Opportunities and
Challenges in U.S.-Taiwan and Cross-Strait Relations" at a conference organized
by the Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies (FICS).</P>
      <P>During his address, Young said the United States views China's sustained
military buildup, including its missile deployments, as a destabilizing factor
in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Taiwan's upcoming legislative and presidential elections, Young
noted that the U.S. government is observing the elections "with great interest
and respect."</P>
      <P>"These elections, regardless of who wins, will inevitably open up new
possibilities for Taiwan and for U.S.-Taiwan and cross-strait relations," Young
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Washington does not and will not take sides in Taiwan's democratic
politics, Young said that the United States "looks forward to working closely
with whomever the people of Taiwan elect as their next president."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Young also noted that the United States "has good communications
with" Frank Hsieh and Ma Ying-jeou -- presidential candidates of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
respectively.</P>
      <P>According to Young, "the solid base of Taiwan's relationship with the United
States and other important countries means that Taiwan enjoys international
access and support, and is not so isolated as some would argue."</P>
      <P>However, Young pointed out that two recent episodes -- namely Taiwan's "ceasing"
of the functioning and application of the National Unification Council and
Guidelines, and its promotion of the U.N.-bid referendum -- could be
"problematic and even risky."</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, these types of episodes tend to have a cumulative effect,
damaging trust in U.S.-Taiwan relations over time," he added.</P>
      <P>He said the United States hopes and expects that strengthening trust between the
two countries will be an important priority for Taiwan's next president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>High Court rejects appeal by president's daughter on slander case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's daughter Chen Hsing-yu lost her appeal Tuesday after
the Taiwan High Court upheld a lower court ruling that a television
commentator's remarks about her engaging in suspected money laundering in New
York in September 2005 did not constitute slander.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu filed the appeal after the Taipei District Court ruled on Aug. 28
that TV commentator Hu Chung-hsin had no intention of defaming her when he
disclosed in a series of programs in October 2005 that the president's daughter
had opened a bank account in New York City to engage in money laundering.</P>
      <P>At the time, the president and his family were dogged by a series of corruption
scandals. In one of the scandals involving the embezzlement of the Presidential
Office's state affairs funds, a public prosecutor listed the president and the
first lady as "joint perpetrators."</P>
      <P>Cheng Hsing-yu, a dentist, stayed in New York City Sept. 12-16, 2005, to attend
a short-term course on dental implant techniques, but Hu quoted unnamed sources
as saying that she was seen in the company of friends opening an account with a
New York bank.</P>
      <P>Hu also alleged that the bank account was opened apparently for the purpose of
money laundering.</P>
      <P>The district court said in its written statement that two witnesses testified
that their Taiwanese friends returning from the United States saw Chen Hsing-yu
opening the account.</P>
      <P>Although the court asked the Ministry of Justice to verify whether she had
opened such an account, the ministry pointed out that it could not request U.S.
help for such investigation because opening a bank account is not a criminal
act, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Another dentist from Taiwan who attended  the same course testified that Chen
Hsing-yu skipped one afternoon class. The court said it could not be ruled out
that she might have used that opportunity to open the account.</P>
      <P>Based on these facts, the lower court decided that Hu could not be found guilty
of slander unless it could be ascertained that no account was opened.</P>
      <P>The high court rejected Chen Hsing-yu's appeal and upheld the lower court's
ruling, saying that Hu's remarks did not constitute slander and that he was
merely exercising his freedom of speech. The case is now closed as the high
court's ruling is final.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's relations with the Marshall Islands will not be affected by the outcome
of that country's parliamentary election, Minister of Foreign Affairs James
Huang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He said that although China has attempted to manipulate the election outcome
through Taiwanese business people,  the solid diplomatic ties between Taiwan and
the central Pacific nation will not be undermined.</P>
      <P>He also said that China will never relax its relentless obstruction and will not
"refrain from taking actions ahead of Taiwan's legislative and presidential
elections or for any other reasons, " reaffirming that Taiwan must not harbor
any false illusions about China.</P>
      <P>His remarks came with the outcome of the Marshall Islands' November national
election due to be published either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning following
the counting of overseas postal ballots. The opposition party Aelon Kein Ad
(AKA) has claimed victory, although the ruling United Democratic Party (UDP)
also said that they could gain a majority in the 33-member legislature.</P>
      <P>Donald Lee, director-general of the MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific
Affairs, noted that information received by the ministry showed that China
pumped a huge amount of money into the election through Taiwanese business
people.</P>
      <P>Lee noted there are around 25 Taiwanese families in the Marshall Islands, and
one or two of them are willing to serve China by helping stump for the
opposition party, or providing funds to candidates.</P>
      <P>Even though the Marshall Islands parliamentary Speaker Litokwa Tomeing visited
China ahead of the national election and said that the AKA will switch
diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, Lee said that Tomeing has since
clarified his stance to Taiwan's ambassador to the country.</P>
      <P>Tomeing has been the Marshall Islands' parliamentary speaker for the eight years
since the UDP of President Kessai Note won the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee also quoted a senior parliamentarian Tony de Brum, one of the four leading
opposition lawmakers who visited China recently, as saying that if the AKA wins
the election it will not switch diplomatic relation to China and the country
will continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Whether it is the UDP or the AKA that wins the election, the ministry will keep
abreast of the situation and bilateral relations will remain unaffected," he
added.</P>
      <P>Lee said that a project to generate solar power on an outlying island of the
Marshall Islands will be completed in March or April next year, and will be
sufficient to provide electricity to 973 households.</P>
      <P>Taiwan established diplomatic relations with the Marshall Islands in 1998, and
the two nations have since maintained a close and cordial relationship.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Securities Association (TSA) has signed a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with its Mongolian counterpart, the Mongolian Securities Dealers and
Brokers Association (MSDBA) , on cooperating to tap emerging markets, a TSA
spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOU was signed by TSA President Huang Min-chu and his MSDBA counterpart in
Taipei Monday, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>It is the second agreement the TSA has signed with a foreign counterpart,
following  an earlier one signed with the Japan Securities Dealers Association
in September 2007.</P>
      <P>"The partnership with the Mongolian securities association is expected to help
Taiwan move into such emerging markets as Russia and China, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, foreign investment has been pouring into Mongolia since its
entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997, bringing enormous economic
growth to the nation.</P>
      <P>Huang further pointed out that the stock market in Mongolia has been developing
steadily since the establishment of the Mongolian Stock Exchange (MSE) in 1991.</P>
      <P>"In Mongolia, the growth of share prices in 2006 doubled that of 2005, and stock
prices have also grown by a wide margin this year, " Huang added.</P>
      <P>The MSDBA, a nationwide organization and the only securities association in
Mongolia, was founded by securities dealers and brokers and is comprised of
members from MSE, 38 securities brokerage firms and three mutual fund companies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's experiences in personnel training, encouraging market prosperity and
risk management provide important references for MSE, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng
encouraged Taiwanese securities firms to be more active in forging bilateral
collaborations with their Mongolian counterparts as Mongolia is not only a
member of the WTO, IMF and World Bank, but also because its geographic location
and rich natural resources make Mongolia an important potential market.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's GreTai Securities Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange have
already signed an MOU with the Mongolian Stock Exchange in August, " Hu said,
adding that the experiences of TSA in personnel management and market planning

33 percent were found because of information provided by informers.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also said that most of the drugs seized in the 11-month period
were shipped via international  express parcel services or carried by passengers
who hid narcotics in their checked-in luggage or in their carry-on luggage.</P>
      <P>In addition to illegal drugs, customs officials also confiscated 185 kg of fresh
deer antler velvet -- a material used in oriental medicine to improve sexual

    <HEADLINE>City government amends regulations to protect historic plague</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
12/04/07  20:28:53
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government passed a proposal Tuesday to amend regulations
governing city-designated historic relics in an effort to protect a landmark
plaque hanging on the gateway of the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall
from being torn down.</P>
      <P>The amendment is an outgrowth of the city government's urgent strategy to
respond to the Ministry of Education (MOE) -initiated plan to replace the plaque
-- bearing Chinese characters reading "Ta Chung Chih Cheng" -- which is said to
allude to the late President Chiang Kai-shek, with another reading "Liberty
Square" by Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>However, since the MOE's plan was put forward last month it has faced strong
resistance from the opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) -administrated Taipei city
government, with the city government criticizing the plan to tear down the
plaque, which is part of an historic site, as an "autocratic" act aimed at
expunging the last vestiges of Chiang's rule.</P>
      <P>The late president was also a chairman of the KMT that ruled Taiwan for 50 years
until the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power in 2000. He has been
branded by the DPP as a dictator and fingered as the main culprit behind a
massacre that occurred Feb. 28, 1947 and the ensuing "White Terror" during a
period of KMT-imposed martial law.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment adopted earlier in the day at the local government's
administrative  meeting,  an amendment was passed stipulating that the central
government's move to designate or abolish the "national status" of a historic
relic located in the city will not affect the relic's status as a city-
designated historic site.</P>
      <P>The amendment came after the MOE's filing of an application with the Cabinet-
level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) Nov. 26 to confirm the national status
of the historic site, now designated Taiwan Democratic Memorial Park but
previously known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park, which was built in 1980
to commemorate the late president.</P>
      <P>Confirmation of the landmark's status as a national historical site would
invalidate the Taipei city government's designation of the park as a city
historic  relic under  the Cultural  Heritage Preservation Law.</P>
      <P>With CCA confirmation expected Wednesday, when the council is scheduled to
publicize revised regulations governing reviews of the designation and abolition
of historic sites, the MOE may soon begin work to "renovate" the memorial hall.</P>
      <P>However, under the city government-revised regulations, "the central
government's move to manage, maintain, repair or re-use a city-designated
historic site should obtain a permit from the city government, " said Yeh Chin-
yuan, commissioner of the city's Law and Regulation Commission.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted the new rule will take effect Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In response to a question posed by reporters as to whether the city government
wrote the new regulation on the basis of its own biased political ideology, Lee
Yung-ping, director of the City Department of Cultural Affairs, claimed the
department was forced to take the action to stop the attempt to replace the
plaque, which was itself driven by a contrary political ideology.</P>
      <P>The CKS Memorial Hall is a popular tourist attraction in the capital city, Lee
said, wondering aloud why the MOE insists on changing its name and the plaque
that has become a landmark.</P>
      <P>Responding to another question, Yeh admitted that the memorial hall could be a
symbol of Taiwan's authoritarian past, but insisted it would be wrong to impose
another form of autocratic rule to eliminate its existence, referring to
incumbent President Chen Shui-bian's determination  to "root out" Chiang's
authoritarian legacy.</P>
      <P>The central government renamed Chiang Kai-shek International Airport the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport Sept. 6, 2006 and renamed Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall as National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Park July 15.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Officials, developers learn from U.K. urban regeneration experience</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local officials and land developers were keen to learn from the experience in
the United Kingdom during a conference Tuesday as several major urban
regeneration projects are being implemented in various regions throughout
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We don't have enough experience in major urban redevelopment here in Taiwan.
That is why we're having this conference to learn from the U.K., which has
enjoyed success in this field and developed its expertise, " said Charles Lin,
Director-General of Construction and Planning Agency (CPA).</P>
      <P>Lin said that the conference, co-organized by the CPA and the British Trade and
Cultural Office (BTCO) in Taipei, would bring valuable knowledge and experience
to the participants who are expected to be engaged in many projects in the
future.</P>
      <P>"Urban regeneration is not easy and it can be expensive. But it's an important
task for any modern country, " BTCO Director Michael Reilly said, adding that he
was glad that up to 10 regions had been selected to undertake such urban
transformation.</P>
      <P>With many successful cases in the United States and the U.K., such as the Canary
Wharf business district in London and Cardiff in Wales,  Taiwan will launch its
own multibillion  dollar urban regeneration projects at the end of year,
including renovation of railway stations in Hsinchu, Keelung, Chiayi and
Kaohsiung Port and Taipei's Huakuang Community adjoining the Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall, Lin said.</P>
      <P>During the industrial revolution and after the years of World War II, a lot of
large scale and cheap housing projects were built without consideration of the
cultural and social context, which is why urban renewal was introduced, said
Rupert Robinson, Board Director of the British Urban Regeneration Association
(BURA).</P>
      <P>Urban regeneration could lead to destruction of buildings, relocation of people,
and sometimes expropriation to make available private property. It also involved
many parties, including the government, developers and residents, and covered a
broad range of social, economical and cultural contexts, Robinson said.</P>
      <P>Dialogue with communities and reaching a consensus were extremely important to
the process, said Shawn Riley, who also serves as BURA's Board Director.</P>
      <P>"Developers and the government had to tell the residents exactly which part of
town needed to be regenerated first and what the town would be like in phase
one, two and three so they had a clear picture of what the future would be, "
Riley said.</P>
      <P>The government was also expected to use infrastructure as an enabler  and
attract investment  from private sectors under a well-structured financing plan
so all parties could benefit from regeneration plans, Robinson added.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the government should be very careful with the role it plays during
the process because resources are limited, Lin pointed out.</P>
      <P>"We have to make it right, not spread it out, " he said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will approve a package of draft amendments to the lottery
statute that will see only 20 percent of profits from the Sports Lottery used
for social welfare and the other 80 percent on sports development, an Executive
Yuan official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is expected to pass the draft amendments at its weekly
meeting Wednesday, the official said, adding that law revision is expected to be
finished before the Sports Lottery is launched next May.</P>
      <P>The amendments were initiated by the Sports Affairs Council, which proposed the
issuance of the Sports Lottery to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) last year, the
official said, adding that under the amended statute, the MOF will oversee
Sports Lottery funds.</P>
      <P>The Sports Lottery is scheduled to be formally issued May 2, 2008 by Taipei
Fubon Bank.</P>
      <P>Under the existing Statute for the Issuance of Welfare Lottery Tickets, lottery
issuing institutes have to use profits gained from issuance of lotteries,
including the Sports Lottery, for social welfare affairs and government
subsidies for pensions and national health insurance, not in the sports field,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Minister-without-Portfolio  Ho Mei-Yueh convened  meeting to promote the
approval of amendments to the statute in order to establish a legal basis upon
which Sports Lottery profits could be spent in the sporting field, the official
said.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Police Department indicated Tuesday that its police force will
intensify their efforts to combat drunken driving in the winter season when
people are drinking more frequently.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the department said the city police force will conduct no less
than 10 operations each month to set up road blocks at 122 strategic locations
in the city to check driver sobriety, with each operation supported by more than
400 officers.</P>
      <P>Noting that many drivers drink and drive just because they feel they might get
away with it, the spokesman warned that alcohol and driving do not mix, and that
those who ignore the rule could end up paying a heavy price.</P>
      <P>The legislature is in the process of amending an existing criminal law to
increase the fine for drunken driving from the current NT$30,000 to NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Taipei City Police Department show that in the first

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is going to employ delicacies created by
the celebrated restaurant Din Tai Fung to conduct "soft power diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang made the announcement Monday while
hosting a luncheon at the MOFA reception hall with Din Tai Fung chefs serving
the company's trademark dishes on the spot.</P>
      <P>Describing the reception hall full of the "luscious aroma of meat" from Din Tai
Fung delicacies, Huang said that introducing Taiwan's distinguished culinary
culture to international society could be a creative tactic in the nation's
attempt to break through China's diplomatic containment.</P>
      <P>Renowned in the international culinary world, Din Tai Fung is going to send a
group of 17 chefs to the United Kingdom and France to prepare all kinds of
savory cuisine for their guests, including its famous steamed pork dumplings,
steamed mashed red bean buns, traditional chicken soup along with Taiwanese tea,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>The event is being organized by the MOFA in cooperation with Din Tai Fung and
several other organizations, including the Council for Cultural Affairs, the
Government Information Office, the Tourism Bureau, the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council and the Evergreen Group.</P>
      <P>Noted politicians, socialites, media executives, food critics and other
celebrities will be invited to attend cookery demonsrations and tastings at
Evergreen Group's London headquarters on Dec. 10, and at Evergreen Laurel Hotel
in Paris Dec. 12 and Dec. 14, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The chefs displayed their culinary skills in advance Monday at the MOFA
reception hall, serving tasty dishes and Taiwanese tea so delicious that their
efforts were roundly applauded by the guests, including British Trade and
Culture Office Director Michael Reilly and French Institute in Taipei Director
Jean-Claude Poimboeuf.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, Huang said that in the midst of the current hard-fought
diplomatic battle, the country can resort to soft tactics, such as "culture
diplomacy", adding that the Taipei First Girls High School marching band, which
performed in the Edinburgh Military Tattoo this summer, and the Taiwanese
symphony black metal band ChthoniC, which performed in many U.S. and European
cities earlier this year, are good examples of "soft power diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Being rated as one of the top 10 restaurants in the world by the New York Times
in 1993 and running successful businesses in America, Japan as well as other
places in Southeast Asia, Din Tai Fung has been praised as the pinnacle of
Taiwan's culinary world, Huang said, adding that using its image to market
Taiwan is a good way of upgrading Taiwan's international profile since fine food
knows no borders nor political barriers.</P>
      <P>"Din Tia Fung's experienced chefs will devote every effort to promoting
Taiwanese delicacies and culture in Europe, " Yan Bing-yi, the group's founder,
said at the same occasion.</P>

      <P>An exhibition documenting a 19th Century British naturalist's work in Taiwan was
launched Tuesday to pay tribute to his contribution to the ornithology of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which will be held at the National Taiwan Museum (NTM) from Dec.
4 to July 20, commemorates the life and work of Robert Swinhoe (1836-1877) , who
documented more than 1,000 species during his 10-year stay in Taiwan from
1856-1866 as Britain's first consular representative to Formosa.</P>
      <P>"It's amazing that black-faced spoonbills, which were observed for the first
time by Swinhoe in 1863, are still here in Taiwan today, " said Council of
Cultural Affairs Vice Chairman Wu Chin-fa in the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Swinhoe wrote himself into history with his observations and documentation  of
Taiwan's  biological  diversity,  said museum researcher and exhibition curator
Lin Jun-tsun.</P>
      <P>Swinhoe was the first naturalist to systematically observe and document birds,
mammals, fish and insects in Taiwan and southern China. Swinhoe's blue pheasant,
an endangered species endemic to Taiwan, is named after him, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Specimens prepared by Swinhoe have proved to be valuable assets for modern
naturalists in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>"What Swinhoe did 150 years ago reminds us about what we should do to preserve
the environment and co-exist with the nature, " said NTM Director Hsiao Tsun-

    <HEADLINE>President dismisses possibility of cross-strait dialogue after March</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
12/04/07  21:54:02

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed Tuesday that even after Taiwan elects a new
president next March, it will be "impossible" for the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to resume dialogue.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received Richard Bush, a former chairman
of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The meeting came one day after Stephen Young, director of the AIT Taipei Office,
delivered a speech titled "Opportunities and Challenges in U.S.-Taiwan and
Cross-Strait Relations" at a conference organized by the Foundation on the
International and Cross-Strait Studies.</P>
      <P>Young noted in his speech that Hu Jintao has replaced Jiang Zemin as China's
president and that Taiwan will elect a new president next March, making an
"opportunity for the two sides to set aside past differences and work to create
a new cooperative relationship."</P>
      <P>On Young's interpretation that Hu's moderate remarks on Taiwan policy at the
recent 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China as an indication
Beijing might be looking for ways to open contact with Taiwan's next president,
Chen said that "we would rather it is that way, although the reality is
otherwise."</P>
      <P>This is because Hu said the prerequisite for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
sign a peace agreement will be that "Taiwan must accept the `one-China'
principle," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the previous Kuomintang administration passed the National
Unification Guidelines in early 1990s in its bid for cross-strait dialogue and
even included the guidelines in the party charter.</P>
      <P>But he said that even with the National Unification Guidelines, which accepts
the "one China" principle and the eventual unification of the two sides, cross-
strait dialogue was disrupted from time to time after 1993, when the top
negotiators on both sides met for the first time in Singapore after a hiatus of
nearly five decades of separation. China even lobbed missiles into waters near
Taiwan in 1996 when the island's first popular presidential election was held.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT, which accepts the `one China' principle, could not have dialogue
with China, how could the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which
rejects the principle, embark on dialogue with China?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait dialogue was completely stalled after former President Lee Teng-hui
defined the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as having a "special state-to-state
relations" in 1999.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has urged China to put aside its differences and embark on peaceful
dialogue since he assumed office in 2000, but added that all his goodwill appeal
has fallen on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>"This is why I say even when a new president is elected in March 2008, it will
be impossible for the two sides to resume the dialogue, " he said, unless Hu and
the Chinese government are willing to forego its "one-China" principle and its
desire for eventual unification as prerequisites for talks.</P>
      <P>He responded positively to Young's remarks that "Taiwan's special situation
calls for careful, responsible leadership."</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the "four noes" pledges he made during his 2000 inaugural
speech, and again during his re-election speech in 2004, remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>The "four noes" pledges refer to his promise that if China does not use force
against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan independence, will not change its
official name, will not introduce cross-strait "state-to-state" relations into
the Constitution and will not hold a referendum on independence or unification.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also strengthened its self-defense capability and the nation's
defense budget will be increased to 3 percent of the gross domestic product in
2008, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He expressed appreciation for the United States' support for greater Taiwan
participation in international organizations, but expressed regret that the
United States will not support Taiwan's membership in organizations in its
capacity as a state, which he said is "contradictory."</P>
      <P>If Taiwan wants greater participation, he said, it should be in the capacity of
a nation. Moreover, Taiwan's participation as a state will conform with the
content, provision and spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that Young said it best when he predicted that "China's
democratization may turn out to be the single most important prerequisite for
seeking a resolution fo the Taiwan question that is acceptable to both sides."</P>
      <P>Chen said China's democratization should include the end of single-party rule,
as well as political, religious and assembly freedom, the renunciation of the
use of force against Taiwan, as well as peaceful dialogue with Taiwan under the
principles of "democracy, sovereignty and equality."</P>

      <P>A group of sex workers staged a protest at the Ministry of the Interior Tuesday
over the minister's objection to decriminalizing prostitution.</P>
      <P>Displaying posters and shouting "prostitutes and patrons are more noble than
corrupt politicians, " 20 members of the Collective of Sex Workers and
Supporters (COSWAS) gathered in front of the ministry, demanding that Interior
Minister Lee Yi-yang deliver on President Chen Shui-bian's promise of no
punishment for sex workers.</P>
      <P>The protest came after Lee said at a recent meeting called by the Executive
Yuan's Human Rights Protection Task Force that both prostitutes and patrons
should be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Some human  rights  activists  have been pushing  for the decriminalization of
prostitution, but Lee was quoted as having said at the meeting that there is not
yet broad social support for the decriminalization of prostitution.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee went on that decriminalizing prostitution will cause more
problems, such as disputes over prostitute licensing, human trafficking and
social order. Against this backdrop, Lee said he prefers to see the law be
revised to have both prostitutes and patrons punished.</P>
      <P>Under the current law, only prostitutes are subject to criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has ordered the Ministry of the Interior to study the
feasibility of revising the current law in line with the principle of upholding
human rights.</P>
      <P>"President  Chen Shui-bian  promised  to amend the law to decriminalize
prostitution while running for the presidency in 2004, but nothing has been done
so far in this regard, " COSWAS Executive Director Chung Jun-Yun said, adding

to deliver on Chen's campaign promise before his presidency expires next May.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth this year should be adjusted upward to 5.35 percent
from a previous estimate of 4.5 percent, a local think tank said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hwa Institution for Economic Research (CIER) said in its 2008 global
economic outlook seminar that the adjustment was based mainly on an optimistic
estimate by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS forecast in late November that because of brisk exports in the third

    <HEADLINE>Executive Yuan reiterates no change in 'one-step' voting format</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is determined to adopt the "one-step" voting format for the
Legislative poll and two accompanying referendums Jan. 12, 2008, and there will
be no other alternative, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks in response to reporters' questions after the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) voiced strong support for 18 cities and counties
controlled by the KMT which are seeking to adopt a "two-step" voting format.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and director of the KMT's Policy Coordination
Committee, issued earlier the same day a seven-point statement declaring the
party's staunch backing for local authorities adopting the "two-step" voting
scheme in a defiance of a Nov. 16 decision by the Central Election Commission
(CEC) to apply the "one-step" format.</P>
      <P>Turning to a report that Taitung County has agreed to use the "one-step" scheme,
Tseng called the report a "twisted fabrication" by local media and reiterated
that the 18 local governments will stick to the "two-step" voting format, under
which voters will be given and cast their ballots for the legislative poll and
referendums in two stages.</P>
      <P>CEC branches are responsible for the disposal and management of local polling
stations and the central unit is not entitled to meddle in their operations nor
to replace their chief officials, Tseng said, adding that the CEC, which has yet
to be instituted, is the source of all this chaos.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung met with CEC local unit chiefs Monday evening,
with the two sides reaching an agreement that voters will receive two ballots
for the legislative elections and two ballots for the referendums at two desks
before casting them into four separate boxes -- a departure from the CEC's
original decision that voters would take all four ballots from a single desk.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the KMT's stance, Shieh made it clear that the CEC-designed "one-
step" format will be definitely used for the polls and said that the KMT must be
held fully accountable for all possible consequences if it insists on applying
the "two-step" format.</P>
      <P>In response to the Legislative Yuan Procedural Committee's inclusion of the KMT-
drafted CEC organic bill as the first issue of discussion for Friday's
legislative session, Ker Chien-ming, legislative caucus whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that it will fully mobilize party
lawmakers to kill the bill's passage at "whatever the cost."</P>
      <P>The KMT-proposed  bill,  Ker said,  would  allow  for the establishment of an
unconstitutional CEC -- something which the DPP is firmly opposed.</P>

      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey declined to comment Tuesday on an ad
concerning the legislation of a "cross-Taiwan Strait peace law" run by a
prominent high-technology tycoon in local newspapers other than blasting it as
part of Beijing's united front tactics.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks to the CNA after United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC)
Honorary Chairman Robert Tsao ran a new advertisement earlier that same day in
major newspapers appealing for the legislation -- his third since Nov. 20.</P>
      <P>According to Shieh, Tsao's advertisement was launched in line with Beijing's
united front tactics comprising a legal, psychological and media war. The
Executive Yuan has no responsibility to respond to Tsao's move, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition to reiterating his claim that Taiwan "needs" to enact such a law to
ensure cross-strait peace, Tsao also accused Taiwan's popularly elected
presidents of using Taiwan independence as a fake issue to deceive voters.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to respect the Republic of China and called on it to stop its
relentless efforts to squeeze the country in the international community,
warning that continuing to do so might eventually lead to a "Republic of
Taiwan."</P>

      <P>The birdwing butterfly native to the Orchid Island, also known as Lanyu, located
off Taitung County in eastern Taiwan, has been selected as the country's most
beautiful in a recent online poll, an organizer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The result of the online poll organized by the Shining Culture and Education
Foundation is slated to be formally announced Dec. 6.</P>
      <P>The month-long poll was aimed at choosing Taiwan's top 10 beautiful butterflies
from 23 cities and counties around the island.</P>
      <P>Currently, the number of birdwing butterflies -- dubbed "flying pearls" -- is
fewer than 2,000 worldwide, with more than 1,500 of them being spotted on the
Orchid Island, Taitung County Councilor Chiang Duo-li said.</P>
      <P>The butterfly's numbers dropped to below 1,000 a decade ago due habitat loss and
reductions of their food supply, Chiang said, adding that massive numbers of the
butterflies were also captured for sale by locals in the past.</P>
      <P>During the 1960s and 1970s, approximately 5,000 to 10,000 birdwing butterflies
were caught and sold annually to butterfly collectors in Taiwan and abroad,
Chiang pointed out.</P>
      <P>Beginning in 2000, the Council of Agriculture (COA) began collaborating with a
local association dedicated to the preservation of the ecosystem on Lanyu to
protect the endangered butterflies, said Chiang, who is also the director of the
association.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang,  birdwing butterflies  also have been discovered on the
Batan Islands of the Philippines, but in very low numbers.</P>
      <P>Orchid Island is about 110 km north of the Batan Islands of the Philippines.</P>

the digital disparity between women in urban and rural areas, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under  the  program,  the  CEPD  subsidized  11 non-profit organizations to
provide 24 hours of basic computer lessons to the course attendees. The program
began in more than 100 townships in June.</P>

the official noted.</P>
      <P>A closing ceremony was held in Chiayi County's Tungshih township in southern

      <P>A group of sex workers staged a protest at the Ministry of the Interior Tuesday
over the minister's objection to decriminalizing prostitution.</P>
      <P>Displaying posters and shouting "prostitutes and patrons are more noble than
corrupt politicians, " 20 members of the Collective of Sex Workers and
Supporters (COSWAS) gathered in front of the ministry, demanding that Interior
Minister Lee Yi-yang deliver on President Chen Shui-bian's promise of no
punishment for sex workers.</P>
      <P>The protest came after Lee said at a recent meeting called by the Executive
Yuan's Human Rights Protection Task Force that both prostitutes and patrons
should be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Some human  rights  activists  have been pushing  for the decriminalization of
prostitution, but Lee was quoted as having said at the meeting that there is not
yet broad social support for the decriminalization of prostitution.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee went on that decriminalizing prostitution will cause more
problems, such as disputes over prostitute licensing, human trafficking and
social order. Against this backdrop, Lee said he prefers to see the law be
revised to have both prostitutes and patrons punished.</P>
      <P>Under the current law, only prostitutes are subject to criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has ordered the Ministry of the Interior to study the
feasibility of revising the current law in line with the principle of upholding
human rights.</P>

prostitution while running for the presidency in 2004, but nothing has been done
so far in this regard, " COSWAS Executive Director Chung Jun-Yun said, adding

country will surely attain order."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan students tops in world in mathematics literacy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan students have been ranked as the top performers in mathematics among
students from a total of 57 countries and regions surveyed worldwide, according
to the results of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's
(OECD's) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2006 released
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The program, administered by the OECD since 2000, is a triennial worldwide test
of 15-year-olds aimed at assessing how far students near the end of compulsory
education have come in acquiring the knowledge and skills essential for full
participation in society. The assessments cover the students' capabilities in
reading literacy, mathematics literacy and science literacy.</P>
      <P>This marks the first time that Taiwan has taken part in the assessment, with a
total of 8,815 students in the age group from 240 schools around Taiwan being
tested.</P>
      <P>The results show that Taiwan students topped their peers from other  surveyed
countries  in terms of their performance  in mathematics. Students from Finland
came in second, followed by those from Hong Kong and South Korea in third place.</P>
      <P>In terms of science literacy, Taiwan students ranked fourth, behind only those
from Finland, Hong Kong and Canada and ahead of students from Japan and South
Korea, which placed fifth and 10th, respectively, according to the results.</P>
      <P>Taiwan students' lowest ranking was in the category of reading literacy, in
which they placed 16th, behind those from other major Asian economies, including
South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan.</P>
      <P>Noting that science literacy is the focus of the PISA 2006, Lin Huann-shyang,
president of National Hualien University of Education, who acted as Taiwan's
project manager, said Taiwan students have demonstrated a strong ability in
explaining scientific phenomena</P>
      <P>but have performed relative weak in identifying science issues and using science
evidence.</P>
      <P>However, the overall performance of Taiwan students in the PISA 2006 illustrates
the excellent achievements of Taiwan's nine-year integrated compulsory education
in terms of mathematics and science, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin Fou-lai, a professor in mathematics at National Taiwan Normal University,
said Taiwan students have much room for improvement in terms of their reading
literacy, pointing out that only 4.7 percent of surveyed Taiwan students reached
the highest level of proficiency in reading, compared with 21.7 percent of
surveyed South Korean students.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out in 43 countries in the first assessment in 2000 which
focused on reading literacy, in 41 countries in the second assessment in 2003
which focused on mathematics literacy, and in 57 countries in the third
assessment in 2006 which focused on science literacy.</P>
      <P>Sixty-two countries have signed up to participate in the fourth assessment in
2009 which will again focus on reading literacy.</P>

      <P>Family members of the skipper of a Suao-based fishing boat missing since Nov. 10
urged the government Wednesday not to cease searching for the crew of the boat.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chen Chin-teh at a
news conference, the wife of Chih Yu-hsin, the skipper of the "Chin Hsieh Yi No.
166, " called for governmental agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA), the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) and the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , to continue their efforts to locate Chih and
the other eight crew members.</P>
      <P>Chih's uncle, a veteran sailor, said the likelihood that the "Chin Hsieh Yi No.
166" sank or collided with another vessel is extremely low as the boat is
equipped with advanced radar, navigation and communications systems.</P>
      <P>Chih's wife and uncle said they do not exclude the possibility that Chih was
abducted and even murdered by his crew -- made up of six Chinese and two
Indonesian citizens -- and that the crew sailed the vessel to China or
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Also present at the news conference, Lin Chin-you, an inspector with the CGA
Department of Coastal Control, said the "Chin Hsieh Yi No. 166" departed the
Suao Port Nov. 8 and made its last radio contact with other Taiwan fishing boats
Nov. 10.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the CGA began its search on Nov. 12 immediately after being
informed that the boat was missing.</P>
      <P>He added that although fishing gear belonging to the "Chin Hsieh Yi No. 166" had
been spotted some 26 nautical miles south of Tiaoyutai Island and that Japan
then dispatched aircraft and patrol boats to help search in adjacent areas for
three days, nothing else related to the boat was discovered.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The southwest and northeast coasts of Taiwan are the most vulnerable to tsunami
attacks in the event of a strong underwater earthquake occurring in the South
China Sea, according to the results of a Taiwan study released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Regions that are considered at high risk include the shoreline between Hengchun
and Tainan in southern Taiwan as well as Lotung and Suao in northeastern Yilan
County, the study shows.</P>
      <P>The study was administered by Wu Tso-ren, an assistant professor at National
Central University's Institute of Hydrological Sciences.</P>
      <P>Wu reported the results of his study during the South China Sea Tsunami Workshop
2007 held by the Academia Sinica's Institute of Earth Sciences.</P>
      <P>Tsunamis are usually caused by undersea earthquakes measuring at least 7.2 in
magnitude that have a focal depth no deeper than 30 km. Moderately elevated
ground undersea helps the formation of tsunamis.</P>
      <P>If the South China Sea experiences an undersea earthquake with a magnitude
similar to that of the Dec. 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake centered near the
Indonesian island of Sumatra, a tsunami 8-10 meters high is likely to hit
Hengchun approximately one hour after the quake, and Lotung and Suao are likely
to see a tsunami 6-8 meters high, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Referring to a report by the United States Geological Survey assessing the
potential risk as a tsunami source along the entire Pacific subduction zones, Wu
noted that the Luzon trench has been identified as a high risk zone, while the
Ryukyu trench and the North Sulawesi trench have been identified as two medium
risk zones.</P>
      <P>The report says these subduction zones can rupture and generate large tsunamis
that will have significant impacts on the countries in the South China region,
including China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,
the Philippines and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the tsunami triggered by the 2004 earthquake, nearly 300,000 people were
killed and more than 1 million others were left homeless in 10 countries
surrounding the Indian Ocean, with the total damage estimated at over US$10
billion.</P>

      <P>Traditional deities are to be used to help promote Taiwan's bid for membership
in the United Nations, organizers of the activity said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks one day after President Chen Shui-bian revealed an "all
deities safeguard Taiwan" campaign for the country's U.N. bid during a visit to
Tsaotien Temple in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Religious groups will use the opportunity of an annual inspection tour of
deities, such as an islandwide tour of a Matsu statue, to promote the U.N. bid,
the organizers said. Matsu is the Chinese goddess of the sea.</P>
      <P>Similar religious rites will also be performed in New York next year to
highlight the nation's U.N. bid, they said.</P>
      <P>They noted that the campaign was inspired by a similar deity procession in front
of U.N. headquarters in New York prior to the opening of the U.N. Assembly this
September.</P>
      <P>The deity procession, which is a common sight in Taiwan, drew a lot of publicity
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Religious sources said that during the deity inspection tour around Taiwan and
the procession in New York next year, there will be other promotional items
available, such as "lucky amulets," to attract attention.</P>
      <P>Activity organizers said they will call a news conference in mid-December to
publish the details of its activities.</P>
      <P>Sources from the Presidential Office said the use of creative innovation to
combine tradition with the "new" issue of the U.N. bid is "sure to attract more
media attention."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tried without success to re-enter the United Nations since 1993. This
year marked the first time the nation had sought entry to the world organization

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou urged the public
Wednesday to use their votes to unseat an "authoritarian government" that has
arbitrarily planned to tear down what he described as a "historic plaque."</P>
      <P>Ma made the call in a statement on a squabble between the KMT-ruled Taipei city
government and the central government run by the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on a Ministry of Education (MOE) -initiated plan to replace the "Ta Chung
Chih Cheng" plaque on the gateway of the National Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Hall, which alludes to the late President Chiang Kai-shek, with another reading
"Tzu You Kuang Chang, "which translates as "Liberty Square." The memorial hall
was formerly named the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>Ma made the statement after a visit to the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in
Linkou, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>He promised that if elected, he will act based on "public consensus" and through
a legal procedure to "restore" the inscription if the DPP government really
ignors the city government's opposition and replaces the plaque.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that the government acted to "get around, violate and destroy" the
laws with administrative power, referring to an ongoing move to revise the
administrative  regulations  concerning the designation and abolition of a
historic relic in its preparation to tear down the plaque.</P>
      <P>By designating the memorial park as a historic site with national status, the
park's current status as a city-designated historic relic will become null. The
change will give the MOE the chance to apply to the Council for Cultural Affairs
for permission to renovate the park.</P>
      <P>According to Ma,  the higher-level  laws that the central government attempted
to get around in order to carry out its scheme to expunge the last vestiges of
Chiang's authoritarian rule include the Cultural Heritage Preservation Law, the
Provisions Governing the Organization of the CKS Memorial Hall Administration
Office, and the Organization Act of the Central Government.</P>
      <P>The DPP has acted to "destroy"  a historic relic through designating its status
as a historic relic, Ma claimed, adding that the conduct has not only "violated
the Cultural Heritage Preservation Law's  spirit  but  also  signals  the
specter  of  emerging authoritarianism."</P>
      <P>The plaque issue was brought up for the purpose of raising conflict, fomenting
hatred and seeking election benefits, Ma claimed, calling on the public to be
"rational" and stay calm.</P>
      <P>The memorial hall was build in 1980 to commemorate Chiang, who the DPP brands as
a dictator and accuses of being the main culprit behind a massacre that occurred
Feb. 28, 1947 and the ensuing White Terror of the KMT-imposed martial law.</P>
      <P>The DPP government renamed the memorial hall as National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Park July 15 after it changed the designation of Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Sept. 6, 2006.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has said Wednesday that a planned referendum on the
government's bid to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan will allow the
public to express their opposition to unification with China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he received American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) former
Chairman Richard Bush at the Presidential Office Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The remarks were in response to a speech delivered a day earlier by Stephen
Young, director of the AIT Taipei Office, who said the government's U.N. bid is
"unnecessary and unhelpful."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that China brought up a new interpretation of its "one China" policy.
The new policy sees Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China, while
under the previous interpretation, Taiwan was taken as part of a "cultural
China" that does not necessarily equate with the PRC.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's future has to be decided by its people. Asking Taiwan people
to accept eventual unification would violate the principle that the nation's
power rests with the public, he said.</P>
      <P>Joining the United Nations under the name Taiwan does not violate his "four
noes" pledges, Chen went on. In addition, it does not involve changing the
status quo between two sides of Taiwan Strait or the nation's official name,
Chen added, noting that about 80 of the United Nations' 192 member countries
joined the world body under unofficial names.</P>
      <P>He said the government proposed the bid to join the United Nations to meet the
Taiwan people's expectations.</P>
      <P>He added that the results of a survey show that 55 percent of Americans support
Taiwan's participation in the United Nations and said the percentage will
increase to 70 percent if the referendum is successful.</P>
      <P>Japanese support will increase from the present 74 percent to 81 percent under
the same situation, Chen said, citing other survey results.</P>

      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers filed a charge
Wednesday against Ma Ying-jeou, the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT)
presidential candidate, on charges of slander over a 228 Incident bill that they
tried to enact at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang Sing-nan and Kao Chien-chih, among others, submitted the charge to the
Taipei Prosecutors Office accusing Ma of "malicious defamation" over the bill,
which is aimed at bringing to justice those responsible for the 228 Incident of
1947 and for government crimes during the martial rule imposed by the KMT from
1949-1987.</P>
      <P>Wang, who proposed the draft law endorsed by 34 DPP lawmakers, blasted what he
described as Ma's "twisted rhetoric" that the bill will involve innocent people
because its fourth article stipulates that even if the perpetrators have died,
their spouses, sons and even third cousins will also have to stand trial in
their places.</P>
      <P>Wang accused Ma of seriously distorting the article's "good faith" which he
claimed would offer the criminals' offspring "the chance to defend their
fathers, grandfathers or relatives."</P>
      <P>Ma's claims that the bill is full of hatred and would implicate innocent persons
is entirely deviated from the facts, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Ma said a day earlier that the DPP has stepped across the red line for rehashing
the 228 Incident because the bill also has hurt the victims' families by failing
to take into account their feelings.</P>
      <P>Such a draft law is merely a scheme designed by the DPP to cement the "pan-green
camp" voter base in the coming legislative and presidential polls, Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and director of the party's Policy Coordination
Committee, turned down an invitation by Wang Tuesday to debate the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>"There is no need to respond to Wang as it would only fuel social confrontation
between the two camps," Tseng pointed out.</P>
      <P>Thousands of Taiwanese people were massacred by KMT troops in the 228 Incident
of 1947 during the party's initial rule of Taiwan shortly after the regime led
by late President Chiang Kai-shek relocated from China to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Taipei city councilors of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
have applied to the City Police Department for the right to hold rallies on the
sidewalk surrounding the Taiwan Democratic Memorial Park, previously called the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, from Wednesday to Dec. 15, a city police official
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Ching-fu, head of the department's social order maintenance office,
confirmed that the application had been approved.</P>
      <P>Huang also noted that police will be deployed at the site of the planned public
activities to prevent conflicts between political foes.</P>
      <P>The DPP city councilors' move to rent the sidewalk space along the memorial park
came amid a face-off between the city government and the Ministry of Education
(MOE) on the latter's plan to tear down the plaque on the park's gateway, which
reads "Ta Chung Chih Cheng" alluding to the late President Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>In protest, various city councilors of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) held
a press conference at the party caucus office at the City Council to denounce
the MOE plan.</P>
      <P>The KMT politicians denounced the DPP's moves to "erase" the name of Chiang Kai-
shek and to apply to hold public rallies as an attempt to "raise conflicts"
between people with opposing political ideas.</P>
      <P>Such conflicts will be used as an excuse for President Chen Shui-bian to impose
martial law during the upcoming legislative and presidential elections next
year, they claimed, urging KMT supporters to be calm and to avoid conflict with
DPP followers.</P>
      <P>They also urged city police to stay alert when the DPP organizes rallies at the
memorial park or tries to "fake riots" to give Chen a chance to impose a curfew.</P>

      <P>The Taipei county government will enforce a new measure from Jan. 1 banning
gravel trucks from other cities and countries from transiting through county
roads, while allowing locally based dump trucks to use the roads only during
off-peak hours.</P>
      <P>The new measure was mapped out after tourism industry workers in Yingge township
complained that the large volume of gravel truck traffic through the town every
day not only endangers the safety of visitors and local residents but also
plagues them with noise and air pollution.</P>
      <P>Yingge, one of the townships in Taipei County that relies heavily on tourism for
its prosperity, is well-known in Taiwan for its ceramics technology and
production. The Yingge Ceramics Museum has an ambitious plan to put Yingge on
the world map as a town that produces high-grade ceramics.</P>
      <P>Taipei magistrate Chow Hsi-wei visited the town last Sunday to measure the
traffic volume of gravel trucks passing through.</P>
      <P>At a Dec. 5 meeting with county government officials, police chiefs and leaders
of tourism-related industries, Chou adopted the suggestion by Lin Chung-chang,
head of the Transportation Bureau of the county government, that sand and gravel
trucks from other cities and counties should transit Taipei County only on
national roads and that locally based dump trucks should be restricted from
using county roads during rush hours and holidays.</P>
      <P>The new measure is expected to be sanctioned by the county government's road
safety supervisory group before being promulgated by Jan. 1 for implementation.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday that the government is expected to
spend an additional NT$1.46 billion (US$45.2 million)  over the next three years
to help disadvantaged high school students.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after the Cabinet passed a project proposed by the
Ministry of Education (MOE) designed to help disadvantaged students
economically, culturally and in terms of learning ability.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the MOE has adopted a series of measures aimed at helping
these students get equal learning opportunities over</P>
      <P>the years and said the project is part of that effort.</P>
      <P>The project includes programs on practical skills and courses catering to the
needs of certain sectors, as well as supplementary schools.</P>
      <P>Under the program, disadvantaged students in senior high schools or vocational
schools who are in the "practical skill" program will be exempted from paying
tuition fees.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the course will mainly target those students who are not keen
on regular learning so that they can obtain practical skills.</P>
      <P>The MOE plans to have the tuition fee exemption program cover first, second and
third year high school students annually and to have eventually benefited 54,000
students by 2010.</P>
      <P>Also, the students who take the courses designed to cater to specific sectors,
such as joinery,  agriculture and precision machinery, will also be exempted
from paying tuition fees.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that around 5,100 students will have benefited from the program
by 2010, the premier said, helping solve the problem of insufficient workers in
some sectors at the same time.</P>
      <P>The supplementary school courses will mainly target those who have to work in
the daytime, dropouts and other disadvantaged students.</P>
      <P>Those students who come from families with an annual household income of less

      <P>Gambian President Yahya Jammeh vowed Wednesday that he will forever stand by the
people of Taiwan and referred to President Chen Shui-bian as "president of the
Taiwan republic."</P>
      <P>Jammeh, who arrived in Taiwan a day earlier for a five-day state visit,  made
the remarks  during a meeting with Chen at the Presidential Office. Minister of
Foreign Affairs James Huang was also present.</P>
      <P>A military salute was held in honor of the Gambian president in the square in
front of the Presidential Office earlier that same day. This is Jammeh's seventh
visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Promising  that he will continue speaking up for Taiwan's membership in the
United Nations until the world body forswears its Resolution 2758 and allows
Taiwan to participate in the international organization, Jammeh said he will
"lend his staunch support to Taiwan until the goal is realized."</P>
      <P>Resolution  2758 recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate representative of
China and gives the China seat to Beijing at the expense of Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to Jammeh, excluding Taiwan from the United Nations not only amounts
to a violation of its basic principles but also deprives other countries of the
opportunity to receive aid from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jammeh said he is deeply disappointed with Taiwan's absence from the United
Nations and that he appreciates the economic assistance the Taiwan government
and businessmen have extended to his nation.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen described the Gambia as Taiwan's "close ally" and thanked the
West African country for its continued and all-out backing for Taiwan in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Chen hosted a state banquet for Jammeh in the evening at the Taipei 101 Tower.

      <P>The days of strictly political diplomacy and confrontational competition with
China in the international arena are long gone,  but Taiwan is capable of
pursuing its diplomatic initiatives in other ways, such as ecology consultation,
a lawmaker versed in the field said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"No one will say no to ecological and environmental protection these days, "
said Legislator Tien Chiu-chin, who led an 11-member mission to Saint Lucia,
Taiwan's diplomatic ally in the Caribbean, Nov. 25 - Dec. 2 to help develop its
Eco Tourism and birding infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs-backed mission, comprised of senior birders and
ecological photographers, was aimed at helping the Caribbean country establish
its Eco Tourism routes and birding Web sites, as well as documenting bird
species for the future publication of a birding guide, an essential tool for
birders, Tien said.</P>
      <P>During the mission's stay, 46 bird species were documented, including St.
Lucia's national bird, the Saint Lucia parrot, and 25 were photographed. Two
photographers attached to the mission have extended their stays for another
month.</P>
      <P>"This is a brand new attempt for us to embrace the global trend of environment
diplomacy and preservation of bio-diversity and develop our international
diplomacy at the same time. There's no better place for such a mission than St.
Lucia, which re-established official diplomatic ties with Taiwan Apr. 30, " said
MOFA Minister James Huang.</P>
      <P>It is the first time the MOFA has worked with a non-government organization
(NGO) on an "eco-diplomacy program, " Huang noted. He also thanked Taiwan
Sustainable Ecology Society (TSES) and Taiwan International Birding Association
(TIBA) for their collaboration.</P>
      <P>What Taiwan wanted to do for its allies is drastically different from China's
intentions, which will most likely entail throwing a large amount of cash for
"monumental projects" at its less-developed allies, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"China helped build a large sports stadium in southern St. Lucia although most
St. Lucians live in the north, and built a large psychiatric hospital for St.
Lucia which has no need of such a facility, " he said.</P>
      <P>"We [Taiwan] don't want to do that. Among other things, we are trying to build
community centers and help the country to improve its water quality, agriculture
and digital education. The idea is to make people's lives better, " Huang
stressed.</P>
      <P>The St. Lucia mission was a good start, and Taiwan will continue developing its
international relations through the application of its expertise in forms of
"soft power, " such as Eco-tourism, information technology and cultural
innovations, Huang said.</P>

expected to run out in less than three weeks, a Center for Disease Control (CDC)
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi said more than 57,000 people had been vaccinated
in the first three days since the free vaccinations became available to all
citizens Dec. 1, proving the popularity of the government-funded inoculation
program.</P>
      <P>Of the free shots administered to date, 54,900-plus doses were given to adults
and 2,100 to children, Shih said, adding that the majority of the recipients
were aged between 50 and 64. Most were residents of Changhua, Taichung, Taipei
and Taoyuan counties.</P>
      <P>According to laboratory influenza virus surveillance, influenza A is the most
common strain in Taiwan, Shih said, adding that this year's vaccine is very
effective in combating this type of flu.</P>
      <P>Noting that flu epidemics tend to peak between a week before Christmas and the
Lunar New Year holiday, Shih said citizens intending to receive free inoculation
should hurry up as there are only 490,000 doses left for adults and 150,000
doses for children.</P>
      <P>The free flu inoculation program was first launched Nov. 1 for high-risk groups,
including children aged between 6 months and 2 years, citizens aged over 65,
medical and health care professionals and poultry traders. With doses remaining
available, the program became available to all citizens Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>On reports that an occupational therapist in central Taiwan was suspected of
having developed atypical Parkinsonism after receiving a free flu shot, Shih
pointed out that several experts have confirmed it is not atypical Parkinsonism
and have ruled out the possibility that her symptoms were induced by the
vaccine.</P>

      <P>The first televised debate between ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and his main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
rival, Ma Ying-jeou, is slated to take place after the Jan. 12 legislative
elections, organizers of the debate has said.</P>
      <P>The six organizers of the televised debate -- the Public Television Service
(PTS) channel, the Central News Agency (CNA), the China Times, the Liberty
Times, the United Daily, and the Apple Daily -- made the joint announcement at a
news conference held Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Also present at the news conference were Hsieh's and Ma's top election campaign
aides -- Lee Ying-yuan and Chan Chun-po. Hsieh also attended the news conference
to accentuate his support for the planned debate.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, the two sides failed to reach an agreement on when the
debate should be held.</P>
      <P>The organizers originally planned to hold two debates, with the first one being
scheduled for Jan. 26 or 27, and the second one for March 1 or 2, said Chen
Shen-ching, deputy general manager of the PTS and convener of a preparatory
committee for the debate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh proposed that the first debate be held on the date chosen by the
organizers, while Chan asked the organizers to help negotiate between the DPP
and the KMT on selecting a date.</P>
      <P>Prior to the news conference, Ma had insisted that the debate be held next
February.</P>
      <P>According  to the organizers'  plan,  the two presidential candidates will
answer questions from 20 selected members of the Taiwanese public and from
representatives of local media.</P>
      <P>The 20 individuals will be selected from a Web site especially designed by the
organizers to invite the public to upload their questions in 30-second video
clips, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese citizens can also send their video clips on CD-ROMs to the
organizers, they said, adding that the Web site also allows the DPP and the KMT
to respond to the posted questions.</P>
      <P>In addition, the organizers noted that the 20 selected people will also be
invited to the televised debate to raise follow-up questions.</P>
      <P>Through the debate, the organizers said they hope that the two candidates can
take the opportunity to listen and respond to the voices of grassroots members
of society, rather than engaging in a smear campaign against each other.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Executive Yuan dumps casino bill</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
12/05/07  22:03:34
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Wednesday a raft of amendments to the Outlying
Islands Development Act during its weekly meeting, but a measure permitting the
opening of casinos was not included in the package.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said that the government has no plans at
present to legalize the gambling industry due to a lack of social consensus on
the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Shieh, the issue is by no means a simple economic affair, rather it
also involves legal and moral fronts. The Executive Yuan is not in a hurry to
legalize the disputed gambling industry before a national consensus has been
forged, he explained.</P>
      <P>Shieh also dismissed as sheer speculation that the Executive Yuan's exclusion of
the casion provision has something to do with the coming legislative and
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>The amendment package approved by the Executive Yuan gives the green light to
the opening of duty-free shops on Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands.</P>
      <P>According a United Evening News report, Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa
was extremely dissatisfied with the outcome and aggressively criticized the
central government for turning a blind eye to the need for economic development
on remote islands.</P>
      <P>Citing estimates by Penghu authorities, the report said that if casinos were
opened on the offshore county, it would generate NT$26 billion in tax revenue
per year for the county government, and more than NT$40 billion (US$1.24
billion) worth of foreign and local investment would likely to pour into the
county, it added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Ping-kun from the Penghu constituency was quoted in the report as
voicing a strong suspicion that the Executive Yuan dumped the casino bill to
slam the door on outlying islands so as to make an opening possible on Taiwan
proper in an effort to lure votes prior to the legislative and presidential
polls early next year.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions during a question-and-answer  session in October at the
Legislative Yuan, Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairwoman Ho
Mei-yueh said that the government will temporarily hold back from its plan to
promote the gambling industry before relevant regulations and laws have been put
in place.</P>
      <P>Despite the Executive Yuan's failure to pass the full bill, Lin, a lawmaker of
the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU), said that he is set to call a vote on
a similar NPSU-proposed bill before the Legislative Yuan adjourns its current
session in late December, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The NPSU-initiated bill to allow casinos on outlying islands has been included
on the legislative agenda, and the United Evening News report said that the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party is
willing to back the measure.</P>

How could American intelligence agencies have overstated Iranzs intentions in
2005 so soon after being reprimanded for making similar errors involving Iraq?

The spy agencies had swallowed hard and pledged to do better after a
presidential commission in March 2005 issued a blistering accounting of the
intelligence failures leading to the Iraq war.

But a National Intelligence Estimate on Iran that was issued two months later
said Iranzs leaders were working tirelessly to acquire anuclear weaponXa finding
that, like the prewar intelligence on Iraq, has now been acknowledged to have
been wrong in one of its chief conclusions.

The Wall Street Journal: Expectations Vary for Fed's Move

With their forecast of economic recovery again endangered by economic turmoil,
Federal Reserve officials next week are likely to deliver their third
"insurance" interest-rate cut this year.

How big a cut and what to say in the accompanying statement are likely again to
be difficult decisions, as they were on Oct. 31 when the Fed cut its short-term
interest-rate target to 4.5% and issued a statement suggesting no more rate cuts
were likely.</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan has nearly all it takes to develop top quality ecotourism, which is
expected to be a niche industry in the future, although there are still some
areas requiring work, a senior birder and ecotourism guide said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Bio-diversity richness; a well-developed transportation system; safety: these
three elements explain why Taiwan has been a popular destination for eco-
tourists from abroad, " said Simon Liao, Vice Chairman of Taiwan International
Birding Association (TIBA) who also works as a guide for eco-tourists.</P>
      <P>Liao, freshly back from a mission to Saint Lucia, Taiwan's diplomatic ally in
the Caribbean, to help it develop ecotourism and birding infrastructure,  took
time to reflect on Taiwan's own ecotourism on the sidelines of a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Not too many people are aware of that Taiwan has been doing well in ecotourism,
attracting mostly foreign birders, Liao said.</P>
      <P>The average expenses for a foreign birder for a 10-11 day stay in Taiwan are an
astonishing NT$ 230,000 (approximately US$7,094), Liao said, adding that he once
received a group of British birders who were charged 5,220 pounds (approximately
NT$348,000) each for the trip.</P>
      <P>"If you knew the business well enough, this would not be a surprise because
there are 'three highs' among common ecotourists: an advanced age, a high level
of education, and a high consumption capacity, " Liao said.</P>
      <P>Hardly anyone he has received in the past has complained about his experience in
Taiwan, Liao said, adding that most ecotourists came from the United States,
United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>"Of course, the most impressive thing they found in Taiwan was the extreme
friendliness of our people, which has long be known, " he noted.</P>
      <P>However, the bilingual services in cheaper hotels did need to be upgraded and
more professional guides were needed to develop a stronger ecotourism industry,
he said.</P>

Ying-huei said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang revealed the figure at a press conference TRA held at the Shulin train

The starkly different view of Iran's nuclear program that emerged from U.S. spy

      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) is working on plans to add three more
stations, including one in Changhua, to its existing eight stations, a task
force of the Changhua County government learned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The task force, headed by Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan, held a meeting
with THSRC executives and officials from the Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to discuss
whether the plan might be realized at an early date to meet the county's
development needs.</P>
      <P>THSRC executives said the initial planning of the three stations in Changhua,
Yunlin and Miaoli -- all in central Taiwan -- will be completed by the end of
June 2007.</P>
      <P>Hu Hsiang-lin, deputy director of the Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail, said the
MOTC would like to see the three stations to become operational at the same
time, and that the ministry will do its best to provide assistance to the local
governments.</P>
      <P>Currently the 345-km high speed rail traversing Taiwan's western corridor has
eight stations: Taipei, Banciao, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan and
Zuoying. After constructing three more stations next year, the THSRC plans to
build two more stations in Kaohsiung, the second largest city of Taiwan, and

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian asked officials of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) to work hard to win 50 seats in the upcoming legislative elections,
DPP officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The president also said that there will be no "pendulum effect" in the Jan. 12
legislative and the March 22 presidential elections, referring to the underdog
effect in which winning one election handicaps a party in the next election.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if the DPP takes 50 seats in the 113-seat legislature, it will
build momentum of the party, and Frank Hsieh, the standard bearer of the DPP in
the presidential election, will go on to win the presidency.</P>
      <P>The president was speaking in his capacity as DPP chairman during a regular
weekly meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee, the officials said.</P>
      <P>He also went out of his way to ask the heads of DPP chapters in Yunlin, Chiayi
and Tainan counties to work hard so as to ensure all DPP candidates in the three
counties win the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"If they work hard enough, the goal of garnering 35 regional seats will be
achieved," the president said.</P>
      <P>On the at-large seats, Chen predicted that minor parties will be unable to get
past the threshold of more than 5 percent of votes cast in the election to
ensure a seat, and the at-large seats will end up in the hands of the two major
parties -- the DPP and the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the president stated that the DPP seeking 15 at-large seats is
a "reasonable estimate."</P>
      <P>The president also said that the DPP has no money to buy votes and will rely on
an all-out effort to combat vote-buying after some heads of DPP chapters
reported that vote-buying is a serious issue in their cities and counties.</P>
      <P>A new "single-member constituency, two-vote" electoral system will be adopted in
the new legislature, with one vote going for individual legislative candidates
and the other vote going for a party. The new system is generally considered to
favor major political parties.</P>
      <P>The number of seats in the legislature will also be halved from the current 225
to 113, with 73 regional seats, six aboriginal representatives and 34 seats for
representatives of at-large and overseas expatriates.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of police officers from the central government and the Taipei city
government have been stationed in the the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Park square
to prevent supporters and opponents in a park plaque replacement dispute from
clashing with one another.</P>
      <P>The police deployment came Tuesday in advance of the Ministry of Education's
(MOE's) plans to replace the park's front gate plaque bearing the Chinese
characters of "Ta Chung Chih Cheng", which allude to the late President Chiang
Kai-shek, with a new one carrying the Chinese characters "Tzu You Kwang Chang, "
which translates as "Liberty Square," Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>The park, formerly known as Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park, was inaugurated in
1980 to commemorate Chiang, who has been branded by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) as a dictator and the main culprit behind a massacre
that occurred Feb. 28, 1947 and the ensuing "White Terror" during the period of
martial law under Kuomintang (KMT) rule.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has also sent its police officers in preparation to
arrest those attempting to make any change to the park, including taking down
the plaque, as the park has been temporarily designated by the city government
as an historic site.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Taipei city government filed a constitutional interpretation of
the Council of Grand Justices Tuesday evening in an attempt to safeguard its
jurisdiction over the park.</P>
      <P>Before the ruling is handed down, the central government has no right to stop or
abolish the Taipei city government's designation of the park as a historic site,
said Lee Yung-ping, director of Taipei City's Cultural Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks Tuesday at a press conference shortly after the Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) amended its measures for the designation and abolishment
of historic sites earlier in the day to deny the city government its right to
designate historic sites, including the controversial park.</P>
      <P>In response to the CAA's moves, the city government called an emergency meeting
to approve an amendment to its regulations, effective immediately, specifying
that any national designation or abolishment of the city's historic sites
approved by the central government  "will not affect"  designations  made by the
city government.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent ruling of the Taipei High Administrative Court, Lee said that
the Taipei city government has jurisdiction over the park, and has the right to
apprehend those caught tampering with the site.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the city government "is confident" regarding the future result of
the constitutional interpretation ruling unless "there is political
interference."</P>
      <P>After the Cultural Heritage Preservation Law was amended in 2005, Lee went on,
historic sites designated by the central or local governments came to enjoy the
same legal status.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the city government started a procedure in March to review whether
the park can be viewed as an historic site.</P>
      <P>During the review process, the park is to be regarded as an historic site, Lee
said, adding that the MOE must obtain approval from the Taipei city government's
21-member committee before changing the park's front gate plaque.</P>
      <P>However, the MOE has yet to file an application for the approval, according to
Lee.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, MOE officials said that the ministry will begin to install the
new plaque soon after the CCA amendments take effect.</P>
      <P>According to CCA officials, the amendments will come into force Dec. 6, three
days after the Executive Yuan published the amendments.</P>

      <P>The Military High Court under the Ministry of National Defense convicted Lt.
Gen. Cheng Shih-yu of two counts of embezzlement after extensive investigations.</P>
      <P>Cheng,  who has been  in custody  since  June,  was  the highest-ranking
military officer to have been prosecuted in recent memory. The sentence was also

the Army Corps' general administrative fees and additional administrative fees.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two counts of embezzlement were separate moves and should be
punished separately, military judges gave a 12-year prison sentence for Cheng's
embezzlement of general administrative fees and an eight-year prison sentence
for the embezzlement of addition administrative fees. But the verdict said Cheng
will have to stay behind bar for 16 years and six months for the two counts of
embezzlement.</P>

      <P>A former commander of the 6th Army Corps was sentenced to 16 years and six
months in prison Wednesday on charges of corruption.</P>
      <P>The Military High Court under the Ministry of National Defense convicted Lt.
Gen. Cheng Shih-yu of two counts of embezzlement after extensive investigations.</P>
      <P>Cheng,  who has been  in custody  since  June,  was  the highest-ranking
military officer to have been prosecuted in recent memory. The sentence was also
the harshest the military court has ever given in recent years. Cheng is
eligible to appeal the case.</P>
      <P>According  to the court verdict,  Cheng  had ordered  his subordinate, Chi Meng-
kuan, to falsify procurement documents to embezzle a total of NT$1.31 million in
the Army Corps' general administrative fees and additional administrative fees.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two counts of embezzlement were separate moves and should be
punished separately, military judges gave a 12-year prison sentence for Cheng's
embezzlement of general administrative fees and an eight-year prison sentence
for the embezzlement of addition administrative fees. But the verdict said Cheng
will have to stay behind bar for only a total of 16 years and six months for the
two counts of embezzlement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scores of police stationed at park over plaque change dispute</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of police officers from the central government and the Taipei city
government have been stationed in the the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Park square
to prevent supporters and opponents in a park plaque replacement dispute from
clashing with one another.</P>
      <P>The police deployment came Tuesday in advance of the Ministry of Education's
(MOE's) plans to replace the park's front gate plaque bearing the Chinese
characters of "Ta Chung Chih Cheng", which allude to the late President Chiang
Kai-shek, with a new one carrying the Chinese characters "Tzu You Kwang Chang, "
which translates as "Liberty Square," Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>The park, formerly known as Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park, was inaugurated in
1980 to commemorate Chiang, who has been branded by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) as a dictator and the main culprit behind a massacre
that occurred Feb. 28, 1947 and the ensuing "White Terror" during the period of
martial law under Kuomintang (KMT) rule.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has also sent its police officers in preparation to
arrest those attempting to make any change to the park, including taking down
the plaque, as the park has been temporarily designated by the city government
as an historic site.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Taipei city government filed a constitutional interpretation of
the Council of Grand Justices Tuesday evening in an attempt to safeguard its
jurisdiction over the park.</P>
      <P>Before the ruling is handed down, the central government has no right to stop or
abolish the Taipei city government's designation of the park as a historic site,
said Lee Yung-ping, director of Taipei City's Cultural Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks Tuesday at a press conference shortly after the Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) amended its measures for the designation and abolishment
of historic sites earlier in the day to deny the city government its right to
designate historic sites, including the controversial park.</P>
      <P>In response to the CAA's moves, the city government called an emergency meeting
to approve an amendment to its regulations, effective immediately, specifying
that any national designation or abolishment of the city's historic sites
approved by the central government  "will not affect"  designations  made by the
city government.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent ruling of the Taipei High Administrative Court, Lee said that
the Taipei city government has jurisdiction over the park, and has the right to
apprehend those caught tampering with the site.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the city government "is confident" regarding the future result of
the constitutional interpretation ruling unless "there is political
interference."</P>
      <P>After the Cultural Heritage Preservation Law was amended in 2005, Lee went on,
historic sites designated by the central or local governments came to enjoy the
same legal status.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the city government started a procedure in March to review whether
the park can be viewed as an historic site.</P>
      <P>During the review process, the park is to be regarded as an historic site, Lee
said, adding that the MOE must obtain approval from the Taipei city government's
21-member committee before changing the park's front gate plaque.</P>
      <P>However, the MOE has yet to file an application for the approval, according to
Lee.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, MOE officials said that the ministry will begin to install the
new plaque soon after the CCA amendments take effect.</P>
      <P>According to CCA officials, the amendments will come into force Dec. 6, three
days after the Executive Yuan published the amendments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President urges hard work to win legislative, presidential elections</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian asked officials of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) to work hard to win 50 seats in the upcoming legislative elections,
DPP officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The president also said that there will be no "pendulum effect" in the Jan. 12
legislative and the March 22 presidential elections, referring to the underdog
effect in which winning one election handicaps a party in the next election.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if the DPP takes 50 seats in the 113-seat legislature, it will
build momentum of the party, and Frank Hsieh, the standard bearer of the DPP in
the presidential election, will go on to win the presidency.</P>
      <P>The president was speaking in his capacity as DPP chairman during a regular
weekly meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee, the officials said.</P>
      <P>He also went out of his way to ask the heads of DPP chapters in Yunlin, Chiayi
and Tainan counties to work hard so as to ensure all DPP candidates in the three
counties win the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"If they work hard enough, the goal of garnering 35 regional seats will be
achieved," the president said.</P>
      <P>On the at-large seats, Chen predicted that minor parties will be unable to get
past the threshold of more than 5 percent of votes cast in the election to
ensure a seat, and the at-large seats will end up in the hands of the two major
parties -- the DPP and the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the president stated that the DPP seeking 15 at-large seats is
a "reasonable estimate."</P>
      <P>The president also said that the DPP has no money to buy votes and will rely on
an all-out effort to combat vote-buying after some heads of DPP chapters
reported that vote-buying is a serious issue in their cities and counties.</P>
      <P>A new "single-member constituency, two-vote" electoral system will be adopted in
the new legislature, with one vote going for individual legislative candidates
and the other vote going for a party. The new system is generally considered to
favor major political parties.</P>
      <P>The number of seats in the legislature will also be halved from the current 225
to 113, with 73 regional seats, six aboriginal representatives and 34 seats for
representatives of at-large and overseas expatriates.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall and its surrounding park will be closed to
public access from 9 a.m. Thursday through midnight Saturday, the Ministry of
Education (MOE) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the Taipei city government sent personnel to the
hall in an attempt to remove scaffolds erected by MOE contractors in preparation
for removal of a plaque referring to the late President Chiang Kai-shek branded
by some as dictator.</P>
      <P>To avoid any further disturbances, MOE Chief Secretary Chuang Kuo-jung said the
Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall, will be closed to the public for three days. But he added that entry into
the National Concert Hall and the National Theater, both of which are within the
perimeters of the memorial hall park, would not be affected.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-ping, director of the city government's cultural affairs department,
criticized the MOE's closure decision, saying the move indicates the ministry's
lack of "democratic process."</P>
      <P>The MOE and the city govenrment have been at odds in recent days over the MOE's
plan to replace the four-character "Ta Chung Chih Cheng" inscription  at the
gateway  to the hall with another four-character inscription that reads "Tzu You

      <P>There was shouting,  cursing and sporadic  shoving between inscription
replacement  supporters and opponents at the site Wednesday as a face-off

    <HEADLINE>President calls for end to deification of Chiang Kai-Shek</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday the dispute surrounding his
administration's plan to make changes to the main gateway of the former Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall involves the question of whether the country should
continue honoring a past dictator as if he were a god.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, those who are blocking the plan to remove a plaque and
inscription with references to the late President Chiang Kai-shek are not trying
to protect historic relics as they have claimed, but instead are trying to
safeguard the deified status of Chiang as well as the single party-state system
and the "great China" ideology that Chiang's name stands for.</P>
      <P>Chen addressed the issue in the latest issue of his online newsletter on the
same day the memorial hall -- which was renamed the National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall earlier this year -- was shut down for three days for the
renovation work amid strong opposition from the Kuomintang (KMT) -controlled
Taipei city government which has designated the hall as a historic site.</P>
      <P>The renovation work will involve replacing the four-character inscription
alluding to Chiang's name located at the top of the main gate with a new
inscription that reads "Liberty Square, " as well as replacing a plaque on the
hall bearing the Chinese characters for "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall" with a
new one that reads "National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."</P>
      <P>Accusing Chiang of being the main perpetrator of the 228 Incident of 1947 in
which thousands of people were massacred by KMT troops, Chen said it would be
"anti-democratic, anti-human rights and anti-Taiwan" if the country were to
continue maintaining a building honoring Chiang.</P>
      <P>Chen said Chiang's 25-year rule of Taiwan never received the consent of the
Taiwan people and was based solely on the illusionary "great China" ideology,
adding that Chiang viewed himself as the ruler of the whole of China and
considered Taiwan as just a part of China.</P>
      <P>"To Chiang, Taiwan was only a temporary stop where he could rest in preparation
for a return to China to restore a regime defeated by the Chinese communists,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Today, we have renamed the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall as the National Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall not only to highlight the Taiwan people's sacrifice for
and contribution to the pursuit of freedom, democracy and justice over the past
five decades, but also to reconstruct the Taiwan consciousness," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further said that while many relatives of the victims of political
persecution during the past martial law era are thankful to the government for
its efforts to compensate and restore the reputation of the victims, they remain
sad and resentful that the truth behind the persecution has yet to come to
light.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that the Democratic Progressive Party administration's
efforts to trace the responsibilities of the past dictatorial rulers are not
aimed at seeking revenge but at upholding justice for the victims and their
families.</P>
      <P>"Asking the victims and their families to look ahead and not back would be like
making them victims for a second time," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Preferential industrial land rent rate program bearing fruit: MOEA</HEADLINE>

      <P>Many industrial lands in Taiwan are becoming increasingly popular, with greater
numbers of overseas Taiwanese returning to invest in the country and with local
enterprises expanding their investment projects, a Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the business boom to the government policy that offers
preferential land rent rates in the island's industrial areas to both local and
overseas Taiwanese investors.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the MOEA launched the preferential land rent rate
program in May 2005, with the ministry allocating a total of NT$60 billion
(US$1.8 billion) in funds to subsidize rent in the first stage of the program.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics show that in the first stage of the program, 506 companies
rented a total of 295.55 hectares of land, generating investment worth NT$203.9
billion and creating 35,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Considering the favorable results of the first stage of the program, the MOEA
launched the second stage last year and increased the original budget from NT$30
billion to NT$50 billion.</P>
      <P>In the second stage of the program, 345 enterprises rented 295.25 hectares of
land in industrial areas, generating investment worth NT$152.01 billion and
creating nearly 30,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>In light of the favorable results of the program to date and the fact that the
funds for the second stage will likely run out by the end of the year, the MOEA
does not exclude the possibility of increasing the budget for the second stage
or launching a third stage, the official said, adding that Economic Affairs
Minister Steve R.L. Chen is asking related agencies to conduct a thorough
evaluation of the program.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government began Thursday to install roadsigns emblazoned with
the characters "anti-corruption democracy square" to rename a section of a
boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The new signs appear on the section between Kungyuan Road and Jinfumen on
Ketagalan Boulevard.</P>
      <P>The move gave rise to speculation that the city government is attempting to
confront the central government over its plan to expunge references to the late
President Chiang Kai-shek at the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall, originally
named the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall until the namechange this year. The hall
is located adjacent to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The city government, which has designated the hall as a historic site and wants
it left as it is, has traded barbs with the Ministry of Education (MOE) over the
removal of the inscription "Ta Chung Chih Cheng" on the gateway, an allusion to
Chiang, and its replacement with one that reads "Tsu You Kuang Chang," or
"Liberty Square."</P>
      <P>A city government official denied any correlation between the two issues.</P>
      <P>Emile Sheng,  director of the city government's  Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission, said the street renaming is to mark the International Day
against Corruption, which falls on Dec. 9.</P>
      <P>In addition, the city government passed a resolution in May to rename the
section of Ketagalan Boulevard  as "anti-corruption Democracy Square."</P>
      <P>"The construction work was set to start on Dec. 6 a long time ago," Sheng added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed concern Thursday over several journalists and
citizens who were injured after being rammed by a van in a scuffle that occurred
outside the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Chen condemned the violence and instructed law enforcement authorities to deal
with those responsible for the incident in accordance with the law, according to
Lee Nan-yang, director-general of the Presidential Office's Department of Public
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Wang Jui-chang, a photojournalist with the Eastern Broadcasting Company, a local
cable TV channel, was taking pictures of a scuffle between members of the pro-
independence group World United Formosans for Independence and protesters when
he was hit and dragged by the pickup van for several meters before being
rescued.</P>
      <P>Wang, who suffered a broken bone, as well as others injured in the incident,
were rushed to the nearby National Taiwan University Hospital for treatment.</P>
      <P>Reporters for Sanlih TV, Formosa TV and the China Times, as well as various
other people, were also reportedly injured in the ram. The driver of the van,
surnamed Peng, was taken to a police station for questioning.</P>
      <P>Crowds gathered in and around the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall after the
Ministry of Education announced a day earlier that it would be closed for three
days from Thursday for renovation work amid strong opposition from the
Kuomintang (KMT) -controlled Taipei city government, which has designated the
hall as a historic site.</P>
      <P>The renovation work will involve replacing the four-character inscription
alluding to the late President Chiang Kai-shek's name located at the top of the
main gate with a new inscription that reads "Liberty Square, " as well as
replacing a plaque on the hall bearing the Chinese characters for "Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall" with a new one that reads "National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall."</P>
      <P>The hall, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, was inaugurated
in 1980 to commemorate the late president. It was renamed early this year.</P>
      <P>The KMT issued a statement to condemn the violence. Huang Yu-chen, director of
the KMT's Cultural and Communication Affairs Committee, appealed in the
statement for calm and urged politicians to stay out of the controversy and
refrain from fueling further controversy for their own political gains.</P>
      <P>The Satellite Television Broadcasting  Association lodged a protest against the
violence. Members of the association urged the public to "show respect" for TV
reporters, who they said have tried their utmost to "safeguard the public's
right to know." They urged the public to stay cool, saying that reporters should
also be protected as ordinary people during strife and should not be the targets
of attacks.</P>
      <P>The Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ) also condemned the incident.</P>
      <P>ATJ President Chen Hsiao-yi condemned the violence and reiterated that
reporters' rights to cover the news should be fully respected.</P>
      <P>She added that the law enforcement authorities should have known that the
memorial hall could be a flashpoint when the renovation job kicks off and
claimed that the police have apparently not done their job in terms of taking
precautions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Chin-tien, head of the Chungcheng 1st Police Station, said that
after preliminary questioning of the van driver, it was found that Peng had "no
intention of hurting anyone" and that the case will be referred to the Taipei
District Prosecutors Office for further investigation.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted Peng as saying that he was driving past the memorial hall and was
slowed by the crowd when somebody -- identified later as a man surnamed Hsiao --
climbed onto his pickup and began cursing him. Peng said he was terrified and
sped up in an attempt to flee from the scene, causing his van to ram the
victims.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. opposition to Taiwan referendum could suffer backlash: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
12/06/07  18:08:32
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that U.S. opposition to Taiwan's plan to
hold a referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan
could trigger an emotional backlash from the Taiwan people and could be
unfavorable to relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had been informed that during a meeting with U.S. President George
W. Bush Oct. 28, Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi requested that
Bush openly voice objections to the referendum initiative or have the U.S.
Secretary of State do so to highlight the severity of the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the incident shows that Beijing has learned a lesson from
past experience and dare not make enemies of the Taiwan people by openly
challenging them, believing that it would be more effective to exert pressure on
Taipei through Washington.</P>
      <P>Despite U.S. opposition to the plan, Chen claimed that it would be "impossible"
for Taiwan to change or scrap the referendum -- slated to be held alongside the
March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving U.S. Rep. Eni Faleomavaega, who
was accompanied by Stephen Young, director of the American Institute in Taiwan's
Taipei office, who recently reiterated Washington's objections to the referendum
by calling it "neither necessary nor helpful."</P>
      <P>During a speech delivered at a conference held by the Foundation on
International and Cross-Strait Studies in Taipei Monday, Young said Taiwan's
presidential election presents an opportunity for Taiwan and China to set aside
past differences and work to create a new cooperative relationship.</P>
      <P>Young said Chinese President Hu Jintao's relatively moderate remarks on Taiwan
policy at the recent 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
indicates that "Beijing may be looking for ways to open contact with Taiwan's
next president."</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is imperative that Taiwan's politicians do not carry their actions
and rhetoric to the point of closing off future possibilities, according to
Young.</P>
      <P>Apparently responding to Young's remarks, Chen dismissed as "wishful thinking"
the belief that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume dialogue as long as
they put aside their differences.</P>
      <P>The fact that the government of Taiwan has been calling for the shelving of
cross-strait differences over the past seven to eight years shows that the
problem lies not with Taiwan, but with China, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible to expect the Chinese leaders to set aside major cross-strait
differences, especially to renounce the `one China' principle or the ultimate
goal of unification, " Chen said, pointing out that even his "five noes"
commitments put forth in his 2000 inaugural address failed to make Beijing agree
to resuming talks with Taipei.</P>
      <P>While the problem already existed during the rule of the Kuomintang, which
follows a "one China" principle and pursues ultimate unification of Taiwan and
China, the situation has become even more difficult now that Beijing has changed
its premise of "one China" from "Taiwan is part of China" to "Taiwan is part of
the People's Republic of China," he said.</P>
      <P>"Not even Ma Ying-jeou (the KMT's presidential candidate) and the KMT dare
openly say they accept Taiwan as part of the People's Republic of China," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen also said Beijing's plan to establish an air defense identification zone in
the Taiwan Strait will damage cross-strait peace and stability, and he urged the
United States and Japan to pay attention to the unreasonable Chinese move.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST) have
developed a new earthquake- resistant structure component for buildings,
offering an easy-to- install solution with improved protective capabilities,
NTUST sources reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Sheng-jin, a professor at NTUST's Department of Construction Engineering,
explained that the new component -- dubbed "low yield strength, energy
dissipation steel structure for seismic shear force" -- has proved better than
conventional ones in terms of seismic wave absorption and building structure
protection.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the new component can endure a shear deformation angle of more
that 16 degrees, far greater than architecture safety requirements, making
building structures secure during even great earthquakes.</P>
      <P>The NTUST research team is at present studying how to integrate the component in
shear walls, Chen said, adding that based on a prototype experiment, when
combined with high-strength beams, the earthquake-resistant design can hold a
building intact under a lateral displacement of six degrees, a figure also
better than the requirement of two to four degrees.</P>

      <P>Effective reporting and propaganda on climate change can help the general public
fight the battle against global warming, experts said Thursday at the Climate
Change Symposium held by the British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The BTCO organized the seminar with regards to the COP13 of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) &amp;the COP/MOP 3 of the Kyoto
Protocol currently being held in Bali, Indonesia, a BTCO spokesman said, adding
that the office would like to take the opportunity to establish a network with
the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration and other NGOs since
environmental issues play an important role in the British government's public
diplomacy campaign.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion,  Alex Palman,  the climate change consultant of the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office,  U.K., who developed  and implemented  the
Climate  Change  Communications Initiative (CCCI) , said that creating fear or
providing information alone is not the proper strategy for educating people
about climate change, adding that individuals should keep positive attitudes and
that everyone can contribute to mitigating global warming by changing their
behavior and way of life.</P>
      <P>Palman went on to give two successful examples of CCCI campaigns on climate
change, including the TV films My CO2 and the Climate Change Champions, both of
which he said can serve as models for Taiwan. The former shows that in response
to global warming, the general public can simply switch off unused electrical
devices or walk instead of driving, while the latter brings together schools,
community groups, NGOs as well as central and local governments for competitions
in taking anti-global warming action among youngsters.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Fiona Harvey, a noted journalist on environmental
issues and correspondent for the Financial Times, said that visualizing the
problem to the general public -- such as floods occurring more and more
frequently in the U.K., or dengue fever spreading toward northern Taiwan due to
warmer weather, is a good way of targeting the issue, since climate change is
more of a fact than theory.</P>
      <P>The media should avoid making its reports "scary reading" because too much
pessimism might make people give up making efforts to address the issue or cause
them to wonder about its credibility, she said.</P>
      <P>"There is optimism as well as gloom, " she said, adding that focusing on
reporting possible solutions and empowering people by showing them what they can
do is more important.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), called Thursday for calm among supporters over a dispute about an
inscription at the top of the main gate of the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall,
formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>In response to a Ministry of Education (MOE) decision to replace the four-
character metal inscription bearing Chiang's second name in the main gate with
another meaning "Liberty Square, " Ma urged "pan-blue alliance" backers to stay
rational amid what he called a plot by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration to create problems and make political gains in the runup to the
legislative and presidential polls of early next year.</P>
      <P>Although whether the inscription should be changed is worthy of discussion, Ma
blamed the DPP government for attempting to remove it in a "rude and
authoritarian manner" without exploring public opinion in advance.</P>
      <P>Claiming that it is absurd that the DPP government would tear down the
inscription after having appointed the memorial hall as a historic relic with
merely an administrative decree, Ma promised that if he wins the March 22
presidential election he will push for the restoration of the inscription
through legal and open means.</P>
      <P>The sealing of the landmark building for three days of renovation work has
sparked strong attacks from the KMT, which said the action fully reflects the
DPP's anti-democratic mindset.</P>
      <P>Countering the KMT-led Taipei city government, the MOE ordered Wednesday evening
that the compound of the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall be cordoned off from
Thursday to Saturday for the installation of the new inscription, which is
slated to be inaugurated Monday.</P>
      <P>Citing relevant regulations and laws, both the city government and the central
government claimed that each is entitled to oversee the monument's operations,
provoking confrontation between supporters of the "pan-green" and "pan-blue"
camps.</P>
      <P>The "pan-green" camp of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union views the late
President Chiang Kai-shek as the main culprit behind the 228 Incident of 1947
and the martial rule that the KMT imposed in Taiwan during the 1949-1987 period.</P>
      <P>The DPP has since early this year launched a series of moves to purge the
country of all references to Chiang.</P>

score sheet for the nation's economic performance.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) , made the remarks at a meeting of the Finance Committee of the
Legislative Yuan. Also attending were Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin and Lu
Du-ching, deputy director of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Jih-chu of the opposition Kuomintang said the government has
forecast that economic growth this year will hit 5.46 percent, while the
monitoring indicators flashed a yellow-red signal in October, suggesting a
transition to a more optimistic economic condition.</P>
      <P>In reality, Lee claimed, a survey shows that nearly 80 percent of the people
think the distribution of wealth has worsened and that the closure of
manufacturers has outnumbered the opening of new ones. Only 20 percent of the
enterprises surveyed said they plan to raise salaries.</P>
      <P>Lee said she does not think the government has falsified the indicators, but she
expressed doubt as to whether the scaling system is effective enough to reflect
the real situation.</P>
      <P>Ho said the CEPD reviews its economic monitoring indicators every five years and
that the present monitoring indicators were only adopted in mid-2007 after
careful planning for more than one year.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses a five-level spectrum to gauge domestic economic health, with blue
indicating recession, yellow-blue a slowdown, green steady growth, yellow-red a
slight overheating and red an absolute overheating.</P>

      <P>Noted lawyer Y.R. Lee Thursday called for tolerance for diverse voices in
Taiwan, which he said should be an open, democratic society.</P>
      <P>Lee, founder and partner of Y.R. Lee &amp; Partners Attorneys-At-Law, made the
call in a statement issued one day after his son, Lee Ting-chun, was brought in
by police for questioning after he gave a speech at the gate of the Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall concerning a Ministry of Education plan to remove the
name of the late President Chiang Kai-shek from the top of the memorial hall's
main gate.</P>
      <P>Lee Ting-chun was among crowds gathered in and around the Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall after the Ministry of Education announced Wednesday that the
memorial would be closed for three days from Thursday for renovation work. The
announcement came amid strong opposition  from the Kuomintang (KMT) -controlled
Taipei city government, which has designated the hall as an historic site.</P>
      <P>The renovation work will involve replacing the four-character inscription
alluding to Chiang's name located at the top of the main gate with a new
inscription that reads "Liberty Square, " as well as replacing a plaque on the
hall bearing the Chinese characters for "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall" with a
new one that reads "National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."</P>
      <P>The hall, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, was inaugurated
in 1980 to commemorate the late president. It was renamed early this year.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his son's being nabbed by the police and dismissed later the same
day, Lee said his son is a university student and an adult, who, like every
citizen in the Republic of China on Taiwan, enjoys a right to freedom of speech
according to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Lee said that  the people  have paid attention  to every governmental move and
policy. He called for members of all sectors in Taiwan society to be cool-headed
and discuss among themselves possible solutions when controversies arise.</P>

      <P>The mother of a Hong Kong student who came to Taiwan 10 years ago but had not
contacted his Hong Kong family in recent years, approached the Hong Kong Red
Cross Society several days ago seeking help in a search for her son, a source
from the Taichung county government said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Chih-chien, a county government official in charge of social
work, the Hong Kong Red Cross Society received a letter from the mother of Ching
Chikin recently saying that she received a letter in early October from a
Taiwanese individual who claimed that Ching had died Sept. 27 this year of
cerebral cancer.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong Red Cross Society then wrote to its Taiwan counterpart, asking for
help in a search for Ching. According to the Hong Kong Red Cross Society,
Ching's mother said the letter she received in early October was mailed by a
social worker named Chia Teh-hsin, supposedly from Taiwan's "Tzi Chin Hospital,
" which had cremated Ching, spread his ashes at sea outside the eastern city of
Hualien, and donated his corneas to a Taiwanese girl in accordance with his
will. Taiwan has no "Tzi Chin" hospital.</P>
      <P>Ching's mother told the Hong Kong Red Cross Society that Ching had not contacted
her for several years and that she had no idea where he was. She was suspicious
about the letter's veracity, which prompted her to approach the Hong Kong Red
Cross Society for a search for the truth and her son.</P>
      <P>The Taichung county government found out that Ching was born in 1974 and began
his residential registration in Linkou, Taipei County in 1994. According to
Taiwan's household registration data, Ching began to study at Providence
University in Taichung County in 1996. He returned to Hong Kong for a short
period in 1998 but returned to Taiwan to work after graduating from the
university. He remains on the Taichung County household register.</P>
      <P>In addition, the pronunciation of the name of the person who sent the letter to
Ching's mother -- "Chia Teh-hsin" -- sounds in Chinese exactly like "a fake
letter."</P>
      <P>The Taichung county official urged anyone who knows of Ching's whereabouts to
contact him on telephone number 04-2526-3100 Ext. 2728.</P>

      <P>Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-wey headed to National
Taiwan University Hospital Thursday afternoon to visit a reporter seriously
wounded by a van outside of the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>Wang Jui-chang, a photojournalist with the Eastern Broadcasting Company, was
rammed by a van while taking photos of a scuffle between members of the pro-
independence group World United Formosan's for Independence and protesters
demonstrating  against the imminent replacement of an inscription on the main
gate of the hall.</P>
      <P>The van also wounded four reporters from Sanlih TV, Formosa TV and the China
Times, as well as other citizens. The driver of the van, Peng Sheng-lu, was
taken into custody by police for questioning.</P>
      <P>Shieh condemned the violence, saying that no one is allowed to employ verbal or
physical violence against reporters, and said that the violence done to Wang and
others, is "intolerable."</P>
      <P>Crowds of people gathered around the hall after the Ministry of Education (MOE)
announced Wednesday a temporary closure of the hall, beginning Thursday, for
renovations involving the replacement of the four-character inscription reading
"Ta Chung Chih Cheng" with another reading "Tzu You Kuang Chang", which
translates as "Liberty Square."</P>
      <P>The MOE and the Taipei City government have been at odds in recent days over the
MOE's plan to replace the inscription.</P>
      <P>Shieh said the MOE has followed correct procedures since April this year in
preparation for carrying out the replacement, and that the Taipei city
government has put up "too much resistance" to the central government's
decision.</P>
      <P>"The Taipei city government will have to assume its legal and social

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new online information-exchanging platform dealing with epidemic diseases is
to open to the public in late December with the aim of reducing the time spent
analyzing prevalent virus strains and adjusting vaccines, National Yang Ming
University (NYMU) sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, the surces pointed out, World Health Organization would gather
virologists each spring to determine which influenza virus strain was likely to
be most prevalent in the coming winter; however, analysis of virus
characteristics and transmission patterns usually  takes a month,  reducing  the
time left for vaccine modification.</P>
      <P>However,  given this platform and a new analytical system developed by NYMU
researchers, the time for that analysis can by reduced to about one week, they
added.</P>
      <P>The platform, dubbed Epidemiology Net, and the system, are a result of the
project on Epidemic Disease Analysis and Virus Strain for Vaccine Selection;
they have been constructed by a team led by Yang Ueng-cheng, a biology professor
at National Yang Ming University (NYMU) ,  and  technically  supported  by the
service-oriented architecture of International Business Machines (IBM).</P>
      <P>Scientists from National Taiwan University, Soochow University, and Veterans
General Hospital also contributed to the network, and more universities and
hospitals nationwide are expected to join the effort in later stages.</P>
      <P>During the present, preliminary phase, most of the entries are coming from
Taiwan's Center for Disease Control and the Influenza Virus Bioinformatics
System (IVBS) run by another NYMU professor, Yang explained, adding that the
information sources will be much more diverse once the platform goes on-line.</P>
      <P>Currently, the platform will focus on diseases posing an imminent danger to
human health, such as bird flu, dengue fever, HIV-AIDS, and tuberculosis, Yang
noted.</P>

      <P>The Taitung County office of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) announced Thursday
that the party has revoked the KMT membership of Hsu Chih-hsiung, who is running
for a legislative seat as an independent in the Jan. 12 election against a KMT-
nominated candidate.</P>
      <P>Yanng Yuan-hsun, head of the KMT's Taitung County Office, said his office was
merely revoking Hsu's membership, instead of expelling him from the KMT, because
Hsu already renounced his KMT membership when he declared his candidacy Nov. 17.</P>
      <P>Hsu, 53, a former Taitung County councilor, is running against KMT nominee
Justin Huang, an incumbent legislator who is seeking re-election for a third
term.</P>
      <P>Although Hsu is seen clearly as an underdog, he has managed to get the support
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which has not fielded its own
candidate in the election. He has pledged that he will maintain good relations
with the DPP government if elected.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>European officials urged the Taiwanese government and businesses to start taking
pragmatic measures to tackle the climate change challenge as Taiwan's carbon
dioxide emissions are drawing international concern.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials and corporations know very well how serious the emissions
are,  and understand the linkages between those emissions and climate change,
but neither are taking action to meet the challenge, said Frederic Laplanche,
deputy head of the European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Neither  of the two leading  candidates  in next  year's presidential election
has put forward specific proposals to reduce Taiwan's high -- and growing --
emissions, " said Michael Reilly, Director of the British Trade and Cultural
Office (BTCO) in Taipei, in a conference discussing media coverage of the
climate change issue.</P>
      <P>"According to an opinion piece in a local newspaper last Sunday, Taiwan is now
the world's third highest per capita emitter of greenhouse gases, behind only
the United States and Australia, " Reilly noted,  adding that there has been
surprisingly little discussion of the impact of global warming on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which is not a Kyoto Protocol signatory and cannot be a signatory to the
successor to the Kyoto Treaty because it is not a United Nations member,
produces one percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials, including Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Minister
Steve Chen, did not refuse to tackle the issue during discussions with European
officials, but some government officials did speak against setting specific
targets for cutting emissions, said Edward Dallas, head of BTCO's political and
economic section.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan, especially businessmen and government officials, have to
understand that their actions to reduce emissions will have a short-term
negative impact on business, but in the long run it is something they must do,
Laplanche said.</P>
      <P>A possible carbon tax and an import ban on countries which are seen to be
"unfriendly to emission mitigation" will impact Taiwanese companies which want
to trade in the European market in the future, he said.</P>
      <P>According to an European Union (EU)  public opinion poll, approximately 87
percent of EU citizens are concerned with climate change, Laplanche said, and
that public support is the driving force behind the EU's determination to tackle
the climate change issue head-on.</P>
      <P>The EU has made a commitment to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at
least 20 percent by 2020 compared to its 1990 levels and a deeper absolute
reduction after the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012.</P>

      <P>The average employer expects new employees to display competence after nine
weeks on the jobs, but most of them fall short of the expectation, according to
the results of a survey conducted by an online job bank and released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The human resources company, 1111.com.tw, conducted the survey of employers to
learn their thoughts on the "readiness"  of new employees.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 28.06 percent of the employers expect new employers to be
in top form after three months, compared with 27.71 percent who said they should
need one month. On average, the employers think that it should take about 2.21
months, or 8.84 weeks for employees to display their personal best.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 85.44 percent of employers will consider "combat
readiness" when hiring new staff.  Among the qualifications considered, 43.69
percent said communication ability is important, followed by professional skills
(41.74 percent) , language ability (36.41 percent) , problem solving ability
(33.39 percent) and ability to work independently (28.77 percent).</P>
      <P>On a scale of 1 to 100, new employees averaged 52.88 after nearly one year on
the jobs, failing the passing grade of 60 in "readiness," the survey also found.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng voiced concern Thursday that a disputed
bill on the composition of the Central Election Commission (CEC) might cloud the
course of the Legislative Yuan's meeting Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to the draft CEC organic law put forth by the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , which has been listed by the Legislative Yuan's Procedural
Committee as the No. 1 issue for discussion during Friday's session.</P>
      <P>As the KMT-drafted law has met fierce opposition from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), which form the
"pan-green" camp, Wang said that he has asked the ruling and opposition parties
to instead negotiate the bill's passage and change the agenda of the Friday
meeting out of fear that conflict could erupt between the two sides.</P>
      <P>In response to Wang's remarks, Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and director of
the KMT's Policy Coordination Committee, said that there will be no change to
the agenda of Friday's legislative meeting and the CEC bill will be handled as
scheduled according to due process.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers have vowed to do whatever it takes to block the bill's passage.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Touh reiterated later the same day that all-out
efforts will be made to kill the "unconstitutional" bill despite the fact the
"pan-green" camp is in the minority at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The draft CEC organic law recently became the focal point of a verbal battle
between the DPP and the KMT after the organization decided Nov. 16 to adopt a
"one-step" voting format for the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative election and two
referendums to be held alongside.</P>
      <P>Stating that the CEC-designed "one-step" voting format would create procedural
chaos, 18 local governments controlled by the KMT said that they will insist on
applying a "two-step" format.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT legislative caucus is set to call a new vote on the body at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said in late November that his party would do its
best to push the CEC bill through the legislature before its current session
adjourns late this month in an effort to maintain what they called "fair
elections."</P>
      <P>The bill failed to pass the Legislative Yuan during its last session as a result
of the aggressive tactics of DPP and TSU lawmakers, including physical tussles.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng voiced discontent Thursday with the
central government over its failure to help boost local economic development,
despite the passage of an amendment by the Executive Yuan to allow the opening
of duty-free shops on outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved a measure Wednesday during its weekly meeting,
authorizing the establishment of duty-free shops on Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu
island, but failed to give the green light to a revision allowing for the
opening of casinos on the three outlying islands.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the amendment is merely an electoral gambit to deceive voters
ahead of the legislative and presidential polls early next year -- something he
argued is a far cry from a genuine program to address the needs of local
residents.</P>
      <P>Lee said the central government has been slow to live up to its election
promises, including President Chen Shui-bian's pledge to permit the opening of
duty-free shops on Kinmen more than seven years ago when he first campaigned for
the presidency.</P>
      <P>To effectively improve Kinmen's economy, Lee contended, the best way is to
expand the existing mini-links -- direct shipping and trade services maintained
between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands with three ports in China's Fujian
Province.</P>
      <P>He cited Vice President Annette Lu as proposing that the people from Taiwan
proper and China should be allowed to travel freely between the two sides via
Kinmen Island.</P>
      <P>Only crowds of people would bring business opportunities, and duty-free shops
without customers are a waste, he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, only certain categories of people, including Taiwanese business
people based in Fujian province and Kinmen/Matsu residents, are permitted to
freely travel across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Some deep-sea drinking water enterprises  claim that their products contain
micro-nutrients, and therefore cost almost twice that of normal bottles,  Cheng
said,  while adding  that the micro-nutrients cited by entrepreneurs may be
either unnecessary or present in only trace amounts.</P>
      <P>In terms of the pH value of water, Cheng said the standard range for pH in
drinking water is 6.0 to 8.5, as suggested by Environmental Protection
Administration.</P>
      <P>However, the survey found eight examples of bottled water with a pH lower than
6.0, with one even reaching 4.9, Cheng said, describing the taste of the latter
as like that of vinegar.</P>
      <P>Noting that water is only water, Cheng urged the public not to believe the
exaggerated marketing claims made for bottled drinking water.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Human Rights Jingmei Park in Taipei will be inaugurated Dec. 10, with
local political victims of the country's 38-year martial law period expected to
attend the inauguration ceremony, a Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Dec. 10 also marks the International Human Rights Day, the CCA
official said that the park will be open to the public after the inauguration
ceremony and will help raise public awareness of human rights in the future.</P>
      <P>The park was formerly a detention center holding some 130,000 political
dissidents between 1968 and 1987, the official said.</P>
      <P>During the 1970s, as human rights movements began to spring up globally,
international human rights groups became aware of the detention center and
started their long-term efforts to rescue Taiwanese political prisoners, the
official went on.</P>
      <P>The efforts also helped the international community come to know of Taiwan's
authoritarian rule and raise their concerns, the official said.</P>
      <P>In order to highlight this key period in Taiwan's transition to democracy, the
CCA has decided to transform the detention center into a park marking the
country's efforts to win recognition of human rights, the official added.</P>
      <P>The CCA will invite local political victims of a massacre that occurred Feb. 28,
1947 and the ensuing "White Terror" of the martial law period, and families of
the victims, to a series of activities at which Taiwan's  government  will
express its appreciation  and recognition of their efforts, the official said.</P>
      <P>After the activities, the victims will also be able to meet with their
supporters from Japan, Germany, and the United States for the first time over
the years, the official noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that the government will abide by the law
and accomplish its tasks.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came amid an ongoing dispute over the Ministry of Education's
(MOE's) move to replace the gateway inscription of the Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Hall, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall inaugurated in 1980 to
commemorate the late President Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>Despite   strong   opposition   from   the   opposition Kuomintang-controlled
Taipei city government, the MOE closed the memorial hall complex to public
access from Thursday through Saturday to facilitate renovation work, including
replacing the four-character "Ta Chung Chih Cheng" inscription with another
four-character inscription reading "Tzu You Kuang Chang," or "Liberty Square" in
English.</P>
      <P>The original inscription alludes to Chiang, who has been branded by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as a dictator and the main perpetrator behind
a massacre that occurred Feb. 28, 1947 and the ensuing "White Terror" during the
period of martial law under KMT rule.</P>
      <P>After giving a speech to DPP members at a seminar held in the central county of
Changhua, Chen told the press that he is gravely concerned about the dispute.</P>
      <P>However, he said that the government will absolutely follow the law in
accomplishing all it should.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a pickup van rammed into a crowd in a scuffle outside the
hall, injuring five journalists and several ordinary citizens. One
photojournalist was seriously injured and remains hospitalized. Anyone who
resorts to violence should be condemned, Chen said.</P>
      <P>During a speech given earlier at the seminar, Chen also spoke of the dispute,
saying that no one opposed his decision to rename the Presidential Office
building, formerly known as the Chieh Shou Hall.</P>
      <P>The name "Chieh Shou" was given in celebration of the 60th birthday of Chiang,
and has the connotation of "Long live Kai-shek."</P>
      <P>Now, the MOE is encountering opposition from those who are trying to defend the
"godhood" of Chiang and who are unwilling to see Chiang's divinity defied, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Citing another example, Chen said that the government's decision to change the
name of Taiwan's international airport in northern Taiwan from the Chiang Kai-
shek International Airport to the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport last year
also triggered protests.</P>
      <P>However, it only took the government eight days to complete the name change of
the airport, and the protests subsided, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed to Spain's experience as an example and noted that bronze
statues of Spain's previous dictator were all pulled down following his death,
which he said is what a country often does during its transition to a democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should contribute to addressing global warming: Kofi Annan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Thursday that although Taiwan is
outside the U.N. framework, it should still contribute to addressing the problem
of global warming.</P>
      <P>Annan  now heads the Geneva-based  non-governmental  Global Humanitarian Forum,
whose current theme is the humanitarian impact of climate change on the poor and
other vulnerable groups.</P>
      <P>In an informal meeting with members of the press in Geneva, Annan was asked by a
CNA reporter to express his views on the fact that Taiwan, which is the world's
22nd largest emitter of greenhouse gases, is not a member of the United Nations
and therefore not a part of global cooperative efforts under the U.N. framework
to fight climate  change,  and whether  the forum  can facilitate  the
participation of non-U.N. member states in the global effort.</P>
      <P>In response, Annan said that on the political side, Taiwan has been trying very
hard to join the United Nations. "You tried almost every year when I was there,
and I know the efforts continue with my successor, " adding that this is an
issue he would leave for the United Nations to deal with.</P>
      <P>"But on the substance of whether a country like Taiwan should become engaged in
both mitigation and adaptation, I would say yes, " he added.</P>
      <P>He further said that according to reports, there are over 200 countries, more
than the total number of U.N. members which stands at 192, participating in the
U.N. Climate Change Conference in Bali, Indonesia, because these countries
realize whether or not they belong to the United Nations or other world bodies,
"we are living in the same world and have the possibility to do something about
the environment."</P>
      <P>Annan added that in facing climate change, one can take the right actions to
deal with the problem without focusing on the issue of participation in certain
groups.</P>

      <P>The United States has an obligation to let the Taiwan people clearly understand
its position on Taiwan's planned referendum on applying to join the United
Nations under the name Taiwan, a U.S. State Department official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The United States has been doing so on various public occasions and will
continue to do so, said Thomas Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, during a press briefing with Taiwanese media
in the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>Christensen said he believes the U.S. move has been successful because the
Taiwan people have understood the position of the United States and are taking
it seriously.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the United States honors democracy and has no intention of
dictating  what Taiwan should or should not do, Christensen said the United
States respects the wisdom of the Taiwan people and believes they will choose a
policy that is favorable to Taiwan and cross-Taiwan Strait peace and stability
through the democratic process.</P>
      <P>Christensen made the remarks when asked to comment on issues surrounding  the
planned referendum,  including President  Chen Shui-bian's latest remarks that
U.S. opposition to the referendum could trigger an emotional backlash from the
Taiwan people and could be unfavorable to relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Christensen reiterated that both Taiwan and China should avoid taking any
"needlessly provocative actions" so as not to escalate cross-strait tensions and
that the referendum is just an example of such actions.</P>
      <P>While the United States is opposed to any unilateral actions by either side to
change the cross-strait status quo, the U.N. bid referendum is obviously
designed to seek changes to the status quo, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Christensen, the referendum is inconsistent with Chen's promise
that he will not change Taiwan's official name during his term, and by implying
that the referendum will provide the Taiwan people a chance to express their
opinions on whether Taiwan should unify with China, Chen is also going against
his pledge that he will not promote a referendum on the unification versus
independence issue during his term.</P>
      <P>Calling  the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party-initiated referendum "unwise,
" Christensen said the referendum is not only dangerous and provocative, but it
will also scare away potential friends who might help Taiwan, including the
United States.</P>
      <P>On Chen's claim that it will help prompt the United States to change its "one
China" policy  if the referendum  is passed, Christensen said the U.S.
government has no plans to alter the decades-long policy because it has been
proven helpful in maintaining cross-strait peace and favorable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to Christensen's statement, Taiwan's representative to the United
States, Joseph Wu, said China's continued isolation of Taiwan in the
international community is the main cause behind cross-strait instability.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that Taiwan is a democratic country and that its people have the
right to express their opinions through various democratic means, including
referendums, adding that the U.N. bid referendum does not involve changing the
country's official name or address the unification versus independence issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) apologized Friday for failing to deliver on
its promise to inaugurate one of the two lines of the mass rapid transit (MRT)
system in the southern Taiwan port city by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>At a news conference in the city, KRTC President Fan Chen-po and other ranking
officials gave a deep bow and explained why they will be unable to meet the
public's expectations.</P>
      <P>Fan said that the delay is due mainly to the fact that construction work on
barrier-free facilities at various stations and renovation work around the
stations have not been proceeding fast enough.</P>
      <P>As a result, the KRTC was unable to carry out the initial inspection as
scheduled on Dec. 7 in order to inaugurate the Red Line before the end of the
year, Fan said.</P>
      <P>He vowed to pull out all stops to complete the construction work, but he did not
say when the line will be inaugurated.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu has said repeatedly that the Red Line of the MRT
system, on which construction began in October 2001, would be inaugurated in
late 2007. But KRTC Chairman Lin Wen-yuan called on the mayor Thursday night to
report to her the reasons for the delay in inaugurating the line.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung MRT system's other line, the Orange Line, is expected to be
inaugurated in late 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will continue to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons based
on the Taiwan Relations Act as well as Taiwan's long-term defense needs, a U.S.
State Department official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a press conference with members of Taiwan media outlets, Thomas
Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
affairs, said that despite China's discontent at the United States' military
sales to Taiwan, the United States will continue to carry out this policy,  in
the belief that maintaining Taiwan's solid defensive capabilities is conducive
to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As to China's concern, Christensen said that the United States values and
listens to China's opinions, but it makes its decisions based on its own
assessment and analysis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Christensen expressed Washington's expectation that Taiwan's
presidential election slated for March 2008 will bring about a new opportunity
to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States supports Taiwan's democratization and shows no
favor to any Taiwan presidential candidate, he said the United States respects
whatever decision the Taiwan people make and hopes that the March 22, 2008
presidential election will bring about an opportunity for cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Christensen added that he has noted the remarks made by President Chen Shui-bian
recently that "cross-strait  dialogue would be impossible no matter who is
elected in the next presidential election, " but the United States stills
attaches great expectations that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will resume
the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue. He further said he encourages both
Taiwan and China not to forsake any opportunity that may lead to talks between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Beijing leadership to engage in dialogue with Taiwan's
democratically elected leaders.</P>

replace the inscription on the main gate of the hall.</P>

that  the city  government's  provisional designation of the hall as a historic

      <P>The upcoming referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the name
Taiwan will be a referendum rejecting  unification  with China,  rather  than
one pursuing independence for Taiwan, a Presidential Office official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said Taiwan
refuses to be downgraded to the status of being a part of China and will
continue to push for the referendum despite U.S. opposition.</P>
      <P>With 2.72 million people having signed the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
referendum petition, Lin said Taiwan expects 10 million people to take part in
the referendum -- slated to be held alongside the March 22, 2008 presidential
election -- and is confident that the referendum will pass.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in response to a statement by Thomas Christensen, U.S.
deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, that by
implying that the referendum will provide the Taiwan people with a chance to
express their opinions on whether Taiwan should unify with China, President Chen
Shui-bian is going against his promise not to promote a referendum on the
unification versus independence issue during his term.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that the referendum is part of Taiwan's democracy and is not to be

      <P>"This is an internal affair of Taiwan. We will listen to the reaction of our
friends but will not waver in our determination to promote Taiwan's democracy,"
Lin said.</P>

will continue to communicate with the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials reiterated that the U.N. bid

ministry will continue to communicate with the U.S. side to try to sort out

      <P>The government's efforts to create an English-friendly environment have borne
some fruit, with more foreign visitors expressing satisfaction  with Taiwan's
English-language living environment, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The number of foreign visitors giving a positive review of the government's
English-language  information  services  has  also increased, the official with
the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) said.</P>
      <P>The official was referring to the results of a RDEC-organized survey of short-
term visitors and long-term foreign residents to explore their appraisal of
Taiwan's English-language environment.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between July and October, with a total of 1,068 valid
samples being collected from short-term visitors and 1,080 from foreign
residents.</P>
      <P>Among  the  short-term  visitors,  61.7  percent  expressed satisfaction with
the local English-language living environment, up 3.8 percentage points from the
level recorded in a similar poll conducted last year.</P>
      <P>As for foreigners who have lived in Taiwan for six months or longer, only 39.7
percent gave the thumbs-up to the overall local English-language environment,
marking a slight increase of 0.5 percentage points from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Asked about their assessment of the government's English-language information
services,  50.3 percent of the short-term visitors surveyed gave a positive
review, up 3.2 percentage points from last year's poll.</P>
      <P>According to the RDEC official, all government agencies have made progress in
improving their English speaking environment. But he acknowledged that there is
still ample room for improvement in the private sector's English speaking
environment which foreigners tend to have contact with on a regular basis in
their everyday lives, including public transport, retail outlets and tourist
site services, to name a few.</P>
      <P>Noting that the private-sector English speaking environment has traditionally
received a low approval rating, the official said the RDEC will give priority to
helping the private business community improve their English literacy and
proficiency.</P>
      <P>In addition, the RDEC has launched a certification logo program for quality
English services. A total of 376 private companies, including therapeutic goods
shops, hotels, restaurants, food stores, taxi companies and businesses in other
related sectors, have been granted the certification logo to prove the quality
of their English services.</P>
      <P>Over the next two years, the official said, the RDEC will continue to promote
the logo certification program in the hopes that the number of certified
companies increases to 1,000.</P>
      <P>The RDEC is scheduled to hold an English-friendly environment promotion fair at
the Taipei World Trade Center Dec. 11-13. In addition to commending government
agencies that have made outstanding progress in creating an English-friendly
environment, the official said, a quality English services certification logo
presentation ceremony will also be held to honor private shop owners during the
fair.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative to Germany, You Ching, has publicly praised Germany's
"value-based" foreign policy and expressed the hope that German Chancellor
Angela Merkel can meet with President Chen Shui-bian in the near future.</P>
      <P>You voiced the hope in an interview with the Berlin Daily which was published in
the newspaper's Dec. 4 issue.</P>
      <P>You said that as the popularly elected president of Taiwan, Chen keenly hopes to
be able to visit Germany and other European countries either in his private
capacity or as Taiwan's head of state.</P>
      <P>However, Eckart von Klaeden, the foreign affairs spokesman for Germany's ruling
party -- the Christin Democratic Union (CDU) -- said Thursday in an interview
with "Deutsche Welle" (Voice of Germany) that because of Germany's "one China"
policy, a visit by Taiwan's head of state would be impossible at this time.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's upcoming referendum on the country applying to join the
United Nations under the name Taiwan, Klaedon described it as a move toward
independence and urged Taiwan to avoid taking actions that could fuel tensions
between the two sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He also reiterated that cross-strait problems should be solved peacefully.</P>
      <P>There has been a noticeable cooling off in relations between China and Germany
since Merkel met with the Dalai Lama in Berlin in late September, with China
canceling a number of high-level talks with German officials since the visit.</P>
      <P>Despite China's objections and criticism from within her own country, Merkel did
not regret meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader,  claiming  that doing  so
was in line with Germany's "value-based" foreign policy which includes
protecting human rights and safeguarding the country's economic interests.</P>

12/07/07  16:35:46
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung denied Friday that the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration has adopted a "closed-door" policy on cross-strait
relations, saying that the criticism was absolutely off-base.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a symposium on the 20th anniversary of the
inauguration of cross-strait exchanges, Chang said the DPP administration has
continued to guide the Taiwanese people to engage in bilateral exchanges with
their counterparts in China based on the principles of sovereignty, democracy,
peace and equality.</P>
      <P>Chang said that since 1987, when Taiwan cleared the way for its people to travel
to the Chinese mainland to visit relatives, cross-strait exchanges have
increased from "dots" to "facets" with massive numbers of people from the two
sides engaging in economic, trade, cultural and tourism exchanges over the past
20 years -- a development that has structurally changed cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Changes in the political climate within Taiwan and China have also resulted in
new situations in terms of the development of cross-strait relations, Chang
said, adding that in recent years, the DPP administration has continued to
promote cross-strait interactions on the premise that Taiwan's distinctive
identity should be its top concern.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in recent years, the government has opened the "mini three
links" between Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and China's Fujian
Province; allowed Chinese journalists to be posted in Taiwan to cover the news;
opened the door to Chinese capital investment in Taiwan's real estate market;
and opened four types of cross-strait charter flights.</P>
      <P>He quoted government figures as indicating that over the past 20 years, people
from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have made 47 million visits to the other
side, while two-way trade has topped US$640 billion and investment by Taiwanese
companies in China has reached US$62 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, Taiwan has continued to extend olive branches to China,
hoping that the two sides could resume peaceful dialogue, but the leadership in
Beijing has not relented in its persistent political, military and diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese  National  People's  Congress  even passed  an Anti-Secession Law in
2005 targeting Taiwan, which codifies China's long-standing threat to attack
Taiwan if it appears that Taiwan is seeking formal, independent statehood, Chang
said, adding that such unfriendly schemes have been major obstacles to the
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a public opinion poll conducted by the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation, Chang said that over 60 percent of Taiwan's
citizens believe that current exchange activities across the Taiwan Strait might
be detrimental to the interests of Taiwan, while 70 percent of respondents have
a poor impression of Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>Chang called on both sides to employ "a little more contact and trust and a
little less suppression and misconception" to improve bilateral ties, saying
that only by engaging in exchanges and dialogue with goodwill and sincerity can
a mutually beneficial result be created.</P>
      <P>Scores of China hands and geopolitical strategists from the United States, Japan
and the host nation, Taiwan, are taking part in the two-day symposium at the
Grand Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Straits Exchange Foundation, the symposium is aimed at tackling
issues including economic, social and legal relations across the Taiwan Strait;
cross-strait negotiations and dialogue; international factors involved in cross-
strait relations; cross-strait economic, trade and high-tech exchanges and
derivative problems;  cross-strait  educational and cultural exchanges and
derivative problems; as well as the prospectives for cross-strait relations over
the next 20 years.</P>

      <P>In response to a media inquiry regarding a news release from the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) , which announced Thursday a voluntary recall
of Starbucks coffee mugs with plastic handles and a stainless base, Taiwan's
Starbucks managers underlined that the problematic China-made mugs have not been
imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They added that many of Starbucks' products are only marketed on U.S. soil,
including the mug recently blamed for several minor burn incidents in the U.S.</P>
      <P>According to the CPSC online news release, the white plastic handle of the
recalled mugs, printed with "Starbucks" logo, can become detached when the mug
is filled with hot liquids, posing a minor burn hazard to consumers.</P>
      <P>Starbucks has received 23 reports of handles detaching from the mug, including
nine that resulted in minor burns.</P>
      <P>The CPSC advised consumers to immediately stop using the mugs and contact
Starbucks for instructions on returning the cups for a full refund. Starbucks is
also offering a free beverage as an incentive to have consumers return the
recalled mugs.</P>

      <P>The general public in Taiwan is most dissatisfied with the country's economic
rights situation, according to the results of an annual human rights survey
released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Taiwan-based Chinese Association for Human Rights,
targets 10 aspects of human rights: aboriginal rights, children's rights,
cultural and educational rights, disabled persons' rights,  economic rights,
elders' rights, environmental rights, judicial rights, labor rights, political
rights and women's rights.</P>
      <P>The survey has two parts: one carried out among the general public and the other
among special groups and elites.</P>
      <P>The results show that 69.8 percent of the public holds a negative view of
Taiwan's economic rights situation, and 64.6 percent of the respondents think
the situation is worse this year than last year.</P>
      <P>Among all aspects surveyed, only aboriginal rights and elders' rights received
positive ratings from more than 50 percent of the public.</P>
      <P>On the part of the survey carried out among special groups and elites, which
uses a five-point scale, cultural and educational rights received the highest
rating, followed by economic rights, women's rights, labor rights and
environmental rights.</P>
      <P>Children's rights, judicial rights, political rights, disabled persons' rights
and the rights of elders received low-to-average ratings, with aboriginal rights
performing most poorly.</P>

      <P>Many Taiwanese companies are accelerating their China-bound investment before

firms may no longer enjoy preferential tax rates, a government official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>According to an official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , China will
equalize the income tax rates of domestic and foreign enterprises starting Jan.
1, 2008, and will only offer preferential tax policies to companies dedicated to

      <P>To cash in on preferential tax rates currently offered to Taiwanese companies
with operations in China, many domestic firms are presenting applications in a
rush of new investment, or increasing their paid-in capital in their present

      <P>Only on Thursday, MOEA's Investment Commission approved a total of 15 China-

      <P>Taiwan's Taichung City clinched the 2007 World Leadership Award in the category
of arts and culture in London Thursday, according to the awards organizer.</P>
      <P>The World Leadership Awards were first organized in 2005 at the World Leadership
Forum in London. The awards are an instrument to identify exceptional leadership
in cities around the world and to inspire other cities facing similar
challenges, according to the organizer.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, at the head of a delegation of city government
officials, personally briefed those judging his city Thursday in an attempt to
ensure that Taichung received the best possible score.</P>
      <P>Taichung ended up beating Lima, the capital city of Peru, and Albuquerque, in
the eastern United States, to win the award in the category of arts and culture.</P>
      <P>Taichung captured the award for excellence in providing city citizens with
superb art and cultural facilities, as well as coming up with far-sighted
blueprints for encouraging such activities. Another reason for the city earning
the award is a staggering increase in the number of city citizens taking part in
art and culture events over the past five years, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>Expressing his pride in seeing the city earn this international award, Hu
reaffirmed in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency later the same day
that he will continue his efforts to promote arts and culture in the central
Taiwan city during the last two years of his tenure.</P>
      <P>Taichung is the first Taiwanese city to win the award since their inauguration
in 2005.</P>
      <P>The World Leadership Awards are presented to cities whose leaders have shown
phenomenal imagination, foresight or flexibility in a number of key fields --
especially cities that have reversed negative trends, thrown off traditional
images, and provided positive examples and inspiration to others, according to
the forum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC) member Chao Shu-chien proposed Friday
postponing two referendums slated to be held alongside with the Jan. 12, 2008
legislative election to avert chaos arising from the combination of the polls.</P>
      <P>Chao, a CEC member recommended by the opposition People First Party (PFP) , made
the comments in a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, he will propose, in a CEC meeting next Wednesday, postponing
the two referendums until Jan. 13 or Jan. 19 as a means of dissolving a fierce
dispute regarding the voting format adopted for the polls.</P>
      <P>Another CEC member, Liu Kuang-hua, recommended by the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) , has endorsed his proposal, Chao said, adding that he and Liu are set to
boycott the Wednesday meeting if his proposal is again vetoed by other members.</P>
      <P>The current 17 CEC members were designated by the premier and approved by
president -- a composition which is strongly opposed by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>As a more complex "single-member constituency, two-vote" system will be
implemented for the first time in the coming legislative election, the two
referendums should not be called simultaneously so as to avoid additional woes,
he argued, explaining that relevant laws do not mandate that referendums be held
the same day alongside a national election.</P>
      <P>In response to Chao's initiative, the CEC said it fully respects the rights of
any individual member to freely air his or her views.</P>
      <P>A war over the voting format has being raging between the central government and
KMT-controlled local governments since the CEC decided Nov. 16 to adopt a "one-
step" format, under which voters will receive two ballots for the legislative
election and another two for the referendums from two desks before casting them
into four separate boxes.</P>
      <P>The 18 KMT-controlled governments insist on applying a "two-step" voting format,
which would see voters receiving two legislative ballots and casting them in the
first step before proceeding to the second stop to vote in the two referendums.</P>

      <P>An education official suggested Friday that a referendum be held to determine
whether the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall should be renamed the "Taiwan

be changed from the original Chinese characters "Ta Chung Chih Cheng" to "Tzu
You Kuang Chang" which means "Liberty Square".</P>
      <P>Chuang Kuo-jung, chief secretary of the Ministry of Education, made the
suggestion after he was blasted for directing workers to remove the plagues
reading "Ta chung Chih Chen" and "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall."</P>
      <P>Chuang mentioned that the previous Kuomintang (KMT) government built the
landmark building in commemoration of the late President Chiang Kai-shek, who
was also the KMT's top leader, without consulting the people.</P>
      <P>"Since Taiwan is now a democratic country, we can hold a referendum to let
people express their opinions on the renaming issue, " Chuang said, adding that
the referendum can be held either alongside the Jan.  12 legislative elections
or the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Ministry of Education's decision to re-designate the building as
the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall'" and the change of the inscription on the
gateway to "Liberty Square" is aimed at highlighting the values of democracy and
freedom, Chuang said he will fully respect the outcome of the proposed
referendum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local human rights watch group praised Friday progress made in providing
better protection to new immigrants and HIV-AIDS patients, but criticized the
government's inaction on preserving a sanatorium in Taipei county.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Association for Human Rights made the remarks as it unveiled its
selection of the top 10 human rights news stories of 2007 ahead of International
Human Rights Day, which falls on Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>At the top of the list of 10 news stories is the government's foot-dragging in
designating the Losheng Sanatorium in Hsinchuang, Taipei County, as an historic
site and the preservation of it, despite the sanatorium's having applied for
such a designation since 2001.</P>
      <P>This is particularly ridiculous in light of the fact that the Council for
Cultural Affairs named the 27-year-old National Taiwan Democracy Hall in Taipei
City as an historic site after only a few days in order to give the central
government the upper hand in its dispute with the Taipei City Government, said
the association.</P>
      <P>The Losheng Sanatorium, a hospital for lepers, was constructed in the 1930s
during the Japanese colonial period. There have been ongoing debates and
protests over the government's plans to replace Losheng Sanatorium with a mass
rapid transport depot.</P>
      <P>Other human rights news stories include the recent passage of an amendment to
the immigration law which stipulates better protection for abused foreign
spouses and foreign laborers in labor-management disputes.</P>
      <P>The passage of regulations on HIV prevention and the protection of HIV patients
were also cited. The regulations protect the human rights of HIV patients,
expand their access to nursing  and protection to ensure the forced relocation
of institutions accommodating HIV patients will no longer take place.</P>
      <P>Other stories making the top 10 list are the leaks of the personal information
of tuberculosis patients barred by the Centers for Disease Control under the
Department of Health from taking long-haul flights due to a flawed computer
system and the indictment of several aboriginal people in Smangus in Hsinchu
county for picking up windfall wood, which is a tradition of the tribal people.</P>
      <P>Other human rights news stories include an immigration official abusing  foreign
laborers  in detention  centers,  closed-door environmental  protection
assessments,  the  retrial  of  the controversial "Hsichi trio" murder case, and
a second year in which the death penalty was not carried out.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top 10 is a "Taiwan Biobank" program launched by Academia
Sinica,  the nation's highest research institute,  in November, which the
association criticized for rendering people as genetic "guinea pigs" and
infringing on their privacy.</P>
      <P>The program targets the residents in Hualien and Taitung in eastern Taiwan,
Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan in southern Taiwan, and Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli in
northern Taiwan, and seeks blood specimens in hopes of unraveling mechanisms
responsible for the nation's 10 top causes of death and 20 major diseases.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in view of the two major elections to be held in early 2008, the
association has sent out questionnaires to all candidates taking part in the
Jan. 12 legislative elections and the March 22 presidential election to learn
about their views on such issues as aboriginal people, gender, immigration, and
environment, hoping to collect the information as a reference for voters in
making their choices.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has said that the open opposition of the United States,
the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia to China's misinterpretation of the
U.N. Resolution No. 2758 is "unexpected".</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Wednesday while meeting with permanent representatives to
the United Nations from Taiwan's diplomatic allies, including The Gambia,
Malawi, Nicaragua, the St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tuvalu, Belize, and the
Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen said that Taiwan's U.N. membership bid under the name
Taiwan this year unexpectedly resulted in the public exposure of China's
misinterpretation of Resolution No. 2758.</P>
      <P>China claimed that under the terms of Resolution No. 2758, Taiwan is a part of
China and, as a result, Taiwan has no right to join the U.N.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said that the 153-word resolution does not mention "Taiwan" at
all.</P>
      <P>"The U.N. resolution neither deals with Taiwan's representation in the U.N., nor
does it say that Taiwan is a part or province of the PRC," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Australia have all openly
expressed disagreement with China's misinterpretation of the resolution, Chen
said,  describing the disagreement as an "unexpected fruit."</P>
      <P>The disagreement further encourages the people of Taiwan in their belief that
Taiwan is a sovereign country that does not belong to the PRC, Chen said, noting
that there is no doubt that Taiwan has the right to join the U.N.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said that thanks to the allies' efforts to promote Taiwan's
U.N.-membership bid this year at a number of U.N. meetings, 140 countries took
four hours and 15 minutes to voice their opinions over Taiwan's U.N.-membership
application at a General Assembly session that held Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Offering his great appreciation for the allies' staunch support, Chen said that
Taiwan will continue to pursue U.N. representation.</P>

      <P>"The president will not be able to resist, deny or overturn the will of the
people," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the "U.N. bid referendum will not be retracted or changed,"
adding that he is confident that it will be passed.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to a U.S. official's remarks a day earlier that reiterated
U.S. opposition to Taiwan's planned referendum.</P>
      <P>Thomas Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia and
Pacific affairs, called the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-initiated
referendum "unwise." He also said the referendum is not only dangerous and
provocative but will also scare away potential friends who might help Taiwan,
including the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen said he "appreciates" U.S. concern about the planned referendum, which will
be held alongside the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Addressing concern in the international community about what "comes next after
the referendum," he said that it should not worry.</P>
      <P>"We only want to express to the world the will of the people of joining the
United Nations under the name Taiwan. We hope the world will hear the voice of
the Taiwan people," he said.</P>
      <P>On widespread international opinion that the U.N. bid might change the status
quo, Chen said the status quo is that Taiwan is a sovereign state and that its
sovereignty lies with the people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not part of China or one of its provinces, and the fact is now more
clear to the international community, Chen said.</P>

      <P>The overheated dispute between people with different political stances on a
gateway plaque over the past week should be brought up for public discussion,
said Kao Yung-kuang, the project leader of a comprehensive survey on human
rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kao, who is the dean of the National Chengchi University College of Social
Sciences, said he thinks Taiwan's political rights ratings can only be improved
through democratic  practices  dissolving political disputes through public
discussion.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks while releasing the results of the 2007 human rights survey
conducted by the Taiwan-based Chinese Association for Human Rights.</P>
      <P>The survey targets 11 aspects of human rights: aboriginal rights, children's
rights, cultural and educational rights, disabled persons' rights,  economic
rights, elders' rights, environmental rights, judicial rights, labor rights,
political rights and women's rights.</P>
      <P>Among the surveyed  general public,  42.3 percent  of the respondents  hold
positive views of Taiwan's political  rights situation while 36.8 percent thinks
the situation negative and 38.1 percent believes the situation has deteriorated
over the past year.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Kao said the survey shows that Taiwanese people recognize
the country's achievements in pursuing democracy and freedom and its efforts to
protect basic human rights.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that the country was seen to perform poorly in terms of equal
rights protection, assuming a neutral political stance, and maintaining a
separation between party and government.</P>
      <P>Kao said he thinks in a country with true democratic practices, a widely-
disputed public issue should be publicly discussed in an in-depth and
comprehensive manner.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the recent scuffle between the central government and the Taipei
city government over a controversial plan to renovate the main gate of the
National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Park, previously called the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall, in Taipei, Kao suggested putting the issue to a series of public
discussions as neither the central nor local governments are able to
unilaterally impose a solution.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court sentenced a woman to three years in prison Friday on
charges of extortion and intimidation against the late Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>Chang Yi-hua was previously sentenced to two and half years by the Shihlin
District Court on the same charges and Friday's increased sentence was the
result of her appeal to the High Court.</P>
      <P>The court ruling noted that Chang, in collaboration with her mother Teng Hsiang-
mei,  extorted over NT$200 million (US$6.17 million) from Koo and his family
between 1994 and 2004 by claiming that Chang was Koo's illegitimate daughter and
threatening to expose him.</P>
      <P>Teng was previously sentenced to five years by the District Court. Her High
Court appeal was suspended because she provided a medical diagnosis showing that
she suffers from chronic depression and suicidal tendencies. The court requires
further mental status examinations of Teng before resuming proceedings.</P>
      <P>Teng and Chang were both indicted last year after DNA tests failed to establish
any kinship between Chang and Koo.</P>
      <P>Koo was a business tycoon who led the Koos Group of companies from 1940 until
his death in January 2005. He also chaired the SEF -- a semi-official
organization set up to handle technical and business matters with China in the
absence of diplomatic relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A draft law regarding the composition of the Central Election Commission (CEC)
failed to be addressed in Friday's legislative session after the ruling and main
opposition parties agreed to hold negotiations on it in the future.</P>
      <P>According to Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
agreed to temporarily put aside the contentious bill drafted by the KMT and
negotiate it at some point in the future after spending an entire fruitless
morning session on the bill.</P>
      <P>As the KMT rejected changing the meeting's agenda, DPP lawmakers occupied the
podium and pushed Wang into a corner, totally paralyzing the meeting.</P>
      <P>"It is good that the two parties decided to stop fighting, as it is obvious that
the DPP will not allow the bill to pass the Legislative Yuan," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and director of the party's Policy Coordination
Commission, said that the KMT legislative caucus immediately canceled a
mobilization order of lawmakers after the decision was made to negotiate the CEC
bill another time.</P>
      <P>Later that same day, opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislative
caucus whip Lo Chih-ming  urged the DPP and KMT legislators to first address the
2008 central government budgetary bill and other issues key to the people's
livelihoods instead of wasting energy on the CEC bill.</P>
      <P>Lo also described their several rounds of physical squabbling over the bill as
merely attempts to make political gains, something he said has seriously hurt
Taiwan's democracy and tainted its international image.</P>
      <P>The KMT has vowed to push for the CEC bill's passage before the current
legislative session adjourns late this month after the body decided Nov. 16 to
adopt a "one-step" voting format for the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative elections and
two accompanying referendums.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the current 17-member CEC was packed by supporters of the ruling
DPP, the KMT put forward the bill proposing that the organization be composed in
proportion of the number of seats that each party holds in the Legislative Yuan
in an effort to maintain what they called "fair elections."</P>
      <P>The bill has repeatedly failed to clear the Legislative Yuan due to strong
opposition from the DPP and the TSU, which say it would allow for the
establishment of an "unconstitutional" CEC.</P>

      <P>The new "single-member constituency, two-vote" electoral system slated for
implementation in the Jan. 22 legislative election next year will squeeze out
small political parties and result in other negative impact, representatives of
two major political parties said Friday.</P>
      <P>The warning came at a seminar organized by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy
earlier in the day to discuss the new legislative electoral system and the
future of Taiwan's legislature.</P>
      <P>Under the new electoral system, one vote goes to an individual legislative
candidate and the other goes to a party. In addition, the number of legislative
seats has also been halved from 225 to 113.</P>
      <P>Lai Su-ju, director of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT)'s public relations
department, said at the seminar that the new system will make each legislator's
electoral district smaller than that of a city councilor.</P>
      <P>This will result in future legislators focusing only on how to satisfy their
voters rather than on reviewing bills and supervising the government, Lai
claimed.</P>
      <P>By serving their constituents, individual legislators will be very likely to
secure these votes, which will dampen the chance of new members being elected to
the legislature, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>To address what she described as a negative impact on Taiwan's democracy, Lai
suggested a limit on legislative terms.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lai said that under the new electoral system, it will be easy for
those nominated by major political parties to be elected, which will reduce
opportunities for diverse voices.</P>
      <P>She also expressed concern over whether only a few legislators will be able to
control the screening process of legislative bills under the new system.</P>
      <P>She also claimed that newly elected legislators next year will have a greater
influence in the following presidential election and thus gain greater leverage
with their parties.</P>
      <P>As a result, these legislators will not need to follow their parties' stances on
every issue like legislators at large do, and will enjoy higher autonomy, she
speculated.</P>
      <P>Echoing Lai, Chang Yu-feng, director of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) 's public survey center, said it will be difficult for small parties to
survive in the new electoral system.</P>
      <P>Only those that are very well-known or those that can win support from voters
will get elected next year, Chang said.</P>
      <P>If small parties want to win legislative seats next year, Chang went on, they
will need to work hard to raise their profiles.</P>
      <P>Chang further said that the halving of the number of legislative seats has also
posed a challenge to political parties, as many incumbent legislators who failed
to be nominated by their own parties as  regional  legislative  candidates  have
decided  to  run independently.</P>
      <P>These legislators, who have won many terms in the past, refuse to follow party
rules, adding uncertainty to the outcome of the 2008 legislative elections,
Chang claimed.</P>

      <P>The Health Bureau of the Kaohsiung county government announced Friday that it
will give free influenza vaccinations to local residents, including healthy
adults.</P>
      <P>Health officials said that about 51,000 people aged 65 or over and 6,800
children aged between 6 months and 2 years have already been vaccinated and that
the city government still has 15,000 doses of vaccine for adults and 8,700 for
children under 3.</P>
      <P>The Health Bureau will now allow members of the general public to get vaccinated
on a first-come, first-served basis, the official said, adding that children
older than 3 will be given adult flu shots and those aged 3 or under will be
given the child vaccines.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that fewer children were vaccinated this year than in
previous  years,  probably  because  many parents are apprehensive about the
controversial mercury-laced  preservative thimerosal used in the vaccines.</P>
      <P>Doctors, however, still recommend the flu vaccine as the single most effective
preventive measure against influenza -- one of the most lethal killers among the
elderly and the very young.</P>
      <P>Studies have shown that influenza vaccine is 70 percent to 90 percent effective
in healthy adults younger than 65. In people aged 65 and over, the vaccine can
reduce the severity of the symptoms and the risk of complications by up to 60
percent if they do get sick. And for those living in nursing homes or other
long-term care facilities, the vaccine is up to 80 percent effective in
preventing death from influenza.</P>

      <P>Foreign laborers' advocates are planning to hold a protest march in Taipei
Sunday in a drive to seek the right of foreign caregivers to have vacations.</P>
      <P>The "I Want  a Vacation"  march  is part of a three-day international conference
on globalization and the human rights of migrants being held by the Migrant
Empowerment Network in Taiwan (MENT) at National Taiwan Normal University. The
conference began Thursday and will run through Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to MENT, the march is aimed at urging the government to offer legal
protection to foreign caregivers in terms of working conditions, to ban private
labor brokers, to enact a state-to-state direct employment system, to allow
foreign workers to have the right to choose an employer, and to cancel work
period limits.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Workers' Association Secretary-General Ku Yu-ling said the
government's labor services have failed to cover the families employing foreign
caregivers.</P>
      <P>Some families that hire foreign caregivers refuse to give their employees any
vacation, claiming that they have no money to cover the cost of hiring a
substitute in their absence.</P>
      <P>Not every family that employs a foreign caregiver is wealthy, Ku said,
suggesting that the labor authorities  use its managed employment fund to hire
local people as caregivers who can be enrolled to substitute for foreign
caregivers when the latter are on vacation.</P>
      <P>The proposal would not only boost local employment but would also protect the
foreign workers' basic human rights, Ku noted.</P>
      <P>Sociology Professor Tseng Yen-fen of National Taiwan University said foreign
workers are treated as "machines" in Taiwan and their human rights are
neglected.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that this is why some foreign workers risk the chance of being
repatriated to flee from their employers despite being bound by a contract.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nguyen Peter Van Hung, the executive director of the Taoyuan County-
based Vietnamese Migrant Workers and Brides Office, urged the government to give
migrant workers the right to vote.</P>
      <P>Voting rights would give the migrants more power to fight for their rights, he
said.</P>
      <P>The "I Want a Vacation" march is scheduled to begin at 1:30 p.m. at the
Zhungxiao-Fuxing MRT station and end at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung described as significant and major progress Friday
that a detention center under Taiwan's infamous martial law era will be turned
into a human rights park later this year.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a press conference held at the Government Information
Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>According to Chang, President Chen Shui-bian will attend a plaque-unveiled
ceremony Dec. 10, which is also world Human Rights Day, to officially rename the
Jingmei military detention center as the Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park.</P>
      <P>The former detention center, located in suburban Taipei, is where many political
prisoners were detained and tried during Taiwan's 38-year martial law era.</P>
      <P>Chang recalled that when he served as lawyer for some of these political
prisoners, he had visited his clients at the gruesome detention center many
times. Chang said he still cannot forget it.</P>
      <P>After dedicating himself to promoting Taiwan's democracy for nearly 30 years,
Chang said he finally understands that the country's democracy was gained by
many people with their lives and their blood.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Shieh Jhy-wey, who was also present at the press conference, noted
that martial law era survivors continue the sparkle of Taiwan's democracy so
that their next generations can breathe the air of freedom.</P>
      <P>Peng Ming-min,  an ex-DPP presidential  candidate  who now represents the human
rights park administration, noted that the Jingmei detention  center is a symbol
of the KMT's political persecution and has become a taboo for many people.</P>
      <P>Peng said he was glad to see that the fear of the center will soon become the
"hope" for Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Klaus Walter, a section chief of Amnesty International Germany, who was also
present, said Taiwan has now marched toward democracy, but noted that there is
still room for the Taiwan people to do better, for example by abolishing the
death penalty and showing more concern for the human rights situation in
Myanmar.</P>

      <P>Although systematic dialogue between Taiwan and China have been suspended for
years, an academic said Friday that rekindling cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations
is feasible.</P>
      <P>the expert made the forecast in a seminar sponsored by the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) to mark the 20th anniversary of the start of cross-
strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-cheng, a professor at National Sun Yet-sen University, predicted that
Taiwan and China will eventually restart bilateral negotiations due to strong
public demand on both sides thanks to increased cross-strait exchanges over the
past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese government first allowed veterans to visit their homes in China in
1987 after scrapping martial law that same year, marking the start of cross-
strait activities following the civil war that caused the Kuomintang to flee to
Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>Although the chances of Taiwan and China resuming bilateral talks seem slim at
present as a result of their own political concerns, Lin said the two sides have
been waiting for an opportune time to do so. As to the question of when the two
sides will re-open dialogue or whether they will obtain concrete results, Lin
said that this will depend on political considerations.</P>
      <P>"A strong public demand arising from growing exchanges across the strait will
continue pushing the respective governments to halt political manipulation and
re-open institutionalized talks as soon as possible, " Lin said, adding that
"this is an irreversible trend" despite the current impasse.</P>
      <P>The SEF is responsible for Taiwan's dealings with China in the absence of
government-to-government contacts between the two sides over the past decades.
Its Chinese counterpart is the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>A construction project to replace the gateway arch inscriptions of the Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall Friday drew mixed reactions from rival groups who had to
be separated by riot police under the archway.</P>
      <P>During the replacement process, opponents of the Ministry of Education's (MOE's)
move to remove inscriptions reading "Ta Chong Chih Cheng" -- which alludes to
the late President Chiang Kai-shek -- continued to sing songs in memory of
Chiang and chant "Defend the Republic of China" and "Long live the Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>In contrast, proponents of the MOE's action gave loud rounds of applause and
cheered to celebrate the removal of the inscriptions.</P>
      <P>It took the workers seven hours to remove the four Chinese characters that made
up the inscription.</P>
      <P>The construction workers were expected to erect a new inscription reading "Tzu
You Kuang Chang," or "Liberty Square" Saturday.</P>
      <P>The hall, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, was inaugurated
in 1980 to commemorate Chiang.</P>
      <P>Chiang has been branded by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as a

      <P>Old Taiwanese people enjoy much higher frequency of exercise than their younger
counterparts, with one out of four elderly people enjoying established sports
habits,  a researcher of the National Health Research Institute said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wen Chi-pang said 50 percent of Taiwanese people interviewed for a survey
admitted that they do not like to exercise, citing results of a survey on
exercise habits that started in 2001.</P>
      <P>Wen said 75 percent of the population do not get sufficient exercise, if those
who burn less than 500 calories through exercise per week are added to the 50
percent of people who take no exercise at all. "Those who think they take
physical exercise are not necessarily burning enough calories," Wen noted.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that only one seventh of the males and one tenth of the
females surveyed burn more than 750 calories per week during exercise, which is
the median amount suggested by the U.S. Center for Disease and Prevention.</P>
      <P>Nearly 8 million young people with higher education and high income comprise the
group that gets the least exercise, Wen said, citing the survey results.</P>
      <P>To reach the standard for calories burned, Wen suggested that people do sports
such as cycling, fast walking, hiking, ballroom dancing or swimming for 30
minutes a day until panting and five days a week. About 20 minutes per day and
three days a week will be enough for exercise that causes people to pant
heavily, Wen said.</P>
      <P>For gentler sports such as waitankun, taichi, yuanchi dance, Falun Gong exercise
and walking, exercise frequency will have to be increased to meet the standard,
Wen said.</P>
      <P>The elderly tend to exercise more because they have more free time and realize
the benefits of exercise from experience, Wen said. He encouraged young people
to engage in more physical activities.</P>

approvals and disapprovals of the subjects. When there is no such understanding,
then the good will not be discovered and rewarded and the bad will not be
punished."</TEXT>

      <P>A construction project to replace the gateway arch inscriptions of the Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall Friday drew mixed reactions from rival groups who had to
be separated by riot police under the archway.</P>
      <P>During the replacement process, opponents of the Ministry of Education's (MOE's)
move to remove inscriptions reading "Ta Chong Chih Cheng" -- which alludes to
the late President Chiang Kai-shek -- continued to sing songs in memory of
Chiang and chant "Defend the Republic of China" and "Long live the Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>In contrast, proponents of the MOE's action gave loud rounds of applause and
cheered to celebrate the removal of the inscriptions.</P>
      <P>It took the workers seven hours to remove the four Chinese characters that made
up the inscription.</P>
      <P>The construction workers were expected to erect a new inscription reading "Tzu
You Kuang Chang," or "Liberty Square" Saturday.</P>
      <P>The hall, formerly known as the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, was inaugurated
in 1980 to commemorate Chiang.</P>
      <P>Chiang has been branded by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as a
dictator and the main culprit behind a massacre that occurred Feb. 28, 1947 and
the ensuing "White Terror" during the period of martial law under Kuomintang

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung described as significant and major progress Friday
that a detention center under Taiwan's infamous martial law era will be turned
into a human rights park later this year.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a press conference held at the Government Information
Office (GIO).</P>
      <P>According to Chang, President Chen Shui-bian will attend a plaque-unveiled
ceremony Dec. 10, which is also world Human Rights Day, to officially rename the
Jingmei military detention center as the Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park.</P>
      <P>The former detention center, located in suburban Taipei, is where many political
prisoners were detained and tried during Taiwan's 38-year martial law era.</P>
      <P>Chang recalled that when he served as lawyer for some of these political
prisoners, he had visited his clients at the gruesome detention center many
times. Chang said he still cannot forget it.</P>
      <P>After dedicating himself to promoting Taiwan's democracy for nearly 30 years,
Chang said he finally understands that the country's democracy was gained by
many people with their lives and their blood.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Shieh Jhy-wey, who was also present at the press conference, noted
that martial law era survivors continue the sparkle of Taiwan's democracy so
that their next generations can breathe the air of freedom.</P>
      <P>Peng Ming-min,  an ex-DPP presidential  candidate  who now represents the human
rights park administration, noted that the Jingmei detention  center is a symbol
of the KMT's political persecution and has become a taboo for many people.</P>
      <P>Peng said he was glad to see that the fear of the center will soon become the
"hope" for Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Klaus Walter, a section chief of Amnesty International Germany, who was also
present, said Taiwan has now marched toward democracy, but noted that there is
still room for the Taiwan people to do better, for example by abolishing the
death penalty and showing more concern for the human rights situation in
Myanmar.</P>

merchant vessels totalling 24.858 million deadweight tons (dwt) in 2006, up
approximately 470,000 dwt compared with 2005.</P>

      <P>Coast guard officers boarded a fishing boat Friday night, discovering a victim
of illegal hunting, a whale shark, which had been cut up into several parts, a
spokesman for the Eastern Coastal Patrol Office (ECPO) said Saturday in Taitung
County.</P>
      <P>Although whale sharks are not on the list of protected animals in Taiwan, the
Fisheries Agency began in 2001 to control the number of whale sharks that could
be caught after discovering that whale shark numbers off the island's eastern
coast had dropped dramatically due to overhunting.</P>
      <P>In that year, an annual quota was set, which has since undergone review and
adjustment by the agency every year. This year, the whale shark hunting quota
was set at 30, or half the level for 2006.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the 2007 quota was reached in July. On Nov. 1, a ban on
whale shark hunting took effect, and it will remain in place until the end of
the year, he noted.</P>
      <P>The skipper of the fishing boat, which operates out of the Fukang fishing port
in the eastern county of Taitung, confessed to illegal whale shark hunting, the
spokesman said, adding that the case has been handed over to local prosecutors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the international community Saturday to pay
attention to China's military threat against Taiwan, its attempts to
diplomatically isolate the country, and its "united front" tactics.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan and China are two separate countries independent of each
other, Chen called on the world to support Taiwan's bid to join international
organizations so as to allow Taiwan to assume its responsibility as a member of
the international community.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing a conference on human rights held in
Taipei by the Liberal International,  a world federation of liberal political
parties.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that both the Liberal International and the Council of Asian Liberals
and Democrats have contributed positively to the deepening of Taiwan's democracy
by speaking up for Taiwan whenever the country suffers unreasonable suppression
by China.</P>
      <P>Also, many members of the Liberal International have openly expressed their
concerns over cross-Taiwan Strait security and China's military threat against
Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has been intensifying its efforts to suppress Taiwan's
international participation in recent years, Chen said Beijing is not only
blocking Taiwan's participation in international organizations where statehood
is required for membership but is also barring Taiwan's participation in non-
governmental organizations.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is not only suppressing Taiwan, it is also suppressing Taiwan's
friends," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In one of the most vivid examples, Chen said, China has attempted through
manipulation  to revoke  the  Liberal  International's consultative status
within the United Nations in retaliation against the group's support for
Taiwan's bid to gain membership in the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>In yet another example, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon denied Taiwan's right
to take part in the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women earlier this year based on U.N. Resolution 2758,
which Ban claimed recognizes "Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China,"
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan, having experienced 38 years of martial law under the
Kuomintang regime, deeply realizes the importance of human rights.</P>
      <P>Stressing that no country should be allowed to resort to violent or non-peaceful
means to crack down on its own people or intimidate other countries in a
civilized world, Chen asked the international community to pay more attention to
China's dictatorship and notorious human right records.</P>

      <P>The combined turnover at Taiwan's five free trade port zones reached NT$43.76
billion (US$1.35 billion) for the first 10 months of this year, marking a three-
fold increase over the figure for the same period in 2006, Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The achievement marks a success in the government's free trade port zone policy,
which the government began to carry out in 2005 at the free trade zones located
at Keelung Harbor, Taipei Harbor, Taichung  Harbor,  Kaohsiung  Harbor  and  the
Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport, the officials said.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Minister Thomas M.F. Yeh attributed the success to the government's
relaxation of restrictions that he said had been hindering cargo from being
freely shipped into and out of the free trade zones.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus for the first 11 months of this year hit a record high
for the period, thanks to brisk exports, according to the latest tallies
released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the Jan.-Dec. period, Taiwan's exports amounted to US$223.25 billion, while
its imports amounted to US$198.08 billion, for a trade surplus of US$25.17
billion for the period, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>The trade surplus for the January-November period this year is already higher
than the previous record of US$22.59 billion for the whole of 2003, financial
officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the large surplus to brisk exports, coupled with the
relatively low annual increase in imports. The annual increase in imports over
the past four years averaged around 10 percent, but the increase this year was
only 6.8 percent, they noted.</P>
      <P>In November, exports amounted to US$21.85 billion, while imports amounted to
US$17.59 billion, for a trade surplus of US$4.26 billion for the month, also a
record single month high.</P>
      <P>November exports and imports increased by 11.8 percent and 2.8 percent,
respectively, year-on-year, mainly because exports to six nations of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the
Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam -- increased by 23.3 percent, and exports to
mainland China, the United States, and South Korea also increased by 14.2
percent, 6.1 percent, and 19.5 percent, respectively, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although imports from China, the Middle East, Africa an India
increased by 5.7 percent, 25.8 percent, 130.6 percent and 189.3 percent,
respectively, in November, imports from the United States, Japan and South Korea
were down by 6.3 percent, 6.7 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively, the
officials said.</P>

      <P>A total of 291 people phoned social workers at the Changhua county government
for urgent aid via the "1957 national welfare care hotline" between November
2006 and November this year, an official at the county's Bureau of Social
Affairs said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Fang-yu, head of the bureau's social aid office, said 60 percent of the
calls were for emergency aid, and 25 percent were for urgently needed medical
treatment subsidies.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior activated the "1957 hotline" service Nov. 17, 2006.
People facing dire problems in their life or those confronted with life-
challenging accidents can phone county social workers for help via the hotline.</P>
      <P>The governmental  aid services  include  emergency  relief, short-term
accommodation, financial assistance for urgent medical treatment, as well as
employment aid.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that although the hotline is open to anyone who needs help, most of the
people who call ask for cash relief and seem reluctant to receive other kinds of
assistance, such as in the area of education and employment.</P>
      <P>The hotline service is part of the central government's "Mega Warmth"  social
welfare program aimed at helping disadvantaged families escape poverty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday that two bone fragments were found
in a shipment of imported U.S. beef, marking the third such case within the last
two weeks.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ting-hung, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Safety, said that
the beef was from Colorado-based Swift Beef Co., which has been banned by the
DOH from shipping its products to Taiwan since Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>However, he said that beef in question was already on its way to Taiwan in mid-
November, so the DOH accepted the application for inspection from the Taipei
importer.</P>
      <P>The two pieces of bone fragments measure 2.4 centimeters and 4.8 centimeters in
size, respectively Hsieh said, adding that the importer will now have to send
back or destroy the shipment.</P>
      <P>Two bone fragments were also found in a Swift Beef Co. shipment in late
November. Earlier, Cargill of Nebraska was also banned from shipping its
products to Taiwan for the same reason.</P>
      <P>The number of U.S. beef packaging houses allowed to export their products to
Taiwan now stands at 44.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned beef imports from the United States in December 2003 after the

      <P>In April 2005, Taiwan lifted an import ban on U.S. boneless beef from animals
under 30 months of age but then suspended American beef imports again on June 25

United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lifted the second ban on Jan. 25, 2006, but in April 2006, Taiwan found

    <HEADLINE>Domestic gravel prices to remain stable next year: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
12/08/07  21:14:52

    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic gravel prices are not expected to drop substantially next year even if
China resumes exports of this critical construction material to Taiwan, a
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to an MOEA estimate, Taiwan will need 60 million cubic meters of
gravel next year, of which 55 million cubic meters can be satisfied with
domestic supplies, the official said, adding that the shortfall will be covered
by imports from the Philippines, Vietnam and North Korea.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has forged cooperative ties with Philippine, Vietnamese and
North Korean gravel suppliers since China suspended pebble exports to Taiwan
earlier this year, the official said gravel imports from the three countries are
expected to continue next year.</P>
      <P>Between May and November, Taiwan imported 167,000 tons of gravel from the
Philippines, 340,000 tons from Vietnam and 89,000 tons from North Korea, the
official said.</P>
      <P>With a view to ensuring steady gravel supply, the government has encouraged
local companies to launch investment projects in the Philippines for gravel
production, the official said, adding that four or five Taiwan-funded gravel
plants in that country are scheduled to begin mass production in January 2008.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, the official said, gravel imports from the Philippines alone
could reach 5 million tons next year.</P>
      <P>Since the government launched a NT$60 per ton freight subsidy program for gravel
imports from countries other than China in May, about 600,000 tons of gravel had
been imported under the program as of the end of November, the official said,
adding that the subsidy program will remain in place next year.</P>
      <P>As to gravel prices, the official said, domestic gravel prices saw a 20 percent
rise between January and March following China's announcement at the beginning
of the year that its gravel exports to Taiwan would be suspended from March.</P>
      <P>"The sharp rise during that period was mainly fanned  by psychological factors,
" the official said, noting that "since the government adopted a number of
measures, including offering freight subsidies for gravel imports from markets
outside China, domestic gravel supplies have returned to normal and prices have
gradually stabilized."</P>
      <P>"The average gravel price has been rising by just about 1percent since April. We
believe that this stable situation will remain unchanged next year, " he added..</P>
      <P>As to reports that China will resume gravel exports to Taiwan soon, the official
said the government would be pleased if China were to lift its export ban on a
reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan has never banned gravel imports from China, the
official said no negotiations or consultations are needed for resumption of
entry of gravel from China. "So long as China lifts its export ban, its gravel
can enter Taiwan accordingly, " the official noted.</P>
      <P>Sources close to local gravel traders associations said Chinese authorities
have begun tackling certain technical  details in preparation for resuming
gravel exports to Taiwan, but they added that no definite timetable is available
yet.</P>
      <P>The MOEA official said that even if China resumes gravel exports to Taiwan,
domestic gravel prices will remain almost the same, given the current stable
market supply and demand situation.</P>

12/08/07  21:18:40
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged the public Saturday to drink less bottled water
or stop drinking it altogether as part of efforts to save the planet from global
warming.</P>
      <P>Lu made the call at a rally organized by environmental protection activists at
the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The rally was part of an "Anti-Global Warming" parade launched by environmental
protection groups, including the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU)
and the Society of Wilderness, with the aim of raising public awareness of the
pollution crisis threatening the survival of the next generation.</P>
      <P>In an address at the rally, the vice president cited the U.N. Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change's assessment as saying that if global warming continues,
average global temperatures are expected to rise by between 1.1 degrees Celsius
and 6.4 degrees Celsius and sea levels by between 18 centimeters and 59
centimeters during this century.</P>
      <P>If temperatures do rise by that amount, she said, it will result in the
extinction of around 20 percent of all species on the planet, which will
seriously affect living conditions for humans.</P>
      <P>Every year, Lu continued, 27,000 tons of raw plastic material is used in
producing plastic bottles for drinking water.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, every person drinks an average of 48 bottles of bottled water per
year, meaning that 1.1 billion plastic bottles are produced annually for bottled
water consumed in Taiwan. She said that more than 1,700 tons of carbon dioxide
are emitted into the air in producing that many bottles.</P>
      <P>Lu suggested that people carry a refillable water bottle with them and refrain
from buying bottled water. The Taipei march was one of a series of similar
rallies held simultaneously in eight cities and counties around the country,
according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>TEPU Secretary-General Ho Tsung-hsun said the event was organized because of
concerns about Taiwan's lack of progress in cutting carbon dioxide emissions, as
evidenced by the recent failure of a draft bill on greenhouse gas reduction to
pass the first reading at the legislature.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese reverend recalled his experience in extending assistance to victims
of the Kaohsiung Incident 30 years ago on the eve of the official opening of a
human rights memorial park, saying that all the hard work was worthwhile as
Taiwan now enjoys full democracy.</P>
      <P>"I was so happy to see that Annette Lu was elected as the vice president and
Chen Chu as the mayor of Kaohsiung, because, for me, it meant I did something
right, " Roger Chao, a Germany-based reverend who offered assistance to
Taiwanese political prisoners in the 1970s-1980s, said in a CNA interview.</P>
      <P>Chao and his wife Doris were invited to attend the Dec. 10 opening of the
Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park, a large compound which used to house
military courts and a detention center for political prisoners -- including Lu,
Chen,  Shih Ming-teh and Presbyterian Church Reverend Kao Jun-ming.</P>
      <P>Chao said that he learned of the incident from German newspapers and was shocked
that many demonstrators were detained. In a biennial Christian conference in
1980, Chao launched a "send-a-postcard" campaign that called for German
youngsters to send postcards to Taiwanese political prisoners as a way to
pressure Taiwan authorities into releasing the dissidents.</P>
      <P>"To my surprise, thousands of Germans bought postcards and stamps with their own
money and penned their support for Taiwan's democracy. Some of them didn't even
know where Taiwan was but they wanted to voice their disapproval of the
injustice, " Chao recalled.</P>
      <P>Doris Chao went to Taiwan's representative office in Germany with a friend and
members of the local press and asked for the immediate release of the prisoners.</P>
      <P>The couple also submitted a list of political prisoners to the German Ministry
of Foreign Affairs via local churches and called for the German government to
pay more attention to the human rights situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Long before the Kaohsiung Incident, Chao had been placed on the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT's) blacklist in 1972 which prevented him from returning to his
motherland. Chao was not able to come back to Taiwan until 1987 when he was
invited by then Vice President Lee Teng-hui for a visit.</P>
      <P>Chao said the "ill feeling" began when he referred to himself as "a reverend
from Taiwan" and a Taiwanese, rather than Chinese, in speeches. Taiwan
government officials quickly advised him against doing so and told his mother
who lived in Kaohsiung that her son was committing treason.</P>
      <P>But Chao was determined to support the Taiwanese movement for democracy and kept
collecting and exchanging information on political prisoners by corresponding
with friends in Taiwan, Germany, Japan and other countries.</P>
      <P>"In those days prior to the Internet, gathering information was extremely
difficult. With Taiwan authority's strict information controls and luggage
checks at airports, we were forced to use secret codes in letters and telegrams
to find out who had been executed and whose Bible had been confiscated, " said
Chao, who earned a xxxx in degree in theology from the University of Hamburg in
196x.</P>
      <P>He and other Taiwanese reverends announced in a "Formosan Christian  for Self
Determination"  statement  in 1974 at the Gemarkerkirche church in Barmen,
Germany, the same church where a group of German reverends released a statement
against the rule of Adolph Hitler and the Nazis in 1934.</P>
      <P>"I'm proud of what I did. We spoke out against the injustice 30 years ago when
no one dared to say anything. And I think the Taiwanese people should cherish
what they have today because they wouldn't have it without the blood, sweat and
tears spent by those freedom fighters who had been unfairly tried,  imprisoned
or executed," he said.</P>

      <P>Past memories suddenly emerged for Klaus Walter, a key person in rescuing
political prisoners in Taiwan back in the 1980s, in the days before the
inauguration of the Taiwan Human Rights Jingmei Park Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, the German human rights activist recalled his first encounter with
a Taiwan political prisoner case immediately after joining Amnesty
International's Group 1400 in Bonn in 1975.</P>
      <P>"I tried to find out all the facts in political prisoner cases which were not
easy to obtain as officials in Taiwan never responded to letters sent by AI, "
said Walter, who is now director of Membership Support Department, AI Germany.</P>
      <P>After getting more and more acquainted with such cases in Taiwan, he decided to
form a Taiwan Coordination group to gather all available information on all
Taiwan political prisoners and general information about the country itself, he
recalled.</P>
      <P>"The Kaohsiung Incident on Human Rights Day in 1979 created many 'new' political
prisoners for AI to gather information on," he said.</P>
      <P>The most "famous prisoners" were Lu Hsiu-lien, Chen Chu, Shih Ming-the, Kao
Chun-ming, and a few others, Walter said.</P>
      <P>"We started a kind of small campaign within AI. We invited all the coordinators
from Sweden, the United States, Britain, Holland and Germany to get involved, "
Walter said, adding that "we told them to try to convince their respective
sections to go international and start a campaign for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Talking about his efforts to gather information on political prisoners in
Taiwan, Walter said the process was very difficult, because "you rarely got an
answer, and if you did, it was usually by the Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>"Trying to find out whether the information provided by the GIO was true was the
toughest part," he recalled.</P>
      <P>"The first real response we got was from the Taipei mayor at the time -- Lee
Teng-hui," Walter pointed out.</P>
      <P>"He was the first person to write back, saying 'yes there is a case,'" Walter
recalled.</P>
      <P>Walter said that Lee Shen-hsiung, a barrister at the time who is now the head of
AI Taiwan, was also a person who worked courageously in trying to gather
information and confirm the arrests of political prisoners.</P>
      <P>"He was one of our main contacts in Taiwan at the time, " Walter said, adding
that "I am glad he is the chair of AI, Taiwan, because he really deserves it."</P>
      <P>Human rights activists from Japan who worked with AI, including Nishikura
Kazuyoshi,  Watarida Masahiro,  Tezuka Toshio, Kinoue Takanobu, Kobayashi
Masanari, Okawa Shiro, Ito Midori, are also expected to be present Monday at the
opening ceremony for the Jingmei park.</P>
      <P>"I'm glad that I'll have the opportunity to meet at this event with those who
worked with us in Japan," Walter said.</P>
      <P>Asked who impressed him the most in the Taiwan's pro-democracy movement, Walter
answered "Chen Chu" without hesitation. Chen Chu currently serves as the mayor
of Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>"She really impressed me a lot, " Walter said, adding that "she proved to be a
real person, with personality."</P>
      <P>Walter pointed out that Chen Chu had already been involved in human rights work
before the Kaohsiung Incident.</P>
      <P>"I am very glad that someone like her is now a leading politician," Walter said.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that he will have the opportunity to meet with Chen Chu
again, and noting that the 30th anniversary of the Kaohsiung Incident is two
years away, he suggested that Kaohsiung City be named a "human rights city."</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Incident, also known as the Formosa Incident, was the result of
pro-democracy demonstrations that occurred in the southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung Dec. 10, 1979. It has played a very important role in Taiwan's
democratic development.</P>
      <P>The time period experienced a rising middle n 1989, Walter came to Taiwan for
the first time to help establish the first AI groups in the country and to met
with former political prisoners, politicians and dignitaries.</P>
      <P>During his second visit in 1995, at the invitation of the Taiwanese Association
of Human Rights, Walter even took part in a televised discussion with then
Minister of Justice Ma Jing-jeou, mainly on the use of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>During that visit, he also toured Kueishan Prison where he met with the "Hsinchi
Trio," who at that time were on death row.</P>
      <P>Upon seeing the three chained at the feet, Walter recalled that he could not
accept the way they were being treated, saying it was "degrading."</P>
      <P>On the development of human rights and democracy in Taiwan, Walter said he is
happy that "we don't have to torture or mistreat prisoners in prison or in
police custody which is good."</P>
      <P>Walter further said the concept of human rights is "normal, " adding that there
is still a lot of room for Taiwan to improve in terms of human rights education
and its overall education system.</P>
      <P>He urged the Taiwan people to pay more attention to international issues, such
as the human rights issues in Darfur in Sudan, or in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>He further said that, prior to the inauguration of the Taiwan Human Rights
Jingmei Park, the first of its kind in the world, "I also encourage you to do
more and to continue."</P>
      <P>During his current visit, Walter is also scheduled to head to Green Island which
has played an important  role in Taiwan's democratic development as many
political prisoners jailed there later turned into pro-democracy activists.</P>

      <P>The National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall will not be re-opened to public
access until 10 a.m. Monday because of a delay in a renovation project involving
replacement of the hall's name plate and the epigraph on the main gateway to the
hall, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chuang Kuo-jung, chief secretary of the Ministry of Education, said he feels
regret that the renovation work could not be completed on time to allow the hall
to reopen as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>The ministry closed the hall, formerly known as Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall,
for three days from 9 a.m. Thursday through midnight Saturday to facilitate the
renovation project.</P>
      <P>The renovation involves replacing a plaque on the hall bearing the Chinese
characters for "Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall" with a new on that reads
"National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" and replacing the four-character
inscription alluding to Chiang 's name located at the top of the main gate with
a new epigraph that reads "Liberty Square."</P>
      <P>Chuang blamed the Taipei city government for the delay in completing the
replacement work, saying the work was repeatedly interrupted by city

      <P>The original "Ta Chung Chih Cheng" epigraph on the main gateway was removed
Friday, but installation of the new one "Tzu You Kuang Chang" meaning "Liberty

      <P>The memorial hall was built in 1980 by the then-Kuomintang (KMT) government in
honor of Chiang who was also the KMT's longtime leader. The current Democratic
Progressive Party administration branded Chiang as a dicatator and main
perpetrator of the tragic 228 Incident of 1947 and has insisted on renaming the
landmark building in downtown Taipei as part of its pursuit of transitional
justice, but the re-designation efforts have met strong objection from the KMT-
controlled Taipei city government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AI member recalls human rights movement in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Past memories suddenly emerged for Klaus Walter, a key person in rescuing
political prisoners in Taiwan back in the 1980s, in the days before the
inauguration of the Taiwan Human Rights Jingmei Park Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, the German human rights activist recalled his first encounter with
a Taiwan political prisoner case immediately after joining Amnesty
International's Group 1400 in Bonn in 1975.</P>
      <P>"I tried to find out all the facts in political prisoner cases which were not
easy to obtain as officials in Taiwan never responded to letters sent by AI, "
said Walter, who is now director of Membership Support Department, AI Germany.</P>
      <P>After getting more and more acquainted with such cases in Taiwan, he decided to
form a Taiwan Coordination group to gather all available information on all
Taiwan political prisoners and general information about the country itself, he
recalled.</P>
      <P>"The Kaohsiung Incident on Human Rights Day in 1979 created many 'new' political
prisoners for AI to gather information on," he said.</P>
      <P>The most "famous prisoners" were Lu Hsiu-lien, Chen Chu, Shih Ming-the, Kao
Chun-ming, and a few others, Walter said.</P>
      <P>"We started a kind of small campaign within AI. We invited all the coordinators
from Sweden, the United States, Britain, Holland and Germany to get involved, "
Walter said, adding that "we told them to try to convince their respective
sections to go international and start a campaign for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Talking about his efforts to gather information on political prisoners in
Taiwan, Walter said the process was very difficult, because "you rarely got an
answer, and if you did, it was usually by the Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>"Trying to find out whether the information provided by the GIO was true was the
toughest part," he recalled.</P>
      <P>"The first real response we got was from the Taipei mayor at the time -- Lee
Teng-hui," Walter pointed out.</P>
      <P>"He was the first person to write back, saying 'yes there is a case,'" Walter
recalled.</P>
      <P>Walter said that Lee Shen-hsiung, a barrister at the time who is now the head of
AI Taiwan, was also a person who worked courageously in trying to gather
information and confirm the arrests of political prisoners.</P>
      <P>"He was one of our main contacts in Taiwan at the time, " Walter said, adding
that "I am glad he is the chair of AI, Taiwan, because he really deserves it."</P>
      <P>Human rights activists from Japan who worked with AI, including Nishikura
Kazuyoshi,  Watarida Masahiro,  Tezuka Toshio, Kinoue Takanobu, Kobayashi
Masanari, Okawa Shiro, Ito Midori, are also expected to be present Monday at the
opening ceremony for the Jingmei park.</P>
      <P>"I'm glad that I'll have the opportunity to meet at this event with those who
worked with us in Japan," Walter said.</P>
      <P>Asked who impressed him the most in the Taiwan's pro-democracy movement, Walter
answered "Chen Chu" without hesitation. Chen Chu currently serves as the mayor
of Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>"She really impressed me a lot, " Walter said, adding that "she proved to be a
real person, with personality."</P>
      <P>Walter pointed out that Chen Chu had already been involved in human rights work
before the Kaohsiung Incident.</P>
      <P>"I am very glad that someone like her is now a leading politician," Walter said.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that he will have the opportunity to meet with Chen Chu
again, and noting that the 30th anniversary of the Kaohsiung Incident is two
years away, he suggested that Kaohsiung City be named a "human rights city."</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Incident, also known as the Formosa Incident, was the result of
pro-democracy demonstrations that occurred in the southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung Dec. 10, 1979. It has played a very important role in Taiwan's
democratic development.</P>
      <P>The time period experienced a rising middle n 1989, Walter came to Taiwan for
the first time to help establish the first AI groups in the country and to met
with former political prisoners, politicians and dignitaries.</P>
      <P>During his second visit in 1995, at the invitation of the Taiwanese Association
of Human Rights, Walter even took part in a televised discussion with then
Minister of Justice Ma Jing-jeou, mainly on the use of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>During that visit, he also toured Kueishan Prison where he met with the "Hsinchi
Trio," who at that time were on death row.</P>
      <P>Upon seeing the three chained at the feet, Walter recalled that he could not
accept the way they were being treated, saying it was "degrading."</P>
      <P>On the development of human rights and democracy in Taiwan, Walter said he is
happy that "we don't have to torture or mistreat prisoners in prison or in
police custody which is good."</P>
      <P>Walter further said the concept of human rights is "normal, " adding that there
is still a lot of room for Taiwan to improve in terms of human rights education
and its overall education system.</P>
      <P>He urged the Taiwan people to pay more attention to international issues, such
as the human rights issues in Darfur in Sudan, or in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>He further said that, prior to the inauguration of the Taiwan Human Rights

more and to continue."</P>
      <P>During his current visit, Walter is also scheduled to head to Green Island which
has played an important  role in Taiwan's democratic development as many
political prisoners jailed there later turned into pro-democracy activists.</P>

      <P>Ang Lee's steamy, spy thriller "Lust, Caution" romped home with seven awards,
including best film, best director and best actor, at the 44th Golden Horse
Awards in his home country of Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>Although the New York-based director has won popular acclaim in major film
festivals worldwide, Ang Lee said during a party held in Taipei after the Golden
Horse Award presentation ceremony that he most values the Golden Horse Awards --
the Taiwan version of Hollywood's  Academy Awards,  designed to recognize
outstanding Chinese-language films and personalities -- because they're held in
his home country.</P>
      <P>Lee said he still has no idea why he made "Lust, Caution." It seemed that there
was an urge leading him to produce the movie to "repay debts that had
accumulated over many lifetimes," he said.</P>
      <P>Admitting that he had undergone great moral struggles during the making of
"Lust, Caution", over scenes some people may consider erotic or steamy, Lee
expressed his sincere appreciation to his family members for their support.</P>
      <P>Tony Leung Chiu-wei won the best actor award for his portrayal of a calm,
ruthless Japanese-allied spy chief in World War II-era Shanghai in "Lust,
Caution", adapted from a short story of the same name by noted author Eileen
Chang. It was the third time that Leung has captured the Golden Horse Award for
best actor.</P>
      <P>Ang Lee, who also won the coveted honor of Taiwanese filmmaker of the year,
boarded a Taiwan High Speed Rail train Sunday morning for his hometown of Tainan
City, southern Taiwan, just hours after the celebration party, to attend an
alumni gathering marking the 50th founding anniversary of the middle school that
he attended decades ago in Tainan.</P>
      <P>The Oscar-winner director will also take time to pay his respects to his
deceased father at a temple in Tainan. His father was a superintendent of the
prestigious National Tainan First Senior High School.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's national status is the most critical point in the March 22, 2008
presidential poll and so candidates of both the ruling and opposition parties
have to come out with a clear stance regarding the issue, Republic of China
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen said here Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yao made the remarks while giving a speech analyzing the meaning of presidential
polls to Taiwan's democratic development at a meeting with Taiwanese expatriates
in Baltimore.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan's national status, rather than its economy, is absolutely
the core issue in the next presidential election, Yao opined that both ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Frank Hsieh and his main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) counterpart Ma Ying-jeou have to provide the public with a
clear explanation concerning their views on this point.</P>
      <P>"Neither Hsieh nor Ma can shirk the issue," Yao said, urging both to debate the
topic, as Ma continuous to maintain that the economy is the central point while
Hsieh increasingly leans toward swing voters.</P>
      <P>Both Hsieh and Ma have to tell voters clearly whether they are vying for
Taiwan's presidency, whether Taiwan's national territory also includes the
Chinese mainland, and characterize the nature of Taiwan-China relations as
domestic or international, he argued.</P>
      <P>Yao said that he strongly doubts that Ma could promote direct transportation
links across the Taiwan Strait, with Beijing insisting that Taiwan-China routes
are domestic, although Ma has repeatedly said that he would immediately embark
on the task if elected president.</P>
      <P>"I doubt that Ma, in his capacity as head of state, dares to sign documents that
would downgrade Taiwan's status to that of a province of China to approve direct
cross-Taiwan Strait flights, " Yao said, warning  that "Taiwan would become an
entirely  local Chinese government if Taiwan deals with ensuing complex
problems, such as labor affairs and academic diploma verification, in a similar
way."</P>
      <P>The DPP and KMT are not enemies, but both bear the responsibility of making
clear their positions to voters how they will deal with China, because this is
the critical point in matters concerning Taiwan's safety and development, he
said.</P>
      <P>He also contended that the United States and international community have to
clearly define what is the so-called "status quo" across the strait now that
they are constantly  calling  for maintaining the status quo between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>The DPP's efforts to hold a referendum on whether the country should push for
U.N. membership in the name of Taiwan are effectively aimed at safeguarding the
cross-strait status quo so as to make international  society  realize that
"Taiwan is an independent sovereignty which does not form part of the People's
Republic of China," he went on.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, Taiwan's people should forge a consensus concerning the so-
called cross-strait "status quo" on four fronts -- Taiwan is an independent
sovereignty, Taiwan and China do not belong to each other, Taiwan must keep its
democratic government system and cross-strait peace must be maintained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP lawmakers oppose bills benefiting veterans</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators expressed opposition
Sunday to "pork barrel" bills proposed by opposition lawmakers that would
benefit only military veterans.</P>
      <P>DPP legislators Chuang Ho-tzu and Trong Chai warned in a joint statement that
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -led "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers have been pushing
11 "pork barrel" bills, including housing subsidies, favoring military veterans
and their dependents.</P>
      <P>Noting that the majority of people in Taiwan are not responsible for the
"feeding" of the handful of military veterans who came to Taiwan from China more
than four decades ago, Chuang and Chai urged all "pan-green camp" legislators,
led by the DPP, and novice "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers, to block those bills
from being passed into law.</P>
      <P>Chuang claims that it would cost Taiwan's people some NT$1.8 trillion (US$55.73
billion) if those 11 bills were passed into law, adding that there is no need
for the Taiwanese, whose number constitutes more than four-fifths of Taiwan's
entire population, to foot the bills to care for the daily needs of military
veterans, who number less than one-tenth of the country's total population.</P>
      <P>The NT$1.8 trillion, Chuang said, could instead be spent on other more crucial
and significant affairs, such as beefing up the country's national defense,
education or social work.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chai said that more than 10,000 veterans have retained their
Taiwan household registrations but live in China on a long-term basis, while the
number of veterans who travel from China back to Taiwan only in January and July
to pick up their regular payments from the government exceeds 50,000.</P>
      <P>Chuang and Chai were mainly referring to an amendment to an act governing the
reconstruction of veterans and military dependents' houses  that  was  approved
in  a  first  reading  by  the opposition-dominated legislature Jan. 8,
stipulating that some 350,000 veterans who do not live in designated military
residential compounds around the country should also be entitled to special
housing subsidies.</P>
      <P>Approval of the amendment would require a budget over NT$1 trillion to subsidize
reconstruction of old military residential compounds that have been built since
the 1950s for some 500,000 military veterans.</P>
      <P>Chuang and Chai described the amendment as nothing more than a pork barrel bill
of the "pan-blue alliance" aimed at using government money to curry favor with
veterans -- who side mainly with the KMT -- in forthcoming elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yeh Chu-lan said that Taiwan, based on its
own struggle for democracy, is working to promote and protect human rights in
other countries worldwide.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks Saturday at a seminar titled "Witness to Taiwan's History
of Struggling for Human Rights During the Martial Law Era", which was part of
activities marking the inauguration of the Taiwan Human Rights Jingmei Park
slated for Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>The seminar was attended by a total of 14 human rights activists from home and
abroad who played a role in Taiwan's human rights movement during the country's
martial law era during 1949-1987, including Watarida Masahiro, Tezuka Toshio and
Kobayshi Masanari, members of Japan's Solidarity Committee for Taiwan's
Political Prisoners;  Klaus Walter,  director of the Membership  Support
Department, Amnesty International (AI) Germany; overseas Taiwanese Chen Mei-chin
and her husband Gerrit van der Wees.</P>
      <P>Also present were Chang Fu-mei, minister of Overseas Compatriot Affairs
Commission, and Wu Chin-fa, vice chairman of the Council for Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that for many people at the forum, the meaning of "human rights" is not
only in the words, but also in the goals they have devoted most of their lives
to pursuing. She added that thanks to the combined efforts of the Taiwanese
people for half a century, the people of Taiwan are now entitled to enjoy human
rights after enduring the world's longest period of martial law.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan underwent a smooth transfer of power without bloodshed in
2000, which she said symbolizes that human rights are truly safeguarded in
Taiwan, Yeh said that it is hoped that Taiwan will help to develop greater
respect for human rights in other countries after having received assistance in
safeguarding human rights in the past.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Dutch pro-democracy activist Gerrit van der Wees said that
the Kaohsiung Incident, also known as the Formosa Incident, in 1979 was a
watershed moment in Taiwan's human right movement, adding that he was then a
university student and dedicated himself to promoting Taiwan's human rights by
establishing the next year the Taiwan Communique, a bi-monthly journal focused
on political developments in and around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Tezuka Toshio displayed an array of photos to illustrate the efforts
made and prices paid in the process of the country's pursuit of human rights.</P>

      <P>Ang Lee, the Academy Award-winning director from Taiwan, said Saturday night
that he was looking for material for his next movie, and that he might try to
direct a "funny movie" if he could find a good script.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks at the 2007 Golden Horse Film Festival in Taipei after he
was invited on stage to announce and present the best actor award, together with
light-hearted Hong Kong actress Sandra Ng.</P>
      <P>Ng, winner of the Best Actress Award at the 2003 Golden Horse Film Festival for
her role as a prostitute in the film Golden Chicken, tried to make Lee perform a
series of facial antics which he might use in dealing with his wife's various
moods.</P>
      <P>Lee' response, drawing a big laugh from the audience, proved that the Oscar-
winning director of "Brokeback Mountain" and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is
also good at making fun.</P>
      <P>On his plans for what comes next, he said he will travel to Spain, France, the
United Kingdom, northern Europe and Australia to promote his latest film --
"Lust, Caution", an erotic espionage thriller which won seven Golden Horse
Awards Saturday, including best feature film, best director, and best actor.</P>
      <P>The movie, which also won the Golden Lion for best picture at the Venice Film
Festival in September, depicts a group of patriotic Chinese students plotting to
kill the head of an espionage network of the Japanese collaborationist
government during the Sino-Japanese war years of 1939-1943, using a young woman
as a lure.</P>
      <P>Asked about his next movie, Lee said he was still looking for the right
material, and that if he could not find it, he would rest for a while. He
indicated that he might shoot a comedy, if he can find a good script.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) held its first ever certification exam for
Chinese-English translators on Dec. 8-9 at the National Taiwan University in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The exam, which is comprised of both translations of written materials and
consecutive interpretation sections, is the result of an attempt by the MOE to
establish a standard translation appraisal system and elevate the professional
image of translators, according to the MOE officials.</P>
      <P>Among the 881 people registered for the exam, 302 will sit both the translation
and interpretation tests, officials said, adding that examinees who pass the
translation exam will receive a certificate and will be officially recognized by
the Taiwanese government as translators.</P>
      <P>Those who pass the first stage of the interpretation exam on Dec. 9 will be
eligible for the second stage exam scheduled on Jan. 6, 2008,  with those
passing it being granted a certificate  in consecutive interpreting.</P>
      <P>The topics  of the questions  in the Chinese-English  and English-Chinese
translation exams vary from economics and science, to social issues, which is
good for assessing translation skills, said one examinee.</P>
      <P>However, during the listening and written part of the first stage of the
interpretation exam, some examinees complained of being confused by how the tape
was played, as well as the answering methods, adding these were not in accord

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator John Chiang said Sunday that he and
Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun will study means to guard the tombs of late
Presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo, who are his grandfather and
father in the county.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the comments while fielding reporters' questions after President
Chen Shui-bian said a day earlier that from Jan. 1 next year, military guards
protecting the mausoleums of the two late presidents in Tashi, Taoyuan County
will be withdrawn as the Chiang family refuses to relocate the remains to a
military cemetery in Shichi, Taipei County, on which the government has spent
NT$30 million.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he will not accept the proposal to relocate the two tombs to the
Shichi military cemetery so long as Chen remains in presidency. Allowing a pro-
Taiwan independence Chen to preside over the tombs' removal would be a great
humiliation to his grandfather and father, he said.</P>
      <P>Although Chiang claimed that he will consider the relocation proposal if the KMT
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou succeeds in winning the March 22, 2008
presidential poll, he pointed out that by that time, Ma might also agree to
permit the two mausoleums to remain in Tashi.</P>
      <P>But since Chen is very likely to rashly withdraw the guards from the two
mausoleums as an electoral gambit in the run up to the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative
election, Chiang said he will discuss measures with Chu as soon as possible to
protect the two mausoleums.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that he talked over the relocation issue with Chu more than a year
ago, and expressed hope that the Taoyuan County Government would watch over the
two mausoleums instead of the central government if the DPP government decides
to withdraw the guards.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, Chu responded positively and many local residents are also
in favor of the idea, which they said would provide the county with an
opportunity to link itself closely with this aspect of the Republic of China's
history.</P>

      <P>Vice president Annette Lu called for the Taiwanese people Sunday to drink less
bottled wqter, or altogether stop buying it as part of efforts to protect the
environment.</P>
      <P>Lu called for members of the Taiwanese public to carry with them their own
canteens containing boiled water prepared at home when going out to work, school
or on a day trip.</P>
      <P>Noting that the production of each liter-sized PET bottle requires 17. 5 liters
of water, Lu said she has no idea whether the consumers are drinking water, or
petroleum, when they are consuming bottled water.</P>
      <P>Lu said there are roughly 6.3 billion people in the world, but "we have only one
Earth, " which prompted her to advocate a drive to encourage people to "worship
heaven, treasure the Earth and love the people"; she went on that this should
start with drinking less bottled water, or no longer buying it at all.</P>
      <P>She noted that more than 270,000 metric tons of raw materials, and 18,000
barrels of crude oil must be processed each year for worldwide production of
plastic water bottles.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, if each citizen consumes 48 PET bottles of drinking water each year,
the nation as a whole would be responsible for the production of 1.1 billion PET
bottles a year, a number which, if lined up end on end, could circle Taiwan
proper 326 times, she said.</P>
      <P>Lu jokingly admitted that she might be inviting the wrath of PET producers by
advocating this drive, but added that she would not flinch from what should be
done.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while stumping  for ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Chao Yung-ching's re-election in the next legislative elections
slated for Jan. 12, 2008. She recommended Chao as a good lawmaker who has been

      <P>They said that the TAITRA will not only seek governmental subsidies for air
tickets for those companies poised to visit El Salvador and Nicaragua, it will
also seek governmental subsidies to help fund Taiwan companies' imports of
coffee from these two Central American countries.</P>
      <P>Coffee has been one of the main products that Taiwan has sought to import from
Central America and one of the key products that Central American countries have
tried to sell to Taiwan over the past years.</P>

      <P>The Performance Workshop theater and Huang Ying-hsiung, a playwright and
director, won the 11th Taipei Cultural Awards for their contributions to hand
down Taiwan's performing arts to the next generation.</P>
      <P>Taipei City's Department of Cultural Affairs held a ceremony to recognize the
winners Friday during which Stan Lai, founder of the theater, said that he is
delighted to win the award and is willing to contribute the cash prize of
NT$200,000 to the cultural agency to encourage more youngsters to engage in
artistic creation.</P>
      <P>Lee Yong-ping, director of the cultural affairs department, commended the
Performance Workshop for its role in leading the development of theatrical
performances in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing the theater's premier work "The Night We Became Hsiang Sheng Comedians"
as an example, Lee said the work became a milestone for Taiwan's theater for its
innovative creativity and its powerful performance, which spurred a revival of
the dying traditional Chinese comedy form Hsiang-sheng in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Lee said that the group also made great efforts to cultivate  young
performing  talents  by regularly  organizing performance camps and other
activities on campuses around the country.</P>
      <P>As to Huang, who is artistic director of the Tien Experimental Theater, Lee said
he was honored for his devotion to training artistic and literary youngsters,
and to promoting the performing arts over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Noting that Huang also paved the way for the disabled to step onto stage through
writing plays that are suited for them to perform, Lee said that Huang also
designed a special descriptive format for the blind and visually impaired to
enjoy movies.</P>
      <P>Also attending the ceremony were Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin; the government's
Labor Affairs Department Director Su Ying-kuei; Emile Sheng,  chairman of the
Research,  Development  and Evaluation Commission; and Lin Cheng-chi, vice
chairwoman of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Political prisoners, human rights workers visit ex-detention center</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>International human rights workers visiting the Jingmei Military Detention
Center Sunday said it was an eye-opening experience while ex-political prisoners
described it as a reminder of Taiwan's "bad old days".</P>
      <P>Close to 100 former political prisoners, some of whom spent up to 12 years in
the center during the 1970s and 1980s, accompanied by the international human
rights workers who offered their assistance in rescuing the prisoners, visited
the suburb compound -- recently renamed Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park by
Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>The site is a vast compound which used to house the military courts of the
Taiwan Garrison Command and a detention center for political prisoners.</P>
      <P>It was also where eight leaders of the Kaohsiung Incident, including Vice
President Annette Lu, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, and former ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairmen Shih Ming-deh and Lin Yi-hsiung, stood trial
under martial law.</P>
      <P>"I was in Room 48. You were in 43, right? " Lin Shu-chi asked his "cell mates"
who arrived with him earlier. Memories may fade away, but something you just
don't forget, said Lin, who spent a part of his 12 year prison life in Jingmei
before being moved to the Green Island.</P>
      <P>The only part of the site which has undergone major change was the
administration building, which was kept intact but penetrated by several newly-
built concrete walls, symbolizing democracy's victory over an authoritative
regime, explained architect Chien Hsueh-yi.</P>
      <P>The court room of the Kaohsiung Incident trial has been turned into an
exhibition room, displaying documents, photographs, relics and articles related
to the incident.</P>
      <P>Roger and Doris Chao, a Taiwanese-German couple who called on Taiwan's authority
to immediate release political prisoners following the incident, were in awe of
the atmosphere of the court room. It was there that the Taiwanese prisoners,
whom they didn't even know but nonetheless tried to help, stood trial.</P>
      <P>A tour of the cells was the highlight of the visit. Former prisoners, most of
whom are over 60 years-old, looked for the cells where they stayed 30 years ago.
Annette Lu and Chen Chu shared room 59 in the second floor, where female
prisoners were kept.</P>
      <P>Pointing at a wash-basin on the floor, Huang Hua explained the prisoners had to
wash hands, dishes, and bathe in the tiny space. Usually, there were six to
seven inmates kept in a 12 square meter room, he said.</P>
      <P>Cell mates were allowed to walk around an open space for 20 minutes twice or
three times per week; it was our only chance to see the sky and embrace "free
air, " he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai Tsai-yuan, who was beaten almost to death in the center, showed visitors
how he wrote an SOS message and flipped the spitball out of the cracked gap of
the window, hoping someone would notice it and bring help.</P>
      <P>"I knew that family members of the prisoners would pass by my window on visiting
days, so I took the chance, " Tsai said. And he succeeded. His notes was sent
out to international human rights organizations and his life was spared.</P>
      <P>"This is the real history, " said Gerrit van der Wees, senior political advisor
of Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), after listening to stories
told by ex-prisoners. He said that Taiwanese should know what really happened
during the "White Terror" days.</P>
      <P>After the park is inaugurated by President Chen Shui-bian Monday and opened to
the public, they will be able to see for themselves.</P>

of aboriginal music from the Tsou and Bunun tribes, two of Taiwan's 13
indigenous tribes.</P>

graduated from the National Taiwan Academy of the Arts in 1964 and went to

      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt has arrived in
Taipei for a four-day visit, diplomatic sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries, was accompanied by Douglas Spelman,
chief of the Taiwan desk at the U.S. Department of State, when he arrived
Saturday evening.</P>
      <P>This is Burghardt's third visit since he assumed his current post in February
2006. He last visited Taipei in mid-June.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of his latest visit is to gain first-hand information about the
local elections and meet with the presidential candidates of Taiwan's two major
political parties -- Frank Hsieh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and
Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang, the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to sources, Burghardt will exchanges views with the two presidential
hopefuls on a range of issues, including their policy visions and initiatives
concerning relations across the Taiwan Strait as well as their views on the
delicate triangular Taiwan-U.S. -China relations.</P>
      <P>Burghardt will review AIT Taipei Office operations Sunday and pay visits to
Minister of James Huang Monday morning and to President Chen Shui-bian at 3 p.m.
that same day, the sources said.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen whether Burghardt will again attempt to dissuade Chen from
holding a referendum on whether the country should seek U.N. membership under
the name Taiwan or touch on topics relating to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Burghardt is scheduled to wrap up his visit Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A retired career diplomat, Burghardt headed the AIT Taipei Office between 1999
and 2001. He now concurrently serves as director of the East-West Seminars at
the East-West Center in Honolulu.</P>
      <P>The AIT, headquartered in Washington, D.C., is a quasi-official U.S.

    <HEADLINE>No improvement in China's human rights situation: experts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
12/09/07  22:24:36
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no improvement in human rights situation in China in 2007, experts and
activists said at a seminar held here on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD) , an independent and non-partisan
democracy assistance foundation, organized the seminar, dubbing the 2007 China
Human Rights Report: Observation on Political Rights and Judicial Rights, to
coincide with the Dec. 10 Human Rights Day and the opening of the Jingmei Human
Rights Memorial Park in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the seminar, Chen Chun-ju, a research assistant at the Institute  of
International  Relations,  National  Chengchi University, said that in 2007 the
Communist Party of China (CPC) made no improvement either in political human
rights, or in citizen's basic civil rights although it was highly expected that
the 2008 Olympic Games will open a window for such change.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the CPC stepped up its control of people before and during its
17th National Congress in October, adding thatthe regime has monitored and
arrested dissidents, rights activists, petitioners; closed down websites and
blogs; and tightened its grip on media since July."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Liao Fu-te, an associate research fellow of the
Institute of Law, Academia Sinica, said that he is frustrated at seeing no
improvement of any kind in people's judicial rights in China, adding that
personal liberty and dignity, fair judicial trials, and the proper
implementation of laws, are the areas suffering from the most serious
infringement.</P>
      <P>The conditions of Chinese prisons are condemned world-widely, " Liao said,
adding thatalthough the Chinese official media claimed that executions dropped
down after the Chinese Peoples Supreme Court took back the power of approving
death penalty yet China never provides the number of execution which is regarded
as a national secrecy.</P>
      <P>Klaus Walter, the German human rights activist and director of Membership
Support, Amnesty International Germany (AI), said that AI has urged China to
drop death penalty, free imprisoned civil rights activists, and give its people
freedom of speech and expression, only to be snubbed by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Walter said that he was disturbed too when he tried in vain to rescue Taiwan's
political prisoners jailed for the Kaohsiung Incident 30 years ago, and it was
beyond his expectation that the jail used to detain those political prisoners
has turned into the Jingmei human rights park; therefore, "I try to be
optimistic and think that maybe one day the Tiananmen Square in Beijing can
become a Liberty Square."</P>
      <P>Maysing Yang, vice president of the TFD, concluded the seminar by saying that
whether China can really improve human rights and become a democratic country
ruled by law has great impact in the stability in Taiwan and human rights in
other Asian countries, "We must keep working together and showing concerns about
this matter."</P>

should be in sympathy with all men, but intimate with men of moral character. If
he has time and opportunity to spare, after the performance of those duties, he
should then employ them in literary pursuits."</TEXT>

"National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" and replacing the four-character
inscription alluding to late president Chiang Kai-shek's name located at the top

intact, adding that if there are any changes to be made in the future, the
ministry will first apply with the Council for Cultural Affairs as stipulated in
the historic relic law.</P>
      <P>Noting that around 10 million visitors tour the park each year,</P>
      <P>Chuang predicted that the number of visitors will increase after</P>
      <P>the name change, saying that foreign visitors will be able to see how Taiwan has
transformed itself from authoritarian to a free and democratic country.</P>
      <P>The memorial hall was built in 1980 by the then-Kuomintang (KMT) government in
honor of Chiang who was also the KMT's leader. The current Democratic
Progressive Party administration has branded Chiang as a dictator and main
perpetrator of the tragic 228 Incident of 1947 and has insisted on renaming the
landmark building in downtown Taipei as part of its pursuit of transitional
justice, but the re-designation efforts have been met with resistance from the
KMT-controlled Taipei city government.</P>
      <P>The ministry closed the hall from 9 a.m. Thursday to 10 a.m. Monday to
facilitate the renovation work.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NSB completes plans on protecting presidential candidates: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Security Bureau (NSB) has completed planning on protecting
candidates' personal safety ahead of the next presidential election slated for
March 22, 2008, NSB Director Shi Hwei-yow said Monday.</P>
      <P>Responding to reporters' questions at the Legislative Yuan on whether the NSB
has obtained intelligence concerning a possible assassination attempt on main
opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou, Shi said his bureau
has been constantly monitoring the security of the candidates and their close
relatives, irrespective of which party they belong to.</P>
      <P>Shi said that the NSB has adopted a "better safe than sorry" policy on
protecting the candidates' personal safety and will not ignore any suspicious
circumstance in carrying out its task, adding that the bureau will handle all
cases concerning the candidates' security after careful assessment of related
intelligence.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is only natural that spats and bickering intensify as elections
approach, Shih urged members of the public to solve differences via rational
debate, adding that verbal abuse and violence are not conducive to the
development of democracy.</P>
      <P>The NSB head stressed that he is confident about maintaining law and order in
the period leading up to the presidential election, adding that he will step
down if any major accident happens to any of the candidates.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the threat letter recently sent to President Chen Shui-bian's
daughter Chen Hsin-yu, Shi said his bureau has been collaborating with the
National Police Administration (NPA) to try to track down the sender.</P>
      <P>Shi said his bureau has handed the letter to the NPA for examination and has
stepped up security measures to protect the personal safety of Chen Hsin-yu and
her family.</P>
      <P>On rumors that Chen Hsin-yu is planning to leave Taiwan for the United States
out of fear for her personal safety after receiving the letter, apparently due
to a lack of confidence in the NSB's ability to protect her, Shi said that if
the rumors are indeed true, it would represent a failure for the NSB in carrying
out its mission.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CANA)
12/10/07  15:01:11

    <TEXT>
      <P>If risking your life for your beliefs and values is honorable, then trying to
help those in a country thousands of miles away whom you don't even know and
whose names you have a hard time pronouncing is equally appreciated.</P>
      <P>That's what the group of international human rights workers invited to attend
Monday's inauguration ceremony for the Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park did
almost 30 years ago through their collective efforts to put pressure on Taiwan
authorities to release political prisoners.</P>
      <P>Most of the human rights workers, who were based in the United States, Japan,
Germany and several other countries, learned of the political prisoner cases in
Taiwan by accident and never met the Taiwanese prisoners they helped save until
last weekend when they together visited the new park which was once known as the
Jingmei Military Detention Center.</P>
      <P>Klaus Walter, head of the membership department of Amnesty International German
Section, said he wanted to work on South American political prisoner cases at
first but was assigned to handle a Taiwan case in 1975 as a 21-year-old student
volunteer in Bonn, Germany.</P>
      <P>"Maybe  my Spanish  wasn't  good  enough,  " Walter  said half-jokingly, adding
that prior to that time, he had no idea where Taiwan was.</P>
      <P>However, after starting to work on the case, he began to understand more about
the political situation in Taiwan and, one year later, formed a Taiwan
Coordination group whose task was to gather all available information on all
political prisoners in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was not easy because Taiwan officials had never answered AI letters, he said,
forcing him to gather information via human rights groups in Japan and other
countries. In addition, AI regulations required that staff obtain information
from at least two different sources to confirm its credibility.</P>
      <P>Masahiro Watarida chose a more direct way to gather information and  became  a
victim  himself.  Watarida,  who  is now  the secretary-general of Globalization
Watch Hiroshima, visited Taiwan soon after the Kaohsiung Incident in 1979 to
collect information on human rights violations.</P>
      <P>When departing from Taiwan Dec. 21, 1979, Watarida was found carrying newspapers
and magazines covering the incident. He was arrested, tortured and detained for
84 days.</P>
      <P>Overseas Taiwanese also worked hard to seek international help. Roger Chao, a
Germany-based Taiwanese reverend and one of the leaders of "Christians for
Taiwan's Self-determination, " and his wife Doris worked with AI on extending
assistance to victims of the incident.</P>
      <P>"And because AI did not allow members to work on cases in their own country,
Taiwanese members established a group to seek support from the international
community, " Chao said.</P>
      <P>International support and assistance were important because the people of Taiwan
could not do much living under the authoritarian regime, Chao said.</P>
      <P>The Hsieh Tsun-min case showed why the rescue of Taiwanese political prisoners
was a global effort. Hsieh, who was imprisoned in 1964 for a public statement
titled "A Declaration of Formosan Self-salvation" as a student at National
Taiwan University, got acquainted with Japanese Taiwan independence supporter
Masanari Kobayashi when both were in a Taiwan Garrison Command detention center
in 1971.</P>
      <P>Kobayashi had succeeded in distributing leaflets advocating Taiwan independence
by flying baloons in Taipei but was later arrested and deported. Later, he
helped send Hsieh's messages to international organizations. The messages were
printed in the New York Times, which led to Hsieh's death sentence being
rescinded later.</P>
      <P>On Hsieh's visit to the AI German Section after his release, Rev. Chao recalled,
a girl showed Hsieh a letter which had been sent to him seven years earlier but
returned by Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>"The girl was 17 years old when she sent the letter of support. Hsieh was in
tears upon reading that letter, " Chao said.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan received so much international help during the period of "White
Terror" in the country and because the country now enjoys full democracy, the
people of Taiwan should start extending a helping hand to people in regions
around the world who are suffering from the same sort of repression, Walter
said.</P>
      <P>"Think about Darfur, Sudan, where there's a major human rights crisis. Or think
about Myanmar, which is closer to you in Asia, " he said, adding that it's time
for Taiwan to extend help to those in need.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Starkly different treatment for political prisoners: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
12/10/07  16:31:21

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that comparing special quarters for an
imprisoned former Kuomintang (KMT) military intelligence officer and cells for
political prisoners of the Kaohsiung Incident was like "heaven versus hell."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he received Lord John Alderdice, president of Liberal
International (LI), at the Presidential Office. LI is a world federation of
liberal political parties.</P>
      <P>He told Alderdice that he visited the Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park in
Hsintien, Taipei County earlier that same day and noted the stark difference in
treatment for Wang Shi-ling, a former director of the Military Intelligence
Bureau under the Ministry of the National Defense, and for those who were
fighting for the freedom of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to pro-democracy activists who were put behind bars for their
parts in the Dec. 10, 1979 Kaohsiung Incident, a peaceful demonstration to mark
International Human Rights Day that turned violent after a government crackdown.</P>
      <P>In addition to the cells for two of the defendants in the incident -- Vice
President Annette Lu and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu -- Chen also visited Wang's
"prison accommodation, " which he described as a villa complete with a studio,
study and kitchen in which he was allowed to live with his family.</P>
      <P>Wang was imprisoned after he instructed gangsters to go to the United States in
1984 to murder Chinese-American writer Henry Liu, better known by his pen-name
Jiang Nan, who wrote a critical biography of the late President Chiang Ching-
kuo.</P>
      <P>The president said the Kaohsiung Incident helped spawn opposition parties in
Taiwan, which he noted was a "political taboo" during the martial law era.</P>
      <P>He said the incident and the subsequent military court trial turned into the
threshold of Taiwan's democracy movement.</P>
      <P>He said that he himself, aged under 30 at the time, was the defense lawyer of
the top defendant, former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Huang
Hsin-chieh.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, ruling Democratic Progressive Party presidential and
vice presidential candidates Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang also served as
defense lawyers for the defendants during the trial.</P>
      <P>The Jingmei park is a vast compound that used to house the military courts of
the now defunct Taiwan Garrison Command and a detention center for political
prisoners.</P>
      <P>It was there the eight leaders of the Kaohsiung Incident, including Lu, Chen Chu
and former DPP Chairmen Shih Ming-teh and Lin Yi-hsiung, stood trial under
martial law.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he was gratified that the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, a symbol
of Chiang's authoritarian rule, has been renamed the Taiwan Democracy Memorial
Hall and that the epigraph that reads "Liberty Square" has replaced an
inscription that alluded to the late president above its main gateway.</P>

      <P>U.S-Taiwan relations are healthy overall but  regarding  the  divergence
between  the  two in certain political issues, there is plenty of room for
communication, Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said after meeting the
chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Monday.</P>
      <P>AIT Chairman Raymond Burghardt and Huang talked behind closed doors for 45
minutes at the Taipei Guest House, accompanied by AIT Taipei Office Director
Stephen Young, AIT Deputy Director Robert Wang, and Douglas Spelman, the newly
appointed director of the U.S. State Department's Office of Taiwan Coordination.</P>
      <P>Huang described the timing of Burghardt's visit as "interesting" to which
Burghardt responded that it is because recently there have been some "exciting
things" going on in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Thomas Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of the Department of State for
East Asian and Pacific affairs said the previous Friday that the U.S. opposes
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) planned referendum on joining
the U.N. under the name of Taiwan, describing it as an attempt to change the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo and a violation of President Chen Shui-bian's
promise not to change the nation's title. Therefore, there was widespread
anticipation among local political watchers as to whether Burghardt would
reiterate the U.S.standpoint.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Huang said that because he and Burghardt are "old friends,"
they exchanged "candid" opinions.</P>
      <P>Burghardt did not reveal details of their discussion, nor did he mention or
comment on the DPP's planned referendum.</P>
      <P>Burghardt was also scheduled to meet with Chen as well as DPP precidential

the minister of the Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Icyang Parod made the announcement at a press conference at the CIP to publicize
the results of a Dec. 5-7 visit he made to Palau.</P>
      <P>He said he also signed a memorandum on the plan with Palau's ministry in charge

      <P>The CIP has hosted the forum since 2002. Parod said the forum was formed based
on the idea that Taiwan and its six Pacific allies should establish a regional
organization dedicated to conducting discussions and exchanges on issues
concerning the development of Austronesian culture in the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>Other countries in the region, such as the Philippines, are also welcome to join
the planned organization, the minister added.</P>
      <P>The 2007 Austronesian Forum will take place Dec. 11-12 at the International

      <P>This year's "IT Month" Expo attracted a total of 750,000 visitors during its
nine-day run, which is similar to the number of visitors to last year's show, an
organizer said Monday.</P>
      <P>On the last two days of the annual event on Saturday and Sunday, companies with
booths set up at the venue offered large discounts on an array of information-
technology products and gave away many gifts to boost sales, a spokesman for the
Taipei Computer Association said, adding that the show attracted about 120,000
visitors on Saturday and another 150,000 on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Despite the high number of visitors to the expo, sales this year were not as
good as those at last year's show, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Describing this year's sales as being "M-shaped," or "polarized," the spokesman
noted that prices of some laptop computers with high-class design were at least
NT$10,000 (US$308) higher than those of regular laptops.</P>
      <P>"However, the laptops with high-class designs were very popular at the show,
with some models being sold out," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the overall market situation in Taiwan, the spokesman noted that
sales of some Japanese-brand laptops have been strong. However, he continued,
for laptop computers of other brands, "many people ask about them, but only a
few actually end up buying them."</P>
      <P>The expo will also be held in the central city of Taichung Dec. 14-19, in the
southern county of Tainan Dec. 28-Jan. 2, and in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung Jan. 10-15, according to the spokesman.</P>

      <P>All 150 seats have been booked long in advance for a demonstration on making
juicy pork dumplings that will be offered by chefs from Taipei's Ding Tai Feng
Dumpling House at a debut to be held in London Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang Chi-hua, owner of Taipei's Ding Tai Feng restaurant, led eight of his chefs
to London recently at the invitation of Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
show off the restaurant's traditional Shanghai fare, particularly handmade
dumplings,  known as pork xiaolongbao and shrimp and crab shiaomai.</P>
      <P>Among the 150 guests that are expected to crowd the tasting -- to be held at the
Evergreen Group Building in London -- will be Chang Siao-yue, Taiwan's
representative to the United Kingdom, and Lord Richard Faulkner of Worcester, a
member of the House of Lords and a co-chairman of the British-Taiwan All-Party
Parliamentary Group.</P>
      <P>Chang and Faulkner will also try their hands at emulating the chefs in making
dumplings.</P>
      <P>Fuchsia Dunlop, a prize-winning food writer who writes for publications
including Gourmet, Saveur and The Financial Times and who is a fluent Mandarin
speaker, will serve as interpreter at the event.</P>
      <P>During an interview with CNA, Yang said it is his honor to "do something for
Taiwan, " given that the country faces seemingly insurmountable difficulties on
its diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>Yang, however, declined to affirm that Ding Tai Feng will open a branch
operation in London, at least not in the near future, citing the fact that
foodstuffs and ingredients in London cost about three times more than in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Founded in Taipei's Yungkang Street in 1972, Ding Tai Feng has since made itself
a legend with its dumplings, shrimp and crab shiaomai, fried shrimp rice,
chicken noodle soup and Shanghai rice cakes. The restaurant was rated as one of
the world's top 10 gourmet restaurants by the New York Times in 1993.</P>
      <P>In addition to three outlets in Taipei, Ding Tai Feng also runs 41 branch
restaurants in Japan, the United States, South Korea, China, Australia,

      <P>The Taiwan Association of University Professors (TAUP) urged a leading
university Monday to remove a statute of the late President Chiang Kai-shek from
its campus to demonstrate its will to remove the vestiges of the martial law
era.</P>
      <P>TAUP President Tsai Ting-kuei made the appeal after calling on National Taiwan
Normal University (NTNU) President Kuo Yi-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Tsai described Chiang as the main culprit behind the brutal Feb. 28, 1947
incident and the ensuing "White Terror" period during martial law under
Kuomintang rule, adding that he is seen as one of the dictators responsible for
killing the most innocent citizens in modern Chinese history.</P>
      <P>"Chiang was by no means a great man of Taiwan, but a criminal, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He said the TAUP chose Monday -- International Human Rights Day -- to call on
Kuo to suggest that the university remove the statue, saying that the symbol of
authoritarian rule could "mislead college students."</P>
      <P>If Taiwan wants to pursue freedom and democracy and take the path that enshrines
human rights and rule of law, it is best to start with education, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that students of both National Taiwan University and National Taiwan
Normal University were victimized during the White Terror, adding that NTU has
removed its statue and that NTNU should follow suit.</P>
      <P>In response, Kuo expressed appreciation to the TAUP for conveying one viewpoint,
but urged respect for the university faculty's authority to handle school
affairs independently.</P>
      <P>He said the statue was built with donations from the faculty. NTNU Professor and
sculptor Chueh Ming-teh then led a team of students who completed the work,
which he said "has great artistic value" and "should be viewed as an artistic
work, not from an ideological perspective."</P>
      <P>Kuo said Taiwan is owned by all the country's people and that bygones should be
bygones.</P>
      <P>Yang Shu-huang, a professor of NTNU who is in charge of campus beautification,
said it is estimated that the statue could fetch NT$100 million given its
artistic value, and suggested that the school auction it to replenish school
funds.</P>
      <P>The TAUP's move followed the government's instruction to remove Chiang's
statutes from all military barracks early this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should have more open policies on cross-Taiwan Strait economics because
it cannot afford to lose the emerging China market in its pursuit of
development, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Jih-chu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is also an economist, made the remarks at a forum held by the Chunghua
Institution for Economic Research (CHIER), a private think tank.</P>
      <P>Lee was one of the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance's" representatives who attended
the forum to give opinions on the China market and national energy policies for
the future four to eight years. The forum was presided over by CHIER President
Ko Chen-en and also attracted the participation of representatives from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party-led "pan-green" camp.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that due to its political situation, Taiwan cannot sign free
trade pacts with other countries and thus has barriers to entering international
markets. Under the circumstances, emerging markets with great business
potential, such as China's, can serve as a springboard for Taiwan to seek
business in the global market, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In order to improve its international competitiveness and bring future economic
development, Lee said Taiwan will have to upgrade its manufacturing industry and
internationalize its service industry.</P>
      <P>As to national energy policies, Lee said Taiwan, as a small country that relies
heavily on exports, has to fully understand international norms on environmental
protection and energy saving in order to cope with changes in the global market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct transport links with China would boost Taiwan's real estate prices by 30
percent, Chao Teng-hsiung, president of the Farglory Land Development Co.,
estimated Monday.</P>
      <P>Chao predicted that the local real estate market will grow by 5 percent to 10
percent annually in the near future barring political disturbance.</P>
      <P>However, the growth would reach 10 percent if the government opened the country
to tourists arriving from China, and would hit 20 percent if the government were
to ease restrictions on foreigners purchasing real estate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The developer portrayed a rosy picture for the country's real estate market next
year, given the fact that the international economy is predicted to be quite
good.</P>
      <P>Although the prices of sand and gravel have increased six- to seven-fold this
year, Chao said it will decline a little bit after the government allows imports
of sand and gravel from Vietnam. However, he went on, this is unlikely to bring
down real estate prices, as Taiwan's misery index for real estate and luxury
buildings is the lowest in the world.</P>
      <P>For the time being, Chao said, foreigners who want to own real property in
Taiwan have to navigate through a great deal of government red tape, which he
claimed takes "about half a year" and which therefore puts many potential
foreign real estate investors off.</P>
      <P>Noting that the delivery of new houses in America is rising, Chao said the
United States is emerging from the negative impact of the sub-prime mortgage
crisis, which bodes well for the economies of other places, including Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Most of the 6.1 million packs of smuggled cigarettes seized in Taiwan as of Nov.
18 and worth about NT$336 million (US$10.4 million) are fake Japanese brands,
according to statistics released Monday by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>The figures were unveiled after a report published a day earlier in Japan's
Sankei Shimbun that in order to gain foreign currency reserves, North Korea has
10 factories manufacturing counterfeit Japanese cigarettes and is smuggling them
into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, a major source of North Korea's foreign reserves came from
amphetamine production, according to the report.</P>
      <P>However, due to heavy crackdowns on the drug in many countries, two of the three
amphetamine factories in North Korea have shut down, the report said, noting
that North Korea has switched to producing counterfeit cigarettes.</P>
      <P>These cigarette factories help North Korea earn foreign reserves worth between
US$500 million and US$700 million annually, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the largest market for the North Korean counterfeit cigarettes, the

      <P>A Peruvian woman with a lymph edema that caused a 47 kg swelling on her left leg
received successful surgery at the E-Da Hospital in southern Taiwan in November
and is recovering well, a hospital spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Maria Rosario Razzeto, 45, came to Taiwan Nov. 9 with her son to receive the
operation with the coordination and assistance from Chang Chia-hau, a doctor at
the hospital.</P>
      <P>Razzeto praised the medical team while being interviewed by a group of
journalists from Central and South America who were covering her story.</P>
      <P>Razzeto, who began to suffer primary lymphoedema 26 years ago, revealed that her
"giant leg" made it difficult for her to move and that she felt too ashamed to
go out, not to mention the pain caused by the illness. Primary lymphoedema is
often due to an underdeveloped lymphatic system.</P>
      <P>After the operation, Razzeto now can walk with the help of a walking frame and
she can also now bend her left leg.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-ching, director of E-Da Hospital's rehabilitation center, said Razzeto
might be able to walk normally after one or two months of physiotherapy.</P>
      <P>Due to Razzeto's poverty, the E-Da Hospital covered her operation costs and is
also planning to give her a tooth implant after she comes back to Taiwan next
February or March to give her a new smile.</P>

      <P>The newly appointed spokeswoman of the opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT)  called on
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Monday to stop its "ugly"
political fight with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-jung, former director of the KMT's Youth Division, replaced Su Jun-pin

candidate Ma Ying-jeou and his running mate, Vincent Siew.</P>

mouthed  invective  spewed by Chuang Kuo-jung, secretary-general of the Ministry

      <P>Chuang has made a series of unprovoked verbal assaults against Ma over the past
few days, ridiculing Ma -- a politician with a public image of civility, good
temperament and gentlemanliness -- as being effeminate and lacking masculine
qualities. His venomous remarks triggered a backlash from women, mothers and gay

      <P>The Taipei city government began the challenging task Monday of moving the
nearly 100-year-old Taipei Workshop -- a train manufacturing and repair facility
located near the North Gate in downtown Taipei -- 30 meters to the southeast in
an effort to save the historic relic during the construction of a new Mass Rapid
Transit (MRT) line.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Director of Cultural Affairs Lee Yung-pin praised the relocation as
a landmark move in the capital city's efforts to preserve its cultural legacy.</P>
      <P>During a ceremony filled with sound of gongs and drums, the old workshop, with a
net weight of 1,040 tons, was lifted from the ground by 35 huge oil jacks. Six
computer-controlled oil-pressure machines were commissioned to push the building
to its new location, according to a local house-moving company contracted to
carry out the work.</P>
      <P>It will take an estimated nine days to move the building to its new temporary
location, where it will remain until 2012, when the construction of the new MRT
Songshan Line is completed, Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems
officials said.</P>
      <P>It will then be moved back to its original location, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Workshop was constructed in 1909 as the Machine Bureau controlled by
the Qing Dynasty. During the Japanese occupation, it was used for maintaining
and repairing trains, as well as for making and assembling new trains.</P>
      <P>The workshop built 10 wooden trains, each around 14 meters long, in the early
part of the 20th Century, according to the Taipei City Department of Cultural
Affairs, which also revealed that the rigid frames for the workshop's roof are
guessed to be abandoned railway tracks built during the period of Liu Ming-chuan
(1836-1896) , Taiwan's governor during the late Qing Dynasty who is acclaimed as
the mastermind behind the construction of Taiwan's rail system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Temple receives NT$130 million in donations from followers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A noted temple in southern Taiwan reported recently that it had received NT$130
million (US$3.9 million) in donations from followers in a single year, which
temple officials described as "a phenomenon" in this period of economic
slowdown.</P>
      <P>Management of the Chaotien Temple in Peikang, in Yunlin County, said the
donations between June 1, 2006 and June 30, 2007 represented an increase of
NT$50 million when compared with an average annual donation of NT$80 million for
previous years.</P>
      <P>However, the expenditure during the same period was also huge, at NT$70 million.
The management said the expenses mainly went to the maintenance of the temple,
salary for the staff and visits to other temples, as well as the sponsoring of
various activities.</P>
      <P>The management said that the pilgrimage season usually peaks between the first
and the third months of the lunar calendar, during which around 1 million
followers will donate to the temple, usually accounting for about half of the
annual donations.</P>
      <P>The management attributed the large increase in donations to the sluggish
economy, which has made the public even more keen to pray to Matsu, one of the
most popular deities in Taiwan, for good luck.</P>
      <P>The other reason is that the directors and supervisors that were elected last
October were dedicated to reform and their efforts in making the financial
status more transparent and accountable have won the trust of the followers.</P>
      <P>For example, the temple began to check gold plates donated by followers over the
past decade this April and announced that the total amounted to 2.223 taels,
worth a market value of NT$40 million. The temple also announced that donations
in the first six months this year totaled NT$86 million. Each tael is about 37.5
grams.</P>
      <P>Followers are positive about the new management team, with one follower saying
the new measures will show that the donations have not been squandered, which
will in turn make people more willing to donate.</P>

      <P>A Japanese peace advocate Monday encouraged Taiwanese youth to have the courage
to take risks and try to build a peaceful and sustainable Taiwan through their
energy and innovative efforts.</P>
      <P>The power of civil society in the post-Cold War era has a proven, international
track record of making a difference, said Tastuya Yoshioka, Founder and Director
of Peace Boat -- a Japan-based non-government organization (NGO) which advocates
peace,  human rights, sustainable development and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>In Japan, young people are taught that risk-taking is wrong, but as we face the
ongoing threats such as militarism, nuclear weapons, climate change and global
epidemics, all global citizens should step up and do something, he said.</P>
      <P>The United Nations framework is important to solving global issues,  but it's
neither  perfect nor able to do it alone. Unfortunately, given the fact that
security council member states all make money from wars, world peace is paid
little more than lip service, he told more than 100 National Taiwan University
students in a lecture.</P>
      <P>That's why civil societies can and should come in and make impacts, said
Yoshioka, who founded Peace Boat in 1983 as a university student.</P>
      <P>Human security, rather than national security, is one of the most important
concepts of a civil society, he said, adding that the key is protecting the
human being, not the politicians, companies or states.</P>
      <P>Yoshioka, 46, established the organization at a time when the issue of Japan's
revisionist history high school textbooks was first becoming controversial. He
was shocked that neighboring countries in Asia were protesting about the content
of the textbooks.</P>
      <P>Peace Boat visited Taiwan on its third voyage in 1986 for a meeting with
Taiwanese democracy activists. As Taiwan was still under an authoritarian
regime, the boat was seized, searched and detained. It is because of that
experience that Taiwan has always held a very special place in his heart,
Yoshioka said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the cross-Straight issue, Yoshioka said in a media interview
Sunday that something along the lines of the European Union format would be an
option.</P>
      <P>"People can't forget the terrible past, but at the same time they can start
reconcile, " he said.</P>
      <P>For the past 24 years, Peace Boat has sailed on nearly 60 voyages and visited
more than 100 countries, including conflict zones such as Eritrea, Cuba, Sierra
Leone and the Balkans.</P>

      <P>Tiunn Hok Chu, a board of director of the foundation, said that in recent years,
an increasing number of young people have begun to create literary works in the

failure to establish a special council to promote the Holo language and culture.</P>
      <P>Tiunn said he hopes that there will be such a council in the future, which will

      <P>Liao Ruey-ming, an assistant professor at Chung Shan Medical University's

      <P>A majority of the respondents to a recent opinion poll have singled out
legislators and public functionaries as the most corrupt people in Taiwan,
according to the results of the survey released by the Transparency
International's Taiwan chapter Monday.</P>
      <P>Public functionaries  in charge of procurement  and public construction
projects, legislators and local governmental officials in charge of the gravel
industry, in that order, are considered the most corrupt groups in the country,
according to the poll, conducted in July.</P>
      <P>Up to 68 percent of the respondents said they feel that the administration does
not have the teeth to crack down on corruption and embezzlement, while 65
percent said government efforts to stop bribery, graft and vote-buying are
insufficient.</P>
      <P>A total of 64 percent of the respondents said they feel the administration may
never succeed in eradicating graft among public office holders if it only
imposes fines without jail terms for those found to have not honestly reported
their properties and assets.</P>
      <P>The respondents singled out voting-buying, influence-peddling and bribery as the
top three irregularities, according to the poll results.</P>
      <P>They also consider corruption in state-run enterprises as more rampant than in
privately run companies.</P>
      <P>On the government's determination to weed out corruption, 41 percent said they
are pessimistic, while 36 percent said they are optimistic, according to the
results.</P>
      <P>Based on a 0-10 scale reflecting the integrity of civil servants, the
respondents considered medical professionals working at public health
institutions as those with the highest level of integrity, at 6.8 points, while
public functionaries in charge of procurement and public construction projects,
legislators, and local government officials in charge of the gravel industry are
considered to have the lowest levels of integrity, scoring less than 4 points.</P>
      <P>The survey of adults randomly selected nationwide was conducted by telephone

2.5 percent.</P>

      <P>The five-member delegation, headed by Xu Wenli, one of the founders of the China
Democracy Party (CDP) , which announced its founding in June 1998 with the goal
of fighting for fairness and freedom of the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>As the CDP also advocates fair popular elections in China, its establishment has
not been approved by Chinese authorities. In addition, many of the CDP members
have been persecuted by the Chinese government after being accused of trying to
sabotage the country. The CDP's headquarters is now located in exile in the
United States, with Xu being its convener.</P>
      <P>During their stay here, the delegation will visit the campaign offices of
candidates of various Taiwanese political parties running in the country's
upcoming legislative and presidential elections early next year.</P>
      <P>An official of the Taipei-based Chinese Youth Solidarity, which invited the CDP
delegation to Taiwan, said the delegation is composed of executives of the CDP,
and he believes that they will thoroughly study the procedure of Taiwan's
democratization and come to better understand mainstream Taiwanese public
opinions.</P>
      <P>Xu's delegation was denied entry by the Hong Kong government Dec. 7, where they
planned to attend a seminar organized by a civic group there.</P>

      <P>The owner of Alexander Health Club -- Taiwan's largest fitness chain with a
26-year history -- announced Monday that the cash-strapped  company  would
immediate  cease operations.</P>
      <P>Candy Tang, chairwoman of the club with more than 20 branches throughout Taiwan,
explained that the company could not continue operating in the red, despite an
injection of funds from its branches in China into local operations.</P>
      <P>Tang's announcement came suddenly, without any prior warning of the company's
troubled financial conditions. Many of its more than 200,000 members have annual
and long-term contracts, and were stunned and worried that they might not be
able to get refunds on their prepaid membership fees.</P>
      <P>According to data provided by the Clearing House of the Taiwan Payments Clearing
System Development Foundation, 23 checks issued by Alexander, in total worth
NT$102.1 million, have bounced as of Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>Regulations promulgated by the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council in mid-
August this year require that health club operators keep a portion of the
membership income in reserve to safeguard consumers' contracts within the first
year in the event of a club going bankrupt. The regulations, however, do not
provide protection for individual membership fees amounting to less than
NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Alexander's 23 branches with an annual turnover of NT2 billion are mostly
located in the greater Taipei area. To join the club, a member was required to
pay an initiation fee of NT$25,000, plus NT$62,500 for a five-year contract and
an annual sanitation charge of NT$1,000. The fees could be paid in installments.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Consumers' Foundation workers indicated that they had received
80 requests from Alexander members seeking help to get their money back, and
that the foundation is prepared to file a class action on behalf of these
consumers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Bankers's Association of the Republic of China urged Alexander
members who have been paying their membership fees in installments using their
credit cards to ask their banks to cancel further payments immediately.</P>

      <P>Offering coverage under the Labor Standards Act (LSA)  to foreign  caregivers
in Taiwan  is "technically infeasible, " an official of the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after an alliance comprised of several foreign labor human
rights groups took to the street Sunday to demand that the government include
the 160,000 foreign caregivers working in Taiwan in the labor act.</P>
      <P>In addition, members of the alliance asked the government to resume providing
respite care services to families with foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>In response, CLA Deputy Chairwoman Tsao Ai-lan said that unlike foreign factory
workers,  it is difficult  to separate family caregivers' working time from rest
time.</P>
      <P>There would be a lot of disputes if the act were extended to include foreign
caregivers, Tsao noted.</P>
      <P>Tsao also said that foreign caregivers often take care of those who are
incapable of moving; as a result, the government cannot require foreign
caregivers to take a break after working for certain hours.</P>
      <P>On the resumption of respite care services, Tsao said that Taiwan has a serious
lack of family caregivers and, as a result, the government should allow those
families that are unable to hire foreign caregivers to have priority access to
respite care services.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  she also said that local employers of foreign caregivers should not
ask their foreign caregivers to do all of the care work, urging the employers to
give their foreign employees some days off.</P>
      <P>Tsao suggested foreign caregivers negotiate their rights with their employers,
noting that if foreign caregivers' rights are trespassed, they can file a
complaint with local labor bureaus.</P>
      <P>Labor bureau officials will immediately offer assistance and take foreign
caregivers to temporary shelters, Tsao noted.</P>
      <P>Responding to the alliance's request that the government use the employment
security fund to hire local caregivers to provide respite care services to
foreign caregivers, Tsao said that local employers of foreign caregivers pay the
fund every month for the reduced job opportunities of local disadvantaged
workers.</P>
      <P>Therefore,  the government should use the fund to provide subsidies to local
disadvantaged workers,  rather than foreign caregivers, Tsao noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
12/10/07  23:24:59
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he has refrained  from holding  a defensive
referendum  over China's misinterpretation of U.N. Resolution No. 2758 after
taking into consideration U.S. friendship for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Raymond Burghardt, who is the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Also present at the meeting was Stephen
Young, director of the AIT Taipei Office, and other officials.</P>
      <P>China, based on its misinterpretation of the U.N. resolution, has repeatedly
declared at international gatherings that "Taiwan is a province of the People's
Republic of China (PRC) " or "the PRC includes Taiwan and is the only legitimate
government representing China," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that such claims have gravely undermined the present cross-Taiwan Strait
status quo, Chen said he could hold a referendum to defend Taiwan's sovereignty
in line with the country's Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Article 17 of the Referendum Act stipulates that the president is empowered to
call a "defensive" referendum on the country's future whenever its sovereign
status is endangered.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has refrained from doing so out of consideration of the
traditionally cordial, friendly relations between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Referring to a planned referendum on whether Taiwan should apply to join the
United Nations under the name Taiwan, Chen said the initiative was proposed by
private groups and has received the endorsement of more than 2 million members
of the public.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is now a democratic country ruled by law, Chen said he cannot overrule
or veto such an initiative. "We must follow our constitutional provision and the
stipulations of the Referendum Act," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen further explained that the U.N. bid referendum has two purposes. "First, we
don't like to continually engage in the longstanding battle with China over the
right to represent 'one China' and look forward to joining the U.N. in the name
of Taiwan; second, we want to have our desire to join the U.N. heard by people
around the world through the upcoming referendum," he explained.</P>
      <P>The president further accentuated that the referendum has nothing to do with
changing Taiwan's official title and does not violate his "four noes" pledge.</P>
      <P>"In keeping with custom, we'll hold a flag-raising ceremony on Jan. 1,  2008 to
mark the Republic of China's 97th founding anniversary and I'll definitely
attend the ceremony, as I did in the past, " Chen told his guests.</P>
      <P>He also hailed as a mark of "full respect for Taiwan people's democratic choice"
the remarks by Young and Thomas Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, that the U.S. government will cooperate with
Taiwan's new president no matter who wins the March 22, 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>As to future cross-strait relations, Chen said: "While I have no idea what my
successor will tell our people and the U.S. government and friends, I can
guarantee that the 'four noes' promise I made to the U.S. government and
President George W. Bush in 2000 and have strictly observed over the past eight
years, will remain intact before my term expires next May."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Reporters Without Borders (RWB) , a Paris-based international non-
governmental organization dedicated to promoting press freedom, staged a
demonstration in Hong Kong Monday -- International Human Rights Day -- to
protest against the Chinese government's suppression of human rights.</P>
      <P>A large flag showing the Olympic rings transformed into handcuffs was revealed
outside the Liaison Office of the Chinese government in Hong  Kong  by  five
RWB  representatives,  including  its secretary-general, Robert Menard.</P>
      <P>One RWB representative said despite China's promise to improve its human rights
situation and press freedom when Beijing was awarded the 2008 Olympics in 2001,
its refusal to give visas to RWB members is evidence of its determination to
keep critics at a distance, which is what prompted the RWB to call for attention
to the situation in China.</P>
      <P>Earlier in August, four RWB representatives, including RWB President Fernando
Castello and Vice President Rubina Mohring, as well as Menard, were arrested and
escorted to the airport for giving an unauthorized news conference outside the
building of the Olympic Games Organizing Committee in Beijing.</P>
      <P>China is notorious for persecuting journalists, cyber-dissidents and free speech
activists, and the situation seems to be worsening, the RWB representatives
said, adding that even though the authorities eased the regulations governing
the work of foreign journalists in January because of the coming Olympic Games,
there have been at least 60 cases of police detaining or obstructing foreign
correspondents since then.</P>
      <P>The RWB representatives said that although it has written several letters to
Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC), asking
for intervention in China's refusal to guarantee freedom of expression and to
respect the Olympic Charter's humanistic values, the IOC has remained silent.</P>
      <P>"We are not trying to spoil a major sports event, but who will be able to say
these games have been a success when thousands of prisoners of conscience
languish in Chinese jails, and who will be able to believe in the `One World,
One Dream' slogan when Tibetan and Uyghur minorities are subject to serious
discrimination? " Menard asked.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has said he will not use anything as an excuse for
imposing martial law.</P>
      <P>There will also be no question of deferring the two critical elections scheduled
for early next year, Chen noted, adding that the Jan. 12 legislative elections
and the March 22 presidential election will take place as originally slated.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Monday in an interview with the Associated Press (AP) . He
gave the interview after meeting with visiting American Institute in Taiwan
Chairman Raymond Burghardt, who is the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>During the interview, AP reporters asked Chen whether he is likely to declare
Taiwan independence before he retires next May to force China to respond before
the Beijing Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>In reply, Chen said some people in Beijing claim he will do something unexpected
during the election season, including declaring independence.</P>
      <P>"This is completely not the case, " Chen said, adding that such rhetoric is just
an intimidation from China and an excuse by China to pressure the United States
to speak against him.</P>
      <P>Rebutting China's accusation, Chen said he has assured Burghardt that Taiwan
will not backpedal and that he will by no means impose martial law or defer the
legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Touching on the planned referendum on the country's bid to join the United
Nations under the name Taiwan, Chen reiterated that as the referendum initiative
has been proposed by grassroots civic groups, he is unlikely to overrule or veto
it. Moreover, he said the referendum is neither a referendum on Taiwan
independence nor a step toward de jure independence.</P>
      <P>On U.S. concern about the ramifications or impact of the U.N. bid referendum,
Chen said he treasures U.S. opinions and is more than willing to communicate
frankly with U.S. authorities over the issue.</P>

foreign caregivers, Tsao said that local employers of foreign caregivers pay the
fund every month for the reduced job opportunities of local disadvantaged

    <HEADLINE>U.S. friendship keeping president from taking drastic move</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)
12/11/07  12:03:53
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he has refrained  from holding  a defensive
referendum  over China's misinterpretation of U.N. Resolution No. 2758 after
taking into consideration U.S. friendship for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Raymond Burghardt, who is the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Also present at the meeting was Stephen
Young, director of the AIT Taipei Office, and other officials.</P>
      <P>China, based on its misinterpretation of the U.N. resolution, has repeatedly
declared at international gatherings that "Taiwan is a province of the People's
Republic of China (PRC) " or "the PRC includes Taiwan and is the only legitimate
government representing China," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that such claims have gravely undermined the present cross-Taiwan Strait
status quo, Chen said he could hold a referendum to defend Taiwan's sovereignty
in line with the country's Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Article 17 of the Referendum Act stipulates that the president is empowered to
call a "defensive" referendum on the country's future whenever its sovereign
status is endangered.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has refrained from doing so out of consideration of the
traditionally cordial, friendly relations between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Referring to a planned referendum on whether Taiwan should apply to join the
United Nations under the name Taiwan, Chen said the initiative was proposed by
grassroots private groups and has received the endorsement of more than 2
million members of the public. "It has nothing to do with the president," he
added.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is now a democratic country ruled by law, Chen said the cannot revoke
such a referendum initiative. "We must follow our constitutional provision and
the stipulations of the Referendum Act," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen further explained that the U.N. bid referendum has two purposes. "First, we
don't like to continually engage in the longstanding battle with China over the
right to represent 'one China' and look forward to joining the U.N. in the name
of Taiwan; second, we want to have our desire to join the U.N. heard by people
around the world through the upcoming referendum," he explained.</P>
      <P>The president further accentuated that the referendum has nothing to do with
changing Taiwan's official title and does not violate his "four noes" pledge.</P>
      <P>"In keeping with custom, we'll hold a flag-raising ceremony on Jan. 1,  2008 to
mark the Republic of China's 97th founding anniversary and I'll definitely
attend the ceremony, as I did in the past, " Chen told his guests.</P>
      <P>He also hailed as a mark of "full respect for Taiwan people's democratic choice"
the remarks by Young and Thomas Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, that the U.S. government will cooperate with
Taiwan's new president no matter who wins the March 22, 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>As to future cross-strait relations, Chen said he cannot possibly influence what
the next Taiwan president may do. "But I here can guarantee that the previous
pledge of 'four noes' I made to the U.S. government and President George W. Bush
would by no means change before my term ends, " he elaborated, adding that
although he was repeatedly nudged by someone to cross the line over the past
more than seven years, he has not done so.</P>
      <P>The "four noes" pledge is a list of things Taipei will not do that could lead to
de jure independence which Beijing has vowed to obstruct by force.</P>
      <P>Burghardt's visit comes as the Taipei-Washington ties hit a nadir over the
contentious U.N. bid referendum that has angered Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the U.S. call for canceling the referendum plan, Chen said he takes seriously
the U.S.  concerns.  While paying  homage to Washington's status as "a faithful
ally, " Chen said the U.S. is misinterpreting the spirit of the U.N. referendum.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. seems to worry excessively, and its understanding of some issues does
not match reality," Chen added.</P>
      <P>The president further said he expected the U.S. to come to Taiwan's aid in the
event China attacked. However, he said Taiwan did not expect Washington to
provide a substitute for Taiwan's own armed forces, and pledged to do everything
in his power to improve their defense capabilities, including implementing a
significant increase in defense spending.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>All that Taiwan's United Nations (U.N.) referendum does is cause trouble, and it
will box in Taiwan's next president, American Institute in Taipei Chairman
Raymond Burghardt said Tuesday, reiterating the United States' opposition to the
referendum.</P>
      <P>"All it [the referendum] does is cause trouble, " Burghardt said in a round
table with members of the local media. The top AIT official is concluding a
visit to Taiwan during which he has met with President Chen Shui-bian,
presidential candidates Ma Ying-jeou and Frank Hsieh, and other political
figures.</P>
      <P>It is the second harsh criticism of the proposed referendum leveled by a U.S.
official within the last two weeks, following Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Thomas Christensen's remarks in a
meeting with members of Taiwan's press Dec. 6 in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Christensen said that the United States supports Taiwan's having a wholesome
democracy but that a bad democracy or a process packaged as democracy is not
true democracy.</P>
      <P>The referendum on the country applying to join the United Nations under the name
Taiwan is a "clever way" of not violating the pledges that President Chen Shui-
bian had made by going through the "back door, " but the United States still
interprets it as a violation, he said.</P>
      <P>Even if it did not go against the "four noes" pledge, it "came pretty close
sometimes, " he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials have described the referendum as a vote against unification
with China and for sovereignty, which is more than the contents of the
referendum itself, he said.</P>
      <P>The United States has the highest regard for Taiwan's democracy, but the
referendum unnecessarily threatens cross-strait stability, which has been the
United States' main concern in the region, he said.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that the United States does value Chen's reassurance Monday of
keeping his promises and ensuring a peaceful transition of power after the
presidential election next year and has asked China to be patient and show self-
restraint ahead of the election.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said his meeting with Chen could be summarized as making sure the new
president, regardless of who it is, has the chance to be his own man to deal
with the cross-straight issue and is not "boxed-in."</P>
      <P>The referendum is not fair to the next president not only because holding the
referendum will make things difficult for him but also because if it is passes,
this will make his job even harder, Burghardt said, adding that the intention of
holding the referendum is to bind the hands of Chen's successor.</P>
      <P>"The referendum also affects the cross-strait atmosphere and the attitude of the
region," he said.</P>
      <P>The results of the referendum will not change Washington's one-China policy,
even though Chen has said passage of the referendum would prove the policy
wrong, Burghardt pointed out.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question regarding how the United States will react to the
results of the referendum, Burghardt said that it will be important to watch and
listen carefully to who says what before, during and after the referendum.
Remarks and responses from Chen, both presidential candidates and other
countries will be closely monitored, he added.</P>
      <P>Burghardt did not directly answer the question posed by a reporter about whether
China has "outsourced" the work of containing Taiwan to the United States, but
he admitted that the Hu Jintao administration has been more adept and
sophisticated in dealing with trilateral relations between the United States,
Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) plans to
set up a NT$40 billion mass transit development fund, with its stake estimated
at NT$800 million, to subsidize bus companies operating in the red in rural
areas in southern Taiwan, an CEPD spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made in an attempt to maintain bus operations in rural areas
nationwide after five bus companies operating in southern Taiwan announced Dec.
22 that they are considering whether to stop serving 150 routes in those areas.</P>
      <P>Those bus companies have officially applied to suspend their services on 89 of
the 150 routes, an official of the Highway Bureau said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the bureau has frequently raised the level of
subsidies given to bus companies operating on routes in remote areas that incur
operational losses because of the small number of passengers using bus services
on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The spokesman noted that over the past few years, the bureau has increased the
subsidies from an annual NT$500 million to NT$600 million, somewhat less than
that demanded by bus operators in rural villages, adding that it is impossible
for the government to provide subsidies to cover all of the losses these
operators incur.</P>
      <P>A CEPD spokesman also said that the government will continue to review its
subsidy mechanism to help operators make ends meet at the most reasonable budget
level.</P>
      <P>The spokesman disclosed the plan to set up a NT$40 billion fund to help bus
companies operating at a loss in remote areas by providing them with subsidies
from interests derived from the fund.</P>
      <P>Contributors to the fund will include government budgets, motor vehicle fuel tax
revenues, revenues from vehicle parking, air pollution control fees and the
proposed traffic-congestion fees.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said that the
Cabinet is striving to tackle these problems by convening meetings between
relevant government agencies and bus operators to protect the rights of
commuters in rural areas.</P>

      <P>The referendum called by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration
on Taiwan's U. N. cause is not aimed at changing the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait, Minister of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) James Huang asserted Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the comments to reporters on a tour of a local temple in the southern
Taiwan city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>Huang said both he and President Chen Shui-bian had clearly explained a day
earlier the government's stance on the issue to visiting American Institute  in
Taiwan (AIT)  Chairman Raymond Burghardt to assuage U.S. concerns during a
meeting in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The government's effort to hold a referendum on whether the country should
pursue U.N. membership in the name of Taiwan is merely an attempt to push the
country to enter the world body as a full member -- something which Huang said
has nothing to do with altering the cross-strait status quo nor what Beijing
calls promoting "de jure" Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, he urged Burghardt to listen to the voices of Taiwan's
people rather than just the opinions of the nation's leaders. In a democracy,
holding a referendum is the best way to explore the views of the people, he
said.</P>
      <P>Reinforcing Taiwan's democracy and cementing public awareness of a "Taiwan-
centric" consciousness are in the common interest of Taiwan and the United
States, and also key to safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region, he
stressed.</P>
      <P>The DPP-initiated  referendum on pushing for Taiwan's U.N. membership will be
held alongside the March 22, 2008 presidential election. Another KMT-proposed
referendum calling for the country's participation at the world body in the name
of the Republic of China will be held at the same time.</P>

      <P>A project to construct a world trade center in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung is slated to be completed by 2010, a city official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The project will be opened up for public bidding later this month, an official
of the Kaohsiung city government's Public Works Bureau said.</P>
      <P>The 4.5-hectare center, which is scheduled to be inaugurated by 2011, will
include a 1,500-booth exhibition hall, the official noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the center will have a 2,000-seat conference room, two 800-seat
conference rooms, four 40-seat conference rooms, and six 20-seat conference
rooms, the official added.</P>
      <P>Due to a lack of a large conference hall and exhibition center in Kaohsiung, the
city's computer and information product exhibitions have had to be held at local
hotels or temporary-erected exhibition venues, the official said.</P>
      <P>International events cannot be held at these venues because they are not large
enough and the traffic access at these sites is limited, the official continued.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has allocated NT$3
billion (US$93 million) for the world trade center construction project and
commissioned the bureau to handle the project, which will kick off in late 2008,
the official said.</P>
      <P>According to the city government's estimates, the world trade center, when
completed, will generate NT$9.2 billion in revenue annually and provide 4,000
job opportunities, the official said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should develop its own distinctive products instead of resorting to cut-
throat price competition, the head of a non-profit R&amp;D organization said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-i, chairman of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) of
Taiwan, made the remarks after being invited by a high-tech company to speak on
innovation and acquiring a competitive edge at the Taipei International
Convention Center.</P>
      <P>Lin said the value-added rate of Taiwan products is too low. Although many of
Taiwan's products have the lion's share of world markets, they generate little
profit, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out features characterizing the manufacturing industry in recent
years, which include a great variety, low demand, short life cycles, high
R&amp;D costs, high quality, low prices, short time spans for delivery, a
shortage of human resources,  increased investment in equipment and low profit
generation.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that even the "worst of times will provide great opportunities,"
urging Taiwanese businesses to focus on upgrading the value of their products.</P>
      <P>He said that South Korean businesses have long heeded this trend and dedicated
themselves to the research and development of key materials, parts and
components.</P>
      <P>In comparison,  Taiwan manufacturers continue to engage in cut-throat price
competition. Even if manufacturers relocate to China or Vietnam, they
nonetheless maintain the same pattern of low-price competition instead of
focusing on establishing their own brand name products.</P>
      <P>"If the trend continues, even if Taiwan manufacturers relocate to Africa, the
chances of them making big profits will be minimal, " he added.</P>
      <P>He cited, as an example, the market share of Taiwan's notebook computers, which
is as high as 90 percent, while the profit margin continues to be a mere 4
percent.</P>
      <P>"If we can't upgrade the value we bring, we can't upgrade our competitive edge,"
he stressed.</P>
      <P>"The declining value-added rate of Taiwan's major manufacturing industry is
worrisome," he said.</P>
      <P>The value-added rate of Taiwan's electronic parts and components was cut to 17.1
percent in 2005 from 32 percent in 1999; the value-added rate in the parts and
components of the textile industry was cut to 22.7 percent from 28.2 percent; in
the computer and communication and audio-video electronic products, it was cut
from 20 percent to 11.4 percent during the same period.</P>
      <P>The value-added rate of Taiwan's overall manufacturing industry fell to 20.8
percent in 2004 from 27.7 percent in 1999. In comparison, the value-added rate
was cut from 24.3 percent to 23.7 percent in South Korea, and from 34.5 percent
to 32.9 percent in the United States.</P>
      <P>He said this shows that key technologies and marketing channels remain in the
hands of other countries, and that even if some Taiwanese products retain the
greater share of global markets, the profits generate are minimal.</P>

      <P>The four men who died in a single-car accident in Taoyuan County early Tuesday
are suspected of being victims of drunken and reckless driving because all had a
strong odor of alcohol, said a spokesman for the county police.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the four victims -- Chiang Yen-tai, Chiang Yen-tsung, Chien
Chuan-shou and Lin Chih-chung -- died horrific deaths when their car, traveling
at a high speed, crashed into four utility poles before coming to a stop.</P>
      <P>He said all four occupants in the car were thrown out of the heavily damaged
vehicle and died of crushed skulls and other serious injuries on the spot. It
was not known who was driving.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the four men had apparently been drinking heavily late Monday
night before traveling by car across the Kanchin Bridge in the Dahsi township of
Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>He said the car was obviously traveling at an extremely high speed on a
downward-sloping stretch of the road when the driver lost control of the car,
causing it to veer off the road and crash into the electrical poles.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bian cited restaurants and volunteers promoting a tobacco-
free environment Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a citation-presentation ceremony held at Taipei City Hall, Hau noted that
since the country's Tobacco Hazard Control Act was implemented in 1997, Taipei
City government has been promoting an indoor tobacco-free environment in many
public places, including restaurants, with the assistance of civic
organizations, including the John Tung Foundation.</P>
      <P>To date, there are more than 2,600 restaurants around Taipei in which smoking is
forbidden, and 311 working places in the city with indoor places free of
tobacco, Hau said, adding that those results are the best for any city in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hau stressed that cigarettes contain some 4,000 chemicals, of which more than 40
are carcinogenic in humans, citing the study conducted by Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States as saying that people exposed
to second-hand smoking environment will have a 30 percent higher chance of
getting cancer.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is a world trend towards creating tobacco-free environments,
Hau said many places, including California, Minnesota and Hong Kong are even
promoting the creation of an outdoor tobacco-free environment. Hau added that
there is still much room for improvement in Taipei City in this regard.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by Taipei Medical University, more than 70
percent of the public is satisfied with the campaign to promote tobacco-free
restaurants, while 85 percent of the people support continuing such campaigns.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Hau also presented certificates to restaurants which newly
joined the list of tobacco-free places and gave citations to volunteers who have
promoted a tobacco-free outdoor environment, in places including parks, plazas
and zoos.</P>

      <P>American Institute in Taipei Chairman Raymond Burghardt's latest remarks were
aimed at placating China, sources at the Presidential Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The sources were responding to Burghardt's remarks at a news conference prior to
his departure earlier the same day after a short visit to Taiwan during which he
said Taiwan's U.N. referendum causes trouble.</P>
      <P>The top U.S. liaison official in the absence of diplomatic ties also said the
referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan is a
"clever way" of not violating the pledges that President Chen Shui-bian had made
by going through the "backdoor", but the United States still interprets it as a
violation of those pledges.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the Department of Public Affairs of the Presidential
Office, refused to comment on Burghardt's remarks.</P>
      <P>Yang said President Chen exchanged views with Burghardt Monday on issues of
mutual concerns, and there is no need to respond to Burghardt's latest remarks.</P>
      <P>But Presidential Office sources said that Burghardt's remarks were aimed at
placating China, saying that its message is "to ask China to exercise self-
restraint" and "to let the United States do the talking.'</P>
      <P>Burghardt's remarks were also aimed at letting the people of Taiwan know the
stance of the U.S., and "to see if it will drive down the turnout rate, " the
sources said, adding that Burghardt said that the results of the referendum will
not change Washington's one-China policy, even though Chen has said passage of
the referendum would prove the policy wrong.</P>
      <P>The sources said that the planned referendum will not be dropped, noting that
President Chen, in an interview with the Associated Press Monday, said that
holding the referendum is aimed more at "domestic factors, " and that he
believes it will galvanize the public to forge a national consensus on pursuing
U.N. membership under the name Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Exports of information and communications technology (ICT) products accounted
for 49.5 percent of Taiwan's total exports, worth US$201.4 billion, from January
to October, indicating that the industry has become a prime mover of Taiwan's
economy, an economic official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
said the figure shows an obvious increase from the 34 percent of US$224 billion
in exports in 2006.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks at an annual assembly meeting of the Taipei Computer
Association (TCA) in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The ICT industry had up to 1.3 million employees during the same period, which
was about half of personnel in manufacturing industry and 13 percent among the
overall number of nationwide employees, Ho said.</P>
      <P>She went on that about one-third of gross fixed capital formation of private
sector during the entire year was from the same industry.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ho noted that the TCA and the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers'  Association (TEEMA)  have made great contributions to Taiwan's
economic development, noting that the two associations' member firms comprise
nearly all of the ICT firms in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Closely related to ICT industry's development, the semiconductor and image
display industries, heavily promoted by the government have each performed
excellently in global markets, with output values in packaging and testing, and
large-sized panel sectors both ranking the first in the world, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ho also spoke of her hope that local enterprises will invest more in ICT-related
fields showing great potential for future development, such as wireless
broadband, digital technologies, healthcare, and green industries.</P>

      <P>No voting format other than the "one-step" procedure designed by the Central
Election Commission (CEC) will be permitted in the Jan. 12, 2008 legislative
elections and two accompanying referendums, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in a Cabinet meeting on public order while giving a
speech thanking police officers nationwide for their hard work.</P>
      <P>With only a month left for the legislative elections in which a more complex
"single-member constituency, two-vote" system will be implemented alongside the
holding of two referendums, Chang said that it is extremely critical to maintain
fair and smooth operations in the coming polls and asserted that "no other
scheme than the CEC-designed 'one-step' voting format will be allowed."</P>
      <P>Chang also demanded that mafia-organized election rigging and vote buying must
be wiped out so as to maintain orderly elections and select well qualified
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Although the CEC decided in Nov. 16 to adopt a "one-step" voting format for the
January polls, 18 local governments controlled by the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) have declared that they will adopt a "two-step" voting scheme to avoid
what they called the "woes" of the "one-step" voting process.</P>

    <HEADLINE>18% of TFCF-supported families getting out of poverty: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Approximately 18 percent of disadvantaged families supported by the private
Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) have climbed out of poverty over
the past two years, according to a report released Tuesday by the TFCF and the
Chinatrust Charity Foundation.</P>
      <P>That figure includes 9.2 percent of families who are no longer listed as low-
income households, 6.3 percent that have stopped receiving TFCF sponsorship and
2.4 percent that have seen their situation improved although they remain on the
list of low-income households, the report said.</P>
      <P>The Chinatrust Charity Foundation has since 2004 financed the TFCF's poverty-
reduction program with donations collected through the foundation's "Light Up
the Life" fund-raising campaign. The report, which sums up the achievements of
the poverty-reduction program over the past two years, is based on a survey
carried out between September and October among 210 families and 446 children
receiving help under the program.</P>
      <P>TFCF tallies show that 2,148 families and 5,259 children joined the TFCF's
poverty-reduction program between January and September this year, meaning that,
on average, one impoverished child appeared on the poverty rolls in Taiwan every
75 minutes.</P>
      <P>Forty-five percent of the children were elementary students and approximately 80
percent were from single-parent families. More than 50 percent of the parents
from these families were from the 36-45 age group, and 31.3 percent were
jobless.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  56.9 percent of these families made less than NT$15,000 (US$464) per
month -- barely one-third of the average monthly earnings of NT$52,994 by
Taiwanese households, the tallies indicate.</P>
      <P>According to TFCF CEO Wang Ming-jen, the poverty-reduction program has
successfully increased the employment rate among parents receiving help from
70.3 percent to 83.7 percent over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The survey finds that nearly 90 percent of enrolled families have seen their
financial status stabilize since joining the program and that more than 60
percent have seen their income increase, by NT$5,026 per month on average.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 57.2 percent of parents acquired the vocational skills for which they
are currently employed through the program, 58.6 percent now have more money to
spend on their children, with the increase averaging NT$3,715 per month.</P>
      <P>Despite increasing incomes, TFCF-supported families still make only NT$15,878
per month on average, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The 23rd Light Up the Life fund-raising campaign is being held from Dec. 5 to
March 4, with the goal of collecting NT$70 million. People intending to make a
donation can call the Chinatrust Charity Foundation's hotline at 0800-001-100.</P>

      <P>The closure of Alexander Health Club -- Taiwan's largest fitness chain with a
26-year history -- is merely an "isolated case, " according to Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh.</P>
      <P>Ho said Monday that the closure does not mean that Taiwan's economy is in
decline.</P>
      <P>She said that the government predicted that this year's economic growth rate
would each 5.46 percent and that the government made its prediction based on the
real situation.</P>
      <P>Ho said that judging from the information available at present, Alexander's
financial deficit seems to have resulted from the rapid expansion of its
operations.</P>
      <P>Local enterprises should adjust business models as they develop and grow, Ho
said, adding that the management of cash flows is very critical for chain
companies that charge membership fees.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks after Candy Tang, founder and chairwoman of the club with
more than 20 branches throughout Taiwan and five branches in China, announced
the closure of the club earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Tang explained that the club had used revenues earned in China to help address
the club's financial straits in Taiwan, but the club has had to cease operations
as it could no longer sustain further losses.</P>
      <P>The health club had generated revenues of some NT$2 billion (US$61.8 million)
annually.</P>

      <P>The government will look into the case to see if the health club has used their
profits gained in Taiwan to invest in China illegally, while leaving debts in
Taiwan unaddressed, Shieh noted.</P>
      <P>Citing media reports, Shieh said that the health club's branches in China are
still operating, which has raised concerns in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The remarks came one day after Candy Tang, founder and chairwoman of the
Taiwan's largest fitness chain with a 26-year history, said that the company
could not continue operating in the red despite an injection of funds from its
branches in China into local operations.</P>
      <P>The club has more than 20 branches throughout Taiwan and five branches in China.</P>

president has made the greatest contribution to Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>According to the public opinion poll conducted by the United Daily News, 55
percent of the respondents cited late President Chiang Ching-kuo as the one who
made the greatest contribution to Taiwan, while 11 percent pointed to former
President Lee Teng-hui. Some 6 percent signaled late President Chiang Kai-shek,
slightly ahead of 5 percent who mentioned incumbent President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Kuo Su-chuan opined that Chen should conduct in-

      <P>The Directorate General of Highways (DGH) announced Tuesday that it had reached
agreement with five bus companies in southern Taiwan to scrap plans to end bus

      <P>DGH Director Chen Jin-yuan said that after days of talks, bus company operators

      <P>Chen said the government had originally planned to subsidize bus companies to
the tune of NT$550 million (US$17.02 million) for 2008, but the Executive Yuan
later agreed to use provisional funds to cover up to 80 percent of the losses
incurred by the bus companies that service the routes.</P>
      <P>The subsidies will be increased to NT$720 million, or 80 percent of the subsides
requested by the bus operators, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. public divided on intervening in cross-strait conflict: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Americans are divided on the question of whether the United States should
intervene in the event of a cross-Taiwan Strait military conflict triggered by a
declaration of independence by Taiwan, according to the results of a survey
released Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey, coordinated by the national non-partisan, non-profit Committee of
100, found that 49 percent of U.S. Congressional staffers agree that the U.S.
should intervene in such a conflict, while only 32 percent of ordinary U.S.
citizens, 31 percent of opinion leaders, and 23 percent of business leaders
agree that it should.</P>
      <P>The survey, titled "Hope and Fear: American and Chinese Attitudes Toward Each
Other, " was conducted between mid August and mid September in the United States
and China and covered a wide range of issues, including bilateral trade and
economic relations, product safety, climate change, the rise of China, and the
Taiwan issue, to name a few. Those surveyed included members of the general
pubic in both countries, as well as business and opinion leaders, and U.S.
Congressional staffers.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the United States should play a more active role in
cross-strait relations, 64 percent of Congressional staffers said they agree
that it should, while 57 percent of U.S. opinion leaders, 54 percent of business
leaders and 46 percent of ordinary citizens said that it should. All the figures
marked increases over those in a similar survey conducted in 2005, with the
ratio of Congressional staffers supporting a more active U.S. role registering
the steepest rise at over five percentage points.</P>
      <P>As to whether  the United  States should intervene  in a cross-strait military
conflict triggered by a Taiwan declaration of independence, the percentages of
business leaders and opinion leaders supporting the notion both marked sharp
drops of over 20 percentage points from the level in the 2005 survey, while the
ratio of Congressional staffers and ordinary citizens supporting the concept
remained roughly the same in the two surveys.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the results, Li Cheng, a senior researcher at the Brookings
Institution who supervised the survey, told CNA that he believes the sharp drop
in the percentage of business leaders and opinion leaders supporting U.S.
military intervention is related to U.S. and Chinese economic interests as well
as to recent provocative moves by Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>He also attributed the high level of support for Taiwan among Congressional
staffers to the successful efforts of pro-Taiwan lobby groups in Washington,
D.C.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  among Chinese citizens surveyed, 53 percent of business leaders and
ordinary citizens said they believe the Taiwan issue is currently moving toward
a peaceful resolution, while 32 percent of opinion leaders in the country said
they feel the Taiwan issue reaches a deadlock.</P>
      <P>Asked how China should work to solve the Taiwan issue, a majority of Chinese,
including 66 percent of opinion leaders, 57 percent of business leaders and 52
percent of ordinary citizens, said expanding exchanges with Taiwan is the most
appropriate way to reach the aim of eventual unity.</P>
      <P>The survey in the United States, which was conducted via telephone interviews
with 1,200 American adults nationwide, has a margin of error of plus or minus
2.9 percentage points, while the survey in China,  which was carried  out
through face-to-face interviews with 4,104 Chinese adults around the country,
has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of gender equality groups in Taiwan said Tuesday that they will file a
complaint against an education official who made a series of sexually
discriminatory remarks offensive to women and the gay community.</P>
      <P>They pointed out at a press conference that they strongly disagreed with the
venomous and utterly puerile remarks by Chuang Kuo-jung, secretary-general of
the Ministry of Education, against opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate
Ma Ying-jeou and Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>In a series of verbal assaults in the past few days, Chuang ridiculed Ma -- a
politician with a public image of civility, good temperament and gentlemanliness
-- as being effeminate and lacking masculine qualities. He also said the Taipei
mayor "looked very much like a gay." His remarks were televised nationwide.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chao-yuan, secretary-general of the Awakening Foundation -- a non-profit
organization promoting women's rights -- said she was disappointed that a senior
education official had set such a bad example by ignoring the Gender Equality
Education Law initiated by his own ministry.</P>
      <P>The law, promulgated in 2004, requires schools to devote at least eight hours
per semester to gender-equality courses.</P>
      <P>Lai You-mei, secretary-general of the Taiwan Gender Equality Education
Association, said Chuang's remarks ruined years of efforts by teachers to
promote gender equality in accordance with the Gender Equality Education Law.</P>
      <P>She added that Chuang's remarks depicting women and gay people as "not behaving
themselves" would make female students, as well as gay students, feel uneasy.</P>
      <P>Lai deplored that to date, the Ministry of Education has made no response to
Chuang's discriminatory remarks.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association president, who is known by the pseudonym
Gofyy, said Chuang's deep-rooted patriarchal gender bias and his trotting out of
sexual stereotypes dealt a heavy blow to front-line gender education workers and
to Taiwan's gay rights movement. The association is a gay and lesbian rights
group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Compulsory vehicle insurance rates to be lowered: FSC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has decided to lower
compulsory vehicle insurance rates from next March by an average of 3.78
percent, an FSC official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Premiums for motorcycles will have an average decrease of 1.12 percent, while
those for cars will see a 4.49 percent decrease, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under the new policy and taking the hypothesis of a new insurance case for an
insurant aged between 30-60 without a record of car accidents, a male insurant
will have his insurance rate for a private car lowered by 6.21 percent,
representing a saving of NT$122 (US$3.8) of the total NT$1,964 premium for one
year.</P>
      <P>A female insurant under the same hypothesis will save NT$112 from a decrease of
6.1 percent, the official said.</P>
      <P>Insured scooters with premium payments of one-year and two-year periods will
have a 4.82 percent and 5.27 percent decrease, respectively.</P>
      <P>The official said 100 percent of cars and 96 percent of motorcycles  have
compulsory  liability  insurance.  The slight adjustment of premium rates is to
reduce the public's financial burden, although certain cars with high damage
rates should have premium rates increased, he said.</P>
      <P>The current Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance Act took effect in 1998
and has gone through five decreases in premium rates from 2001-2006, with a
cumulative decrease of 22 percent, the official said.</P>
      <P>The new insurance premium policy was proposed by the Taiwan Insurance Institute
and approved by an examination committee of impartial individuals, the official
added.</P>

      <P>Efforts by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to make domestic universities more
globalized have borne fruit by attracting an increasing number of foreigners to
study in Taiwan, Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the MOE, Tu said the globalization of local
universities is an important policy as it has increased the number of foreign
students coming to Taiwan from 1,960 in 2004 to 5,266 in 2007.</P>
      <P>Tu encouraged universities to create a bilingual environment so as to attract
more foreign students to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also urged the 12 universities which have obtained huge subsidies from the
government to upgrade the level of their foreign student affairs departments to
push for educational exchanges with other countries.</P>
      <P>One student from the United States who attended the press conference said he is
a computer engineer who developed an interest in language learning.</P>
      <P>He first learned Dutch and German, but later began to learn Chinese and
calligraphy from an artistic angle. Finding the Chinese language to be very
interesting, he said he decided to concentrate on studying Chinese and came to
Taiwan for this purpose, taking the Chinese name Lee Ai-hsi.</P>
      <P>Lee said he chose to come to Taiwan to learn traditional Chinese characters, as
the simplified Chinese characters used in China have distorted the meaning of
the Chinese characters.</P>
      <P>Another student from Burkina Faso who studies in a postgraduate program at Ming
Chuan University, said he was grateful to have the chance to study in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese academic forecast here Monday that Taiwan's opposition "pan-blue
alliance" will take 71 legislative seats in the Jan. 12, 2008 elections, ahead
of 39 seats taken by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-li, a researcher with Academia Sinica -- the highest research institute
in Taiwan -- issued his speculation in a seminar sponsored  by the Washington-
based  Center  for Strategic  and International Studies.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the "pan-blue alliance" of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party is likely to seize 71
legislative seats in the polls -- 48 regional seats, 18 at-large seats and five
aboriginal seats -- accounting for 62.8 percent of the 113-member 7th
legislature.</P>
      <P>On the other side, he said he expects the DPP to win just 39 seats -- 25
regional seats, 13 at-large seats and one aboriginal seat -- accounting for 34.5
percent of the total.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , an ally of the DPP in the "pan-green camp,"
might win 3 regional seats, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu based his speculation on the two camps' performances in major elections from
2004-2006,  including the 2004 legislative  and presidential polls, the 2005
provincial city and county chief elections and the 2006 special municipality
mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Judging from this possible outcome, Wu said January's legislative polls will
mark a watershed in Taiwan's political spectrum.</P>
      <P>First, the "pan-blue alliance" will further cement its power base in northern,
central and most eastern regions, while the DPP will prevail in southern Taiwan
-- a development Wu claimed indicates "a serious rift in local society."</P>
      <P>Secondly, he predicted, small parties such as the TSU, the New Party and the
PFP, will all disappear from the domestic political map.</P>
      <P>However, Wu declined to predict the outcome of the March 22, 2008 presidential
election, saying that "a host of variants" remain.</P>
      <P>DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh is competing with his KMT rival, Ma Ying-

      <P>The Tamsui Historical Museum in the northern county of Taipei received an award
Tuesday for its efforts to help establish an English-language environment in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The museum is one of some 100 government agencies and public places to receive
such an award from the Cabinet-level Research, Development, Evaluation
Commission (RDEC).</P>
      <P>The honor came after the RDEC recently conducted a review of the agencies and
places as part of the government's efforts to better serve foreigners in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a recent survey conducted by the RDEC on foreign
tourists to Taiwan, 61.7 percent of the people interviewed -- up 3.8 percentage
points from last year -- said that they are satisfied with the country's
English-language environment.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that 50.3 percent of the respondents -- up 3.2 percent --
noted that they are pleased with the English services provided by Taiwan's
government agencies.</P>
      <P>In order to provide a better service to international tourists, the Tamsui
Historical  Museum  has also constructed  friendly environments for Japanese and
Spanish speakers, said Chang Bao-chuan, an official at the county's Cultural
Affairs Bureau who is in charge of establishing the English-language environment
for the museum.</P>
      <P>At the 2007 English Carnival currently taking place at the Taipei Show Hall Two
in downtown Taipei City, the museum has built a special area equipped with
English-language multimedia, said Yu Chen-hua, head of the museum.</P>
      <P>Within that area, visitors will be able to experience a day in the life of the
British consul in his official residence in Tamsui during the 19th century, Yu
noted.</P>
      <P>The residence has become a popular tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the area will also be able to experience British tea culture, sample
royal British tea and snacks, and play tennis on a Nintendo Wii, a popular video
game console, Yu added.</P>

      <P>The Tamsui Historical Museum in the northern county of Taipei received an award
Tuesday for its efforts to help establish an English-language environment in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The museum is one of some 100 government agencies and public places to receive
such an award from the Cabinet-level Research, Development, Evaluation
Commission (RDEC).</P>
      <P>The honor came after the RDEC recently conducted a review of the agencies and
places as part of the government's efforts to better serve foreigners in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a recent survey conducted by the RDEC on foreign
tourists to Taiwan, 61.7 percent of the people interviewed -- up 3.8 percentage
points from last year -- said that they are satisfied with the country's
English-language environment.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that 50.3 percent of the respondents -- up 3.2 percent --
noted that they are pleased with the English services provided by Taiwan's
government agencies.</P>
      <P>In order to provide a better service to international tourists, the Tamsui
Historical  Museum  has also constructed  friendly environments for Japanese and
Spanish speakers, said Chang Bao-chuan, an official at the county's Cultural
Affairs Bureau who is in charge of establishing the English-language environment
for the museum.</P>
      <P>At the 2007 English Carnival currently taking place at the Taipei Show Hall Two
in downtown Taipei City, the museum has built a special area equipped with
English-language multimedia, said Yu Chen-hua, head of the museum.</P>
      <P>Within that area, visitors will be able to experience a day in the life of the
British consul in his official residence in Tamsui during the 19th century, Yu
noted.</P>
      <P>The residence has become a popular tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the area will also be able to experience British tea culture, sample
royal British tea and snacks, and play tennis on a Nintendo Wii, a popular video
game console, Yu added.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday that the government hopes agricultural,
fishery and poultry products adopting the traceability system will account for
10 percent of all such products produced next year.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a weekly meeting of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said the government has set 2008 as agriculture produce safety year, hoping
that 10 percent of agricultural products will adopt the management system next
year and that all products will adopt the system by 2015.</P>
      <P>The traceability system of agriculture produce is a high-tech measure that has
been adopted by many advanced countries to manage and record product information
from production to processing and logistics, which helps trace product
responsibility, guarantee food quality and offer consumers clear information on
the food they buy.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the government attaches great importance to agricultural
development and welfare of the farmers. It has mapped out a draft agriculture
basic law to help Taiwan's agricultural sector cope with the impact and
challenges posed by globalization, liberalization as well as global warming
effect, he added.</P>
      <P>Under the draft law, the traditional agricultural industry will be transformed
into high value-added industry, and agriculture will serve multiple functions in
terms of food production and ecology, he said.</P>

      <P>However,  it attached an additional resolution to the FTA demanding that the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs use only the nation's formal title -- the Republic
of China -- without adding the name Taiwan when signing similar accords with
other diplomatic allies in the future. This requirement is not applicable to
countries without formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-El Salvador/Honduras FTA will be referred to the coming legislative
plenary meeting for substantial screening.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hsieh Wen-ting said that the KMT legislative caucus proposed
attaching the additional resolution after the various parties failed to forge a
consensus in two meetings called by ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung to discuss whether the designation of the ROC (Taiwan)
should be used when clinching FTAs with diplomatic partners.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, adding the word Taiwan to bilateral pacts can provide a good
reference for countries with which Taiwan has no diplomatic relations and can
also offer a way of "thinking out of the box." Hsu said he has reservations
about the KMT-proposed resolution and will continue exchanging views with other
lawmakers on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan urged to show more concern for Chinese dissidents</HEADLINE>

      <P>Reporters  Without Borders  (RWB) Secretary-General and founder Robert Menard
voiced hope Wednesday that Taiwan will show more concern for the plight of
Chinese dissidents.</P>
      <P>Menard made the call in an interview with CNA after a visit to the Association
of Taiwan  Journalists  for talks with local journalists to gain a better
understanding of the state of Taiwan's media.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Menard recalled a trip he made to China in January, saying
that during that visit, he handed over to the Beijing authorities a list of
names of over 80 imprisoned Chinese dissidents and asked the communist regime to
release them in time for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games slated for Aug. 8-24.</P>
      <P>Menard said Beijing had made some promises and actually released several
dissidents. However, they were released only because they had completed their
prison terms, he noted, adding that in fact, Beijing had done nothing.</P>
      <P>Menard said the RWB has been concerned about the human rights situation in China
for a long time.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Taiwan, he praised it as one of the few democratic Asian countries
and voiced hope that the country, which shares a common cultural background with
China, will pay more attention to China's human rights problems.</P>
      <P>Menard had planned to hold a demonstration a few days earlier with other RWB
members in Beijing in protest China's failure to fulfill its promises to improve
human rights and press freedom made while seeking the right to host the
Olympics. However, China rejected his visa application, he said.</P>
      <P>Menard arrived in Taiwan Tuesday for a four-day visit.</P>
      <P>RWB,  founded  in  1985  in  Paris,  is  an international non-governmental
organization advocating freedom of the press. The organization now has branches
and offices on five continents.</P>
      <P>The group issues the Worldwide Press Freedom Index annually to measure the
degree of freedom journalists and media have in more than 160 countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
said Wednesday that he felt heartened when American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Raymond Burghardt said Taiwan's U.N. bid referendum will "box in"
Taiwan's next president.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Burghardt, the top U.S. liaison official with Taiwan in the absence
of diplomatic relations, meant well and was speaking on his behalf.</P>
      <P>He was referring to remarks by Burghardt prior to his departure from Taiwan
after a brief visit during which he reiterated U.S. opposition to Taiwan's plan
to hold a U.N. referendum alongside the March 22 presidential election, saying
it causes trouble and could tie the hands of the next president.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said that whether Hsieh or his rival, Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition
Kuomintang, wins the election, "he deserves to be his own man and should not be
boxed in by statements made now," referring to the referendum, which could hold
the danger of limiting Taiwan's freedom to maneuver with Beijing.</P>
      <P>At a news conference to unveil his new book, titled In Pursuit of Victory in
Adversity, Hsieh also said the United States is a good friend of Taiwan, and
that "one should listen to the advice of a good friend."</P>
      <P>He also said that "it will not be the first time the United States has voiced
its opposition, and that a series of other expressions toward Taiwan's
referendum on U.N. membership will come."</P>
      <P>He also distanced himself from President Chen Shui-bian, saying that he has
known Chen for 20 years, during which they have competed and cooperated with
each other.</P>
      <P>"I know clearly that the president decides the direction of the nation prior to
May 20, 2008, but it will be my decision after that if I am elected," Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>On cross-Taiwan Strait relations, he said that "Taiwan should see the window of
opportunity in its adversity."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Taiwan, being small, has to display wisdom in dealing with
China, while China should show tolerance and compromise.</P>
      <P>He noted that both sides of the Taiwan Strait "had good communication" in the
1990s, noting that China was not so strong as it is now.</P>
      <P>The compromise of the strong demonstrates tolerance, and co-existence is not for
the ears of Taiwan, but also for China, he said.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan is in chaos due to long-term squabbling between the
ruling and opposition parties and that there is a "dearth of trust in society
with no long-term optimism and collective sense of happiness among the public."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is at a critical juncture in terms of moving toward peace or
deteriorating into chaos. If the situation is not handled well, the chaos could
turn into crisis, "with the possibility that China could step in to clear up the
mess," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has to act with caution and wisdom in the adversity, and should build up
its strength, as well as combine "soft power" such as freedom, democracy and
culture.</P>
      <P>He also said that if more international organizations recognize Taiwan, it will
help the country's security.</P>
      <P>If elected president, he said, he will try to mend fences with the United States
over the eroded trust between the two nations due to the contentious referendum
plan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's eight export processing zones (EPZs) attracted a total of NT$44.4
billion (US$1.37 billion) worth of investment in the first eleven months of this
year, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Sheng-ba, director general of the MOEA's Export Processing Zone
Administration,  said  the figure  is higher  than  the administration's
original target of NT$35.2 billion for the whole year.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, Taiwan established its first exporting processing zone in
1966 in the southern port city of Kaohsiung. He said that over the years, the
country's EPZs have transformed from traditional-industry based to high-tech
industry based.</P>
      <P>Due to their successful development, Taiwan's EPZs have become a model followed
by many developing countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Tseng noted that currently, a total of 330 enterprises have established

    <TEXT>
      <P>The business sector expressed welcome Wednesday to an Executive Yuan motion
authorizing relevant public offices to cancel or adjust downward  business taxes
on four categories of imported basic commodities.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that zero or lower levels of business tax imposed on imported basic
commodities, including wheat,  barley, corn and soybeans, will help alleviate
pressure on domestic traders caused by skyrocketing commodity prices on the
international market, Executive Yuan officials said.</P>
      <P>Soaring prices of wheat, barley, corn and soybeans have caused a direct impact
on local traders, particularly those who deal in flour, cooking oil, bread and
animal feed.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed in a regular weekly meeting a motion authorizing
government agencies to slash or adjust downward the 5 percent business tax on
the commodities, based on their prices including cost, insurance and freight.</P>
      <P>At present, imports of soybeans, corn and barley are duty free, and only wheat
imports have an import tariff of 3.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Most of the flour, animal feed and cooking oil traders welcomed the Executive
Yuan initiative, saying the policy is a positive move in terms of stabilizing
commodity prices and controlling inflation.</P>
      <P>Some, however, lamented that there are too many factors causing their costs to
surge,  with spiraling  grain  prices  on the international market being the
main culprit.</P>
      <P>They forecast that flour prices will continue to rise in December, after rises
in October and November.</P>

      <P>Eighty-eight percent of school children surveyed recently by the Child Welfare
League Foundation (CWLF) identified themselves as cyber game players, with many
playing on weekdays, according to the results of the survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out between Oct. 16 and Nov. 2 among 1,818 fifth- and
sixth-graders and students in the first and second years of junior high school.</P>
      <P>The results show that on weekdays,  18.5 percent  of the respondents play cyber
games for more than three hours per day, while 3.9 percent use the Internet for
over eight hours per day.</P>
      <P>On weekends, 43.8 percent of the respondents said they spend more than three
hours per day playing cyber games, with 13.4 percent playing for more than eight
hours per day.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 10 percent said they tend to continue play after midnight.</P>
      <P>On the reasons for spending so much time on games, 62 percent of the respondents
said they do so to kill time, while 51.6 percent said they just follow what
their friends and classmates do, 50 percent said the games relieve stress, 70
percent said they enjoy the fantasy aspect, and 72 percent said they feel the
game characters are part of themselves.</P>
      <P>The results indicate that many children turn to cyber games for fun and a sense
of achievement because their lives are mundane and frustrating, CWLF officials
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CWLF claimed that children who play cyber games face four major
potential crises: exposure to violent content, susceptibility  to Internet
addiction,  dangerous  contact with strangers and involvement in criminal
activities.</P>
      <P>While approximately 70 percent of the cyber games popular among children are not
rated, the survey results show that 20.14 percent of cyber game players have a
preference for games with adult content.</P>
      <P>On the risk of Internet addiction, the CWLF said 25.8 percent of the respondents
display symptoms of addiction, while the ratio of children with symptoms reaches
47.3 percent among those who play online games.</P>
      <P>On the risk of dangerous contact with strangers, the results show that 61.1
percent of those polled said they will chat with unknown partners while playing
games online.</P>
      <P>Over 22 percent of the respondents will have further interaction, including
exchanging phone calls, making friends and developing romantic  relationships.
In particular,  15.6 percent  of the respondents said they meet friends online.</P>
      <P>On the risk of involvement in criminal activities, the survey results show that
27.2 percent of the respondents have used illegal plugins to extend their games,
13.9 percent have stolen other people's user names to play online games and 13.5
percent have used false identities to cheat virtual goods out of others.</P>

      <P>CAA officials made the remarks after its probe of the incident, saying that
Taitung air traffic controllers had not provided timely information to the pilot
of a Daily Air plane that six jet fighters were approaching, resulting in the
pilot having little time to respond to the unexpected situation.</P>
      <P>The officials said the incident showed that coordination between military and
civil aviation needs to be reviewed.</P>
      <P>At issue is a Nov. 29 incident in which six F-5F and F-5E fighters were
returning in formation to Chihhang Airbase in Taitung in eastern Taiwan. The
pilot of the Daily Air plane, one minute after taking off from Fengnien Airport
in Taitung on way to Green Island, was startled to see the fighters pass nearby.</P>
      <P>The pilot protested to the air traffic controllers after arriving at Green
Island.</P>
      <P>The probe by the CAA officials showed that the six military jets were flying at
an altitude of 1,500 feet as they prepared to land, while the Daily Air plane
was at 1,000 feet, CAA officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that air controllers twice informed military jets that a
civilian aircraft was to take off, but failed to inform the Daily Air pilot of
the incoming military planes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, air traffic control officials said that the military and civil planes
maintained a "safe distance" and that there was no risk of a collision as had

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that French President Nicolas Sarkozy's
recent remarks opposing Taiwan's planned referendum on its quest for U.N.
representation under the name Taiwan violates France's founding spirit.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during the meeting with Robert Menard, secretary-general
of the Reporters without Borders, a Paris-based non-governmental organization
dedicated to promoting freedom of the press, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen told Menard that Taiwan expects to hold a referendum alongside the
presidential election next March on whether the country should join the United
Nations under the name Taiwan. This move is mainly intended to proclaim to the
world the common desire of the 23 million people of Taiwan to join the U.N, the
president explained.</P>
      <P>That proposal has encountered opposition from several countries, including
France, with Sarkozy expressing his opposition during a recent visit to China.</P>
      <P>Sarkozy's opposition was stated under pressure from China and in hopes of
economic benefits for France, Chen said, stressing that his expression of
opposition to Taiwan's referendum clearly violates France's founding spirits of
freedom, democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Noting that the holding of referendums is a basic human right, Chen said the
French people also enjoy this right and that many national referendums have been
held during the Fifth Republic, including referendums on issues whether or not
France should accept or reject the proposed European Union Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen also mentioned that Menard was denied entry by Chinese authorities on Dec.
10, the world's Human Rights Day, before coming to Taiwan. Menard's China visit
was originally aimed at protesting against insufficient protection of freedom of
the press in China.</P>
      <P>Denying Menard entry to China reflects Beijing's widespread and unceasing
repression of the press, so it is no wonder that China consistently trails the
world in rankings of press freedom, Chen stressed.</P>

workers stationed in China from 2008, narrowing the gap in salaries paid to
workers on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to 1.38-fold on average at
present, down from an average 1.57-fold during the period from 1991-1994.</P>

      <P>In the early 1990s, some 5 percent of China-based Taiwanese employees enjoyed
triple the pay of colleagues doing similar work in Taiwan, while over 13 percent
received double the income.</P>
      <P>As for new workers to be dispatched to China from next year, they would receive
an average pay of 1.24-fold that of their colleagues in Taiwan, the poll found.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 38 percent of Taiwan businesses said they will offer
more handsome bonuses instead of pay increases to such employees in the future.</P>
      <P>Some 82 percent of Taiwan companies said they will provide airplane tickets as a
bonus to their China-based workers; 68 percent of companies will make available
holidays; 66 percent will provide accommodation subsidies. About 58 percent of
companies said they will offer subsidies for employees'  insurance  premiums and
travel expenditures.</P>

      <P>Far Eastern Air Transport Corp. is awaiting a reply from the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) regarding its application to terminate
air service between Taipei and Tainan.</P>
      <P>Executives with the airline company have indicated that the company would like
to cease the air service as soon as possible, but MOTC officials have expressed
hope that Far Eastern would continue serving the Kaohsiung-Tainan route at least
until after the Lunar New Year in early 2008, when all forms of passenger
transport will be in great demand.</P>
      <P>The company filed the application with the Civil Aeronautics Administration
under the MOTC in late November after promotional efforts to attract more
passengers for the Taipei-Tainan route proved to be in vain.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 12, Far Eastern reduced the price of a one-way ticket for a Taipei-
Tainan flight to NT$1,060 (US$32.8), lower than the NT$1,255 for a one-way ride
between the two cites on the Taiwan High Speed Rail. Despite that effort, the
occupancy rate has remained at about 30 percent, meaning the airline is
operating the route at a loss.</P>
      <P>A Far Eastern executive said the company will focus on regional routes in the
next decade.</P>
      <P>In addition to a domestic route between Taipei and Kaohsiung, the Taipei-based
airline operates international services to China, South Korea Indonesia,
Malaysia, Palau, the Philippines,  Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's domestic air services are in tatters in less than one year after the
Taiwan High Speed Rail became operational in January this year.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines canceled its Taipei-Taichung route in May, followed by Uni
Air's termination of its service on the Taipei-Chiayi route. TransAsia Airways
is still hanging on to its Taipei-Tainan route by using a propeller airplane
with about 70 seats, with the price set at NT$998 for a one-way flight.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There was no progress in the social, economic and cultural human rights
situation in China in 2007, while education rights, political rights and freedom
of speech were even worse than in 2005, experts said at a seminar held in Taipei
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD) , a non-partisan organization
dedicated to the promotion of democracy and human rights in Taiwan and abroad
and the first democracy assistance foundation in Asia, organized the seminar in
which it released its "2007 China Human Rights Report: Observation on Social,
Economic, and Educational and Cultural Rights."</P>
      <P>TFD Vice President Tung Li-wen said it is appalling that both the educational
rights and rights of free speech compared with 2005 have deteriorated in 2007,
despite the national guidelines of Chinese President Hu Jin-tao's proposal to
build a "harmonious society." He added that the Communist Party of China (CPC)
has severely sacrificed its people's rights while putting every effort into
holding the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and its power transition in the 17th
National Congress.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the so called "black-hearted" substandard products made in China have
become the greatest nightmare for the Chinese people as well as the whole world,
Tung said, adding that they are evidence of how social rights are ignored in
China and how negligent the government can be with regard to its people's health
and lives.</P>
      <P>Addressing the same occasion,  Robert Menard,  founder and secretary- general of
Reporters Without Borders , a Paris-based international non-governmental
organization dedicated to promoting press freedom, said that China's enormous
economic development has not brought progress to its human rights situation or
its freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>Menard said that even though in January the CPC eased the regulations governing
the work of foreign journalists because of the Olympics, there have nonetheless
been at least 60 cases of police detaining or obstructing foreign
correspondents, which proves again that China's promises are merely lip service.
Therefore, pressure should be kept on China through the International Olympic
Committee to guarantee freedom of expression and respect for the Olympic
Charter's humanistic values, Menard said.</P>
      <P>Lee Yu-jung, an assistant professor of the Department of Public Affairs and
Management at Tainan University, who was also present at the seminar, said the
power struggle between Shin Kong Mitsukoshi and Beijing's  Hualian  Group  over
the  Shin  Kong  Place  in Beijing demonstrates the regression of economic
rights in China in 2007, despite the announcement and implementation of the
Property Law of the People's Republic of China in March and October.</P>
      <P>In short, even though a representative of the Beijing Candidate Committee said
in 2001 that "by entrusting the organization of the Olympic Games to Beijing,
you will help the development of human rights" after Beijing was awarded the
2008 Olympics, no durable improvements have been seen in human rights, while
some rights have been subjected to greater suppression.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung city government in southern Taiwan proposed an action plan on the
protection of city climates  at a recent  global  meeting,  receiving
widespread recognition, a city official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that a plan proposed by a local government in Taiwan to
combat global warming had been recognized by the international community, said
Hsiao Yu-cheng, head of the port city's Environmental Protection Bureau.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after Hsiao led a delegation that attended the 13th Session of
the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Bali, Indonesia, Dec. 8-11.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese officials took part in the conference not as UNFCCC members but as
members of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives
(ICLEI), Hsiao noted.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City joined the ICLEI in 2006, making it Taiwan's first city to become
an ICLEI member, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Established in 1990,  the ICLEI is composed of 715 local governments in 67
countries and is aimed at encouraging local governments to engage in the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the ICLEI has initiated many campaigns and programs to help
local governments seek sustainable development, earning the organization
widespread acclaim.</P>
      <P>At the conference, Hsiao proposed the port city's action plan to implement the
ICLEI's Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) program to the ICLEI Secretariat and
the plan was adopted.</P>
      <P>While attending an ICLEI pre-meeting, Hsiao also discussed with ICLEI Secretary-
General Konrad Otto-Zimmermann and CEO Wayne Wescott the eco-friendly measures
taken by Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Hsiao told them the Kaohsiung city government has effectively controlled
pollution emissions of factories in the area.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said the city government is encouraging local citizens to
replace old scooters as part of its efforts to minimize scooter emissions.</P>
      <P>Hsiao also noted that the city's subway system -- which will be inaugurated soon
-- along with a bus transfer system and bicycle lanes, will enhance the use of
the city's mass transportation systems.</P>
      <P>He described the vision of transforming the port city into a "low carbon city"
as "not unattainable."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>High ticket prices as well as the inconvenience of shuttling to bullet train
stations have dampened the public's willingness to travel by high speed rail,
according to a survey released by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The first survey on the use of the high speed rail system since its inauguration
early this year also found that public opinion is split on the ticket price,
with 44.7 percent of respondents saying that the price is reasonable, while 48.2
percent said the price is unreasonable.</P>
      <P>The MOTC suggested that the Bureau of High Speed Rail urged Taiwan High Speed
Rail Corp., the operator of the bullet train, to offer lower ticket rates during
off-peak hours.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that around 22 percent of people over 20 have traveled on
the high speed train.</P>
      <P>For those who have traveled on the high speed rail system but say they would not
do so again, the most common reason is "an overall exorbitant price, " including
the shuttle service fee to downtown, cited by 44.2 percent of respondents.</P>
      <P>For those who have yet to travel by the train, over 75 percent said they have no
need to do so, while 7.3 percent cited the high price when asked for their
reasons.</P>
      <P>For those who have taken a single-ride, 22.2 percent said that the price is too
high when asked why they were not traveling by bullet train in both directions.</P>
      <P>Asked what improvements are required, most people pointed to the ticket price.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that most passengers travel to the high speed rail
stations in their own vehicles (44. 6 percent), while most leave the stations
after being picked up by relatives and friends (28.4 percent).</P>
      <P>For those who used to travel by air, 67.2 percent switched to the bullet train
after its inauguration; among those used to traveling by rail, 47.6 percent have
switched to the bullet train.</P>
      <P>In addition, even though air carriers have launched preferential ticket prices
to compete with the high speed rail, only 41.8 percent said they would re-
consider travel by air.</P>
      <P>Even though the express train is cheaper by 20 or 30 percent than high speed
rail, over half said they still prefer the high speed train.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said that the biggest edge the high speed train offers is a sharp
reduction in travel time, noting that of those who travel both ways using the
high speed rail system, over 68.4 percent said they return home the same day.</P>
      <P>Eastern Public Relations Co. at the commission of the MOTC, conducted the survey
on people over 20 years of age Sept. 17-28. A total of 1,713 valid responses
were collected with a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The 345-km high speed rail, which links Taipei in northern Taiwan and Kaohsiung
in southern Taiwan, cuts the travel time to 90 minutes from the original four
and a half hours. Standard fare for a single ride between Taipei and Kaohsiung
is NT$1,490 (US$46).</P>

      <P>Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) will hold the annual bicycle
and sporting goods shows together March 13-16 next year, forming the country's
biggest ever exhibition event, a TAITRA executive said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two exhibitions will feature a total of 4,300 booths and are expected to
draw 65,000 visitors and 7,000 foreign buyers, TAITRA Vice President Walter Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei International Cycle Show 2008 (Taipei Cycle) will be held at the
Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC) Nangang Exhibition Hall in Nangang District in
Taipei City. The grand opening of the newly completed hall is slated for March
13 next year, the first day of the two exhibitions, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei International Sporting Goods Show 2008 (TAISPO) will be
held at the old TWTC Exhibition Hall in the Hsinyi district of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>TAITRA has received over 700 applications from both domestic and foreign firms

largest in the world. Booths booked for next year's event already exceeded
2,700, marking an 18 percent year-on-year growth, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The TAISPO has about 1,600 booths from 254 firms, but the event will not be open

held annually in Taiwan--will include the two exhibition venues as additional
legs in its race next year, which will be held at the time of the exhibition.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will fully respect a draft containing a set of measures being
drawn up by the Central Election Commission (CEC) to handle contingencies in the
run-up to elections or on voting days, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the comments while answering questions from reporters following a
weekly Executive Yuan meeting and after the China Times reported in its Tuesday
edition that the CEC is crafting a set of contingency measures to deal with
"natural catastrophes" or other "unavoidable situations" ahead of elections and
on polling days.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the CEC will be entitled to set a new polling day for
future elections in case of "natural disasters" or "unavoidable situations, "
should the CEC members approve the draft measures.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Executive Yuan will respect relevant proposals put forward by
the CEC in this regard, Shieh said that it is tremendously important to maintain
fair and smooth operations in the legislative and presidential elections slated
for early next year.</P>
      <P>As the CEC has decided to adopt a "one-step" voting format in the two elections,
the central government said it will not allow some local governments to
implement a "two-step" voting scheme in defiance of the CEC's decision.</P>
      <P>"Two different voting systems would be totally unfair to all candidates,
political parties, electoral workers and voters, " he pointed out, adding that
"any irregularities prior to or during the elections will not be tolerated,
including efforts to rig elections or buy votes."</P>
      <P>However, Shieh declined to answer the question of whether the draft bill being
worked on by the CEC has something to do with the voting format dispute between
the central and local governments.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung urged the public not to overreact to the draft,
saying that the measures being assessed already form part of the CEC's internal
regulations.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung  reiterated  a day earlier in a cross-agency crime-

other irregularities to influence the outcomes of the elections and nor will it
permit a "two-step" voting format.</P>

      <P>Francis Chen, founder and president of the Franz Collection Inc., presented a
Chinese porcelain piece modeled on the work of a late Italian horse painter to
Pope Benedict XVI during a meeting in the Vatican Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said in an interview with the Central News Agency (CNA) prior to his
departure for the Vatican for the rare meeting that he was shocked that he would
have the honor of meeting with the Pope when he learned of the audience two
months ago.</P>
      <P>He said he later learned that one of his friends had helped arrange for the
meeting after his company failed to organize a painting exhibition with the
Taipei-based National Palace Museum in the Vatican.</P>
      <P>The Franz Collection and the Palace Museum originally planned to hold an
exhibition featuring a painting collection created by well-known Western
missionary-painter Giuseppe Castiglione, also known by his Chinese name Lang
Shih-ning, who died in 1766, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>The exhibition was also to feature a porcelain work produced for the Franz
Collection, Chen said, adding that the work reinterprets one of Castiglione's
paintings.</P>
      <P>Castiglione was born in Milan, Italy, in 1688. At the age of 27, he was sent by
the Vatican to preach in China. He later attracted the attention of Emperor Qian
Long of the Qing dynasty and served as an artist for the court.</P>
      <P>During the three-hour meeting, the Pope presided over a blessing ceremony and
engaged in a cultural dialogue with his guest, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to promote culture, the Franz Collection previously
donated  NT$10 million (US$308,928)  to sponsor an exhibition showcasing 14th-
Century paintings from the Vatican and the Museum of Milan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen founded the Franz Collection in 2001, and has established branches in

      <P>Lawmakers in the legislative committee on sanitation and the environment, and
social welfare passed a draft amendment to the "Gender Equality in Employment
Act" Wednesday, which would relax restrictions on applications for parental
leave.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment, which also proposes changing the title of the act to the
"Sexual Equality in Employment Act, " stipulates that no matter how small a
company in scale and size, it will be required to agree to applications for
parently leave without pay from employees who have worked in the company for at
least one year.</P>
      <P>The proposal would also prolong the period of paternity leave from two days to
three.</P>
      <P>Legislator Cheng Yun-Peng of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, who put
forth the amendment, explained that national health insurance covers hospital
costs for three days following a natural birth, meaning a newborn's mother can
stay at hospital for three days.</P>
      <P>However, the existing law only offers the father a two-day leave with pay to
stay with the mother, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The amended bill is expected to affect about 900,000 enterprises around the
country, officials of the Council of Labor Affairs said.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, only a worker in a company with more than 30 employees
is eligible to apply for parental leave, which can last for at most two years,
so long as he/she has worked at the company for 12 months or more.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment also stipulates that the employer cannot reject an
application for parental leave without pay, nor can employers punish workers for
taking such leave.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on the draft amendment,  an executive  of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Federation of Industries complained that the bill has failed to take
the current operational challenges facing local enterprises into consideration,
warning that the amendment will greatly affect small- and medium-sized

      <P>Chen Kuo-hsiang, director-general of the MND's General Political Warfare Bureau,
issued the denial in response to questions from legislators on the Legislative
Yuan's National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ting Shou-chung of the main opposition Kuomintang claimed that Lee
has disguised the main purpose of his visit to Central and South America, saying
that his main purpose is actually to make a transit stop in the United States to
assure the American government that the ruling Democratic Progressive  Party
(DPP) -proposed referendum on whether Taiwan should join the United Nations
under the name Taiwan is not aimed at provoking China nor will it cause a
conflict across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The DPP's plan to hold the referendum alongside the presidential election next
year has caused deep concern in both the U.S. and China,  with American
government officials reiterating on many occasions Washington's opposition to
such a proposal, while Chinese and U.S. officials are also making frequent
contact on the issue. China sees the referendum proposal as a move to march
toward de jure independence, while the American government is worried that the
movement might affect the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>According to Ting, Washington is also concerned that Taiwan's legislative and
presidential elections to be held early next year will further complicate cross-
strait ties, which are already tense, and Lee was asked by the U.S. government
to give an assurance that Taiwan will not do anything provocative.</P>
      <P>Chen said he did not know where Ting's sources were from but he assured him that
Lee's Latin American visit is purely for military exchanges with Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in the region.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Lee departed Nov. 29 to visit several of Taiwan's diplomatic
allies, including the Dominican Republic and Paraguay, and is scheduled to
return to Taiwan Thursday.</P>

order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you can also make the people keep
away from wrongdoing, but they will lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If,
on the other hand, in government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain
order by encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense of
shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Legislature acts to relax restrictions on parental leave</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers in the legislative committee on sanitation and the environment, and
social welfare passed a draft amendment to the "Gender Equality in Employment
Act" Wednesday, which would relax restrictions on applications for parental
leave.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment, which also proposes changing the title of the act to the
"Sexual Equality in Employment Act, " stipulates that no matter how small a
company in scale and size, it will be required to agree to applications for
parently leave without pay from employees who have worked in the company for at
least one year.</P>
      <P>The proposal would also prolong the period of paternity leave from two days to
three.</P>
      <P>Legislator Cheng Yun-Peng of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, who put
forth the amendment, explained that national health insurance covers hospital
costs for three days following a natural birth, meaning a newborn's mother can
stay at hospital for three days.</P>
      <P>However, the existing law only offers the father a two-day leave with pay to
stay with the mother, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The amended bill is expected to affect about 900,000 enterprises around the
country, officials of the Council of Labor Affairs said.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, only a worker in a company with more than 30 employees
is eligible to apply for parental leave, which can last for at most two years,
so long as he/she has worked at the company for 12 months or more.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment also stipulates that the employer cannot reject an
application for parental leave without pay, nor can employers punish workers for
taking such leave.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on the draft amendment,  an executive  of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Federation of Industries complained that the bill has failed to take
the current operational challenges facing local enterprises into consideration,
warning that the amendment will greatly affect small- and medium-sized
enterprises.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government signed an agreement with the city government of
Taichung Wednesday to offer technical assistance and help Taichung develop eight
stations on its mass rapid transit (MRT) system's Wurih-Beitun Line.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Taichung Mayor Jason Hu inked the pact at a
ceremony in the Taipei MRT system's Zhongxiao-Fuxing Station near the Sogo
Department Store's Fuxing Branch.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Hau pointed out that the city-owned Taipei Rapid
Transit Corp. (TRTC) in charge of operating the Taipei MRT system, is very
experienced in creating business opportunities in stations along the MRT lines,
and has created many win-win situations for the city government and firms housed
in various stations.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Taichung city government will pay a reasonable fee for the technical
assistance. He added that the development project is expected to create business
opportunities worth NT$15 billion (US$46.35 million) and net NT$1.8 billion a

    <HEADLINE>CEC entitled to draft contingency measures: Executive Yuan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will fully respect a draft containing a set of measures being
drawn up by the Central Election Commission (CEC) to handle contingencies in the
run-up to elections or on voting days, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the comments while answering questions from reporters following a
weekly Executive Yuan meeting and after the China Times reported in its Tuesday
edition that the CEC is crafting a set of contingency measures to deal with
"natural catastrophes" or other "unavoidable situations" ahead of elections and
on polling days.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the CEC will be entitled to set a new polling day for
future elections in case of "natural disasters" or "unavoidable situations, "
should the CEC members approve the draft measures.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Executive Yuan will respect relevant proposals put forward by
the CEC in this regard, Shieh said that it is tremendously important to maintain
fair and smooth operations in the legislative and presidential elections slated
for early next year.</P>
      <P>As the CEC has decided to adopt a "one-step" voting format in the two elections,
the central government said it will not allow some local governments to
implement a "two-step" voting scheme in defiance of the CEC's decision.</P>
      <P>"Two different voting systems would be totally unfair to all candidates,
political parties, electoral workers and voters, " he pointed out, adding that
"any irregularities prior to or during the elections will not be tolerated,
including efforts to rig elections or buy votes."</P>
      <P>However, Shieh declined to answer the question of whether the draft bill being
worked on by the CEC has something to do with the voting format dispute between
the central and local governments.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung urged the public not to overreact to the draft,
saying that the measures being assessed already form part of the CEC's internal
regulations.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung  reiterated  a day earlier in a cross-agency crime-
fighting meeting that the government will not allow gangsters, vote-buying or
other irregularities to influence the outcomes of the elections and nor will it
permit a "two-step" voting format.</P>

that the WVI, a global partnership committed to helping the world's poor,
intends to raise more funds for the program with the aim of helping improve the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking economic planning official voiced opposition Thursday to a draft
amendment to a law that would expand the right of parental leave to laborers.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ming-feng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development, was referring to a draft amendment to the "Gender Equality in
Employment Act," which passed the first reading in the legislature a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>Under the amendment, all companies, regardless of their size, would be required
to grant maternity leave for up to two years to all employees who have worked
for the company for at least one year. Companies that do not face fines of up to
NT$100,000 (US$3,090).</P>
      <P>Currently, only companies with more than 30 employees are required to do so.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment would also extend the period of paternity leave from two
days to three days.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the Legislative Yuan "means well" by passing the first reading of the
amendment to encourage more women to have babies at a time of declining birth
rates in the country.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the enactment of amendment could affect employers'
willingness to hire women.</P>
      <P>He said that gender is no longer the main issue in Taiwan's workplace, but the
enactment of the amendment to give women long periods of maternity leave would
make employers think twice before hiring them.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the issue be left to employers and employees to work out on
their own.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Ping-pin, president of the Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises, said that most of the businesses that are members of the
association have limited staff numbers and that if the draft amendment is passed
into law, it will affect their willingness to hire women, adding that women
could suffer before benefiting from the new law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics expert Schive Chi said at a recent luncheon organized by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei that Taiwan welcomes foreign banks that can help
globalize local banks.</P>
      <P>When foreign banks enter the market not as a branch but as a subsidiary, "they
will have a very positive influence on industry standards,  " Schive  said  in
his Wednesday  speech,  titled "Opportunities for New Markets and New Products."</P>
      <P>Touching on the government's role in banking reform, Schive went on that if
Taiwan's next president can make the financial sector truly transparent and
independent, the outlook for Taiwan's financial market will be much brighter.</P>
      <P>Schive, a former vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development, further suggested in his speech that local banks can
apply what they have learned from their partnerships with foreign banks in
Taiwan to tackle problems they might encounter in China because "whatever has
happened here is likely to be repeated in China."</P>
      <P>Within this framework, Schive suggested that the government improve its
supervisory skills and philosophy.</P>
      <P>"The regulators should take the regulated as a partner, rather than seeing the
relationships  as one between  superiors  and subordinates," Schive added.</P>
      <P>In another 10 or 12 years, Schive suggested, this part of the world will be even
more integrated economically, with some kind of regional free trade agreement
functioning. " Our domestic banks, particularly the larger ones, will presumably
go abroad, especially within the region, to acquire local banks, " he predicted.</P>
      <P>Schive further said in his speech that "over the next decade, our capital market
will play some roles that used to be played by banks."</P>
      <P>As to the future competition between banks, Schive accentuated that "it will be
focused on who can give the best service to customers" because banking is
basically a people business, of which a key element will be hiring or developing
the right talent.</P>
      <P>"In this next stage of development, success will depend on having more
sophisticated, more internationally minded personnel," Schive said.</P>

      <P>A new law is needed to ensure that only indigenous people can be elected as
chiefs of aboriginal autonomous regions, the head of the Council of Indigenous
Peoples (CIP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>CIP Minister Icyang Parod said during a Legislative Yuan session that since a
draft bill governing indigenous residents' autonomous rights stipulates that all
Republic of China citizens enjoy equal political rights in indigenous autonomous
regions, there is no legal clause to prohibit Han Chinese citizens from
participating in elections of local chiefs in indigenous autonomous regions.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he said, an article should be added to the draft bill to
stipulate that only indigenous people can be elected as chiefs of aboriginal
autonomous regions.</P>
      <P>Parod made the remarks  in response  to ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Chen Ying and opposition Kuomintang Legislator  Chang  Jen-hsiang,
who  criticized  the  Executive Yuan-authored indigenous residents' autonomous
rights draft bill as allowing all Taiwan citizens to have right to run for seats
representing indigenous regions as long as they maintain household registration
in those regions.</P>
      <P>This stipulation  runs seriously counter to the spirit of indigenous autonomy,
the legislators pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang lashed out at the Executive Yuan for referring the indigenous
residents' autonomous rights draft bill to the Legislative Yuan for legislation
more than four years after the draft bill was hammered out in June 2003 and only
at a crucial moment when legislative hearings on the general budget for 2008 are
about to begin.</P>
      <P>Chang accused the Executive Yuan of "trying to hold hostage" the legislators at
a crucial time.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that China's intimidation will not sway
the Taiwan people's resolve to push for a referendum on the country applying to
join the United Nations under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that since the ruling Democratic Progressive Party initiated
a referendum on the U.N. membership bid, Beijing has used an array of political
and economic means, including outright threats, to pressure China-based Taiwan
business people to side with China or speak out against the referendum.</P>
      <P>However, the president said, China's crude attempt to obstruct the Taiwan
people's legitimate right to deepen their country's democracy by holding the
referendum will not sway their resolve to push for the referendum, which is
slated to be held alongside the March 22 presidential election. He added that
such attempts by Beijing will only antagonize the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Both China and the United States, Taiwan's staunch supporter, have voiced
opposition to the referendum out of concerns that it represents a step toward de
jure independence.</P>
      <P>The president also said that the government is dedicated to enticing Taiwan
business people operating overseas to return to Taiwan, noting that an office to
help them return for investment was established in July this year.</P>
      <P>He added that by the end of October, overseas Taiwanese have invested NT$8.8
billion (US$271.6 million) in the country in 91 projects, with 43 of the
investment projects involving China-based Taiwan business people.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received winners of the National Golden
Award for Architecture at the Presidential Office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pope Benedict XVI met a three-member delegation from Taiwan Wednesday at the
Vatican and received a set of porcelain pieces modeled on the work of a famous
18th-century Italian missionary-painter as a gift.</P>
      <P>The meeting was part of the pope's weekly public audience, in which the pope met
with some 8,000 people from all over the world.</P>
      <P>The gift was presented by Francis Chen, founder and president of the Franz
Collection Inc., which was inaugurated in 2001 and now has branches in Germany,
the United States, Japan and Russia.</P>
      <P>The other members of the Taiwanese delegation were Fu Jen Catholic University
President Bernard Li and Shaw-Lan Wang, publisher of the Chinese-language United
Daily News based in Taipei.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Li reported the recent developments concerning the Catholic
university to the pope and invited him to visit the school, which is located in
Taipei County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang greeted the pope in French.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the pope expressed gratification while accepting the gift from Chen
who explained to the pope that the set was created based on paintings created by
well-known Western missionary-painter Giuseppe Castiglione.</P>
      <P>Castiglione, also known by his Chinese name Lang Shining, was born in Milan,
Italy, in 1688. At the age of 27, he was sent by the Vatican to preach in China.
He later attracted the attention of Emperor Qian Long of the Qing dynasty and
served as an artist for the court. He died in 1766.</P>
      <P>Chen said in an interview with the Central News Agency prior to his departure
for the Vatican for the rare meeting that he was extremely surprised when he
learned two months earlier that he would have the honor of meeting with the
pope.</P>
      <P>He said he later learned that one of his friends had helped arrange for the
meeting after his company failed to organize an exhibition with the Taipei-based
National Palace Museum in the Vatican to display Castiglione's painting
collection.</P>
      <P>The exhibition was also to feature a porcelain piece produced by the Franz
Collection, Chen said, adding that the work reinterprets one of Castiglione's
paintings.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to promote culture, the Franz Collection, in addition to
presenting the gift to the pope, previously donated NT$10 million (US$308,928)
to sponsor an exhibition in Taipei showcasing 14th-century paintings from the
Vatican and the Museum of Milan, Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rebutted Thursday speculation
raised by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) about possible delays in the
approaching legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, DPP legislative caucus whip Wang
Tuoh accused the KMT of lacking vision and still harboring the old mindset of
its past martial law era.</P>
      <P>The KMT accused the DPP a day earlier of seeking to defer the legislative and
presidential elections slated for early next year after government spokesman
Shieh Jhy-wey said that the Executive Yuan will fully respect any proposals put
forward by the Central Election Commission (CEC) to deal with possible
contingencies such as "natural catastrophes" or "avoidable and irresistible
situations" prior to the elections or on the actual polling days.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based China Times reported Tuesday that the CEC was working on a
draft containing a set of contingency measures to serve that end. If the CEC
members approve the measures, the CEC will be entitled to set new polling days
for future elections, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The DPP has shown its "true colors" by "attempting to postpone the two key
elections" through creating woes and causing conflict in the run-up to the polls
so that it can announce postponements of the elections and impose martial law,
the KMT said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the KMT has been possessed with "evil ideas" by making the
charges. As Taiwan has evolved into a democratic and diversified society, the
president cannot recklessly announce an emergency decree to delay elections or
impose martial law, he said, arguing that "only a dictator would do so."</P>
      <P>The KMT must not twist the contingency measures being drafted by the CEC and
rehash the issue in the face of the two elections, he said.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu -- accompanied by Deputy Mayor Lin Ren-yi and Hsu

to celebrate Akihito's 74th birthday, which falls on Dec. 23, the official went

Kaohsiung Office of the American Institute in Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>The party marked the first local celebration of Akihito's birthday since Japan
switched diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China in 1975, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>Chen -- who is slated to pay a four-day visit to Japan at the head of a
delegation beginning Sunday -- said it is a pity that only 100,000 out of the
1.1 million visits to Taiwan paid by Japanese tourists each year are to
Kaohsiung, Chen said, expressing hope that more Japanese tourists will visit
Kaohsiung using the high speed railway.</P>
      <P>She also expressed hope that Kaohsiung can have the opportunity to boost ties
with Japanese cities by conducting exchanges in various fields.</P>
      <P>The JIA is a semi-official organization authorized to handle affairs between

      <P>Taiwan will ban Austrian BASE jumper Felix Baumgartner from visiting the country
again after he made an unlawful jump from the Taipei 101 skyscraper earlier this
week, National Immigration Agency (NIA) officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Baumgartner parachuted from the 91st floor of the 509 meter building Tuesday,
landing on the roof-top car park of the neighboring Taipei World Trade Center
building. He departed for Hong Kong that same day soon after finishing the jump
-- a promotional event sponsored by the energy drink manufacturer Red Bull.</P>
      <P>NIA officials pointed out that Baumgartner, who entered Taiwan on landing visa,
violated the Immigration Act by engaging in an activity inconsistent with the
purpose of his visit and being involved in an act considered by the authorities
to be detrimental to Taiwan's national interests, public security, public order
or the good customs of the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei police said that despite his having already left the country,
they are planning to refer Baumgartner for prosecution on charges of endangering
public security. They also claimed that the management of Taipei 101 can sue him
for intruding into the building and damaging the building's tiles during the
jump.</P>
      <P>An internationally renowned daredevil, Baumgartner has performed a number of
dangerous stunts throughout his career.</P>
      <P>They include a skydive in 1999 from the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia -- then the world's highest skyscraper -- and a jump from the Christ
statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that same year.</P>
      <P>In 2003, he became the first person to skydive across the English Channel using

      <P>Titled "37 Arts, " the new creation is named after the building in which the
arts center is located. Sheu created the dance with her partner   Bulareyaung
Pagarlava,   a  Paiwan   aboriginal dancer-turned-choreographer, during their
eight-week residence at the center from July to September, Sheu said.</P>
      <P>Sheu is the first Asian artist invited to the arts center established by Mikhail

play director Lee Chien-chang, traveling dancer in Germany Chiang Pau-shu, and

      <P>The new dance will show the choreographers'  contradictory feelings "of being at
an execution ground and paradise at the same time" during their stay at the
center, Sheu said.</P>
      <P>"I felt like an angel in paradise to be invited for a residence at the world-

      <P>Blasting Sarkozy's expression as compromising the core values of democracy to

      <P>As to the United Nations' refusal to issue press passes to Taiwanese journalists
to cover international events, Menard said it is not in line with the non-
discrimination principle, as reporters are entitled to cover news and do not
represent their countries while doing their jobs on international occasions.</P>

      <P>Electoral workers in local governments favoring a "two-step" voting format in
the coming legislative polls and two accompanying  referendums must be held
accountable if irregularities occur during the voting process, Executive Yuan
spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that "there will not be two different voting systems in a country, "
Shieh reiterated that the "two-step" voting method favored by the 18 cities and
counties controlled by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will not be
tolerated in the Jan. 12 legislative elections and referendums.</P>
      <P>As to what the Central Election Commission  (CEC)  called "unavoidable and
irresistible situations" on polling days that could be a cause for postponing
elections, Shieh said that the commission had yet to define the relevant
details.</P>
      <P>In a bid to clarify a media report that Vice Premier Chiou I-jen, in a meeting
the previous day, rejected a proposal to postpone the legislative elections to
resolve the voting format dispute, Shieh claimed that no such meeting was held

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated during a recent media interview that a
referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan will
take place as planned, despite strong opposition from the United States and
China.</P>
      <P>Making the remarks during an interview with Germany's Die Zeit weekly, Chen said
the referendum was "initiated by the people" according to their constitutional
rights and that he has no power to reject or revoke the initiative because he is
"not an emperor, "according to a transcript of the interview released Thursday
by the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan attaches great importance to U.S. concerns over the issue and
will continue communicating with Washington to try to sort out their
differences.</P>
      <P>"But the U.N. bid referendum must be held. It is impossible for us to backpedal
and scrap the plan," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "four noes" pledge made in his 2000 inaugural address was based
on the prerequisite that "China has no intention of using force against Taiwan,
" Chen said this prerequisite is non-existent, given that the number of missiles
deployed by China targeting Taiwan has increased from 200 in 2000 to 988 at
present.</P>
      <P>Chen said the world should not expect Taiwan's people to keep quiet just because
China is intimidating Taiwan with its military might.</P>
      <P>"The most powerful weapon to protect Taiwan is not missiles or armored vehicles
but democracy, special direct democracy such as referendums," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the United States and Europe should not try to restrict Taiwan's
democratic development for the sake of their own interests in China and he added
that he was deeply impressed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's insistence on
meeting Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, disregarding Chinese pressure.</P>
      <P>According to Chen,  the greatest problem with the Chinese leadership is its lack
of courage to face up to the true public opinion in Taiwan, mistakenly believing
that everyone in Taiwan supports the "one China" principle, accepts ultimate
unification with China and is not opposed to Taiwan becoming part of the
People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen said China's suppression and intimidation of Taiwan are pushing Taiwan
farther and farther away from China.</P>
      <P>For example, while only 30 percent of the people in Taiwan identified themselves
as Taiwanese rather than Chinese in 2000, the ratio has soared to 70 percent
this year, he noted.</P>

      <P>A new "contact communication system" has been developed by researchers at
National Taiwan University (NTU) to enable data exchange with a simple handshake
by the users, university sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Invented by a team led by Lu Shey-shi -- a professor at NTU's Department of
Electrical Engineering, the system uses the human body as a data transmission
medium, so that when equipped with signal units, two users can exchange
information such as telephone numbers and e-mail addresses with a handshake, or
a person can submit identification information to operate security systems and
ATM machines with a touch of the finger.</P>
      <P>Lu explained that although scientists have known for a long time that the human
body is capable of conducting electricity, real applications in data
transmission through body parts have never come into existence before. "But now,
human skin has been made to serve as an electrical contact to allow data
communication through body contact," he said.</P>
      <P>The signal unit, which can be placed in a watch or mobile phone, can store data
ranging from ID numbers, entry security codes, credit card numbers, cash card
numbers to medical information, saving the trouble of carrying various cards, Lu
noted.</P>

      <P>Tourism Bureau officials said Thursday that when an international hotel on the
banks of scenic Sun Moon Lake opens in 2012, Chinese tourists will be one of its
main targets.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks during the first presentation of the construction
project for the hotel, which will be built on the build-operate-transfer (BOT)
model.</P>
      <P>They noted that Sun Moon Lake in Nantou County is one of the most famous scenic
spots in Taiwan and is especially popular with Chinese tourists, although
existing accommodation facilities cannot meet demand.</P>
      <P>The new hotel, to be built on 2.79 hectares of land bought from the state-run
Taiwan Power Company, will have around 250 rooms.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted that when the hotel opens for business in 2012, it will
attract more tourists, with around 3.36 million domestic visitors, 780,000
Chinese tourists and around 260,000 tourists from other countries visiting every
year.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake Scenic Park Management Director Tseng Kuo-chi said the hotel will
be built based on a statue encouraging private sector investment in
international hotels in a bid to upgrade tourism at the lake.</P>
      <P>Representatives of foreign construction companies were also present at the
presentation and expressed keen interest in the project.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau is expected to sponsor two more presentations to learn the
views of the construction companies before announcing details of an open bid on

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City, Taichung City and Kaohsiung City have vowed to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 60 percent from 1990 levels by 2050 at a global meeting being
held in Bali, Indonesia, government sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the proposed cuts are part of an agreement reached at
the 13th Conference of the Parties (COP 13) to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</P>
      <P>Alongside the conference, which will run though Dec. 14, is the third meeting of
the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
      <P>The agreement titled the Climate Protection Agreement was signed by the members
of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) , the
C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the World Mayors Council on Climate Change
and the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG).</P>
      <P>Taipei City and Kaohsiung City, in northern and southern Taiwan, respectively,
attended the conference as ICLEI members, while Taichung City in central Taiwan
is a UCLG member. Taichung Mayor Jason Hu was elected to the UCLG board of
directors in November.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City is confident that it will achieve the goal by 2050, a spokesman
for the city's Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) said during an interview
with the Central News Agency later in the day.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu has already pledged to cut the port city's carbon
emissions year by year, the spokesman noted, adding that at present, factory
chimneys in the city are monitored by computer.</P>
      <P>If any unusual situation occurs, EPB Director Hsiao Yu-cheng will immediately
receive a text message and the bureau will send officials to inspect the
situation at once, the spokesman went on.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is under no obligation to comply with the Kyoto Protocol as was not
allowed to sign it due to its lack of U.N. membership, and thus does not need to
cut carbon emissions by 2012, when the protocol expires, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>However, the Executive Yuan has submitted a draft act to the legislature aimed
at reducing the country's greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent by 2030, the
spokesman noted.</P>
      <P>The legislature has not yet passed its third and final reading of the draft act,
according to the spokesman.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has said during an interview with a German weekly that
Taiwan's holding of referendums on public policy issues of major concern is an
indispensable step toward deepening the country's democratic institutions.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in the interview with Germany's Die Zeit weekly to be
published Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Chen praised German Chancellor Angela Merkel for her courage
in receiving Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama during the latter's
visit to Germany in September, in defiance of China's strong protest.</P>
      <P>Merkel's  meeting  with the Dalai Lama adversely  affected Germany-China ties,
with Beijing later canceling several high-level talks between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, her action showed that "common values are more important than
vested interests."</P>
      <P>Asked about criticism by the European Union and the United States of Taiwan's
plan to hold a referendum on its quest for a seat in the United Nations under
the name Taiwan, Chen said Taiwan appreciates these countries' concern, but
added that the holding of referendums is an inevitable step for Taiwan on its
march toward full democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen described democracy as Taiwan's best defensive weapon and said the country
should not waver from this cause, adding that he disagrees with China's claim
that Taiwan's referendum proposal is a move toward  de jure independence,  as
the island is already independent.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China do not belong to each other. Each has their different cultures
and this is the status quo existing between the two sides of Taiwan Strait,
which Taiwan hopes to maintain, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's future can only be decided by its people and no-one can declare that
Taiwan is part of People's Republic of China, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said it is a possibility that the two sides could move toward
reconciliation if China were to abandon considering Taiwan as one of its
provinces.</P>
      <P>"The big problem for China's leaders is that they are not willing to listen to
the voices of Taiwan's people, believing that they lack the courage to reject
Beijing's `one China' policy, " Chen said, adding that Taiwan will not yield to

      <P>Hsueh Ching-yuan,  a section  chief of the Department  of Conscription under the
Ministry of the Interior, who is at the head of a Taiwanese delegation currently
on a tour of the Philippines, said Taiwan is the first Asian country  to adopt
alternative conscription programs to allow draft-eligible young men to serve
their mandatory  military services in non-military  alternative programs.</P>
      <P>Over the past seven years, Hsueh said, conscripts have performed commendably in
non-military  alternative conscription  programs, serving as social workers,
medical professionals and teachers, at home and abroad, as well as on the
diplomatic front, in foreign countries.</P>
      <P>By joining the non-military alternative conscription programs, Hsueh said, the
children of Taiwanese expatriates can serve their home country of Taiwan in
their country of residency on the one hand and make a diplomatic contribution on
the other.</P>
      <P>The Philippines is the first country in the world where Taiwan has sent its

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian condemned violence Thursday after receiving a letter
threatening himself, his daughter and his grandson.</P>
      <P>The president first revealed that he was threatened during a rally in Taipei to
drum up support for Tien Hsin, a candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party for the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>He said the use of threats and intimidation against his family is "irrational, "
and urged the public to join him in condemning violence.</P>
      <P>The president also said that not only his daughter Hsin-yu, but also his son,
Chih-chung, had received threatening letters.</P>
      <P>He asked if "politics has to be this dirty and sordid, " urging people to see
clearly who wants democracy and who detests democracy.</P>
      <P>"There will be winners and losers in every election, " he said, adding that he
didn't win every time. He noted that he lost during Tainan county magistrate
election in 1985, and his wife was injured during a controversial car accident
after the election, resulting in her being paralyzed from the waist down.</P>
      <P>The president also said that he was jailed for more than two years because of
his dedication to politics.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the Department of Public Affairs at the Presidential
Office, said that the letter came in the form of a New Year's greeting card
addressed to Lee.</P>
      <P>The letter read, "Tell Ah-bian (nickname of the president) to be beware of two
bullets. An-an (the president's grandson) will be abducted and Hsin-yu (his
daughter) raped," according to Lee.</P>
      <P>The two bullets refer to the shooting incident on the eve of the 2004
presidential election, when both Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were
slightly injured on campaign trail. The opposition accused Chen of staging the
incident to win sympathy votes in the hotly contested election, albeit without
substantive evidence.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he immediately turned the letter over to the security service,
saying that any violence should be condemned.</P>
      <P>Security around the president has been strengthened since the incident. When
President Chen attended a democracy and human rights award ceremony in the
afternoon, all men dressed in suits were asked to take off their suits for
security checks.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai,  secretary  general of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
said that the party will never bow to threats.</P>
      <P>Cho said that the previous letter threatening Hsin-yu was sent to the editor of
a media outlet and did not invite too much discussion at the time, but this time
the letter was sent to the Presidential Office, posing a direct challenge to the
government's authority.</P>
      <P>Cho said that he could only hope that there is no connection between public name
calling of the president and threatens on his life.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan is a "rational society, " and the threat should not exist.
There should be "effective ways to counter such threats," he added.</P>

      <P>A drug mule and four packets of powdered MDMA ecstasy were seized by law
enforcement officers Wednesday in Kaohsiung City, the Kaohsiung County Police
Department said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the municipal police department, a 34-year-old man
surnamed Chang was arrested Wednesday evening in a building in Kaohsiung City
while trying to collect the illicit drugs mailed from Malaysia under the
instruction of a drug trafficker. Two packs of the drug were seized along with
Chang.</P>
      <P>Agents from the Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration's Tainan branch and
Kaohsiung County policemen launched the raid after receiving a tip provided by
an informant in June and conducting months of tracking and investigation, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Two another packs of the same narcotics were seized Thursday morning at Chang's
suite in a building in Jenwu township, Kaohsiung County according a statement in
the initial probe by Kaohsiung County police.</P>
      <P>Police suspect that the drug traffickers wanted to smuggle the four packs of
MDMA ecstasy, weighing nearly one kilogram in total, into Taiwan in time to rake
in handsome profits as Christmas approaches.</P>
      <P>One MDMA pill could be sold for NT$500 (US$15.5) at local night clubs or pubs,
police said, adding that they are trying to apprehend other accomplices.</P>
      <P>According to police investigators,  smugglers concealed the illegal drugs in
books which had their pages cut out. The empty books with drugs hidden inside
were wrapped in many layers of plastic, copy paper, and protective wrapping
paper to avoid being detected by X-ray when entering Taiwan's customs.</P>
      <P>As each hollowed out book held some 0.25 kilograms of powdered MDMA and yet
weighed less than 0.3 kilograms, customs agents might easily allow them to pass,
police explained, adding that the drug traffickers must be very familiar with
the inspection process of postal materials at Taiwan's customs.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, who has a criminal record for document forgery and drug
abuse, he had run errands for a drug trafficker nicknamed "Boss" for more than
three months.</P>
      <P>Chang told police that he would be paid from NT$3,000-NT$5,000 for each errand
he made for the "Boss" -- transporting or taking delivery of drugs, or accepting
money from clients, adding that he succeeded in five such errands, carrying two
packets each time.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will set up a special booth to
promote Taiwan's recreational farms at the Taipei International Travel Fair 2007
slated to open in Taipei City Friday, a COA official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The booth will introduce 10 operational recreational farms selected  by experts
representing  unique facets  of Taiwan's agriculture, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Green World Ecological Farm with Asia's largest butterfly ecological park in
Hsinchu County, northern Taiwan, and Peikuan Farm with the world's only crab
museum in Yilan County, northeastern Taiwan, will both be included, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Similar  to tourist  farms,  recreational  farms  integrate agricultural
production and rural life for the benefit of visitors. In addition,  a
recreational farm presents local cultural and ecological resources, and
encourages visitors to become involved with the natural environment through
picnicking, bird watching, and other low-impact activities.</P>
      <P>Seeing  the great business  potential  of the recreational agriculture industry
in stress-filled modern life, the government has made great efforts to provide
assistance and counselling in the development of local recreational farms, with
an aim of making the industry a future star in tourism, the official said.</P>
      <P>The COA will also set up a booth to exhibit Taiwan's special agricultural
products and local dishes, such as sour Chinese cabbage in Kinmen County, dried
silver anchovies of Penghu County, and herbal jelly of Hsinchu County, to better
introduce visitors to Taiwan's unique features, the official said.</P>
      <P>Students at the Kainan University in Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan will work
with the Japanese traveling expert Segami Tsuyoshi, who has lived in Taiwan for
many years, in creating special Taiwanese dishes for visitors at the fair, the
official added.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD) Thursday honored Dr. Cynthia Maung
with the second Asia Democracy and Human Rights  Awards  (ADHRA)  in Taipei  for
her outstanding achievements in human rights and her services to Myanmarese
refugees.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian conferred the ADHRA on Maung, dubbed "Myanmar's Mother
Theresa," the 48-year-old founder of the celebrated refugee Mae Tao Clinic in
the Thai border town of Mae Sot, at a presentation ceremony, while Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy (TFD) Chairman Wang Jin-pyng presented her with a
US$100,000 grant to support her work.</P>
      <P>ADHRA was created by the TFD, a Taiwan-based and the first national democracy
assistance foundation in Asia, in 2006 to honor individuals or groups dedicated
to democratic development, the advance of human rights and the building of
democracy. Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Robert Menard won the
first ADHRA last year.</P>
      <P>Addressing  the occasion,  Chen said Maung's selfless love magnifies the
atrocity and barbarity of the Myanmarese junta and it is therefore meaningful
that Maung won the ADHRA, especially when democratic development in Myanmar has
encountered great difficulties.</P>
      <P>In her acceptance speech, Maung expressed gratitude to the TFD, saying that
Taiwans peaceful democratic development is a model for other countries.</P>
      <P>Maung is known for her work to help refugees and migrant workers in Myanmar, as
well as those suffering from the deteriorating situation there after the ruling
juntas bloody crackdown on protesters against rising prices led by Buddhist
monks in September.</P>
      <P>The Mae Sot clinic not only offers medical care but also occupational training,
health education, social services, housing for unaccompanied children and
community-building activities. Thanks to Maung and her colleagues efforts,
around 200 patients a day receive the care free of charge.</P>
      <P>Regarding the human rights situation in Myanmar, Maung said in an interview that
even though there was some pressure such as economic sanctions put on the junta
for political dialogue or reform, there has been no change or improvement in the
past year.</P>
      <P>Maung emphasized repeatedly that international  humanitarian assistance should
be monitored properly and that international organizations shouldwork
collaboratively and directlywith the local community and democratic
organizations.</P>
      <P>As to the September unrest, Maung said that compared with a similar event in
1988, it was good to see that more people got involved this time and supported
the movement. However,there is no opportunity for improvement or change under
the military regime,she said, because any attempt at democratic change or
political dialogue is cracked down upon by the military.</P>
      <P>She urged continuous international attention and collaboration on the issue and
expressed hope that the U.N. Security Council will take steps to intervene
despite obstruction from "certain countries."</P>

      <P>India's government bestowed the Golden Peacock award on Taiwanese film director
Lin Chih-ju Thursday in recognition of his winning the best film award at the
just concluded 38th International Film Festival of India in Goa.</P>
      <P>Lin's film, "The Wall", captured the best film award in the Asian, Latin
American and African film category at the Goa film festival, the most
prestigious Indian film festival, beating 13 other films by directors from the
three areas, including the "Postmodern Life of My Aunt" directed by prominent
Hong Kong director Xu Anhua.</P>
      <P>The jury described "The Wall" as a "can't miss" film, as it depicted everyday
people coping with political challenges in a simple story of dreams, hope,
betrayal and love.</P>
      <P>This year's Goa film festival attracted a total of 200 films from 43 countries
for the competition.</P>
      <P>The awards ceremony was presided over by Neelam Kapur, director in charge of
film festivals of India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, with
Taiwan's representative in India Hsia Li-yen receiving the award on behalf of
Lin, who will also receive a cash award worth US$25,500.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwanese films enjoy high esteem in the world film community, Kapur
expressed hope that Taiwan will send more films and directors to attend India's
various film festivals. She added that the Indian government has earmarked
sufficient funds to cover all the traveling cost for foreign guests to attend
film festivals with the aim of strengthening cultural exchanges with other
countries.</P>
      <P>Hailing Taiwanese films for winning many prestigious awards in international
film festivals, Kapur said India's film festival organizers will sponsor an
event focusing on Taiwanese topics if such superior directors as Ang Lee and Hou
Hsiao-shien will be able to attend India's festivals.</P>
      <P>Hsia said he would like to serve as bridge to boost the mutual understanding and
the cultural exchanges between India and Taiwan, inviting Kapur and other Indian
film celebrity to participate in Taiwan's Golden Horse Film Festival and other
international film festivals held in Taiwan in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP vows not to bow to death threat targeting 1st family</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will not bow to threats posed in
an anonymous letter promising harm to President Chen Shui-bian and his family
members, DPP Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cho made the remarks after Chen revealed earlier in the day a letter in which
someone threatens to "rape his daughter Hsin-yu and kidnap his eldest grandson
An-an."</P>
      <P>The president noted that the letter also warned him to "watch out for two
bullets."</P>
      <P>Producing a photocopy of the death threat letter at a press conference called
later in the day, Cho said that the government's authority should not be
challenged and urged the police to deter the person responsible for a series of
threats to Chen's family.</P>
      <P>Cho said he hopes that the death threat is not related to a series of unexpected
protests targeting Chen staged by individuals on a number of occasions recently.</P>
      <P>Describing the people of Taiwan as "rational, " Cho said that "there seems to be
a force encouraging all these threats and protests."</P>
      <P>With the Jan. 12 legislative election approaching, many sensitive disputes will
arise, which might result in greater frictions between supporters of different
political parties, Cho said.</P>
      <P>Cho stressed that local citizens should voice their opinions through legal and
democratic channels, and that the DPP will humbly listen to their opinions.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office has activated its security system, Cho noted, adding
that the DPP believes greater importance should be attached to the security of
the national leader.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cho also told the press that a media outlet received a postcard last
week, in which the sender, who dubbed himself a "Taiwanese Citizen", threatened
to attack the clinic where the first daughter works.</P>
      <P>Only a few days ago, the "Taiwan Citizen" sent out another postcard, demanding
that Chen and his son, Chen Chi-chung, apologize for the Ministry of Education's
move to replace an inscription of the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall alluding
the late President Chiang Kai-shek with a new one reading "Liberty Square."</P>
      <P>The postcard was sent from Chungho in the northern county of Taipei, the police
said, adding that further investigation is under way.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local government agencies have been working hard in the past five  years  to
create  an English-friendly environment, though it still needs many adjustments,
agency staff members said Thursday on the sideline of the 2007 English Carnival.</P>
      <P>The hard work has paid off, however, judging from the latest results of the
overall living environment approval rate of 61.5 percent among foreigners, which
was the highest in five years. The survey was conducted by the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC).</P>
      <P>The basic requirement was render every operational item and bulletin  bilingual
so foreigners  could have easy access to information on where they wanted to go,
said Meng Yun-tsung, Manager of Hsinchu Post Office. The office also had English
courses for its staff to improve their English conversation.</P>
      <P>Results of the same survey showed that only a third of foreigners were satisfied
with the police service environment. But that was not the case in Nantou County
Police Bureau, which started to work on providing a bilingual environment in
2004, said a policeman surnamed Wu.</P>
      <P>"I don't know what it's like in metropolitan areas like Taipei City, where there
have been more criminal cases. Most of the foreigners in Nantou are tourists
rather than businessmen, which was why most of our interaction involves
answering questions, giving directions... and let them use our bathrooms," a
policeman surnamed Fan said.</P>
      <P>Not every policeman was able to speak fluent English, but foreigners could
always call Foreign Affairs Sections of every police station for help, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung City, where the 2009 World Games will be held, a bilingual
environment  is even  more  important.  The  city's transportation and tourism
bureaus worked with taxi drivers, who are expected to host many foreign visitors
during the games.</P>
      <P>More than 400 drivers of the Sin Sing Siang Taxi Radio Station started taking
free English lessons offered by the bureaus this year to improve their
conversation.</P>
      <P>"It's impossible to make all of the drivers speak English well in a short period
of time, but at least we're supposed to know which hotels, agencies and
locations the passengers want to go to, and be able to chat a little bit with
them, " said Wu Yi-fong, an executive of the taxi station.</P>
      <P>The initiative and effort should be appreciated, said Douglas Habecker, Editor-
in-Chief of Compass, which publishes free bilingual magazines in Taipei,
Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"The [English] environment has improved a lot during the last five years. It's
easy for people to criticize but Taiwan has made huge steps. The biggest change
has to do with the positive attitude of the central and local governments, and
the people, towards internationalization, " said Habecker, 40, who were born in
the eastern city of Hualien and lives in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The basic idea was not make everyone a good English speaker and to make
everything bilingual, because that's impossible, Habecker said,  adding  that
the more important  thing  is to provide user-friendly,  high-quality  and
constantly updated information through guides, maps and Web sites.</P>
      <P>"Try to find a solution and ways to make it easier [for foreigners]  in
important spots such as airports,  hotels and transportation hubs, " he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Myanmar human rights issue too serious to be overlooked: Maung</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Cynthia Maung, a Burmese physician who has been providing medical services
to Burmese refugees for almost 20 years, said Thursday that there are serious
human rights issues in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Maung, recipient of the 2007 Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award (ADHRA) ,
received the award and grant worth US$100,000 from President Chen Shui-bian in a
ceremony before participating in a forum on human rights issue in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been ruled by a military junta since 1988.
The junta changed the country's official English name to the "Union of Myanmar"
in 1989, a move which is not recognized by many opponents of the regime.</P>
      <P>Estimates of the displaced population on the Thai-Myanmarese border range
between 500,000 - 600,000, composed mostly of people forced to leave their towns
and farms because of civil wars and oppression from the military junta, she
said. It has been very difficult for refugees to gain access to everything from
health care and education to clean water and accommodation, she added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the refugees face threats from land mines, epidemics and drugs.
Taken together, the human rights issue in Myanmar is simply too serious to be
overlooked, she said.</P>
      <P>The 48-year-old doctor, herself a refugee and a member of the ethnic Karen
minority, established the Mae Tao Clinic in Mae Sot, Thailand, near the Thai-
Burmese border, in 1988. Since then, the clinic has been providing not only
medical care, but also job training, social services, health education, child
protection, and community-building activities.</P>
      <P>Michael Hsiao, Executive Director of Academia Sinica's Center for Asia-Pacific
Area Studies, described situation in Myanmar as "a human hell" where civilians
have been deprived of the right of stay in their hometowns.</P>
      <P>"As a matter of fact, Taiwan might not be able to do much to improve situation
in Myanmar. But Taiwanese can offer support simply by focusing more attention on
the problems [in Myanmar] and at the same time take that as a warning to ensure
that the same does not happen again in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese have been doing more than just bringing attention to the issue.
The Taipei Overseas Peace Service (TOPS), for instance, has been sending
humanitarian missions to Myanmar for 10 years.</P>
      <P>The human rights situation in Myanmar and conditions in 10 refugee  camps  along
the Thai-Myanmarese  border  have  been deteriorating, said Sam Lai, a TOPS team
leader who's been working in Myanmar for five years.</P>
      <P>All the refugees were disappointed after the demonstrations in September failed
to overthrow the military regime, Lai said, adding that "they thought they could
finally go home."</P>
      <P>"For the past five years, my mother has always been asking me the same question:
When will you come home? I always answer: Maybe next year, " he said.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, all our Myanmarese friends will be able to go back home someday so I
can tell my mother that I'm finally coming home, " Lai said.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC) will set up a technology
section in Seoul, South Korea to facilitate bilateral exchanges in basic
scientific research, NSC Vice Minister Yang Hung-dun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The division will be under the authority of the country's representative office
in Seoul, known as the Taipei Mission in South Korea, and will have Chou Chuan-
hsin, a professor at the Institute of Applied Mechanics of National Taiwan
University as its first chief, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Science and Technology of South Korea, and the Korea Science and
Engineering Foundation will be the two cooperative partners for the technology
section during its early stages, which will focus on boosting exchanges in basic
scientific research, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Director-General of NSC's Department of International Cooperation Lin Kuang-lung
said Chou, who was educated in South Korea before attending  college,  will be
well-served  by his knowledge of technology, language ability, and thorough
understanding of Korean culture.</P>
      <P>During the past six years, Taiwan has set up a technology section each year in
different countries, including Russia, Australia, Vietnam, India, the Czech
Republic, and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that after establishing a section in Vietnam three years ago,
Taiwan has shifted from a country seeking help from advanced countries, to a
country seeking opportunities to cooperation with,and providing technical
assistance to other countries.</P>
      <P>A technology section previously set up in Chicago in the United States, in 1991,
has been moved to Boston in order to meet the needs of Taiwan's biotechnology
industry, Lin said, adding that next target for setting up a new section is Sao
Paulo, Brazil.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President vows no compromise despite death threat</HEADLINE>

12/13/07  23:52:39
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that he will by no means waver in his
rejection of the "one China" principle and China's goal of the "eventual
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait" despite death threats leveled
against himself and his family.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China are two separate, unconnected countries," said Chen while
stumping for DPP legislative candidate Tien Hsin in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>During the remaining half year of his term, Chen said he will stick to his guns
no matter how grave China's saber-rattling and military threats and no matter
how frightening the attempts to intimidate himself and his family.</P>
      <P>Chen's reaffirmation of his resolve came after the unveiling of anonymous
threatening letters to his daughter, his son and the Presidential Office. In one
of those letters, the sender warned the president to "watch out for two
bullets."</P>
      <P>The "two bullets" alluded to the shooting incident on the eve of the 2004
presidential election, when both Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were
slightly injured on campaign trail. The opposition accused Chen of staging the
incident to win sympathy votes in the hotly contested election, albeit without
substantive evidence.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Thursday's campaign rally, Chen said he believes that god had
blessed him in that adversity because of his magnanimity in providing attentive
care to family members of the two late presidents and the late Premier Sun Yun-
hsuan who was partially disabled after suffering a stroke.</P>
      <P>Chen's own wife is paralyzed from waist down, yet he said he has never used
public funds to foot his wife's medical bills nor have doctors and nurses from
state-run hospitals take care of his wife.</P>
      <P>"My wife, a disabled first lady, receive far worse treatment than did Sun, a
former premier, " Chen said, adding that Veterans General Hospital physicians
and nurses took turns caring for Sun before his death early last year. Sun also
had a state-funded villa in Keelung for his recuperation,  about which  the DPP
government  never complained.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration has also followed the practice of the previous Kuomintang
government in caring for the widows of the late President Chiang Kai-shek and
his son, the late President Chiang Ching-kuo, until they died a few years ago,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Recalling that he has endured many challenges and ordeals in his bumpy political
careers, Chen said no threat or intimidation could changed his mind and
determination to safeguard national interest and dignity.</P>

always call Foreign Affairs Sections of every police station for help, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung City, where the 2009 World Games will be held, a bilingual
environment  is even  more  important.  The  city's transportation and tourism
bureaus worked with taxi drivers, who are expected to host many foreign visitors
during the games.</P>
      <P>More than 400 drivers of the Sin Sing Siang Taxi Radio Station started taking
free English lessons offered by the bureaus this year to improve their
conversation.</P>
      <P>"It's impossible to make all of the drivers speak English well in a short period
of time, but at least we're supposed to know which hotels, agencies and
locations the passengers want to go to, and be able to chat a little bit with
them, " said Wu Yi-fong, an executive of the taxi station.</P>
      <P>The initiative and effort should be appreciated, said Douglas Habecker, Editor-
in-Chief of Compass, which publishes free bilingual magazines in Taipei,
Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"The [English] environment has improved a lot during the last five years. It's
easy for people to criticize but Taiwan has made huge steps. The biggest change
has to do with the positive attitude of the central and local governments, and
the people, towards internationalization, " said Habecker, 40, who were born in
the eastern city of Hualien and lives in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The basic idea was not make everyone a good English speaker and to make
everything bilingual, because that's impossible, Habecker said,  adding  that
the more important  thing  is to provide user-friendly,  high-quality  and
constantly updated information through guides, maps and Web sites.</P>
      <P>"Try to find a solution and ways to make it easier [for foreigners]  in
important spots such as airports,  hotels and transportation hubs, " he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President vows no compromise despite death threat</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that he will by no means waver in his
rejection of the "one China" principle and China's goal of the "eventual
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait" despite death threats leveled
against himself and his family.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China are two separate, unconnected countries," said Chen while
stumping for DPP legislative candidate Tien Hsin in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>During the remaining half year of his term, Chen said he will stick to his guns
no matter how grave China's saber-rattling and military threats and no matter
how frightening the attempts to intimidate himself and his family.</P>
      <P>Chen's reaffirmation of his resolve came after the unveiling of anonymous
threatening letters to his daughter, his son and the Presidential Office. In one
of those letters, the sender warned the president to "watch out for two
bullets."</P>
      <P>The "two bullets" alluded to the shooting incident on the eve of the 2004
presidential election, when both Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were
slightly injured on campaign trail. The opposition accused Chen of staging the
incident to win sympathy votes in the hotly contested election, albeit without
substantive evidence.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Thursday's campaign rally, Chen said he believes that god had
blessed him in that adversity because of his magnanimity in providing attentive
care to family members of the two late presidents and the late Premier Sun Yun-
hsuan who was partially disabled after suffering a stroke.</P>
      <P>Chen's own wife is paralyzed from waist down, yet he said he has never used
public funds to foot his wife's medical bills nor have doctors and nurses from
state-run hospitals take care of his wife.</P>
      <P>"My wife, a disabled first lady, receive far worse treatment than did Sun, a
former premier, " Chen said, adding that Veterans General Hospital physicians
and nurses took turns caring for Sun before his death early last year. Sun also
had a state-funded villa in Keelung for his recuperation,  about which  the DPP
government  never complained.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration has also followed the practice of the previous Kuomintang
government in caring for the widows of the late President Chiang Kai-shek and
his son, the late President Chiang Ching-kuo, until they died a few years ago,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Recalling that he has endured many challenges and ordeals in his bumpy political
careers, Chen said no threat or intimidation could changed his mind and
determination to safeguard national interest and dignity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Myanmar human rights issue too serious to be overlooked: Maung</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Cynthia Maung, a Burmese physician who has been providing medical services
to Burmese refugees for almost 20 years, said Thursday that there are serious
human rights issues in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Maung, recipient of the 2007 Asia Democracy and Human Rights Award (ADHRA) ,
received the award and grant worth US$100,000 from President Chen Shui-bian in a
ceremony before participating in a forum on human rights issue in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been ruled by a military junta since 1988.
The junta changed the country's official English name to the "Union of Myanmar"
in 1989, a move which is not recognized by many opponents of the regime.</P>
      <P>Estimates of the displaced population on the Thai-Myanmarese border range
between 500,000 - 600,000, composed mostly of people forced to leave their towns
and farms because of civil wars and oppression from the military junta, she
said. It has been very difficult for refugees to gain access to everything from
health care and education to clean water and accommodation, she added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the refugees face threats from land mines, epidemics and drugs.
Taken together, the human rights issue in Myanmar is simply too serious to be
overlooked, she said.</P>
      <P>The 48-year-old doctor, herself a refugee and a member of the ethnic Karen
minority, established the Mae Tao Clinic in Mae Sot, Thailand, near the Thai-
Burmese border, in 1988. Since then, the clinic has been providing not only
medical care, but also job training, social services, health education, child
protection, and community-building activities.</P>
      <P>Michael Hsiao, Executive Director of Academia Sinica's Center for Asia-Pacific
Area Studies, described situation in Myanmar as "a human hell" where civilians
have been deprived of the right of stay in their hometowns.</P>
      <P>"As a matter of fact, Taiwan might not be able to do much to improve situation
in Myanmar. But Taiwanese can offer support simply by focusing more attention on
the problems [in Myanmar] and at the same time take that as a warning to ensure
that the same does not happen again in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese have been doing more than just bringing attention to the issue.
The Taipei Overseas Peace Service (TOPS), for instance, has been sending
humanitarian missions to Myanmar for 10 years.</P>
      <P>The human rights situation in Myanmar and conditions in 10 refugee  camps  along
the Thai-Myanmarese  border  have  been deteriorating, said Sam Lai, a TOPS team
leader who's been working in Myanmar for five years.</P>
      <P>All the refugees were disappointed after the demonstrations in September failed
to overthrow the military regime, Lai said, adding that "they thought they could
finally go home."</P>
      <P>"For the past five years, my mother has always been asking me the same question:
When will you come home? I always answer: Maybe next year, " he said.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, all our Myanmarese friends will be able to go back home someday so I
can tell my mother that I'm finally coming home, " Lai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Solomon prime minister's ouster not to affect ties with Taiwan: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between Taiwan and the Solomon Islands will not be affected
by the ouster of the South Pacific ally's prime minister, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) acting spokeswoman Yeh Fei-pi said Friday.</P>
      <P>Solomon Islands lawmakers ousted Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare in a vote of
no-confidence Thursday, as large numbers of police and soldiers patrolled the
country's capital to deal with any possible unrest stemming from the decision.</P>
      <P>Despite the ouster, Yeh said, the Solomon Islands' general social situation
remains stable. The country is expected to pick a new prime minister in two
weeks.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has maintained close contacts with both the Solomon Islands'
ruling and opposition parties, Yeh said bilateral relations are not expected to
change regardless of which party wins the premiership. According to Yeh, various
bilateral cooperative programs will also continue to be carried out without any
hitch.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the Solomon Islands have maintained cordial relations since forging
diplomatic ties were forged 24 years ago, Yeh said, adding she believes that the
long-term friendship between the two countries will remain intact following the
South Pacific nation's Cabinet reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Solomon lawmakers voted 25 to 22 in the 48-member parliament to support a no-
confidence motion put forward by the opposition led by lawmaker Fred Fono, who
has accused Sogavare of arrogance and sending the Solomons' international
reputation plummeting during his 20-month rule.</P>
      <P>Sogavare came to power in April last year in the wake of rioting that devastated
the country's capital. He has since caused a series of controversies with his
abrasive style and verbal attacks on regional power Australia, according to
foreign wire service reports.</P>
      <P>Sogavare, who abstained from voting without explaining why, said he accepts the
outcome with "humility." He told reporters he would remain in parliament until
his four-year term ends in 2010.</P>
      <P>The Solomon Islands is located some 1,800 kilometers northeast of Australia.
With an area of about 28,000 square kilometers, it has a population of slightly
more than 530,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative candidate Liu Chien-kuo of the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party
put forth some different proposals Friday on helping the disadvantaged in his
effort to win voter support in Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing social welfare as his core campaign theme, Liu stressed that
"subsidies" and "relief" are not the most effective approaches in terms of
helping the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Instead, Liu said during a campaign rally in the south-central county,
disadvantaged groups should be provided with assistance that allows them to live
"independently and sustainably."</P>
      <P>He added that the term "disadvantaged" should be replaced with "untapped
advantages" in describing members of these groups as "disadvantages can be
turned into advantages if the concept of sustainable operations is
materialized."</P>
      <P>Liu said that if elected, he will see to it that seniors living alone are
provided with free meals on a regular basis, that disabled individuals are given
the opportunity to have their own careers, that foreign spouses are provided
with free language and cultural classes to help them assimilate into Taiwan
society quickly, and that children from low-income families are provided with
free, regular kindergarten and after-class education.</P>
      <P>During the rally, representatives of 20-odd disadvantaged groups jointly
expressed their support for Liu, presenting him with a pair of shoes as a
symbolic gesture of their hope that he will be able to move forward with solid
strides in representing his constituents.</P>
      <P>In return, Liu promised his supporters that if elected, he will work tirelessly
to take care of "the elderly, the weak, and women and children."</P>

      <P>Taiwan-based Wintek Corp. replaced South Korea's Samsung SDI as the world's
largest supplier of mobile phone displays in the third quarter of 2007 for the
first time by contributing 14.2 percent to the world's total shipments,
according to a report released Friday by the display market research and
consulting firm DislaySearch.</P>
      <P>DisplaySearch tallies show that Wintek shipped 47.26 million mobile phone panels
in the third quarter of 2007, up 39 percent quarter-on-quarter and 76 percent
year-on-year. The growth rates were the highest among the world's  top five
mobile phone display manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The report said Wintek's recent efforts to expand its production line for thin
film transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs) have significantly boosted
the company's TFT-LCD production, with the shipments of TFT-LCD panels for
mobile phones as a percentage of the company's  total  shipments  rising  seven
percentage  points quarter-on-quarter to 19 percent for the third quarter.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Samsung SDI shipped 39.19 million mobile phone panels,
up 6 percent quarter-on-quarter and accounting for 11.8 percent of the world's
total shipments, the report said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, shipments by Sharp, Epson and TPO accounted for 10.2 percent, 9.5
percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, of the world's total for the third
quarter of 2007.  Shipments by the five manufacturers together accounted for
53.2 percent of the world's total for the quarter.</P>
      <P>The report noted that both Sharp and TPO are shifting to low temperature poly-
silicon (LTPS) TFT-LCD manufacturing process.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 33.9 million TFT-LCD mobile phone panels shipped by Sharp in the
third quarter of 2007, 20.7 million were produced using the LTPS technology,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>TPO shipped 15 million LTPS-based TFT-LCD mobile phone panels in the third
quarter, making it the world's second-largest manufacturer of the products, the
report said.</P>
      <P>It said the world's total shipments for mobile phone displays amounted to 332.8
million for the third quarter of 2007, up 19 percent over the previous quarter
to hit a new high for a single quarter.</P>
      <P>However, owing to an 18-percent drop in the average unit price of mobile phone
panels, the value of the shipments declined 8 percent year-on-year to US$2.77
billion for the third quarter of 2007, according to the report.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Friday a series of new government incentives
to boost Taiwan's tourism in the coming two years, including relaxing the
eligibility standards for subsidies on Taiwan-bound charter flights and offering
free credit of up to NT$400,000 (US$12,384) for domestic spending to lucky
foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>Making the announcement while addressing the opening of the Taipei International
Travel Fair 2007, Chang said the Cabinet has designated 2008 and 2009 the "Tour
Taiwan Years, " during which the government will take various measures to
attract more international visitors to make Taiwan a major travel destination in
Asia.</P>
      <P>For example, the government will offer free of charge credit worth NT$100,000 to
the one millionth visitor, NT$200,000 to the two millionth visitor, NT$300,000
to the three millionth visitor and NT$400,000 to the four millionth visitor, he
said.</P>
      <P>Also, the government will provide a US$30,000 bonus to any cruise liners with at
least 2,000 passengers that makes a mid-journey stop in Taiwan and lower the
threshold making Taiwan-bound charter flights eligible for government subsidies,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to officials at the Ministry of Transportation and Communications'
Tourism Bureau, while subsidies are currently being provided to round-trip
charter flights carrying at least 100 passengers, the passenger threshold will
be lowered to 50 next year, and one-way charter flights will also be subsidized.</P>
      <P>Taiwan sees approximately 15,000 visitors arrive via charter flights per year,
with Japanese charter flights accounting for the largest number of arrivals, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to encourage more South Korean citizens to visit Taiwan, the government
will also increase the subsidies for South Korean charter flights next year,
they said.</P>
      <P>While the subsidies will be raised from 5 million won (US$5,384) to 6.25 million
won for charter flights heading for Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport or
Kaohsiung International Airport, the amount will be increased from 6.25 million
won to 7.5 million won for charter flights heading for other Taiwanese airports,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration's bid over the past year
to push for the country to enter the United Nations under the name Taiwan has
helped put Taiwan on the map,  members of the Taiwan Association of University
Professors (TAUP) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference marking the publication of the TAUP observation of
Taiwan's political climate in 2007, Hsu Chu-feng, deputy secretary-general of
the TAUP, said the unprecedented U.N. bid initiated by the DPP administration
has not only helped consolidate the national identity of the people of Taiwan,
it also constitutes a successful diplomatic strike.</P>
      <P>Hsu claimed that the U.N.-bid efforts have forged a new, nationwide consensus,
which in turn has helped consolidate the national identity of the people of
Taiwan, and that the international community has for the first time heard the
common voice of Taiwan's people, which is making the Beijing leadership unhappy.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-sheng, an honorary professor with National Taiwan University's
Graduate Institute of National Development, said that although the maiden bid to
seek the country's entry into the U.N. under the name Taiwan did not succeed,
the motion was, for the first time, brought up for discussion by the U.N.
General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The number of international media reports on the bid was also four or five times
greater than that given bids made by the ex-Kuomintang administration seeking to
return the Republic of China to the U.N., Chen said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the DPP-initiated U.N. bid was a successful diplomatic strike,
which has significantly  increased Taiwan's visibility in the international
community.</P>
      <P>On the issue of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Chen said that rationally
speaking, Taiwan is not the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan return the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which
are located closer to the Chinese mainland than to Taiwan proper, to China and
then found a Republic of Taiwan under the spirit of the U.N. Chapter.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the Taiwanese authorities bring those Kinmen and Matsu
residents who recognize Taiwan to settle in Taiwan and resettle those Taiwanese
residents who recognize the ROC to Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that both notions of the signing of a cross-strait peace accord and
the draft of an act governing peaceful engagement between Taiwan and China are
pitfalls.</P>
      <P>He also called on Taiwan's voters to remain alert against Chinese espionage,
claiming that Chinese hands have already been in the upcoming presidential race
and referendums.</P>
      <P>Chuang Han-lin, a lecturer with the Minghsin University of Science and
Technology, said that Taiwan's hard-earned democracy will face an "unprecedented
crisis" if the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its allied parties win the
majority seats of the next legislature and the KMT presidential  candidate  Ma
Ying-jeou  wins  the 2008 presidential race.</P>

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) head said Friday that except  for
emergency  medical  relief, helicopters will still be barred from making rooftop
landings in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CAA Director General Chang Kuo-cheng made the remarks after Far Eastern Group
Chairman Douglas Hsu suggested Thursday that, due to heavy traffic between
Taipei and Taoyuan, the government open helicopter routes between Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport and some high buildings in Taipei whose roofs suit
helicopter landings.</P>
      <P>Hsu's idea has obtained the support of Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>However, Chang stressed that helicopter rooftop landings are only permitted in
cases of emergency medical relief efforts considering that once such service is
opened it will negatively affect aviation security in Taipei's air space, which
is relatively small.</P>
      <P>Chang said any private flying vehicle or charter plane will have to apply the
permission from the CAA before flying along already fixed routes.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, a helicopter flying from Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport to Taipei could only land at Taipei Songshan Airport.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng held a press conference Friday in a rare
move to remind the Executive Yuan that the legislature has the constitutional
power to screen budgetary bills and to urge Cabinet officials to refrain from
interfering in budget screening by lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Wang took the move after he was called on by Minister Lee Yung-teh of the
Council for Hakka Affairs (CHA) the previous day to explain why he endorsed a
proposal put forth by Legislator Wong Chung-chun of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) to postpone legislative negotiations on the CHA's budget for next year and
to freeze the unspent portion of the CHA's 2007 budget.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wang, Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, the director of the KMT Policy
Coordination Committee, was also named in the CHA's Thursday statement
denouncing Wong for his "irrational" proposal.</P>
      <P>The CHA statement came after Lee accused Wong of holding Executive Yuan
officials hostage by proposing to freeze the council's budget after it failed to
subsidize a planned Hakka cultural and biological park construction project in
the southern county of Chiayi at Wong's request.</P>
      <P>In the CHA statement, the council also asked Wong to explain why he brought up
the proposal, and to identify the law on which he based his call to freeze the
council's remaining budget.</P>
      <P>The statement, however, was regarded by the legislative speaker as an offense
against the legislative power to examine budget bills.</P>
      <P>At the Friday press conference, Wang released a formal statement, in which he
reiterated that lawmakers shoulder the duty and are endowed with the
constitutional power to request a budget cut when they discover improper
governmental acts in writing or executing a budget.</P>
      <P>Wang also stated that any disputed issues at the Legislative Yuan should be
dealt with through negotiations among legislative caucuses of the political
parties, and that since the 2008 general budget is still being negotiated, he
suggested that the CHA and other Executive Yuan agencies refrain from
interfering in the budget screening processes of the various legislative
committees to avoid affecting general budget negotiations.</P>

      <P>Responding to main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers' criticisms of
President Chen Shui-bian's public revelation of having received a threatening
letter, the Presidential Office urged the party Friday not to gloat over others'
misfortune as doing so could invite crime.</P>
      <P>Presidential  Office Public Affairs Department Director Lee Nan-yang issued the
call after various KMT lawmakers criticized Chen for making public the letter
and questioned his motives in a forum at the Legislative Yuan earlier the same
day.</P>
      <P>While stumping Thursday in Taipei for a legislative candidate of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Chen told supporters that the Presidential
Office had received a letter earlier that same day threatening his daughter with
rape, his eldest grandson with abduction and himself against two bullets.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Alex Fai questioned why the intelligence and investigative
authorities have not conducted a probe if someone really sent a threatening
letter to the president, while his KMT counterpart Chang Jen-hsiang blamed Chen
for upsetting the social atmosphere by bringing the issue into the limelight.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Chen disclosed the incident to remind the public to pay greater
attention to violence and threats, Lee asked the KMT not to apply double
standards to similar cases because such an attitude would encourage crime and
would not help forge social harmony.</P>
      <P>"Any intention to exercise violence must be condemned, regardless of one's
political stance, " Lee said, adding that "threatening the president is a very
serious matter, and the outside world should not politicize Chen's disclosure of
the incident."</P>
      <P>Despite the threatening letters sent to President Chen, DPP vice presidential
candidate Su Tseng-chang said that he has no plans to increase the number of
personnel in his security detachment.</P>
      <P>Su blasted those who try to create chaos and upset public order in society
through violent means and expressed hope that Taiwan's society would maintain

      <P>Members of a civic group, Citizen Congress Watch (CCW) , staged a protest
outside the Legislative Yuan Friday against the legislature's plan to wrap up
the current session Dec. 21, 10 days earlier than the legally prescribed date.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan holds two sessions each year, with
the first lasting from Feb. 1 to the end of May, and the second from Sept. 1 to
Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>Since the term of incumbent lawmakers will come to an end Jan. 31 when they will

who will join the elections have proposed an early end to the current
legislative session to allow them to concentrate on their election campaigns.</P>
      <P>The early recess plan was given the green light earlier this week but soon drew
opposition from activists dedicated to pushing for judicial and legislative
system reforms, who denounced the decision to end the legislative session ahead
of schedule as a waste of public money.</P>
      <P>CCW Chairman Ku Chung-hua claimed Friday that the decision will waste over NT$50
million of the taxpayers' money, the amount 213 incumbent lawmakers will draw in
wages reviewing the more than 1,000 backlogged bills at the Legislative Yuan.</P>

      <P>More countries are looking to woo Taiwanese tourists as outbound tourism
continues  to grow,  said travel representatives from various countries at an
international travel fair Friday.</P>
      <P>"The reason is clear. Almost half of your [Taiwan's] population at least made a
trip overseas last year, " Robert Young, a staff in Hungarian Trade Office in
Taipei, spoke about Taiwan's tourism potential.</P>
      <P>Hungary was among seven new presenters at the 2007 Taipei International Travel
Fair taking place from Dec. 14-17 with 62 participating countries at the annual
event. Other first-timers are Nauru, the Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu, the
Solomon Islands and Greece.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) in November, the number of outbound Taiwanese
tourist trips reached 7.68 million between January and October this year.</P>
      <P>"Currently 15,000 Taiwanese tourists visit Hungary every year, and we're
targeting 25,000," Young said, adding that negotiations on direct flights
between Taiwan and Budapest is ongoing and hopefully a deal will be reached next
year.</P>
      <P>The Czech Republic has been trying to attract not only Taiwanese investment but
tourists as well. Of 30,000 visitors last year, most of them were businessmen,
CzechTourism representative Lucie Turkova said, adding that as bilateral trade
and investment increase, tourism is also expected to boom and that's why they're
here.</P>
      <P>Travel agencies have also changed with the times and are going with the latest
trends. In the past, most Taiwanese tourists wanted to visit as many countries
and spots as possible, but that is no longer the case, said Mathias Hultgren,
who represents the Swedish travel agency Scandinavian Perspectives Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Travel plans in the past basically excluded young people because only senior
citizens were able to enjoy a two to three weeks trip, " Hulgren said. About
50,000 Taiwanese tourists visited Sweden last year, he said.</P>
      <P>Agencies are also employing different strategies to attract Taiwanese tourists.
Hultgren said their main target was those who have been to Europe but never
visited Scandinavia, and people who are interested in seeing a different part of
Europe.</P>
      <P>"How many [Taiwanese] people visit Toronto every year? " Hultgren said, adding
that Taiwanese have had the misconception that Sweden was too far away for an
affordable trip, but the distance between Taipei and Stockholm is about the same
as that between Taipei and Toronto.</P>
      <P>As usual, Japan took up the most booths, 66 in all, although representatives
from Hong Kong and Macao also made their presence felt at the fair.</P>
      <P>DGBAS statistics showed that Hong Kong, Japan and Macao were the top three
destinations for outbound Taiwanese tourists this year.</P>

adding that the number shows a 44 percent growth of the figure in 2004, which
was the first year of the event.</P>
      <P>Runners who break any records in the full marathon will win NT$1 million
(US$30,865), while local runners who break Taiwanese records will win
NT$100,000, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese athletes such as Wu Wen-chien and Hsu Yu-fang, both of whom have set
previous local records, will compete along with 10 top-class foreign runners,
including two from Kenya who are very likely to break records and win the
general championship, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>For the past three years, the event's sponsor has donated about NT$5 million as
social welfare funds. The amount is decided every year according to the number
of runners who complete the race, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The sponsor has invited the public to join a fundraising activity to be held
alongside this year's marathon with the aim of raising more funds for social
welfare, in addition to the amount to be decided by the race results, the
spokesman said.</P>

      <P>A documentary film about the education of foreign spouses in Taiwan premiered in
Taipei City Thursday, with the aim of encouraging more new immigrants to study
Mandarin and local cultures so as to better integrate into Taiwanese society, an
education official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The film, produced by Taiwanese director Tsai Tsung-lung, was made at the
invitation of the Ministry of Education (MOE), which has provided aseries of
courses on both local languages and cultures at local schools to help foreign
spouses adapt to life in Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that as of October this year, the number of Taiwan's
new immigrants through marriage reached nearly 400,000, but only about 70,000 of
them have taken Mandarin lessons provided by the MOE.</P>
      <P>One of the film's three leading characters, Kao Hsien-hsiang, an immigrant from
Vietnam, has lived in Taiwan for over eight years and finished taking lessons at
Sihsian Elementary School in Taipei County last year.</P>
      <P>Kao told reporters that she was saddened seeing immigrants from her country
suffering from communication difficulties and social discrimination. With her
husband's support, she later decided to take lessons  and now works as a
volunteer  at a local household registration office in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The film also shows another two characters with different life experiences and
difficulties regaining confidence and acquiring local knowledge via a variety of
channels as they prepare themselves for future life challenges.</P>
      <P>Director Tsai said he discovered during the production of the documentary that
discrimination against foreign spouses is a common phenomenon in Taiwanese
society. "Many Taiwanese people are reluctant to understand them or give them
chances to speak up, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the film will prompt more foreign spouses to learn local
languages and cultures in order to better communicate with Taiwan's people and,
at the same time, help Taiwan's people better understand the difficulties
foreign spouses face, their feelings and thoughts as new immigrants.</P>
      <P>The film will also be shown around the country at 12 seminars on the MOE's
policies on new immigrants from Dec. 14 to Jan. 6, the official said.</P>

      <P>The minister of the Council for Hakka Affairs (CHA) apologized Friday to
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng for mistakenly blaming him for a disputed
proposal at the Legislative Yuan to freeze the CHA's unspent budget.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-teh visited Wang at the Legislative Yuan earlier in the day to make the
apology after the CHA released a statement Thursday asking Wang to explain why
he endorsed the proposal put forth by Legislator Wong Chung-chun of the
opposition Kuomintang to postpone legislative negotiations on the CH A's budget
for next year and to freeze the unspent portion of the council's 2007 budget.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang pointed out that no Executive Yuan agencies have the power to
interfere in budget screening by lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Lee said he mistook the signature Wang wrote on the proposal document  to
acknowledge  his receipt of the paper as Wang's endorsement of the proposal.</P>
      <P>Lee continued to denounce Wong for holding the CHA hostage in an attempt to have
his request fulfilled, referring to Wong's failure to win the CHA's subsidizing
of a planned Hakka cultural  park construction project in Shuishang township in
Chiayi County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dozens of Shuishang township residents led by Wong protested at the CHA Friday
after the council decided not to subsidize the project, the cost of which has

      <P>"Taiwan" or "I Love Taiwan" might appear in a New Year firework show at the top
of Taipei 101, one of the highest skyscrapers in the world, a spokesman for
Taipei Financial Center Corp., which manages the building, said Friday.</P>
      <P>The company will choose between the two wordings rather than the government
slogan "U.N. for Taiwan," said Michael Liu, assistant vice president of the
company's Corporate Public Affairs.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the company will avoid using what he described as "politically
sensitive" and "controversial" slogans.</P>
      <P>"U.N. for Taiwan" is being used by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government to promote the country's bid to join the United Nations under the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Tourism  Bureau  under the Cabinet-level  Ministry  of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) had planned to display the slogan in the firework show in
an effort to raise the international profile of the country's U.N. membership
bid.</P>
      <P>However, the bureau's plan drew protests from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
-controlled Taipei city government, which approved the company's plan to stage
the firework show earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Amid rumors that the Taipei city government had deliberately postponed the
screening of the company's firework show plan, DPP Taipei City Councilor Chuang
Jui-hsiung called a press conference in which he accused the city government of
applying double standards to its screening of the application.</P>
      <P>The city government told the company late last year that the screening would not
be subject to the Firework and Firecracker Regulation Act, Chuang noted.</P>
      <P>However, the city government has changed its stance this year and now requires
the company to abide by the act, Chuang claimed.</P>
      <P>Noting that the city government is not the sponsor of the firework show, Chuang
said it should not have interfered with the wording of the show.</P>
      <P>However, an official of the city's Fire Department, who was also present at the
press conference, responded that the city government did not change its stance
and did not conduct the screening according to the act.</P>
      <P>The screening process was delayed because the company's safety plan failed to
pass the city government's screening, the city official explained, dismissing
rumors that the city government purposefully delayed the screening.</P>
      <P>The city government approved the firework show plan soon after the company
submitted an improved safety plan, the official went on.</P>
      <P>Taipei 101 will set off 12,000 fireworks this year -- 3,000 more than last year
-- Liu said, adding that fireworks will also be set off over the skyscraper for
the first time.</P>
      <P>More than 600,000 people are expected to watch the New Year show, the city
official noted.</P>

      <P>There were 327 sexual assaults cases in the ten-month period, up by 48 year on

      <P>Officials called on the public to swiftly turn to the county's social affairs
bureau or police authorities for help if they find relatives or friends have
been assaulted.</P>

      <P>The government will stop referring to the tombs of the late Presidents Chiang
Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo as "mausoleums" and will simply call each a "tomb,
grave or cemetery, " Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jyh-wey said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks while commenting on issues concerning the government's
plan to withdraw military guards posted at the Chiangs' graves in Tashi, Taoyuan
County, where their remains are temporarily interred.</P>
      <P>Calling the plan part of the government's efforts to achieve transitional
justice, Shieh said the government has been benevolent enough to have dispatched
military guards to protect the mausoleums for so many years after the end of
martial law in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It would be very unreasonable if anyone were to think the government should
continue using taxpayers' money for the purpose, Shieh said, pointing out that
the government has prepared new tombs for the permanent burial of the two late
presidents at Taipei County's Wuchihshan Military Cemetery.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with
law schools at the prestigious Stanford University and Cornell University in the
United States, under which the ministry will send several outstanding
prosecutors as visiting scholars to receive training at the two institutes, MOJ
sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The cooperative agreements aim to cultivate prosecutors' legal knowledge  and
foreign language competence  and offer them an opportunity to broaden their
perspectives in hopes that they will be able to better represent  Taiwan while
attending international conferences and engaging in negotiations with foreign
countries, the sources explained.</P>
      <P>With a view to raising the standard of prosecutorial services, the MOJ has
proactively sought to forge links with prestigious law schools in the United
States and Japan and selected excellent prosecutors to visit the educational
institutions to learn about the theory and practice of criminal law systems in
various countries and the operational advantages and shortcomings of their
systems, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, the MOJ has clinched MoUs with Yale University and Harvard
University in the U.S., as well as the University of Tokyo and Waseda University
in Japan, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors who are selected under the plan will be granted paid study leave,
full tuition subsidies, plus round-trip flight tickets, the sources noted,
adding that they will be required to serve at the MOJ for a specific period of
time after returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, a cumulative total of 16 prosecutors have returned to Taiwan and
worked at various units at the MOJ after finishing their overseas studies,
according to the sources.</P>
      <P>As the MOJ is Taiwan's representative agency at meetings of the Asia Pacific
Group on Money Laundering (APG) , the Financial Action Task Force on Money
Laundering (FATF) , the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the World
Trade Organization (WTO), there is an imminent need to train prosecutors to
improve foreign language proficiency and professional expertise if they are to
be involved in negotiations with other countries, the sources went on.</P>
      <P>The MOJ has frequently sent prosecutors to attend international negotiations,
meetings or training sessions in Belgium, Australia Japan in the past few months
of this year, and has recently dispatched prosecutors to join a Taiwan-EU
workshop on legal affairs in Belgium, according to the sources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academics and social activists called Friday for greater humanity for new
immigrants on the part of the government when drafting relevant policies.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the non-profit Awakening Foundation and
attended by scores of academics, representatives of civic groups and immigrants,
Liao Yuan-hao, an associate professor at National Chengchi University, said the
government should work out more humanitarian policies and mechanisms for new
immigrants and foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>Citing a legally binding requirement that new foreign spouses must have assets
of NT$400,000 (US$12,310) as an example, Liao said many groups dedicated to
helping new immigrants have sought to have the Legislative Yuan scrap this rule.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma
Ying-jeou has promised to help push for such a law amendment. Liao added that
they will also seek to meet ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and ask for his assistance.</P>
      <P>Many laws currently enacted by the government, such as the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area and the
Immigration Law, are hostile to immigrants, Liao said.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to adjust its mindset when drawing up policies by taking
human rights for immigrants into account instead of merely focusing on entry and
exit controls or the "quality" of human resources.</P>
      <P>The professor also encouraged social service activists to seek breakthroughs and
challenges on the legal front and think out of the box in order to better assist
new immigrants.</P>
      <P>Liao said he is optimistic that several amendment proposals to the Nationality
Law will be discussed at the Legislative Yuan before it adjourns its present
session late this month.</P>
      <P>Chung Chin-ming, chairman of a cross-Taiwan Strait marriage promotion group,
said Taiwan's laws and regulations are very unfriendly to Chinese spouses of
local citizens, despite the fact that bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and
China have rapidly increased over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Due to a quota management system implemented by the government, it takes some 33
years for Chinese husbands and wives who hope to be naturalized as Taiwanese to
get an ID card, according to Chung.</P>
      <P>Men and women from Taiwan and China have established at least 250,000 families
to date, with the number of their family members and relatives in Taiwan
climbing to more than 1 million, Chung said, pointing out that the government's
long-term discriminatory treatment of Chinese spouses negatively impacts local
society.</P>

      <P>It was Lu Yi-chih's second international award of the year, having already been
the runner-up in the Sendai International Music Competition in Japan in June.</P>
      <P>Lu impressed the five judges from Austria and Czech Republic with his playing of
Haydn's sonata in the preliminary, two of Brahms' rhapsodies in the semi-final,
and working with a local symphony orchestra in Arad to play Beethoven's Piano
Concertos No. 5 "Emperor" in the final round.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old Lu attributed winning the Audience Choice Award to his
outstanding performance of the Concertos No. 5, but admitted that he played a
bit under par in the preliminary and semi-final rounds due to a serious cold and
therefore lost the grand prize as the final score was based on all three
performances. "It is a pity, " he said.</P>

assets obtained by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) during its previous 55
years of rule in Taiwan, said Hsieh Hsin-ni, director of the party's Culture and

      <P>In addition, the DPP will tell the public how the KMT "irrationally" has blocked
a number of important bills at the legislature over the years, Hsieh went on.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's remarks came in response to a report in the Chinese-language United

run an "anti-Chiang" campaign in the run-up to Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is also a legislator, said the DPP's election campaign will show

    <HEADLINE>Supreme Court confirms president's confidentiality privilege</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  14  (CNA)
12/14/07  23:29:11
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Court confirmed Friday President Chen Shui-bian's "confidentiality
privilege" and revoked a Taiwan High Court ruling that did not positively
address Chen's demand to reclaim a collection of documents and articles held by
the Taipei District Court in its probe into the "state affairs fund" misuse
case.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court told the High Court to make a new ruling on Chen's petition
for reclamation of the documents based on whether Chen's explanation of the
importance of keeping the documents confidential is justified.</P>
      <P>The High Court ruled Oct. 22 that the District Court should first determine
whether  Chen  himself  or the Presidential  Office secretary-general  is
authorized to request the return of the collection under the Presidential Office
Organization Law.</P>
      <P>As the laws to be used in the case depend on the status or identity of the
applicant, the High Court ruling said the District Court should not have made a
judgment on Chen's request before it had deliberated on whether Chen has the
right to make such a request in the first place.</P>
      <P>If Chen is not a suitable applicant, the High Court ruling said the District
Court just needs to turn down the request and need not bother to check whether
Chen is eligible to proclaim the documents as "strictly confidential" in terms
of his confidentiality privilege.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the High Court revoked the District Court's previous
ruling and demanded that the District Court mete out a new judgment.
Dissatisfied with the High Court ruling, Chen appealed the case to the Supreme
Court.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court said in its verdict that since the Council of Grand Justices
has recognized  the president's  confidentiality privilege in its No. 627
constitutional interpretation,  other national agencies should respect or abide
by the ruling.</P>
      <P>Given such a privilege, the president is eligible to determine whether a
document should be kept confidential for national security or national interest
concerns, no matter whether such a document is still in his possession  or has
already  been handed to any Presidential Office unit.</P>
      <P>If the president is not allowed to determine the document's confidentiality once
it has been handed over to another unit for documentation, the Supreme Court
said the president's privilege would be undermined.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  the Supreme Court said the Presidential  Office secretary-general is
just the president's chief of staff and should not himself enjoy confidentiality
privileges.</P>
      <P>Based on this understanding, the Supreme Court said the High Court should decide
whether the documents should be returned to Chen based on his explanation and
need not bother to check who is obliged to apply for the return of the
documents.</P>
      <P>Chen asked for the return of the collection Sept. 6 on the grounds that the
collection were "strictly confidential" information under the protection of the
Classified National Security Information Protection Act and should be kept
secret permanently.</P>
      <P>The president said in his petition that the collection was labeled "strictly
confidential" in line with CGJ Ruling No. 627, which confirms the president's
constitutional right to decide what constitutes a state secret and his right to
refuse disclosure, also known as confidentiality privilege.</P>
      <P>The collection consists of invoices, vouchers, magnetic records, written
testimony by concerned individuals and data related to six secret diplomatic
projects from 2002 to last December.</P>
      <P>The District Court obtained the collection of documents and articles from a
prosecutorial team that indicted the first lady and three other defendants last
November on charges of corruption and forgery for allegedly embezzling NT$14.8
million (US$450,000) from the "state affairs fund, " a special allowance fund
set aside for the president's discretionary use for official purposes. Chen was
named as a "joint perpetrator" in the case, but he was not indicted because of
his immunity from prosecution as prescribed in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The lawyers of President Chen and four defendants in the case -- first lady Wu
Shu-jen and three of Chen's former and incumbent aides -- appealed to the High
Court Oct. 15 after the District Court turned down the presidential request for
the return of the collection in a ruling issued Oct. 5.</P>
      <P>The District Court based its rejection on the grounds that the president's
proclamation of the collection fo documents as "strictly confidential" is
illegal. According to the Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) Ruling No. 627 issued
June 15, President Chen is entitled to appeal to the Taiwan High Court over
disputes with the district court or prosecution  concerning the exercise of his
confidentiality privilege.</P>
      <P>As the four defendants in the "state affairs fund" case do not have the right to
appeal the District Court ruling on the ownership of the collection of
documents, the High Court ruling said they should not appeal again over the
case.</P>

      <P>The president, who doubles as DPP chairman, asked the media not to ask him to
comment on such reports, which he described as "hearsay."</P>
      <P>"The DPP is in power and I'm the president. We have always followed the right
way in doing things, and there are no dirty tricks," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that during the 2004 presidential election, his rival accused him of
staging an election-eve assassination attempt in which he and Vice President
Annette Lu were slightly injured, to win sympathy votes.</P>
      <P>He described his rival's accusation as a 'dirty trick."</P>
      <P>He also said reports that he might impose martial law prior to the Jan. 12
legislative elections or postpone the elections are untrue.</P>
      <P>In a rally to stump for a DPP legislative candidate in Taipei County Nov. 25,
Chen said he was mulling several options proposed by some activists, including
the imposition of martial law and the postponement of the legislative elections,
to deal with the issue arising from the 18 cities and counties led by the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" that have refused to abide by the Central
Election Commission's decision to use a "one-step" voting system in the
legislative elections and two referendums scheduled for Jan. 12.</P>
      <P>But he made a clarification the following day, saying that Taiwan has come a
long way from authoritarian to democratic rule and that there is no question of
backpedalling and imposing martial law.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu suggested Saturday that the Hsinchu Science Park in
northern Taiwan should be active in efforts to maintain peace in the Taiwan
Strait by taking advantage of its cooperative ties with 23 other high-tech
facilities around the world.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks during a walking tour and a Hsinchu food festival organized
by the Hsinchu city and county governments and the park's administration office
to celebrate the science park's 27th founding anniversary and the 25th
anniversary of Hsinchu City's upgrading to a provincial municipality.</P>
      <P>In her address, Lu described the science park as one of Taiwan's important
diplomatic resources, citing the park's close connections with many other
similar facilities around the world.</P>
      <P>This year, Lu noted, the science park's production value is expected to hit
NT$1.25 trillion (US$38.63 billion) , which she said proves that Taiwan's high-
tech industry enjoys an influential global position.</P>
      <P>If the cross-Taiwan Strait situation becomes even more tense, the world will be
tense too, she said, adding that the science park might be able to help build a
peace network with its foreign allies if there is a political conflict between
the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park, established by the government in 1980, is regarded as
one of the world's most significant areas for semiconductor manufacturing. It is
home to the world's top two semiconductor foundries -- Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. and United Microelectronics Corp.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
denied reports Saturday that President Chen Shui-bian could use "dirty tricks"
to obstruct the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to reports by the United Daily News that said minutes of a
Dec. 8 closed-door meeting in Taipei between American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Raymond Burghardt and Vincent Siew, vice presidential candidate of the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), had been leaked.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Burghardt expressed concern in the meeting that Chen
could create a disturbance in the Taiwan Strait and announce the postponement of
the upcoming legislative and presidential elections, while Siew pointed out that
rumor has it Chen does not like Hsieh and could create an incident that would
allow Su Tseng-chang, the DPP vice presidential candidate, to replace Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Hsieh dismissed that the reports as unfounded, claiming that the minutes could
have been leaked by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Hsieh  also accused  Ma Ying-jeou,  his KMT rival in the presidential election,
of speaking ill of Taiwan in front of foreign dignitaries, claiming that Ma
criticized Taiwan during visits to Japan and the United States instead of
lashing out at China's deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su claimed that the KMT is actually best at "dirty tricks, " citing the smear
campaign by his rival during his bid for a second term as Pingtung county
magistrate.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT, in its bid to regain power, has attempted to use what he
claimed is the United States' "lack of full understanding" about Taiwan's
development  and is "using sensationalism"  to intimidate Taiwan people for its
own gains.</P>
      <P>Ma declined to comment on Siew's meeting with Burghardt, saying however, that
the KMT is keeping tabs on possible DPP election gambits.</P>
      <P>Siew, for his part, said he met with Burghardt in his capacity as an old friend
and that there was a tacit agreement between the two that the content of the
meeting would not be divulged.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that he would not have divulged the
content of threatening mail sent to the Presidential Office recently had the
letter not leveled a threat against his grandson.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending a lunch gathering of Tainan First Senior
High School alumni at the Legislative Yuan restaurant in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism that he caused unease among grassroots citizens by
playing up the incident, Chen said he made the revelation mainly because the
mail described his eldest grandson as a target.</P>
      <P>"I'm no stranger to death threats. Actually, I live under various kinds of
threat and intimidation every day. At the height of the `red-shirt' campaign
against me last year, I received an average of 20 death threats by phone, mail
or e-mail every day. I took them in stride and paid them no mind," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is now a pluralistic democratic society, Chen said it is not
uncommon that a public issue draws a myriad of voices and opinions.</P>
      <P>"I respect dissenting views, but I condemn violence. Everyone is free to air his
or her opinions via peaceful, non-violent means. Nobody should resort to violent
or non-peaceful ways of expression," he said.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival at the Legislative Yuan restaurant, an aide of opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Tsai Chin-lung stepped in front of him intending to heckle
Chen in a direct encounter,  he was immediately  bundled  away by police
officers  posted  at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Recalling that the mob of red-clad protesters spewed streams of invective at him
during last year's failed campaign to force him to step down over graft
allegations, Chen said he does not mind the expression of opposing views.</P>
      <P>"I would rather see excessive democracy than impose any `red line' or roadblocks
to undermine our hard-won democracy. This is probably why the reliability of
Taiwan's press is usually very low. Nevertheless, Taiwan ranks top among Asian
countries in press freedom surveys conducted by major international media
watchdogs, including Reporters Without Borders and Freedom House, " Chen said
proudly, adding that he will never back away from his commitment to upholding
full freedom of the press and freedom of speech.</P>

in Tainan County, southern Taiwan, at which Magistrate Su Huan-chih hosted a
charity auction of what he described as the best quality beef in the country.</P>
      <P>The venue was filled with the luscious aromas from 10 food stands selling paper-

      <P>A group of indigenous teachers in Taipei has been running a language program
since last year to keep native languages alive among indigenous people who live
in the cities, with good results so far, the group said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The objectives of the association are to promote the indigenous cultures of all
13 tribes and to teaching native languages to urban students of indigenous
descent, " said Pu Cheng-chan, president of the Taipei Indigenous Languages
Teachers Association (TILTA) on the sidelines of an indigenous culture festival
held at the Songshan Tobacco Factory.</P>
      <P>TILTA was established last year and now has 42 teachers who come from 13
Taiwanese tribes, most of whom are teaching native languages in Taipei City, Pu
said.</P>
      <P>Teachers have two-hour weekly classes in churches, schools, village offices and
even apartments. TILTA has had more than 700 students, ranging from elementary
school children to university students, participating in the free programs.</P>
      <P>Upah Yuki, an Atayal from Jianshih township in Hsinchu County, has been teaching
an Atayal class of 15 students in the Neihu and Nangang areas for the past year.</P>
      <P>Pu, a Tsuo from Alishan, Chiayi County, said the group launched the initiative
to complement the "Language Nest" program run by the Indigenous Peoples
Commission of the Taipei city government.</P>
      <P>"I'm happy to see that most of the indigenous students in Taipei City are
learning their native languages and that most parents are encouraging their
children to do so, " Pu said.</P>
      <P>In general, Taiwan's indigenous people are happy to see the government's efforts
in preserving indigenous cultures, said Upah.</P>
      <P>Upah, who has changed his name from his Chinese name back to his traditional
tribal name, said it is the right move for Sanmin township in Kaohsiung County
to adopt the new indigenous name of Namasiya township last week to honor its
Tsou tribal history.</P>
      <P>The move, he said, shows that the government is implementing the "New

      <P>Local financial holding groups will face increasing competition from their
foreign counterparts as the world's four major banking conglomerates have
managed to expand their Taiwan networks through acquisitions, market researchers
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The warning came after HSBC Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest bank by market value,
took over control of the debt-laden Chinese Bank Friday after the government
agreed to pay HSBC NT$47.49 billion (US$1.46 billion).</P>
      <P>The HSBC deal was the latest in a series of forays by foreign banks into the
Taiwan market. On June 8, ABN Amro Holding NV assumed control of Taitung
Business Bank while New York-based Citigroup Inc., the most profitable overseas
bank in Taiwan, bought the Bank of Overseas Chinese for NT$14.1 billion in
April. In September 2006, London-based Standard Chartered PLC acquired Hsinchu
International Bank.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's financial market is not very large, market analysts said
foreign banking groups mostly set their eyes on the vast Chinese market in their
acquisition bid for Taiwanese banks. Given the facts that Taiwan shares same
languages and cultural backgrounds with China, foreign banks can employ the
experiences they obtain in Taiwan for use in their foray into the Chinese
market.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the researchers said, the acquisition of Taiwanese banks will offer
foreign banks easy access to the immense financial service market for the large
number of Taiwan-funded companies in China and other Asian countries to expand
their Asian financial map.</P>
      <P>In addition, the analysts said, Taiwan's consumer banking and personal financial
management markets are also growing steadily. With a limited number of branches,
foreign banks used to have difficulties entering those emerging service fields.
After buying into Taiwanese banks, foreign banks can now expand their local
service networks and the return of their investment will become even more
evident in two or three years, the analysts said.</P>
      <P>Local financial holding company executives admitted that the entry of foreign
banks have posed a tremendous threat to market shares. "If we fail to upgrade
service quality and design innovative financial products, we could be overtaken
by our foreign counterparts in three years," said a senior executive of a local
financial holding company.</P>
      <P>Foreign banks are also expected to offer attractive employment terms to lure
away outstanding financial managers from local banks, posing yet another
challenge for local banks, the executive warned.</P>
      <P>In the face of growing competition from foreign banking groups, the executive
said local banks must step up manpower training, streamline overall operations,
upgrade product design capabilities and seek merger and acquisition
opportunities with their local counterparts to expand economies of scale. The
most suitable number of domestic branches of a local financial holding group
ranges between 180 and 200, the executive noted.</P>
      <P>According  to a deal reached  between  HSBC  and Taiwan's government-owned
Central Deposit Insurance Corp. (CDIC) , HSBC will take over Chinese Bank's
sound assets, including its branches, as well as debts and at least half of the
bank's' employees, while Taiwan's Financial Reconstruction  Fund will pay HSBC
NT$47.49 billion.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Bank is a unit of the bankrupt Rebar Group. The CDIC assumed control
of the bank after a run on its deposits early this year. The CDIC is the only
institution in Taiwan exclusively in charge of managing the deposit insurance
system and serves as an integral part of the country's financial safety net.</P>
      <P>HSBC said in a statement issued Friday that it plans to inject between US$300
million and US$400 million of fresh capital into Chinese  Bank  to ensure  its
enlarged  operations  will have "appropriate" financial ratios.</P>
      <P>"Chinese Bank will provide HSBC in Taiwan with significant opportunities in
retail, commercial and corporate banking, " HSBC's Taiwan Chief Executive
Alistair Currie said in the statement.</P>
      <P>HSBC, which has eight bank branches and 2,300 workers in Taiwan, said the
acquisition will increase the number of its branches on the island, Asia's
fourth-largest banking market, to 47.</P>

    <HEADLINE>6.1% of students receiving guidance have used drugs: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 6.1 percent of junior high school students receiving guidance
admitted they have used drugs, according to the results of a survey released by
the Champions Education Association over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The survey also revealed that 7.7 percent of the students smoke, and 7.2 percent
have joined a gang.</P>
      <P>Also, 15.1 percent of respondents tend to indulge in online friend-making, while
another 27.2 percent tend to indulge in cyber games.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out between May and June this year among 17,265 students
in the first year of junior high school. They were all participants in guidance
programs offered by the association in 24 counties and cities nationwide.</P>
      <P>On parent-child relations, 20 percent of respondents said they do not get along
well or have communication problems with their parents, and more than 30 percent
think their parents discipline their children too strictly, are inconsistent in
applying their rules to themselves or are dissatisfied with their children's
performance.</P>
      <P>The survey further revealed that approximately 50 percent of respondents find
going to school to be an unpleasant experience, 8-12 percent have been extorted
or threatened in school, and 13-20 percent are often bullied or ostracized by
their classmates.</P>
      <P>In addition, 30 percent of respondents are dissatisfied with their appearance,
50 percent care very much how others look at them, 30 percent often feel
depressed or sad for no reason, and 50 percent often see their emotions
influenced by others or fail to get enough sleep, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the results, Wang Fu-lin, head of the Ministry of Education's
Department of Military Training Education, said the ratio of drug-using students
in this survey is clearly higher than those of similar surveys conducted in the
past, which he said could be related to the fact that this survey targeted
students requiring extra attention and support.</P>
      <P>Results  of past surveys carried  out among teenagers  or undergraduates
indicate that 1-2 percent of respondents have used drugs, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is always a correlation between drug abuse and gang
participation and the issue of school dropouts, Wang said the ministry has in
recent years taken various measures to prevent students from dropping out and to
encourage dropouts to return to school.</P>
      <P>Of the more than 6,000 students dropping out of school during the last academic
year, over 600 admitted they left school because of the bad influence of their
friends, he pointed out, adding that school dropouts can be led astray more
easily than others because of their abnormal lifestyles.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, tallies from the National Police Agency show that 420 minors were
arrested for drug abuse during the first eight months of this year, compared
with 405 during the same period last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S.-Taiwan ties not affected by elections, referendums: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's upcoming legislative and presidential elections and the referendums to
be held alongside them are not affecting the country's bilateral ties with the
United States, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Tzu-pao said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang said while delivering a report at the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs
Committee that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has repeatedly stressed to
the U.S. government that the referendum on Taiwan's bid to enter the United
Nations as a full member under the name Taiwan will not alter the political
status quo across the Taiwan Strait and is by no means a move toward Taiwan
independence as Beijing has claimed.</P>
      <P>Yang said to the legislators from across the political spectrum that he would
describe 98 percent of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship as "very good" and the
remaining two percent as "not that smooth" because  the two sides remain divided
over Taiwan's  upcoming legislative and presidential elections as well as the
issues involved in the referendums.</P>
      <P>"This two percent is not having any adverse impact on the overall U.S.-Taiwan
relationship," Yang said, claiming that bilateral ties have continuously
improved and "this year is better than last year."</P>
      <P>Yang said the MOFA has repeatedly told Washington that the deepening of Taiwan's
democratization and the building of Taiwan's "distinctive identity" are the
"common assets" of Taiwan and the United States which also form the bedrock of
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the MOFA has also continued its efforts to improve bilateral
U.S.-Taiwan ties, including seeking a relaxation of U.S. restrictions on visits
of its Cabinet officials to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has also made continuous efforts to push for closer military and
security dialogue and cooperation between the two countries and has constantly
kept the United States informed about the  progress  in  Taiwan's  controls  on
the  export  of militarily-sensitive  products  and  in the  implementation  of
anti-terrorism policies, Yang said, adding that the MOFA has also expressed
Taiwan's willingness to offer humanitarian aid related to anti-terrorism efforts
to individuals from around the world and other countries in need.</P>

      <P>Chen further said that there is no discord within the mission.</P>
      <P>Reports quoting Legislator Sandy Yen of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party

the mission and therefore reported the matter to relevant authorities.</P>
      <P>The reports also said that divisions exist within the defense mission between
pro-DPP and pro-Kuomintang (KMT) factions due to the nonstop fighting between
the ruling and main opposition parties over the arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was appalled to hear about the reports, claiming the defense
mission has always striven to serve the country. He added that such divisions do
not exist and that the mission simply carries out the orders issued to it by the
government.</P>
      <P>He added that there is nothing unusual about the fact that he has been
transferred back to Taiwan, because his term has ended.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that he has not yet received any orders regarding Navy Rear Adm.

    <HEADLINE>Ocean-going fishing boats urged to pay heed to shark catch norms</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
12/17/07  15:49:20

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's deep sea fishing boats were urged Monday to gain a better understanding
of the international norms on the catching of sharks on the high seas.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Fisheries Agency under the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture called for operators of ocean-going fishing boats to keep in mind
international regulations governing the catching of sharks before heading to
open fishing grounds or other countries' territorial waters based on cooperative
contracts.</P>
      <P>Tsai Tien-hsiang, a Fisheries Agency department head in charge of deep sea
fishery, said that although shark fishing is not banned worldwide, the
international community has become increasingly aware of a sharp decline in
shark populations and many nations have either developed shark conservation
plans or have actually passed laws providing greater protection for the fish.</P>
      <P>The United Nations estimates that more than 100 million sharks are killed each
year -- whether as a target of commercial shark fisheries or as bycatch from
other fisheries, and studies show that shark populations have declined by 90
percent around the world in the last 50 years.</P>
      <P>Sharks are regularly killed for their fins to make the Asian delicacy known as
shark fin soup. In a gruesome and wasteful practice known as shark finning, a
shark is captured, its fins sliced off -- often while its still alive -- and the
animal then tossed back into the sea, dead or dying. The rest of the body is not
worth nearly as much as the fin, and having to take the whole shark to shore
uses up a lot of space on the boat, especially with larger sharks.</P>
      <P>Many countries have taken the problem of shark finning and other forms of shark
hunting seriously and some countries have even banned shark fishing altogether,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Various countries, including Australia,  the United States, Brazil, Canada and
the European Union have banned the inhumane practice of shark finning and
require that anyone bringing a shark fin to shore must also have the rest of the
carcass.</P>
      <P>Regional fishery organizations,  including the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) , the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission (IATTC) , the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the Western and
Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) , have also adopted an
international ban on shark finning.</P>
      <P>Tsai called for Taiwan's deep sea fishing boat operators to observe this finning
ban.</P>
      <P>Since sharks form some 10 percent-20 percent of bycatch from other deep sea
fisheries, deep sea fishing boats should report to the authorities of the ports
they visit about the amount of sharks they are carrying and present relevant
documentation, Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>He added that shark fishing norms vary from country to country. For example, he
said, Palau bans shark fishing altogether and prohibits fishing boats carrying
sharks or shark fins from calling at its ports or entering its territorial
waters.</P>

      <P>The leisure, tourism and restaurant industries are the favorite choices among
workers seeking a career change after the upcoming Chinese New Year, according
to the results of a survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey, carried out in October by an employment service Web site run by the
Council of Labor Affairs' Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training, shows
that 29.7 percent of the potential career changers  intend to enter the leisure,
tourism or restaurant industries.</P>
      <P>The second-most  popular choice are schools  or government agencies, which are
favored by 27.7 percent of potential career changers.</P>
      <P>While the hi-tech industry is preferred by 10.1 percent of the respondents, 9.7
percent hope to enter the finance and securities industries.</P>
      <P>Ko Chin-chang, operations director of the Web site, attributed the popularity of
the restaurant industry to the high profit margin and low entry threshold of the
industry.</P>
      <P>The high pay and flexible work hours of the tourism industry are making jobs
such as tour guides very attractive to potential career changers, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Web site provides information on 71 occupations in 15 trades, Ko
advised workers to do comprehensive research on the companies or industries they
plan to enter before actually making the move to change their jobs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's plan to inaugurate a new flight route 4.2 nautical miles west of the
median of the Taiwan Strait next January could affect cross-strait stability,
National Security Bureau (NSB) Director Shi Hwei-yow said Monday.</P>
      <P>China's act "should not be seen as an isolated case, as it would involve a
change of the status quo in the strait," Shi said.</P>
      <P>The action will affect Taiwan's flight safety and will squeeze the maneuvering
space of Taiwan's miliary planes in drills and training, he said.</P>
      <P>Beijing could also use the designation of the new route to step up monitoring of
Taiwan, he said in a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He noted that if the flight routes of the two sides of the Taiwan are too close
to each other, the overlapping routes could undermine flight safety.</P>
      <P>He said the bureau has convened a coordination meeting and has conveyed the
views to China via the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) . The CAA also
conveyed the concerns to the International Civil Aviation Organization.</P>
      <P>"We must react strongly to safeguard security," Shi said.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Chang Hsien-yao demanded that the NSB
contact China over the matter, to which Shi responded that China refuses to talk
to the Taiwanese authorities, including him.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-you said the median of the Taiwan Strait
helps restrain both sides, but added that China has in the past deviated toward
or even crossed the median during inclement weather conditions.</P>
      <P>China's new route will be very close to Taiwan, but the ministry will have a
standard procedure to deal with the situation, he said, adding that the air
force will respond based on the judgment of whether China's planes have bad
intentions.</P>

      <P>China's planned air route through the Taiwan Strait is likely to overlap
existing ones between Taiwan and its outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu,
posing a danger to Taiwanese air traffic safety, a Taiwanese aviation official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came one day after Vice President Annette Lu disclosed China's plan
to add an air route close to the median of the strait that separates the
airspace between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Billy Chang, director-general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA),
confirmed that Beijing has notified the CAA via Hong Kong aviation officials
regarding its new plan.</P>
      <P>In addition, China hopes that Hong Kong aviation authorities will represent the
Chinese government in negotiations with the CAA over the new air route, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>The CAA has reported the case to the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) as it involves complex political issues, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>At present, Chang said, the specific details of China's new route is not yet
clear and the CAA is trying to obtain relevant information about the route
through available channels.</P>
      <P>China's growing economy has resulted in increasing need for flights, Chang
noted, adding that the planned route is aimed at addressing the increasingly
busy routes between Hong Kong and Shanghai, which Chang said will pose a threat
to Taiwanese planes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's current air routes were planned prior to the loss of its United Nations
seat to the People's Republic of China in 1971, Chang said, noting that the
median of the strait has been tacitly accepted by both Taipei and Beijing for
decades.</P>

carries only a date of manufacture and provides no information about its

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator John Chiang rebutted Monday an
accusation that he has committed election bribery, claiming that chocolate coins
he gave away to potential voters are worth only NT$ 9 each.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who is seeking re-election in Taipei, made the remarks after his
election rival, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Julian Kuo,
made the accusation.</P>
      <P>Kuo claimed at a Legislative Yuan Judiciary Committee meeting that the
chocolates given out by Chiang are worth NT$ 40 each, which exceeds the NT$30
limit.</P>
      <P>In response, Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin, who was invited to deliver a
report and answer questions about its investigation of election bribery, said he
will look into the matter, which was already being investigated by the Taipei
Prosecutors Office. Chiang, meanwhile, provided the sales order for his
chocolate to prove their cost.</P>

handed out by Chiang are the same as those sold in the Starbucks coffee chain at
a retail price of NT$40 each.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice investigates bribery cases based on the market price
rather than wholesale price of gifts, Kuo said, adding that one Taipei city
councilor had his election annulled for giving out T-shirts, although he claimed
that they were cheap. The point is not how much the gift costs but how much
voters think it is worth, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Market price may vary depending on where one buys it, Chiang said, pointing out
that the same product might be sold at different prices in convenience stores,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several environmental groups urged the government Monday to pay heed to Taiwan's
greenhouse gas emissions, as its high emissions rate has caused concern in the
world community.</P>
      <P>At a press conference organized by the Taiwan Environmental Action Network
(TEAN) and the Green Party Taiwan, Cheng I-ching, a TEAN director,  noted that
at the just-concluded U.N. Climate Conference held on the Indonesian island of
Bali, many newly industrialized countries such as Singapore, South Korea and
Taiwan were listed as the next group of countries to be required to reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's high average per capita greenhouse gas emissions in particular
surprised the participants in Bali, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Cheng,  who participated in the Bali conference, said the conference had three
major developments -- the long-term goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions for
developed countries is gradually being adopted; the 25 top air polluters in the
world, including Taiwan, were told to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and some
underdeveloped  countries such as Brazil and South Africa are voluntarily
setting long-term reduction goals.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released at the conference, Cheng said Taiwan's average
greenhouse gas emission per capita rate tops the Asian list, adding that the
participating countries said they will not allow Taiwan to become a "loophole"
in the network designed to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the representatives and environmental groups of various
countries suggested that Taiwan adopt similar policies and measures to other
countries to control greenhouse gas emissions so that it does not encounter a
boycott facing the United States.</P>
      <P>The U.S., one of the top emitters of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping
emissions, refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol and said it is not yet ready to
commit to mandatory caps on greenhouse gases, causing strong criticism from the
rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Lin Tze-lun,  an assistant  professor  at National  Taiwan University, said that
although the U.S. has rejected any specific emission reduction  measures,  it
recognizes  the policies and suggestions made by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC).</P>
      <P>In addition, the conference has decided to set up a fund to help developing
countries establish an adjustment mechanism to manage climate-change.</P>
      <P>Lin added that it is worrisome that in Taiwan, only the Environmental Protection
Administration pays any attention to the issue, while other administrative
branches simply ignore the problem.</P>

      <P>A security official claimed Monday that civil servants would not dare to violate
the law by engaging in illicit wiretapping.</P>
      <P>National Security Bureau Director Shi Hwei-yow made the remarks after the main
opposition Kuomintang asked if the government had used bugs in the wake of the
leaking of the contents of a recent closed-door meeting in Taipei between KMT
vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew and Raymond Burghardt, American
Institute in Taiwan chairman.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Siew's office in a cross-strait peace foundation
initiated by KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan was also suspected of being bugged.</P>
      <P>Former Vice Legislative Yuan Speaker P.K. Chiang's office and KMT Legislator Su
Chi's office in the legislature were also suspected of having been bugged, the
reports said.</P>
      <P>Shi noted that according to the law regarding communication protection,
violators will be subject to up to five years in prison. No civil servants would
dare to break the law under such condition, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He also expressed regret that legislation on wiretapping has been in practice
for years, but the public still have misgivings.</P>
      <P>He said he has repeatedly asked for administrative neutrality and expressed hope
that "some political figures" will show restraint lest they incite crimes.</P>
      <P>Investigation Bureau head Yeh Sheng-mao also said that wiretapping of
individuals is carried out based on the law and claimed that the bureau "will
not wiretap any political parties."</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the bureau mainly targets cases under criminal investigation.
If there is substantive evidence, the bureau will request permission from
prosecutors to set up wiretaps.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>HSBC Holdings PLC, Europe's biggest bank in terms of market value, has agreed to
buy the Taipei-based Chinese Bank, which has been under government charge since
January following a financial fallout involving the bankrupt Rebar Asia Pacific
Group, which owns Chinese Bank.</P>
      <P>HSBC Holding agreed to take control of the debt-laden Chinese Bank Friday after
Taiwan's government agreed to pay it NT$47.49 billion (US$1.46 billion) based on
an indemnity clause.</P>
      <P>Alistair Currie, Taiwan CEO of the London-based banking giant, said at a news
conference Monday that HSBC will complete the acquisition deal in three months,
allowing the deal to begin making a profit from next year.</P>
      <P>The acquisition, which is still pending approval by relevant governmental
agencies, will increase the number of HSBC branches in Taiwan from eight to 47.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Asia's fourth-largest banking market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, HSBC said in a statement issued Friday that it plans to inject
between US$300 million and US$400 million in fresh capital into the Chinese Bank
to ensure that its enlarged operations will have "appropriate" financial ratios.</P>
      <P>According to the deal that HSBC struck with the government-owned Central Deposit
Insurance Corp. -- which was assigned to take over the Chinese Bank in the wake
of a bank run crisis triggered by the insolvency of two other companies under
the Rebar Group in January -- HSBC must establish its Taiwan subsidiary within
three years of the acquisition or within one year after the value of its assets
in Taiwan exceeds US$13.9 billion. The subsidiary should have capital of no less
than US$309 million.</P>
      <P>According to the deal, HSBC will take over Chinese Bank's sound assets,
including its branches, as well as its debts and at least half of the bank's
employees, or some 1,000 people, while Taiwan's Financial Reconstruction Fund
will pay HSBC NT$47.49 billion. HSBC currently has about 2,300 local employees.</P>
      <P>Local financial holding groups are seen to face increasing competition from
their foreign counterparts as the world's four major banking conglomerates have
managed to expand their Taiwan networks through acquisitions, market researchers
said.</P>
      <P>The researchers said the acquisition of Taiwanese banks will offer foreign banks
easy access to the immense financial service market for the large number of
Taiwan-funded companies in China and other Asian countries to help them expand
their Asian financial maps.</P>
      <P>In addition, the analysts said, Taiwan's consumer banking and personal financial
management markets are also growing steadily. With a limited number of branches,
foreign banks used to have difficulty entering those emerging service fields.
After buying into Taiwanese banks, foreign banks can now expand their local
service networks and the returns on their investments will become even more
evident in two or three years, the analysts said.</P>

in order to offer the children a healthier and more congenial educational
environment and reduce the financial burden on the families in the caring and
education of their children.</P>
      <P>According to the Association of Early Childhood Education Reform (AECER) , more
than 40 percent of Taiwanese families feel that kindergarten tuition imposes a
heavy burden on them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a pre-school educator, Ou Chi-you, noted that private kindergartens
account for nearly 70 percent of Taiwan's pre-school education  institutions,
but  the  quality  of these  private kindergartens is uneven, she added.</P>
      <P>To the surprise of all, the MOD decided to withdraw the bill from the
legislature after a group of private kindergarten entrepreneurs took to the
street early December to protest against the bill, which they believe will
negatively affect their businesses.</P>
      <P>The petitioners urged the government to continue pursuing its reform project,
which, according to the MOE, will make Taiwan's pre-school education environment
healthier, less profit-oriented, and friendlier to children, with several
scholars calling for the legislature to pass the bill to guarantee the budget to
support pre-school education.</P>

      <P>A three-day seminar on public construction planning and evaluation organized by
the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) with an
aim to prevent wasting of public funds opened Monday, CEPD Deputy Chairman Chang
Ching-sen said.</P>
      <P>The seminar was attended by over 400 representatives of local and central
governments as well as private counselling companies, Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, many public construction projects proceed without thorough
pre-evaluation or planning for future operation and management, causing problems
associated with plan alterations or insufficient budgets during construction.
Some are even left idle after being completed.</P>
      <P>To better preclude the possibility of wasting resources, the CEPD introduced
concepts of cost-effectiveness evaluation and financial planning  to seminar
participants,  most of whom  are public construction project planners with local
governments, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The seminar's agenda also covers case studies on both foreign and domestic
public  projects  in a number  of fields  such  as transportation, healthcare,
agriculture, water resource, and tourism.</P>
      <P>The CEPD is responsible for planning and examining central government public
construction projects, and has approved projects worth NT$131.5 billion (US$4.04
billion) this year, Chang said, adding that most of the budget will be used to
construct expressways, rail transportation, agriculture, and flood control
systems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will work to collect debts owed by a fugitive tycoon after
tracking down what could be some of his overseas assets, a spokeswoman of the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>FSC Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang was referring to Wang You-theng, founder and
owner of the Rebar Group who is now taking refuge in the United States with his
wife. Wang was found to have embezzled billions of dollars out of 70-odd
subsidiaries owned by the financially distressed Rebar Asia-Pacific Group.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the FSC has since May embarked on efforts to collect debts of
several prominent fugitive tycoons via the Bankers Association of the Republic
of China and financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The top priority targets are Wang, Tuntex Group founder Chen You-hao, and Guang
San Group Chairman Tseng Cheng-jen.</P>
      <P>Chang said that about one month ago, they tracked down what could be more than
US$90 million of Wang's assets in Europe, and creditor banks are now working to
collect debts via various channels.</P>
      <P>Chang would not divulge further details.</P>
      <P>Wang was exposed after the application for insolvency protection by China Rebar
and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co., -- two Rebar group subsidiaries --
caused a panicked run on the Chinese Bank -- yet another Rebar subsidiary -- in
early January. The bank's customers withdrew more than NT$33 billion (US$1
billion) from the bank, prompting a government takeover to allay public fears.</P>
      <P>The two companies became insolvent  after suffering losses totaling NT$25.2
billion over the past seven years.  However, according to initial estimates,
total losses to the national coffers and investors caused by the Wang family's
systematic hollowing out of the Rebar Group-owned subsidiaries could amount to
NT$300 billion -- about one-fourth of Taiwan's annual tax revenues.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Agriculture authorities promised Monday to propose a strategy within three days
to curb a continuing drop in cabbage prices.</P>
      <P>Secretary-general Hsu Han-chin of the Agriculture and Food Agency under the
Council of Agriculture (COA) voiced the promise in a meeting with over 30
emotional farmers from Changhua County, central Taiwan, at the COA building.</P>
      <P>The cabbage growers, led by Legislator Chen Chao-jung of the opposition
Kuomintang, petitioned for the COA for relief after cabbage prices slumped in
recent days.</P>
      <P>Chen indicated that the price for 30 kg of cabbage has dropped to between NT$300
and NT$500 from NT$1,100-NT$1,300 over a week ago in the county's Hsihu fruit
and vegetable wholesale market.</P>
      <P>The farmers have failed to earn any profit from their harvest, Chen pointed out,
blaming the price fall for a news report from Taichung City last week that said
a duck died suddenly after being fed cabbage leaves.</P>
      <P>The problematic cabbage reportedly came from the Hsihu market.</P>
      <P>In a news release last Friday, the COA said tests on samples from the
unfortunate duck have begun, noted it is a single case, and urged consumers to
refrain from speculating on the cause of the duck's death before the test
results are in.</P>
      <P>The news release reiterated that the council employs strict measures in
screening pesticide residues on agricultural products in local markets. Over 97
percent of 2,191 samples examined from farm fields and wholesale markets around
the country during the first 11 months of the year passed the residue tests, COA
said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that since the report of the duck's mysterious death, cabbage wholesale
prices have not fluctuated as usual.</P>
      <P>Hsu explained that the agency has been closely monitoring cabbage price
fluctuations since the wholesale price experienced a rise from NT$15 per kg in
July to NT$36.7 per kg in October due to the effects of typhoon damage, before
dropping to the current level of NT$19.5 per kg.</P>
      <P>It is expected that prices will drop further, to NT$8 per kg, by the end of
December due to an abundant harvest, the official said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the COA has activated the 95 percent price adjustment mechanism and is
set to purchase vegetables in abundance directly from growers for 95 percent of
their production cost in an effort to safeguard the farmers' basic economic
security.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has an estimated over 13 million Internet users this year, an all-time
high, according to the results of a recent government study to be published
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The annual study was conducted by the Cabinet-level Research, Development, and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC) among 15,007 people aged over 12 via telephone
interviews in August and September, an official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The RDEC began to conduct the study in 2001 in an effort to understand the
digital gap in Taiwan, the RDEC official said.</P>
      <P>The study shows that nearly half of the Internet users polled had made online
purchases, up 5 percent from last year, the official noted.</P>
      <P>Describing blogging as popular among Internet users, the official said 74
percent of the people interviewed browse other people's blogs.</P>
      <P>The official further said that 25.4 percent of the Internet users surveyed had
created their own blogs.</P>
      <P>In addition, 76.4 percent of the respondents use online communication software,

      <P>The study also shows that the government's efforts to bridge the digital divide
among local cities and countries have achieved results, the official said,
adding that the Internet penetration rate in the southern county of Yunlin and

      <P>A good-will mission from Japan donated 100 cherry seedlings to the National
Kinmen Institute of Technology Monday in a gesture to alleviate the trauma
inflicted by the Japanese military during the Second World War.</P>
      <P>The 28-member group, comprised of alumni of Chuo University in Tokyo, was led by
Nagata Shigeru, chairman of a pro-Taiwan friendship association.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony at the campus of National Kinmen Institute of Technology (NKIT),
Shigeru and NKIT President Lee Chin-cheng planted 10 cherries around a pond and
erected a stone monument inscribed with the Chinese characters: "Friendly
cherries."</P>
      <P>The donation was initiated by Chuo University alumni after they learned from Lee
during his visit to Japan in June that many residents of Kinmen were drafted to
serve the Japanese troops during the war years and never returned home.</P>
      <P>The Chuo alumni expressed the hope that the "friendly cherries" would obliterate
the trauma of the past and rebuild friendship between Japan and the outlying
island group.</P>
      <P>The 10 cherry seedlings planted at the ceremony Monday were from a donation
three years ago, because the 100 newly presented seedlings have to undergo a

      <P>This year's New Year firework show at the top of Taipei 101, one of the tallest
skyscrapers in the world, will last for 188 seconds, a spokesman for the Taipei
Financial Center Corp., which manages the building, said Monday.</P>
      <P>However, Horace Lin, president of the company, declined to reveal the wording
that will appear in the firework show, saying only that it will be neutral.</P>
      <P>The announcement came following a recent row between the central government and
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)-controlled Taipei city government over the
wording.</P>
      <P>The Tourism  Bureau  under the Cabinet-level  Ministry  of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) had planned to display the government slogan "U.N. for
Taiwan" in the fireworks show in an effort to raise the international profile of
the country's U.N. membership bid.</P>
      <P>However, the bureau's plan drew protests from the Taipei city government.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the wording, which will include Taiwan, will be acceptable to both
sides.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Taipei 101 will set off 12,000 fireworks this year -- 3,000
more than last year.</P>
      <P>Fireworks will also be set off over the skyscraper for the first time, Lin said,
adding that traffic controls in the area will be expanded this year.</P>
      <P>A concert to be held in the square in front of City Hall on New Year's Eve is
likely to break the 520,000 visits registered at last year's event, Lin went on.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion,  Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin encouraged the public
to attend the concert and urged them to attend a flag-raising ceremony and fun
run to be organized by the city government on New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hau said the city government mobilized nearly 400 people last year to
clean up the 21 metric tons of garbage left behind by thoughtless litterlouts
after the event.</P>
      <P>To address the problem, the city government will provide garbage cans this year,
Hau said, urging people not to litter.</P>
      <P>One day prior to the new year's eve concert, the city government will hold a
carnival featuring dance, military bands, and a flower float parade, according

      <P>Responding to a demand that two national elections slated for early next year
should not include referendums, Central Election Commission (CEC) Secretary-
General Teng Tien-you said Monday that it would be very difficult to change the
polling dates, which have been officially promulgated.</P>
      <P>Although doing so might help settle a voting method dispute between the central
and some local governments, Teng said it would now be "almost impossible" to ask
CEC members to hold a meeting and alter the polling dates.</P>
      <P>Teng made the comments in response to a call from a group of main oppostion
Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers, including Hung Hsiu-chu, Chiu Yi, Pan Wei-kang and
Wu Yu-sheng, earlier that day at a Legislative Yuan news conference.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT member, also issued a written
statement endorsing the KMT legislators' call for "peaceful elections."</P>
      <P>Wang and the KMT lawmakers contended that the Jan. 12 legislative elections and
the March 22 presidential election should not be held at the same time as the
referendums, to avoid what they claimed would be "procedural woes."</P>
      <P>According to Wang, in his 32-year political career, this is the first time he
has sensed "strong public worries" about whether the elections will be held on
time and smoothly. Speculation that the government might put off the elections
or impose martial law has sparked grave public concern at home and abroad, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Wang ascribed the uncertainties to the CEC's decision to combine the legislative
elections with two referendums and the presidential election with another two
referendums, and argued that the chaos would disappear if the elections were not
held along with the referendums.</P>
      <P>For her part, Hung said she "strongly feels" the public is deeply concerned
about whether the polls, in particular the March 22 presidential election, will
proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>Liu Kuang-hua, a CEC member recommended by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
told CNA that a Dec. 12 CEC meeting failed to hold vote on a proposal that he
submitted calling for a postponement of the referendums to be held alongside the
legislative polls.</P>
      <P>Liu said he was pleased to see Wang and KMT lawmakers share his standpoint and
said that only separating the polls would resolve the voting format dispute. He
also called for public support for his proposal.</P>
      <P>Although the CEC decided Nov. 16 to adopt a "one-step" voting format for the
approaching polls, 18 local governments controlled by the KMT have insisted on
applying a "two-step" scheme out of concern over "possible woes" arising from
the "one-step" voting method.</P>
      <P>Taking the legislative elections as example, under the "one-step" voting format,
voters will receive two legislative ballots and two referendum ballots from two
different desks before casting each of the ballots into four separate boxes.</P>
      <P>Under the "two-step" voting method, voters would receive two legislative ballots
and cast them into two different boxes in the first stage before proceeding to
the second step, in which voters would receive two referendum ballots and cast
them into two different boxes.</P>

respectively, approach.</P>
      <P>A media report last week about a CEC plan to iron out a contingency plan which
would permit the body to scrap or delay elections in case of "unavoidable or

CEC as a tool to pursue that aim.</P>

      <P>In defiance of the central government's decision that the CEC-designed "one-

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alishan forest railway is expected to reopen to passenger services Dec. 21
after four months of repair work to remove massive amounts of fallen rocks from
successive landslides during the typhoon season, local forestry officials said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Chiayi office of the Forestry Bureau under the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture said the No. 42 Tunnel of the railway, located 59
kilometers from Chiayi Station, was blocked by a landslide due to torrential
rain in July, and that although the railway was reopened briefly after a month-
long repair blitz, the line was again disrupted because of four typhoons and
tropical storms.</P>
      <P>The repair work was made more difficult by a magnitude six earthquake on July 23
in northern Taiwan, and another magnitude five tremor in southern Taiwan on July
29, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the end of the No. 42 Tunnel is now shielded by a
protective wall, which will guide any falling rocks away from the railway. The
Alishan railway is said to be one of the world's three remaining alpine
railways. The other two are located in the Himalayas of northern India, and
Andes of South America.</P>
      <P>Opened in 1912 while Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the narrow-gauge railway
was designed to haul timber down the mountain, but is now mainly used to
transport the more than 200,000 tourists who annually visit Alishan to take in
the area's beauty at an altitude of more than 2,200 meters in Taiwan's Central
Mountain Range.</P>
      <P>The scenic rail line winds its way up from the subtropical plains to mountainous
pine forests in just 72 kilometers, crossing more than 80 bridges and passing
through about 50 tunnels. Its route includes a series of dangerous switchbacks.</P>
      <P>Although the government has been operating the train at an annual loss of about
NT$110 million (US$3.35 million) , it has decided to preserve the line not only
for its historic value but as a means to boost local tourism.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lashed out at the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Monday for failing to match its words with deeds.</P>
      <P>The president noted that the KMT has made "a better economy and the well-being
of the public" the theme of its campaign for the upcoming legislative and
presidential elections, but he pointed out that the KMT has consistently blocked
the budgets for national development and public welfare bills at the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The KMT even stalled the review of the 2007 central government's budget for six
months, he added.</P>
      <P>He stated that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (KMT) aims at grabbing 50
seats in the Jan. 12 legislative elections, saying that based on the 40 percent
of votes received by the DPP in the past two legislative elections, this will
translate to 45 seats in the upcoming  elections,  which  will see the adoption
of a new "single-member constituency, two votes" electoral system and the number
of seats cut by half to 113.</P>
      <P>More efforts will result in an additional five seats, and the DPP could easily
emerge as the dominant force in the legislature. This, coupled with DPP
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh's winning the March 22 presidential election,
will help stabilize the political situation, the president said optimistically.</P>
      <P>He also said that KMT's resistance to the Central Election Commission's decision
to adopt a "one-step" voting format for the upcoming elections aims at blocking
the two DPP-initiated referendums from being held alongside the elections.</P>
      <P>The president said that the KMT is trying to block a referendum to return the
KMT's ill-gotten assets to national coffer alongside the legislative elections,
and a bid to join the U.N. under the name Taiwan in tandem with the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The president also said that the KMT will never change its ideology, which he
claims amounts to "one China, " and "eventual unification with China."</P>
      <P>In contrast, the DPP insists on "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait,"
the president said.</P>
      <P>He said that if China's agricultural products inundate Taiwan and Chinese
laborers come in droves to Taiwan, the situation of Taiwanese farmers and the
employment rights of the Taiwanese people will be affected.</P>
      <P>He concluded that if Taiwan is eventually swallowed up by China or Taiwan can
only rely on Chinese market, then it will "indeed be a serious situation."</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday that Taiwan has not banned
China's sand and gravel from coming to Taiwan, and that China can resume exports
at any time.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials made the remarks after China's Ministry of Commerce said earlier
the same day that it has started preparations for the resumption of sand and
gravel exports to Taiwan, expressing the hope that Taiwan's gravel association
would communicate with China to facilitate the exports.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) is in
charge the cross-strait issues and that the MAC has commissioned the semi-
official Taiwan External Trade Development Council to conduct talks with China
on the issue.</P>
      <P>Any groups that have not been authorized by the government to conduct such talks
will be in violation of the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People
of Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has not banned China's gravel, as long as China is willing to resume
exports, the gravel could come at any time.</P>
      <P>"This is purely business deal, " they said, and Taiwan welcomes developments
which will help diversify the sources of such imports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan previously relied heavily on China's gravel, but managed to meet its
needs by increasing domestic dredging and seeking exports from other countries
after China unilaterally stopped the exports earlier this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2008 election choice between Taiwan, China identities: DPP candidate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
12/17/07  23:55:10
(By Yang Ming-chu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's voters will make a choice in the 2008 presidential  election between a
"Taiwanese identity" and "Chinese identity, " the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) standard bearer in the race said in Tokyo Monday.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, who is currently on a four-day visit to Japan, made the remarks in
a speech delivered to Japanese politicians, scholars and business executives
interested in Taiwan's affairs as well as Taiwanese expatriates in Japan.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) originated in China and has never
forsaken its ultimate goal of pursuing eventual unification of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, Hsieh said the 2008 presidential election could be a choice
between a Taiwanese and Chinese orientation.</P>
      <P>Even though the KMT moved its seat to Taiwan 58 years ago, Hsieh said the party,
which ruled Taiwan for more than five decades until May 2000, still has its
Chinese title bear the word "Chungkuo" meaning "China."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he is convinced that if the Taiwan-rooted DPP manages to win the 2008
presidential election, the KMT will finally change it designation.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT has blocked the DPP's major policy initiatives at nearly
every turn since it lost power, Hsieh said the pall of a "democratic civil war"
has been shadowing Taiwan over the past seven years.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh said he is confident that if elected he will be able to put an
end to the current political chaos.</P>
      <P>He further said Taiwan's hope lies in a significant rise in the number of Taiwan
people who identify themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.</P>
      <P>A decade ago, he said, only 20 percent of Taiwane people perceived themselves as
Taiwanese, and the number rose to 30 percent seven years ago when the DPP just
came to power, but the number now surges to 70 percent.</P>
      <P>If China continues to block Taiwan's participation in major international
organizations and squeeze out its international presence, Hsieh said he believes
that Taiwan people's national identity and national consciousness will continue
to strengthen.</P>
      <P>He criticized his electoral rival, KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou for
failing to speak up against China's sovereignty claim over Taiwan while visiting
Japan earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Referring to Ma's statement during his earlier Tokyo visit that if elected, he
will neither promote unification, independence nor provoke any conflict across
the Taiwan Strait, Hsieh said it is rather strange for a presidential candidate
to shun defending his own country's sovereign status during an overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is already an independent sovereign state, Hsieh said if
Ma does not share such a stance, he should not run for Taiwan's presidency.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Hsieh also urged the international community to push China to
fulfill its international responsibilities now that its has become economically
prosperous.</P>
      <P>As to whether China's rise would pose a threat to Asian security and stability,
Hsieh said Chian's attitude and policy toward Taiwan could serve as a litmus to
such a test. "We could tell from its policy toward Taiwan whether China would
honor its promise of pursuing a peaceful rise," Hsieh added.</P>

without study is perilous. To give oneself up to the study of metaphysical
theories -- that is very injurious indeed. Shall I teach you what is
understanding? To know what it is that you know, and to know what it is that you
do not know -- that is understanding."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many fresh graduates in Taiwan responding to a recent survey give the impression
of being job-hoppers, with 48 percent having changed jobs at least once over the
past five months since leaving school.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey, which were released Monday, also revealed that 57.73
percent of the respondents are preparing to leave their current jobs after the
upcoming Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out Dec. 1-14 by the online employment service provider
1111 Job Bank among 2,037 workers or job-seekers who graduated from school this
past summer.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that 23.12 percent of respondents have not found a full-time
job since graduation, including 26.77 percent of senior high school graduates,
25.29 percent of college graduates, 25 percent of master's or doctoral degree
holders, and 22.24 percent of university graduates.</P>
      <P>Among those who have found employment, 23.63 percent have changed jobs once over
the past five months, 11.24 percent have done so twice, and 12.84 percent have
done so at least three times.</P>
      <P>On the reasons for quitting, 30.52 percent mentioned failure of the job to meet
their expectations, 26.64 percent mentioned a desire to find another job with
higher pay and better benefits, and 24.63 percent mentioned a lack of career
advancement prospects.</P>
      <P>While 18.71 percent of the successful job-seekers found their first job after
sending out three resumes on average, 17.04 percent only found a job after
sending out more than 30 resumes.</P>
      <P>A total of 19.41 percent of the successful job-seekers found a job even before
graduation, compared with 22.67 percent who only did so after searching for more
than three months.</P>
      <P>As to their financial resources before getting a full-time job, 34.95 percent
relied on the support of family or friends, 31.27 percent relied on their own
savings, and 14.38 percent made ends meets through part-time employment.</P>
      <P>Compared with 51.40 percent of successful job-seekers who found a job that
matches their field of study, 48.60 percent were hired for jobs unrelated to
their area of expertise.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that the starting salaries of successful job-seekers average
NT$17,960 (US$553) among junior high school graduates, NT$23,846 among senior
high school graduates, NT$20,024 among senior vocational school graduates,
NT$22,085 among college graduates, NT$23,200 among university graduates and
NT$34,186 among master's degree holders.</P>
      <P>The figures compare with the average expected salary of NT$19,640 among junior
high school graduates, NT$24,513 among senior high school graduates, NT$21,419
among senior vocational school graduates, NT$24,990  among college graduates,
NT$25,800 among university graduates and NT$36,973 among master's degree
holders.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey results showed that those who studiedin the fields of
medicine or health enjoy the highest average starting salary at NT$25,733,
followed  by those who studied science, engineering or information technology at
NT$24,683 and those who studied in the fields of law, political science,
sociology or psychology at NT$23,829.</P>
      <P>The lowest average starting salary was seen among those who studied mass
communication, education or physical education at NT$22,183, according to the
survey results.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Former DPP chairman urges KMT to amend Referendum Law or face boycott</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung urged the
public Tuesday not to support candidates of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
in the upcoming elections unless the party agrees to amend the Referendum Law.</P>
      <P>Lin and members of the Nuke-4 Referendum Initiative Association (Nuke-4 RIA)
distributed leaflets at the exits of an MRT station in downtown Taipei to
underscore their appeal.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the group has written several times to KMT Chairman Wu
Poh-hsiung and KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou expressing the hope of
being able to call on them to discuss the amendment of the Referendum Law,
neither of them has responded to any of the letters.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed the main focus of the group's campaign is to "call for the KMT to
amend the Referendum Law rather than to boycott the party in elections."</P>
      <P>If the KMT amends the Referendum Law before the Jan. 12 legislative elections
and the March 22 presidential election as proof that the party is sincere in
answering the calls for greater democracy, the association will end the boycott
immediately.</P>
      <P>Asked why his group has only been targeting the KMT, Lin said the DPP has
proposed an amendment to the Referendum Law that is largely the same as that
called for by the association to enable the Taiwan people to exercise their
right of referendum more easily.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the KMT has continued to block the amendment in the legislature's
procedure committee, so the party "should bear greater responsibility," he said.</P>
      <P>However, he lashed out at both the DPP and the KMT for formulating a Referendum
Law that has in practice stripped the people of their referendum right.</P>
      <P>He noted that 880,000 signatures are required for a referendum proposal to
become valid, meaning that only major parties are capable of initiating
referendum proposals.</P>
      <P>The two major parties have not focused on amending the "flawed" referendum and
have instead each initiated their own referendum proposals, which is like
"putting the cart before the horse," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the referendums to be held alongside the upcoming elections.
The DPP-initiated referendums are on returning the "ill-gotten" assets of the
KMT to the national coffers and on Taiwan's U.N. membership bid under the name
Taiwan, while the KMT-initiated referendums are on ending government corruption
and on the Republic of China applying to return to the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Asked if he will express  concerns  about President  Chen Shui-bian's recent
deeds and remarks that some alleged as improper, Lin said that a democracy's
ability to function normally depends on the people having the ability to monitor
the government, adding that the right to referendum strengthens this ability.</P>
      <P>"If there is a good referendum law, then it will at least check the politicians
in terms of policies or legal matters," he said.</P>
      <P>On whether he will stump for DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, Lin noted
that he withdrew from the party in January 2006 and that he hopes that he will
not have to stump for any political parties or candidates.</P>
      <P>Lin has devoted himself to the cause of a nuclear-free homeland in recent years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh said Tuesday in Tokyo that he hopes Taiwan will capitalize on its
"intelligent power" to become a "miracle maker" for world peace.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is currently on a four-day visit to Japan, made the remarks while
delivering a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as an independent country, Hsieh noted that Taiwan is seeking
to join the international community and hopes to win recognition from the world.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is currently walking on a path to dignity, and seeking dignity does not
mean being a troublemaker," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan can make a contribution to world peace, Hsieh stressed that
Taiwan created "economic " and "political" miracles in the past and that it can
become a "miracle maker" for world peace in the future.</P>
      <P>During his speech, Hsieh also explained that his philosophy on relations between
Taiwan and China is one of "co-existence and self-survival."</P>
      <P>He said that "co-existence" also means co-prosperity and interdependence,
describing himself as a "peace supporter."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh noted that a very important premise for "co-existence" is
"self-survival" -- with respect and protection.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the people of Taiwan, including himself, would be glad to see
China rise peacefully, adding that during the process, Taiwanese people and
businesses have made a massive contribution to China's economic growth.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that many people also worry about the possibility that the
rise of China could turn into a threat to peace.</P>
      <P>"How China treats Taiwan will be a litmus test on whether China's rise will be
peaceful or whether it will pose a major threat to peace in Asia," he said.</P>
      <P>If China does not respect Taiwan at all and deprives Taiwan's 23 million people
of their basic human rights, then cross-strait relations will inevitably become
strained, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He also said that if Beijing continues to use force to threaten Taiwan and does
not employ peaceful means to resolve cross-strait issues, then China will become
a threat in Asia.</P>
      <P>By then, Taiwan will not be the only victim, Hsieh said, noting that other
countries -- including Japan -- will also face the threat from China. For this
reason, he called on the international community to attach greater importance to
Taiwan in looking at cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsieh said that in recent days, the world has been closely watching
developments concerning the upcoming presidential election in South Korea
because its result will have an impact on the future development of Asia.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said he hopes that the world can also focus its attention on
Taiwan's presidential election slated for March 22 as a strong Taiwan will be
conducive to peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region and the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP rebuts accusation of election tricks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
denied Tuesday an accusation that the party would use bird flu as a pretext to
prevent China-based Taiwan businessmen from coming home to vote in two key
elections slated for early nest year.</P>
      <P>Wang Tuoh made the statement at a Legislative  Yuan news conference in response
to an earlier question from main Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Ting Shou-chung as
to whether the DPP would resort to dirty tricks, such as using an epidemic
outbreak, as a pretext for banning cross-Taiwan Strait travel and exchanges,
thereby preventing many Taiwan business people from returning and voting in the
polls, in particular the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang accused the KMT of entertaining "wild fantasies" and described Ting's
allegation as a reflection of the party's mindset of its past martial rule. The
so-called "dirty tricks" cited by the KMT are nothing more than a product of its
imagination, he blasted.</P>
      <P>In contrast, some of 20 kinds of "dirty tricks " applied by the KMT to rig
elections over the years, have actually been ruled unlawful by courts and the
persons involved in these cases convicted, he pointed out, adding that vote-
buying is the trick most often used by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Currently, more than one million Taiwan business people and family members are
based in China, and it is estimated that more than half of them are KMT
supporters, according to a news report by the Taipei-based English-language
China Post.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Central Election Commission (CEC) is set to announce, by the Jan.
12 legislative polls, a contingency draft providing clear definitions of what it
terms "natural catastrophes" and "unavoidable or irresistible situations" which
could lead to a halt or suspension of the coming elections.</P>
      <P>That news has sparked grave concern within the KMT that the DPP would use the
CEC as a weapon to block the smooth holding of the legislative and presidential
elections as public opinion survey results show that the DPP is lagging well
behind the KMT in the two approaching elections.</P>
      <P>It was reported that some KMT members are worried that a "two-step" voting
method to be adopted by 18 KMT-controlled cities and counties in the coming two
elections would be annulled by the CEC.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian again thanked the U.S.  government Tuesday for
approving the sale of eight diesel-electric submarines to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing a celebration held at the Tsoying naval
base in the southern port city of Kaohsiung to mark 20 years of service by two
improved Zwaardvis-class submarines.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the two Dutch-made submarines were delivered to Taiwan in 1987
and 1988, respectively, and commissioned at the Tsoying naval base.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan was only able to acquire the vessels after numerous, almost
unbelievable hardships, including a financial crisis facing the Dutch
shipbuilder that drove it to the brink of bankruptcy and almost forced it to
close down its production line, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>At the same time, China was using every possible means to obstruct the arms
procurement plan, threatening to downgrade its diplomatic relations with the
Netherlands to pressure the European country to cancel the sale, Chen continued.</P>
      <P>Chen said this episode demonstrates that "many things cannot be bought with
money" and that strong  combat weapons,  such as submarines, are especially
difficult for Taiwan to obtain.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's survival and development depending heavily on foreign trade and
shipping, the country must establish a reliable naval force to protect regional
stability, Taiwan's economy and trade, he said.</P>

      <P>Marine biologists have discovered several natural antimicrobial substances in a
coral species endemic to Taiwan and expect to apply them to various medical
treatments, sources at the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium
(NMMBA) in Fengkang, Pingtung County said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The project, the result of collaboration between the museum and two
universities, spotted six sesquiterpenoid chemical compounds, dubbed
rumphellolides A to F, in the coral species Rumphella antipathies, according to
Sung Ping-jyun, the project leader and an associate research fellow at the
museum.</P>
      <P>Sung noted that every coral species is capable of producing 20 to 30 natural
chemical compounds, and that there is a long-standing research question
concerning how the possible applications of each substance might be identified.</P>
      <P>Currently, Sung explained, the six newly-found materials are known to have
antimicrobial effects, which can be helpful in terms of disease and cancer
treatment, anti-inflammation and pain-killing drug development, the containment
of bacteria and viruses, or production of cosmetics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sung said, conventional extraction methods have an excessively
negative impact on the ecology of coral habitats and are unable to exclude other
disrupting factors in the symbiotic relations between coral, algae, and other
species.</P>
      <P>To overcome these shortcomings, Sung said, "we have spent years improving the
extraction process, as well as establishing the only mass production coral
cultivation farm in the world to facilitate future research and compound

    <TEXT>
      <P>The secretary-general of the Ministry of Education (MOE) filed a lawsuit Tuesday
at the Taipei District Court against the Taipei-headquartered China Youth Corps
(CYC) , claiming that a portion of the CYC-operated Chientan Overseas Youth
Activity Center's property rightfully belongs to the country.</P>
      <P>Chuang  Kuo-jung  told media reporters  that the CYC,  an organization
associated with the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , had obtained an enormous
amount of national resources during the period of KMT rule.</P>
      <P>He blasted the financial injection from the state's coffers during the KMT
regime as a move "corrosive to the economic order of a normal country."</P>
      <P>Chuang indicated that the MOE helped in the construction of the Chientan center,
the largest of all 14 CYC-owned activity centers around the country, with
subsidies amounting to NT$168 million during the 1988-1990 period.</P>
      <P>Given those subsidies, the MOE should have owned 35.3 percent of the center's
buildings. However, Chuang pointed out that over the past two decades the CYC
has never acted to transfer any part of the buildings to the MOE.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the MOE official said the ministry had offered the CYC subsidies
totaling more than NT$780 million since 1957, which, calculated on current
values, would be worth in excess of NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Chang complained that no civil groups in Taiwan, except the CYC, could obtain
such a large amount of money from the government's coffers and that no other
political party, anywhere, "could control such a vast property holdings as the
KMT."</P>
      <P>According to the MOE, it brought the civil lawsuit to lay claim to the Chientan
center buildings and NT$30 million from the CYC.</P>
      <P>If the CYC is not willing to handover one-third of the ownership of the Chientan
activity center, the MOE claimed that the CYC should pay the country NT$411.15
million.</P>
      <P>In response to the MOE complaint, CYC Secretary-General Wang Fu-sheng said it is
difficult for the CYC, a civic organization providing recreation,  education and
social-welfare services to domestic and overseas Taiwanese youths, to segment
the Chientan center's property right, but the CYC will want to return the NT$168
million the MOE offered for the center's construction as a subsidy.</P>
      <P>He has no idea how the MOE came up with the figure of NT$411.15 million in its
property right claim, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Underlining that the CYC is not a political organization, Wang stated that after
the issue has been brought to the court, the CYC will have its lawyers to
clarify its position on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Chientan Overseas Youth Activity Center, situated on the west bank of the
Keelung River, occupies an area of 50,000 square meters. The center owns
accommodation facilities for up to 1,000 people, an auditorium, a conference
room, a banquet room, a lecture auditorium and 40 other meeting rooms.</P>
      <P>The CYC, formerly called the "China Youth National Anti-Communist National
Salvation Corps,  " was established  in 1952 on the recommendation  of then-
president  Chiang Kai-Shek as a quasi- governmental, quasi-political
organization with close ties to the KMT regime.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 28, 1989, the CYC became a non-governmental organization, officially
severing its ties with the KMT regime. It dropped "Anti-Communist" from its
official name officially Oct. 25, 2000.</P>

      <P>Renowned French stage director Ariane Mnouchkine and her 60-member troupe,
Theater du Soleil, will give six performances of the marathon show Les Ephemeres
(The Ephemerals) in Taipei between Dec. 22 and 29.</P>
      <P>The six-and-a-half-hour show was first presented in the 2006 Avignon Art
Festival of France and the Taipei performances will be the show's Asian
premiere.</P>
      <P>The show will be presented in French with Chinese subtitles on a revolving stage
under a huge canopy with 600 seats. The canopy, brought in from France, is being
set up in the plaza between the National Theater and the National Concert Hall.</P>
      <P>Les Ephemeres, described by critics as an elegy to the ephemeral quality of
human existence, has two parts, each lasting 3 hours and 15 minutes. The two
parts will be presented together Dec. 22-23 and Dec. 29. The first part will
also be performed Dec. 26-27, while the second part will be staged Dec. 28.</P>
      <P>The show consists of 50 personal stories that work like small threads woven
together into a fabric of love, friendship, conflict and farewells in communal
life.</P>
      <P>Theatre du Soleil was founded by Mnouchkine in 1964. Her productions are often
not confined to a typical stage. When audiences enter a Mnouchkine production,
they can often see the actors putting on makeup or getting into their costumes.
The actors improvise as stage set movers and even share snacks with the
audiences during intermissions, making the audience and performer relationship
tighter and more direct.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP candidate values identity, security over economy</HEADLINE>

(By Yang Ming-chu and T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) believes that national
identity and security issues are more important than economic issues, DPP
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>While delivering a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, Hsieh,
who is on a four-day visit to Tokyo, explained that the lack of national
security and sovereignty will mean no freedom for the people, rendering other
issues "meaningless."</P>
      <P>Noting that it is wrong to think that Taiwan only has economic problems, like
Hong Kong, Hsieh said that Taiwan has its own president, legislature, currency,
and judicial system, making the island a de facto independent state.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsieh said that Taiwan's national security faces a threat from
China, who has deployed over 1,000 missiles targeting Taiwan, as well as
launching legal, psychological, and electronic warfare against the island.</P>
      <P>Hsieh continued that China has been attempting to isolate Taiwan from the world
and deprive the country of its right to participate in the international
community, including the World Health Organization (WHO) , which is a serious
concern in safeguarding the health of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>China's efforts to block Taiwan internationally have harmed Taiwan's national
identity, he went on, noting that Taiwan is nonetheless seeking to become a
member of international organizations to strengthen its national identity.</P>
      <P>Rebutting  claims that Taiwan's international  efforts have resulted in cross-
strait tensions and turned the nation into a "trouble maker", Hsieh said that in
face of the missile threat from China, the people of Taiwan need to protect
themselves by joining world organizations.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on his strategies to safeguard Taiwan's security, Hsieh noted that
first of all, he supports purchasing defensive weapons and vows to raise the
country's defense budget to over three percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>He also said that he supports the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which he noted is
of great benefit to the peace and stability in Asia.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Hsieh said that Taiwan needs to be recognized by the international
community and needs endorsements from more countries in order to further common
interests and security issues.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States differed on several issues in recent years, but
Hsieh said that if he is elected next year, he will strive to rebuild trust
between both sides.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he also hopes to establish a framework for peace and stability with
China and to create a mutually beneficial situation.</P>
      <P>If elected, he also hopes to collaborate with the Japanese government in a
number of fields, including defense, culture, economics,  non-governmental
organizations,  and  environmental protection, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, Hsieh said that he will further enhance the Taiwanese identity if he
wins the 2008 election.</P>
      <P>If the people of Taiwan do not regard Taiwan as an independent, sovereign
country, the country will not enjoy any significant degree of national security,
he went on.</P>
      <P>Since the DPP took power in 2000, the percentage of people in Taiwan who
consider themselves to be "Taiwanese"  rather than "Chinese" grew from 30
percent to 70 percent, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the country's bid to enter the United Nations under the name Taiwan
this year, Hsieh said that the U.N. membership bid is expressive of a common
aspiration of the Taiwanese people, and that the U.N. bid can also effectively
enhance their Taiwanese identity.</P>
      <P>Explaining that Taiwan's U.N. bid is not the cause of tensions in Asia, Hsieh
attributed the real cause to the fact that the world does not accept Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The international community's failure to recognize Taiwan gives the People's
Republic of China (PRC) an opportunity to claim that Taiwan is a part of China,
which Hsieh stressed is the real reason behind tensions in Asia.</P>

      <P>A man is being held incommunicado for attempting to smuggle protected fowl into
Taiwan, Taipei Customs officials reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>This is the first time a passenger has been held incommunicado for bringing
animals into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Customs officials said the man, surnamed Yang, was found to have hidden 13 live
fowl and 831 live beetles in his carry-on luggage when he arrived at the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport from Surabaya, Indonesia Sunday.</P>
      <P>The fowl and beetles were handed over to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine's Hsinchu office while the passenger was turned over
to the Taoyuan Prosecutors Office by aviation police.</P>
      <P>Customs officials said four of the 13 birds were determined to be cicinnurus
regius, a small (approximately 16 cm long), passerine bird of the Paradisaeidae
family, which is listed as a protected animal.</P>
      <P>Under the Wildlife Conservation Act, the passenger is liable to a prison term of
between six months and five years, and/or a fine of between NT$300,000
(US$9,260) and NT$1.5 million (US$9,260-US$46, 300).</P>
      <P>Although nine other live birds were not protected, the passenger violated the
Statute for Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Disease by bringing them
and 831 live beetles of various types in from an area at risk for high
pathogenic avian influenza virus.</P>
      <P>Violations of the statute will be subject to up to seven years of imprisonment
and/or a fine of up to NT$3 million.</P>
      <P>Customs officials again called for the public to refrain from importing live
animals from areas at risk of high pathogenic avian flu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that all local governments must adopt a
"one-step" voting format designed by the Central Election Commission (CEC) for
the legislative and presidential elections early next year and that the "two-
step" method proposed by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will be invalid.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments while touring Hsing Kuo University in the southern Taiwan
city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>Chen vowed that there will not be two different voting methods in the
legislative and presidential elections, slated for Jan. 12 and March 22,
respectively, and called for widespread public support for the CEC decision to
apply the "one-step" voting method.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung reiterated earlier the same day at an emergency
Legislative Yuan news conference that the validity of the two elections, if
conducted in a "two-step" voting format by some local governments, will be
determined by the CEC within one week of the election.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks to clarify comments made a day earlier by CEC  Secretary-
General  Teng  Tien-you  during  a  legislative intepellation session that
elections to be conducted via a "two-step" voting method by 18 KMT-controlled
cities and counties in the polls "would be valid" despite the CEC's decision to
adopt a "one-step" format.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Teng's Monday remarks at the Legislative Yuan are merely his
personal views and his words do not represent the CEC's stance. Chang blamed
Teng for "making improper statements at the national parliament."</P>
      <P>Chang categorically repeated that there will be no voting format other than the
CEC-designed  "one-step" method for the polls, asserting that the winners and
legality of the elections -- if held in the "two-step" voting format in some
localities -- must be determined jointly by CEC members within a week of the
poll.</P>
      <P>"Only results confirmed by the CEC are valid, " he emphasized, adding that
electoral operations conducted by local election units in defiance of the CEC's
decisions and regulations will be illegal and local unit chiefs and their
delegates prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey also attended the news conference and
warned that the central government will not tolerate any lawbreaking by local
authorities that would invite "catastrophic chaos."</P>
      <P>The central government will do whatever necessary to deal with all possible
senarios in advance, he stressed.</P>
      <P>However, Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin told reporters following a municipal
council meeting later the same day that the city's election commission has
decided to apply a "two-step" voting method for the legislative and presidential
elections -- each accompanied by two referendums -- to avoid chaos in the voting
process.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Chia-chi, deputy mayor of Taichung City in central Taiwan who also serves
as head of the city's election commission, said that the city will hold the two
elections in line with the "two-step" voting format based on a set of voting
rules promulgated in 2004 by the CEC for polling stations.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside concerns that doing so will be illegal, Hsiao argued that the
local governments are entitled to organize polling stations under the law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hakkas the most digitalized ethnic group: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A nationwide survey has found that Hakkas are the most digitalized ethnic group
and that the "digital divide" phenomenon has been more of a generation issue
rather than an urban-rural issue in recent years, an academic said Tuesday in a
press conference.</P>
      <P>The annual survey,  which was conducted  by the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC), found that 72.1 percent of Hakkas used personal
computers while 70.5 percent of Hoklos and 67.2 percent of indigenous peoples
did so.</P>
      <P>The Hakkas also had the highest percentage of Internet users -- 66.5 percent,
compared to Hoklos' 64.9 percent and 60.9 percent of the indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>Hakkas' advanced digitalization may shocked a lot of people, but it's not
surprising from the perspective of social studies, said Wu Chyi-in,  a research
fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of Sociology.</P>
      <P>"According to our long-term statistics, the Hakkas have had the highest level of
education among all ethnic groups in Taiwan. Being a minority group with limited
resources, most Hakkas have tried to realize social mobility and better lives
through obtaining higher levels of education," Wu said this social context might
be one of the hidden reasons for the group's advanced digitalization.</P>
      <P>"Some fellow researchers described the Hakkas as 'the Jews in Taiwan's society',
" Wu added.</P>
      <P>In addition to that interesting finding, the academic also said that the results
of this survey showed that the main issue in the "digital divide" has shifted
from infrastructure to differing ways of life between the generations.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, Internet use rates in all age groups under 30 surpassed
94.4 percent, but the rates decrease dramatically in groups over 31 years of
age. The same phenomena could also be found in the percentages of those writing
personal blogs, regularly making online comments  and participating  in
discussions  and knowledge-sharing online.</P>
      <P>"It looks like 30 is the watershed age of this 'digital divide 2.0' phenomenon,
" said Vandy Liu, a professor at Chung Yuan Christian University's  Department
of Management of Information Systems.</P>
      <P>Liu said that Taiwan has been successful in recent years in developing its
information technology infrastructure, which was why the broadband Internet
penetration rate was not an issue in most regions; rather the Taiwanese
government should pay more attention in developing a "society of Internet
citizens."</P>
      <P>"That means encouraging Internet users of all ages, especially those who above
age 30, to live a 'Web 2.0 life' by sharing their experiences, communicating,
challenging authorities and injustice online, because this is how society works
nowadays, " he said.</P>
      <P>"The question for Taiwan's government is: what's next after laying down the
infrastructure? " Wu said.</P>

Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is the tenth year that the government has offered second-hand or recycled
computers to students living in remote areas, donating more than 10,000 to
economically less privileged students during that period.</P>
      <P>At the computer-donation ceremony, Hsiao Tai-chi, president of Chung-Hua

conduct the computer recycling project, noted that for those citizens or groups
not capable of buying new computers, the second-hand ones are the best way to
march into the e-era.</P>
      <P>Hsiao hailed the recycling of second-hand  computers as a combination of
environmental protection, charity and science, with an aim of arousing awareness
of recycling and maintaining the country's sustainable development.</P>

      <P>Several local civic groups called for amendments to the Election and Recall Law
and Criminal Law so that those who buy and sell votes will be subject to more
severe punishments.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Society, Taiwan Society North, Taiwan Society South and other groups
called a news conference to highlight their campaign to ensure that there be "no
condoning of bribery."</P>
      <P>Taiwan Society South President Cheng Cheng-yu said the influence of bribery in
Taiwan is far-reaching. Noting that the court has in the past been lenient in
punishing such violations, he said an amendment to the Election and Recall Law
will address that deficiency.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the groups hope to raise the penalty for vote-buying from the current
prison term of between three and 10 years to at least five years.</P>
      <P>Punishment for those who receive bribes should also be increased to between one

President Chen Shui-bian, who doubles as the chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and KMT presidential

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) should enhance local junior high school
students' awareness of drug abuse and increase its efforts to protect students
from narcotics, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Liao Pen-
yen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao made the remarks after a Dec. 17 report of the Taipei-based, Chinese-
language China Times published the results of a survey stating that 6.1 percent
of the local 13th graders interviewed have used drugs.</P>
      <P>Based on that percentage, Liao inferred at a news conference that more than
18,000 young students could have used drugs.</P>
      <P>Questioning why the MOE does not attach greater importance to drug hazards, Liao
said that the education ministry has only allocated NT$27 million (US$831,536)
to anti-drug education in 2008.</P>
      <P>That budget is not enough to train specialized teachers who can provide
counseling to students concerning drug abuse, Liao went on.</P>
      <P>In response to the lawmaker's questions, Lin Hsiao-yin, a MOE official, said
that the ministry is very surprised by the results of the survey conducted by
the Champions Education Association, R.O.C.</P>
      <P>Lin said that another survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) did not find such a high number of drug use among local junior high school
students and noted that the association's survey dealt with students who have
received counseling for misconduct, which may have resulted in the survey
arriving at an higher than warranted percentage.</P>
      <P>In an effort to strengthen anti-drug education at local schools, the education
ministry will earmark an additional NT$10 million for next year, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the ministry plans to require primary and junior school students to
attend courses on the prevention of drug abuse within the next three to five
years, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>The ministry has also begun designing teaching materials to raise students'
awareness of drug abuse and will train "seed teachers" to combat narcotics abuse

      <P>Internet users in Taiwan surf an average of 2.7 hours a day, according to the
results of a 2007 survey on the digital divide, released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
under the Executive Yuan between Aug. 1 and Sept. 17 in Taiwan, drawing on
15,007 people above the age of 12. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 0.8
percent.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, the number of people in Taiwan habitually using the
Internet rose to 13 million this year, an increase of 400,000 people over the
previous year.</P>
      <P>The 2007 survey also found that 5.6 million households around the country are
online.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu City, northern Taiwan, has the largest percentage of households online,
at 75.5 percent, followed by Taichung City at 73.3 percent, and Taipei City at
71.6 percent, according to the poll, which also pointed out that cities and
counties where the online population grew by over 3 percent this year include
Keelung City, Yulin County, Hsinchu County, Miaoli County, Taitung County,
Tainan City and Taichung County.</P>

and 20 have their own blogs, while more than 30 percent of Internet users aged
between 21 and 30 have personal blogs; less than 15 percent of the Internet
users over 30 are used to posting their thoughts and feelings online.</P>
      <P>On cyber-shopping, the survey found that nearly 70 percent of Internet surfers
under 30 years old shop online, and that one in four Internet users between the
ages of 21 and 30 have sold goods online.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that 78.4 percent of Internet users said they are concerned
about having their personal data exposed on the Internet, 77.6 percent said they

      <P>All Taiwanese agricultural products will be traceable by 2015, the Council of
Agriculture (COA) announced Tuesday at the launch of the first nationwide
agricultural traceability system.</P>
      <P>Certified  traceability  agricultural  products  will  carry certification
insignia for quick identification to guarantee the origin of products, COA
Minister Su Chia-chuan said, adding that 2008 will be "Safe Agriculture Year."</P>
      <P>More than 172 farmers have been granted Traceability Agriculture Product (TAP)
certification from the Cabinet-level COA, which has entrusted 17 certifying
institutes around the nation as independent certifying systems.</P>
      <P>Food safety has been one of the hottest issues in the past year in Taiwan, as
many food safety cases regarding domestic and imported products have been
reported.</P>
      <P>"The day of pushing for mass production is over. Modern-day farmers and
consumers will and should pay attention to safety, quality and quantity -- in
that order -- of agricultural products, " Su said.</P>
      <P>The certification system consists of three criteria -- TAP, Organic Traceability
Agricultural Product and Quality Traceability Agricultural Product -- and will
integrate all certifying criteria used in the market by 2010, he said.</P>
      <P>Consumers can visit the Taiwan Agricultural Food Traceability System at
taft.coa.gov.tw to inquire about related information and in the future will also
be able to access  the information  in supermarkets and on their mobile phones,

    <HEADLINE>pesticide in cabbage might have killed duckling: health officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Dec. 18 (CNA)
12/18/07  21:40:06
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Health officials from the Taichung city government said Tuesday that a duckling
that died a week ago after its owner fed it cabbage probably died of poisoning
by pesticide residue on the outer leaves of the vegetable.</P>
      <P>The officials of the Public Health Bureau confirmed that they conducted tests on
cabbage leaves submitted by the owner of the duck farm and detected five
different  kinds of pesticide residue, including 0.79 parts per million (ppm) of
Carbofuran, exceeding the allowed limit of 0.5 ppm.</P>
      <P>The cabbage leaves also had 0.05 ppm of Acetamiprid, 0.04 ppm of Indoxacarb and
0.04 ppm of Dimethomorph. Taiwan has a zero tolerance policy for these three
pesticides in vegetables.</P>
      <P>The officials explained that if the cabbage leaves are not washed with water,
the pesticide residues could be fatal to a small duck.</P>
      <P>They suggested that for human consumption, consumers should peel off the outer
leaves and wash the cabbage with water thoroughly. This, they said, will remove
at least 90 percent of any pesticide residue.</P>
      <P>The officials also pointed out that under the Food Sanitation and Management
Act, those responsible for allowing vegetables with pesticide residues exceeding
allowed limits onto the market will be subject to fines of between NT$40,000 and
NT$200,000, while vendors who refuse to disclose the origin of such vegetables
are liable to fines of between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>Cabbage farmers in central Taiwan staged an angry protest a day earlier after
prices of the vegetable plunged to less than NT$6 per kilogram  as a result  of
news reports  about  the suspected pesticide-caused death of the duckling. They
urged the government to take immediate action to help them stabilize prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Democracy Party should learn from Taiwan: activist</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
12/18/07  21:44:27
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese democracy activist Xu Wenli said Tuesday that the China Democracy Party
(CDP) he founded should learn from Taiwan's ploitical parties which gain the
power from the ballot box in order to end the totalitarian government of
Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Xu, heading a five-member delegation of exiled Chinese democracy activists,
arrived in Taiwan Dec. 10 to observe Taiwan's upcoming elections with the aim of
better understanding Taiwan's democratic politics and electoral culture.</P>
      <P>Xu claimed in an interview with the CNA that the process of Taiwan's
democratization is similar to that of China, as Taiwan went from one-party rule
to democracy, adding that Taiwan's successful experience will be the best
reference for China to move forward to democracy in the future.</P>
      <P>Noting that the maturity of a democracy hinges on the degree of its rule of law,
Xu claimed that none of Taiwan's political parties or groups -- even the anti-
corruption protests that occurred last year -- have ever crossed the line, which
he said reflects the maturity of Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>Xu said the people of Taiwan enjoy freedom of speech and noted that even the
president can be criticized, a freedom that the Chinese people lack.</P>
      <P>He noted that during China's Cultural Revolution, launched by then-CPC leader
Mao Zedong in the 1960s, everybody was involved in politics, including children.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, adults who are not interested in politics can live their lives
without having to become involved in politics, Xu went on.</P>
      <P>Xu, who was sentenced to more than 10 years in prison by the Chinese government,
founded the CDP in 1998 with the goal of fighting for fairness and freedom for
the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>As the CDP also advocates fair popular elections in China, its establishment has
not been approved by the Chinese authorities. In addition, many of its members
have been persecuted by the government after being accused of sabotage. The
CDP's headquarters is now located in exile in the United States.</P>
      <P>Xu said that although China's current opening policy focuses on the economic
sphere, this economic freedom has made the Chinese people long for political
freedom.</P>
      <P>Although the Chinese authorities claim to be democracy-minded, Mao's ideology
has profoundly affected their behavior, Xu added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese President Hu Jintao's efforts to safeguarding one-party rule
have been very strong, Xu said it is unlikely that China's leaders will take the
initiative in reforms.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that if the Chinese leadership continues its authoritarian
rule, the regime will collapse just as the former Soviet Union collapsed.</P>
      <P>Xu said now is the best time to develop China's democracy and expressed that
Taiwan's experience in developing democracy can serve as a reference for China.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Chinese authorities to allow the existence of opposition
parties and to conduct free elections.</P>
      <P>The delegation will visit the campaign offices of various candidates running in
the upcoming legislative and presidential elections early next year.</P>

      <P>The Nantou Flower Festival, a major annual event for Nantou County in central
Taiwan, will begin Dec. 22, showcasing beautiful flower arrangements alongside a
variety of activities for visitors, Nantou Magistrate Lee Chao-ching said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said the activities will include liquor tastings, cookery featuring flowers,

      <P>He said the county government has invited farmers in seven townships, private
corporations, communities, the tourist industry and temples to take part in this
year's exhibits.</P>
      <P>These efforts have led to the show including large-scale flower fields, as well
as spectacular flower gardens at various theme parks around the county.</P>
      <P>Visitors can see various flowers in the county's townships, including cherry
blossoms in Yuchih township, tulips in Shanlin township and plum blossoms in
Hsinyi township, as well as farms of roses, sunflowers and cosmos.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Canadian musician Matthew Lien and local dance group Utheatre

      <P>A group from China's Zhejiang Provincial Department of Culture will also present
a traditional Chinese drama at the Chung Tai Chan Monastery in Nantou City Jan.

    <HEADLINE>DPP candidate confident of landslide in presidential election</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Dec. 18 (CNA)
12/18/07  22:44:35
(By Mike Chang, Yang Ming-chu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh said here Tuesday that he is confident of a landslide victory in the March
22 election, expressing the hope that he will beat his rival, Ma Ying-jeou of
the Kuomintang (KMT), by 250,000 votes.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is in Japan for a four-day visit, made the remarks at a news
conference after delivering a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of
Japan in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>On the Jan. 12 legislative elections, he said the DPP estimates it can capture
50 seats in the streamlined 113-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>On the widening gap between Taiwan's rich and poor, Hsieh said the KMT
encourages manufacturers to invest in China and claimed that this leads to
rising unemployment, while his policy is to support small- and medium-sized
enterprises, claiming that this means factories will not have to make an exodus
overseas too soon.</P>
      <P>He also said that both he and President Chen Shui-bian advocate Taiwan's
independent sovereignty but that he differs from Chen on economic issues such as
relaxing restrictions on locals investing in China.</P>
      <P>Addressing the concerns related to constitutional re-engineering, he said that
according to the Constitution, constitutional amendments require the consent of
three-quarters of the legislators. As the DPP is aiming at 50 seats in the
legislature, constitutional amendment will be beyond the means of the DPP and
therefore there should be no concern about resultant cross-Taiwan Strait
tensions.</P>
      <P>He claimed that although China insists on its "one China" principle, if he is
elected, China will "have to" respect the will of the Taiwan people, who will
never accept the terms of "one China."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that China will face a litany of challenges in the coming 20
years, such as the issues of environmental protection, the widening wealth gap
and other social and economic woes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan went through all these problems and maybe it can be of assistance. It is
not good for China to isolate Taiwan, Hsieh said, expressing the hope that China
will treat minor countries peacefully in keeping with its "international
responsibility."</P>
      <P>He also criticized Ma for not speaking up for Taiwan during a visit he made to
Japan last month and his description of the DPP as a "troublemaker," which he
described as "not fair." Hsieh described his party as "a creator of a cultural
and peace miracle."</P>
      <P>Hsieh later called on Takeo Hiranuma, president of the Alliance for Japan-ROC
Friendship, and 21 members of the alliance,  a pro-Taiwan group of congressmen
and senators.</P>
      <P>Hiranuma wished Hsieh victory in the election. Former Defense Minister and now
congresswoman Yuriko Koike was also on hand to greet Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if he is elected president, he is sure that the DPP will become
the dominant force in the legislature, because if the KMT loses, the party will
splinter into Chinese Nationalist Party and the Taiwanese Nationalist Party, and
Chinese influence will gradually fade from Taiwan politics, leading to the
nation moving toward the path of normalization.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the ratio of those who identify themselves as Taiwanese rather than
Chinese was 30 percent in 2000 when President Chen Shui-bian won his first
election with 39.5 percent of the votes.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the ratio of those of those who identify themselves as Taiwanese rose
to 46 percent, and Chen was re-elected with 50.1 percent of the votes.</P>
      <P>Although recent public opinion polls on the issue vary, with the figures
standing at around 70 percent or at least over 62 percent, Hsieh said he is
confident of an overwhelming victory in the election.</P>
      <P>Senator Yasuhiro Oe noted that Ma said during his visit that he knows Japan, but
Oe said Japan needs a pro-Japan president for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma is generally considered to hold a tough stance on such issues as conflicting
fishery rights and Japanese claims on the controversial Tiaoyutais Islands,
known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh then called on former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori to exchange
views on the cross-strait situation.</P>

12/18/07  23:32:36

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is continuing communications with the United States in the hope that it
will not follow China's rhetoric in thinking Taiwan's planned referendum on its
U.N. bid is a step toward de jure Taiwan independence, the acting spokeswoman of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Phoebe  Yeh said  that  after  months  of discussion  and communications, both
sides have realized that there is indeed a gap in understanding.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is acutely aware of the U.S. concerns, and the United States knows
perfectly Taiwan's stance, " Yeh said, adding that Taiwan has repeatedly
expressed the hope that the United States will not follow China's rhetoric in
seeing the U.N. bid is a step toward changing the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait or seeking de jure Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the ministry regrets the differences between the two countries over the
referendum.</P>
      <P>A close look at remarks by U.S. officials -- from Deputy Secretary of State John
Negroponte and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Thomas Christensen to American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond
Burghardt -- shows that the U.S. stance is consistent.</P>
      <P>However, she said, Taiwan has repeatedly explained to the United States that a
deepening democracy will help peace and stability in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Yeh also said that Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang will arrive in New
York Tuesday and will exchange views on issues of mutual concern with the
National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to the resolution of conflicts that threaten U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>Yeh admitted that Huang will meet members of the think tank rather than U.S.
officials, but she said he "should be able to meet the people he wants to meet."
She did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Yeh claimed that if the planned referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid passes a vote
held alongside the March 22 presidential election, it will give a "positive
message to the international community that Taiwan people are keen on joining
the world body."</P>
      <P>However, if the referendum fails, then it can be attributed to a lot of factors,
including that the threshold for the referendum is too high, as well as a
controversial voting format.</P>
      <P>But whether the referendum passes or not, more than 2 million people have signed
their names to endorse the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-initiated
referendum, which Yeh described as " significant in its own way."</P>
      <P>She added that whoever takes the helm of the nation after the March 22
presidential election, he will still have to address the issue of Taiwan's
maneuvering space.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible not to think about soliciting the maneuvering space of Taiwan
internationally, Yeh said, adding that this is why the nation needs to forge a
consensus by holding the referendum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP candidate confident of landslide in presidential election</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Dec. 18 (CNA)
12/19/07  10:58:11
(By Mike Chang, Yang Ming-chu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh said here Tuesday that he is confident of a landslide victory in the March
22 election, expressing the hope that he will beat his rival, Ma Ying-jeou of
the Kuomintang (KMT), by 250,000 votes.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is in Japan for a four-day visit, made the remarks at a news
conference after delivering a speech at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of
Japan in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>On the Jan. 12 legislative elections, he said the DPP estimates it can capture
50 seats in the streamlined 113-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>On the widening gap between Taiwan's rich and poor, Hsieh said the KMT
encourages manufacturers to invest in China and claimed that this leads to
rising unemployment, while his policy is to support small- and medium-sized
enterprises, claiming that this means factories will not have to make an exodus
overseas too soon.</P>
      <P>He also said that both he and President Chen Shui-bian advocate Taiwan's
independent sovereignty but that he differs from Chen on economic issues such as
relaxing restrictions on locals investing in China.</P>
      <P>Addressing the concerns related to constitutional re-engineering, he said that
according to the Constitution, constitutional amendments require the consent of
three-quarters of the legislators. As the DPP is aiming at 50 seats in the
legislature, constitutional amendment will be beyond the means of the DPP and
therefore there should be no concern about resultant cross-Taiwan Strait
tensions.</P>
      <P>He claimed that although China insists on its "one China" principle, if he is
elected, China will "have to" respect the will of the Taiwan people, who will
never accept the terms of "one China."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that China will face a litany of challenges in the coming 20
years, such as the issues of environmental protection, the widening wealth gap
and other social and economic woes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan went through all these problems and maybe it can be of assistance. It is
not good for China to isolate Taiwan, Hsieh said, expressing the hope that China
will treat minor countries peacefully in keeping with its "international
responsibility."</P>
      <P>He also criticized Ma for not speaking up for Taiwan during a visit he made to
Japan last month and his description of the DPP as a "troublemaker," which he
described as "not fair." Hsieh described his party as "a creator of a cultural
and peace miracle."</P>
      <P>Hsieh later called on Takeo Hiranuma, president of the Alliance for Japan-ROC
Friendship, and 21 members of the alliance,  a pro-Taiwan group of congressmen
and senators.</P>
      <P>Hiranuma wished Hsieh victory in the election. Former Defense Minister and now
congresswoman Yuriko Koike was also on hand to greet Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if he is elected president, he is sure that the DPP will become
the dominant force in the legislature, because if the KMT loses, the party will
splinter into Chinese Nationalist Party and the Taiwanese Nationalist Party, and
Chinese influence will gradually fade from Taiwan politics, leading to the
nation moving toward the path of normalization.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the ratio of those who identify themselves as Taiwanese rather than
Chinese was 30 percent in 2000 when President Chen Shui-bian won his first
election with 39.5 percent of the votes.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the ratio of those of those who identify themselves as Taiwanese rose
to 46 percent, and Chen was re-elected with 50.1 percent of the votes.</P>
      <P>Although recent public opinion polls on the issue vary, with the figures
standing at around 70 percent or at least over 62 percent, Hsieh said he is
confident of an overwhelming victory in the election.</P>
      <P>Senator Yasuhiro Oe noted that Ma said during his visit that he knows Japan, but
Oe said Japan needs a pro-Japan president for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma is generally considered to hold a tough stance on such issues as conflicting
fishery rights and Japanese claims on the controversial Tiaoyutais Islands,
known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh then called on former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori to exchange
views on the cross-strait situation.</P>

      <P>A former agent of the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice was
nabbed in Chunghe, Taipei County Tuesday for mailing threatening letters to
government leaders, including President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Hou Yu-ih, chief of the national police, told a hastily called news conference
later that day that the man, identified as Yang Ching-hai, had sent at least 31
threatening letters since November 2005 to senior officials, lawmakers from

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan hopes U.S. will not follow China's thinking on U.N. bid</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
12/19/07  10:59:54

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is continuing communications with the United States in the hope that it
will not follow China's rhetoric in thinking Taiwan's planned referendum on its
U.N. bid is a step toward de jure Taiwan independence, the acting spokeswoman of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Phoebe  Yeh said  that  after  months  of discussion  and communications, both
sides have realized that there is indeed a gap in understanding.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is acutely aware of the U.S. concerns, and the United States knows
perfectly Taiwan's stance, " Yeh said, adding that Taiwan has repeatedly
expressed the hope that the United States will not follow China's rhetoric in
seeing the U.N. bid is a step toward changing the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait or seeking de jure Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the ministry regrets the differences between the two countries over the
referendum.</P>
      <P>A close look at remarks by U.S. officials -- from Deputy Secretary of State John
Negroponte and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Thomas Christensen to American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond
Burghardt -- shows that the U.S. stance is consistent.</P>
      <P>However, she said, Taiwan has repeatedly explained to the United States that a
deepening democracy will help peace and stability in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Yeh also said that Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang will arrive in New
York Tuesday and will exchange views on issues of mutual concern with the
National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a nonprofit organization
dedicated to the resolution of conflicts that threaten U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>Yeh admitted that Huang will meet members of the think tank rather than U.S.
officials, but she said he "should be able to meet the people he wants to meet."
She did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Yeh claimed that if the planned referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid passes a vote
held alongside the March 22 presidential election, it will give a "positive
message to the international community that Taiwan people are keen on joining
the world body."</P>
      <P>However, if the referendum fails, then it can be attributed to a lot of factors,
including that the threshold for the referendum is too high, as well as a
controversial voting format.</P>
      <P>But whether the referendum passes or not, more than 2 million people have signed
their names to endorse the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-initiated
referendum, which Yeh described as " significant in its own way."</P>
      <P>She added that whoever takes the helm of the nation after the March 22
presidential election, he will still have to address the issue of Taiwan's
maneuvering space.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible not to think about soliciting the maneuvering space of Taiwan
internationally, Yeh said, adding that this is why the nation needs to forge a
consensus by holding the referendum.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's planned referendum on applying</P>
      <P>to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan is not intended to declare
independence or disrupt the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's
representative to the United States Joseph Wu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed the referendum will allow the Taiwan people to exercise their
democratic rights and that the vote will only address the issue of Taiwan's U.N.
membership, rather than changing the country's official name.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has been using U.N. Resolution 2758 -- which recognizes the
People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of China at the
United Nations -- to pressure the world body to reject Taiwan, Wu claimed the
resolution does not grant China the right to represent the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Wu said the United Nations' refusal to consider  Taiwan's membership application
is frustrating to the Taiwan people but has not dampened their desire to join
the world body.</P>
      <P>In addition to the referendum initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party on using the name Taiwan to join the United Nations, the opposition
Kuomintang is also pushing a referendum on U.N. membership for Taiwan under a
different name, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while delivering a keynote speech entitled "Taiwan's United
Nations Bid: Domestic Democracy or International Crisis" at the Heritage
Foundation in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Asked how U.S. concerns over the referendum are being addressed, Wu reiterated
that the United States is Taiwan's most important friend and that Taiwan
understands Washington's worries about the possible outbreak of cross-strait
conflict.</P>
      <P>Based on this reason, Taiwan has made it clear since 2000 that the country will
not declare independence, change its official name, or hold a referendum on the
unification versus independence issue, Wu said, adding that the U.N. bid
referendum is designed merely to make the voices of the Taiwan people heard.</P>
      <P>Asked if there is any chance the government of Taiwan might cancel the
referendum, Wu said both referendums will go ahead as planned as they are
promoted by political parties and are not up to any changes by the government.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, China's hostility toward Taiwan has made gaining U.N.
membership very important for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Besides blocking Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations, China is also
attempting to bar Taiwan's participation in the world community and is excluding
Taiwan from bilateral and regional free trade agreements with neighboring
countries in order to increase Taiwan's economic dependency on China.</P>
      <P>Wu argued that including Taiwan in the United Nations will help Taiwan's
political and economic development and provide Taiwan and China with a new
platform for dialogue.</P>
      <P>He stressed the separate rule of Taiwan and China has been the status quo across
the Taiwan Strait since 1949 and that the Taiwan people are fully entitled to
representation in the United Nations.</P>

relation with one of its former agents who was arrested Tuesday for mailing
threatening letters to public figures, including President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The bureau said in a written statement that Yang Ching-hai left his job at the
bureau in March 1988 and that the bureau has no information whatsoever about his
activities or the people he has associated with since that time.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper  reported Tuesday that Yang entered the Investigation Bureau
in 1970 and was considered a maverick by his supervisors.</P>
      <P>He published two books criticizing the bureau after leaving his job and filed a
lawsuit in June 2000 against Wang Kuang-yu, the bureau chief at the time,
accusing him of falsifying numbers for the bureau's annual budget.</P>
      <P>Yang was arrested on suspicions of involvement in a total of 31 criminal
intimidation cases, including sending threatening letters to President Chen
Shui-bian, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, government officials, legislators and news

      <P>Yang's girlfriend Ting Yi-chih, who admitted to helping type some of the

      <P>Ninety-six cases of parents comitting suicide after attempting to kill their
children have been reported in Taiwan over the past three years, leaving a total
of 124 children and teenagers killed or injured, according to tallies released
Wednesday by the Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF).</P>
      <P>The figure means an average 2.6 filicide-suicides occur per month in the
country, with the incidence rate registering 7.5 cases per million people,
higher than Japan's seven cases per million people, foundation officials said.</P>
      <P>The tallies were compiled by the foundation based on news reports published in
the last three years. The latest of these incidents took place Sunday, in which
a man in the central city of Taichung stabbed his eight-year-old daughter and 12
-year-old son with a fruit knife before killing himself with the same knife. The
girl and the father died, but the boy survived.</P>
      <P>The foundation has discovered that although the number of filicide-suicides has
dropped slightly this year, the death rate of children and teenagers involved
has increased to over 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that in 2005, 32 cases causing death or injury to a total of 51
children and teenagers were reported, with the death rate standing at 53
percent.</P>
      <P>The number of such cases rose to 35 in 2006, with 46 children or teenagers
killed, translating into a death rate of 72 percent.</P>
      <P>This year, 29 such cases in which 27 children and teenagers were killed or
injured had been reported as of Dec. 18, with the death rate registering 70
percent.</P>
      <P>The tallies indicate that nearly 70 percent of the victims of filicide-suicides
were school children older than six.</P>
      <P>On the causes of the incidents, the tallies show that 37.5 percent of the cases
reported so far this year were related to marriage or relationship conflicts.</P>
      <P>While another 28.1 percent were attributed to the heavy burden of credit card
debt or debts owed to a loan shark, 12.5 percent involved a parent suffering
from mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder or depression.</P>
      <P>Unemployment was to blame in 9.4 percent of the cases, and 6.3 percent involved
a parent with poor health or heavy parental duties, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>CWLF officials urged children to ask for help if they detect any unusual or
worrisome acts in their parents, adding that the public should also report the
situation to the authorities if they notice any dangerous signs in their
relatives, friends or neighbors.</P>
      <P>Places they can approach include the foundation's help hotline at (02) 25505959
ext. 4, the Ministry of the Interior's welfare and care hotline at 1957 and the
Department of Health's suicide prevention hotline at 0800-788-995, the officials
said.</P>

jobs, with a high percentage of them not content with their salaries, according
to the results of a recent survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the online job broker udnjob.com, found that only 31.6

their jobs, while 44.2 percent of those surveyed said their jobs are acceptable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislative speaker, DPP chief divided over election validity</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai were hugely divided Wednesday over the notion
that the validity of the upcoming legislative elections will be determined by
the Central Election Commission (CEC)  if the election is conducted in a "two-
step" voting format.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung said Tuesday that according to the Public
Officials Election and Recall Act, electoral operations will be illegal if the
Jan. 12 legislative elections are conducted in a "two-step" voting format by
some local governments and that the winners and legality of the elections -- if
held in such a format -- must be determined by the CEC members within a week of
polling.</P>
      <P>Apart from the CEC and the courts, no individual in this country should have the
right to validate the election results, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks to clarify comments made Monday by CEC Secretary-General
Teng Tien-you during a legislative interpellation session that elections to be
conducted via a "two-step" voting method by 18 KMT-controlled cities and
counties in the polls "would be valid" despite the CEC's decision to adopt a
"one-step" format.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that Teng's remarks at the Legislative Yuan were merely his
personal views and that his words do not represent the CEC's stance.</P>
      <P>Wang said Chang has apparently  "over-defined"  the Public Officials Election
and Recall Act, adding that the top government agency in charge of elections and
electoral affairs should respect voters' decisions and that the votes they cast
should be considered valid.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cho noted that the CEC decided in November that a "one-step"  voting
format will be adopted  in the forthcoming legislative elections as well as in
the presidential election slated for March 22.</P>
      <P>Cho quoted Chang as saying that according to the Public Officials Election and
Recall Act, the "two-step" method proposed by the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) will be invalid.</P>
      <P>Cho claimed that the KMT is simply trying to cause a social standoff by
insisting on the adoption of a "two-step" voting format.</P>
      <P>For his part, the legislature speaker, who was formerly a KMT vice chairman,
said that while Chang described Teng's remarks made at the Legislative Yuan as
"personal views, " the DPP is also putting forward "personal views" by defining
the KMT's "two-step" voting format proposal as "invalid."</P>
      <P>Even if the CEC has discussed and made a resolution on the voting format, it
should still be examined by the public, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang said the only way to solve the dispute surrounding the voting format for
the elections is to separate the legislative elections  and presidential  race
from  proposed  accompanying referendums, pointing out that four years ago, when
the presidential election and referendum were held separately, the voting went
smoothly.</P>
      <P>He added that although ballot distributions seems to be no problem in the "one-
step" voting format, the most important part -- vote counting -- would be time
consuming and troublesome.</P>

      <P>Business turnover of the local information technology (IT) industry this year is
expected to rise by 20 percent to 30 percent from last year, a spokesman for the
Taipei Computer Association (TCA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>TCA President Wang Jeng-tang made the forecast after saying that local notebook
and personal computer manufacturers should be able to maintain stable growth in
the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>In addition, speaking on the likely impact of the Labor Contract Act to be
implemented by the Chinese government from Jan. 1, Wang cited notebook computer
manufacturers as an example when he said that Taiwan produces up to 80 percent
of the world's laptops and that no country can compete in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is generally believed that the act will increase the cost of employing
Chinese laborers, which will be costly for Taiwanese companies that manufacture
in China.</P>
      <P>However,  Wang  pointed  out  that  all notebook  computer manufacturers will
face the same pressure, because they have all set up factories in China.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Wang said it is unlikely that these manufacturers will lower
product prices while their costs go up.</P>
      <P>"Maybe in the future, they will raise their selling prices a little, " Wang
predicted, describing the impact of the Chinese action as "limited" and "not
necessarily negative."</P>
      <P>Asked if computer manufacturers will shift production sites to other countries
to cope with rising labor costs, Wang pointed out that infrastructure
construction takes time.</P>
      <P>Therefore, "it will take these manufactures at least a year or two before they
leave China," he said.</P>

      <P>Frank Hsieh, the presidential hopeful of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , said here Wednesday that he is satisfied with his just-concluded
visit to Japan and pledged that he will seek dialogue with China if elected
president early next year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks at a news conference prior to his departure for Taiwan
after wrapping up a four-day visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if he achieves  victory in the March 22 presidential election,
he will do his utmost to help galvanize peace across the Taiwan Strait and hold
talks with China based on national sovereignty and dignity.</P>
      <P>He said he is poised to conduct negotiations with China but will not do so
unconditionally at the cost of Taiwan's democratic values and efforts by
yielding to China's unreasonable conditions, such as its "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, he favors a broader opening of Taiwan to China on the
economic front, including allowing direct cross-strait charter flights and
Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, while insisting on safeguarding Taiwan's
independent sovereignty on the political front.</P>
      <P>Such a stance would mark a departure from the position of Ma Ying-jeou, his main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) opponent, who urges a full opening to China without
paying heed to Taiwan's independent sovereignty and also from that of some
traditional DPP members who focus excessively on national sovereignty and remain
reluctant to open up to China, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Turning to the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty over the Tiaoyutai island group,
which is also claimed by Japan and China, Hsieh said he already proclaimed that
the island group belongs to Taiwan when he served as premier from 2005-2006.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the sovereignty dispute over the island groups should be
put aside temporarily to allow fishery development by designating the
12-nautical mile zone around the islands as a conservation area.</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's suspicion that Hsieh was afraid of defending Taiwan's
sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais in front of the Japanese side, Hsieh argued that
Ma is unaware of how the government has been seeking  to resolve the Tiaoyutai
issue through international negotiations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh arrived in Osaka Dec. 16 for a four-day visit and then proceeded to Kyoto
and Tokyo, where he gave speeches, visited Japanese politicians and met
Taiwanese expatriates.</P>

      <P>Some 500 drivers working for a Taipei bus company are dressing up as Santa Claus
this month in order to bring seasonal greetings to commuters and to make their
usually bland bus rides more colorful and memorable.</P>
      <P>The Santa drivers, introduced by Capital Bus, which operates 45 bus routes in
the greater Taipei area, also hand out candies and cookies to passengers during
the Christmas season. Christmas is not a public holiday in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More  and  more  drivers  undergo  the voluntary  yuletide transformation, which
started a few years ago, following growing public demand.</P>
      <P>"We had only a few Santa drivers at first, but many passengers would wait at the
bus stops for Santa drivers and buses with Christmas decorations," Yang Shu-
ting, the station master at Er-chong, Taipei County, told CNA.</P>
      <P>The company then asked all its drivers to dress up as Santa Claus on a voluntary
basis and most drivers have cooperated, Yang added. Many other staff members
also wear Santa costumes, which are provided by the management.</P>
      <P>Over the years, many drivers have taken pride in being able to bring Christmas
greetings to bus passengers but for at least some of them, taking on this extra
role was not easy at first.</P>
      <P>"My 10-year-old son was shocked to see me in a Santa costume and asked me what I
was doing dressed like a clown," said Wu Chen-sen.</P>
      <P>After some explanation, his children had a change in attitude and are now proud
to have a dad who is a Santa driver.</P>
      <P>"It's going to be December again. Don't forget to become a Santa driver," Wu's
children remind him.</P>
      <P>Another driver, Chao Er-ge, said: "I was a bit shy at first but now I'm used to
it."</P>
      <P>"I'm very happy to dress up like a Santa Claus to serve my passengers," he
added.</P>
      <P>Besides adding color to the journey, Santa drivers make sure passengers do not
miss their stops.</P>
      <P>"Welcome aboard Capital Bus Route 292 from Er-chong to Lin-Gwang MRT Station.
Next stop Zhong-shan MRT Station," a driver announces.</P>
      <P>"I was too shy to address the passengers at first," Wu said. "But now, even if
there is only one person left on the bus, I still make the announcements."</P>
      <P>"It has become a habit," said Wu, who also drives a Route 292 bus.</P>
      <P>Reactions from passengers to the Christmas service have been "mostly positive,"
said Yang.</P>
      <P>A passenger, who preferred to remain anonymous, praised the idea and said: "I
really like the service they provide."</P>
      <P>Capital has been named Taipei's top bus operator 16 times by the city

including soybeans and sunflowers, on 1,721 hectares of fallow land in the
southern counties of Yunlin, Chiayi and Tainan in 2006.</P>
      <P>This year, the cultivation was further expanded to 24 counties and townships,
including Taoyuan and Taipei counties, covering a total of 3,334 hectares of
fallow ground.</P>
      <P>However, harvests were far less than expected due to damage caused by natural
disasters and pests, Yu said, adding that they could only meet the demand from
several model governmental bio-energy promotion programs such as the "green
government vehicle" program implemented in September.</P>
      <P>In this regard, Yu said, future energy crop cultivation will focus on plants
like sweet potatoes, which are the major resource for the production of bio-
ethanol.</P>
      <P>Energy crop cultivation is one of the government's strategies in the face of an
international  energy  crisis  resulting  from skyrocketing crude oil prices,
according to the AFA.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, who is a 1986 Nobel
Prize winner in chemistry, suggested that the government speed up efforts to cut
Taiwan's emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the factors in global warming.</P>
      <P>At a national park/greenland conference held by the Construction and Planning
Agency in Taipei earlier in the day, Lee said the country has moved at a snail's
pace in the reduction of CO2 emissions.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan can be regarded as an "over-developed" country from the viewpoint
of its CO2 emissions. If the nation cannot act to cut the emissions
significantly, economic activity in the country will be "meaningless" because
the next generation will be faced with a polluted environment unsuitable for
living, Lee said.</P>

      <P>A wetland area that has been developed into a natural waste water treatment area
by ecological engineering methods in Taipei County has also been turned into a
natural habitat for wildlife.</P>
      <P>The 13-hectare wetland, known as the Da Niao Pi Wetland, has also won the 2007
Ford Motor Company Conservation and Environmental Grant for Excellence.</P>
      <P>The wetland, built between November 2005 and December 2006, can treat some
11,000 metric tons of waste water per day discharged into the Tamshui River from
communities in Taipei County, with a cleansing rate of 60 percent.</P>
      <P>Professor Kuo Jen-hua of National Taiwan University provided technological know-
how to the wetland management -- the Taipei County Environmental Protection
Bureau -- to nurture Taiwanese endemic wild rice on the wetland, efforts that
have already borne fruit over the past year, said Hsiao Tien-kun, a bureau
inspector.</P>
      <P>In addition to wild rice, Hsiao said, the wetland is now a wildlife
conservation  habitat with ecological  and biological diversity -- visitors and
residents include wetland and migrant birds such as the common moorhen, a water
bird that inhabits paddy fields, mangroves and wetland areas, the little grebe,
the common teal and the rarely seen jacana.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Microbiologists at two universities in the southern port city of Kaohsiung have
discovered a bacteria capable of breaking down the poisonous substance dioxin
efficiently and are trying to apply the species to a mass purging process to
save on the time and cost involved in removing the pollutant, academic sources
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU) and Cheng Shiu University (CSU) started
the project with the aim of remedying the aftermath of dioxin pollution
incidents, which at present cost millions of dollars to clean up and require the
removal of existing contaminated soil and its replacement with clean soil.</P>
      <P>"However, the polluted soil still presents a health threat to humans and animals
as there is no effective way of decomposing the substance, " said Chang-Chien
Guo-pin, director of the CSU's Super Micro Mass Research and Technology Center.</P>
      <P>Dioxin, a general term for a group of hundreds of highly persistent chemicals,
is a by-product emitted in the production of herbicides, disinfectants and other
agents. Dioxin has proven capable of causing cancer and other diseases in
humans.</P>
      <P>Chang-Chien noted that the project was first initiated when a CSU team found
that hundreds of bacterium species can survive and prosper in dioxin-laced soil,
indicating that some of them must have the ability to "digest" and live off the
chemical.</P>
      <P>Later, Chang-Chien continued, they decided to cooperate with microbiologists
from NSYSU to differentiate the various species -- among the several candidate
bacteria, only one can break down the chemical with great efficiency, while the
others work too slowly to attain economies of scale.</P>
      <P>The bacterium -- which Chang-Chien declined to identify as the patent
application for the cultivation and purging process is still undergoing review
-- is under intense scrutiny by the researchers to determine if it can also work
at the same efficacy and efficiency outside the laboratory.</P>
      <P>"Once the method proves workable, it will save billions of dollars that would
otherwise have to be spent on removing polluted soil," said Chang-Chien.</P>

      <P>A number of products imported from El Salvador and Honduras will have import
tariffs exempted from early next year or within the next five, 10, or 15 years,
a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved a package of amendments to the General Rules on
Customs Import Tariffs a day earlier, regulating tariff exemptions on 10,500
industrial  and 1,337 agricultural products from the two countries from next
year, the official of the MOF's Department of Customs Administration said.</P>
      <P>Items such as T-shirts, men's underwear, catfish slices, frozen shark fins and
fish tails, are all included on the exemption list.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 220 sensitive products with tariff quotas, such as pineapples,
mangoes, cigarettes, compact cars, as well as sugar with tariff quotas, have
been excluded from the exemption list in order to protect domestic industry, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Honduras and El Salvador, both
of which are diplomatic allies of Taiwan, in May this year, the official said.</P>
      <P>The amendments  also stipulate  that 14 imported products, including noni juice
from Panama -- which signed an FTA with Taiwan in 2004 -- be exempt from import
tariffs from January, while another 38 products from Panama will have import
tariffs removed gradually within three or five years, the official added.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called Wednesday for voters to support the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its candidates so that the DPP can garner
50 seats in the Jan. 12 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The president, who doubles as DPP chairman, made the appeal prior to a weekly
meeting of the DPP Central Standing Committee. Chen, along with Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung and Presidential Office Secretary-General Yeh Chu-lan, also shouted
campaign slogans.</P>
      <P>Chen said the next legislature will adopt a "single-member constituency, two-
vote" electoral system for the first time, in which voters will cast their first
ballot for their preferred regional legislator and a second for their favored
political party. The 225-member legislature will also be cut by half to 113
seats.</P>
      <P>"Voters are being given an extra privilege and choice to end the chaos in the
legislature and stabilize the political situation, " he said, referring to the
constant bickering in the opposition-dominated legislature, which has stalled
the review of major bills for several years, in some cases.</P>
      <P>He urged the voters to endorse the DPP so that it can win at least 35 regional
seats. This, coupled with 15 at-large seats, would ensure the party its target
of 50 seats.</P>
      <P>Should DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh win the March 22 presidential
election, he will be able to make the DPP a stable majority in the legislature,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president also said the legislative elections will be a battle between the
DPP's "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" stance and the opposition
Kuomintang's "eventual unification with China" position.</P>
      <P>Each ballot will be crucial, Chen went on, adding that according to the current
electoral system, any political parties that fail to receive more than 5 percent
of the ballots cast will be ineligible for the distribution of at-large seats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan hopes to be late bloomer in corporate branding</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
12/19/07  21:01:46

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's corporations have only recently begun branding themselves, but hope to
catch up with the strongest brand names around the world, trade officials and
corporate leaders said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"While earning meager profits, Taiwanese companies have to upgrade themselves
from OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) to OBMs (original brand
manufacturers) sooner or later, " Hsu Chun-fang, Deputy Director of Bureau of
Foreign Trade, said in a year-end review of the "Branding Taiwan" campaign.</P>
      <P>Recognizing that branding will be the next step for Taiwanese businesses, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) launched a seven-year Branding Taiwan
campaign in 2006 with a NT$1.6 billion budget.</P>
      <P>The campaign  focuses  on helping  SMEs (small and medium enterprises), rather
than companies that have already made their mark and possess  strong  brand
names,  such as computer  hardware manufacturers Acer Inc. and Asustek Computer,
which ranked as the top brand name in Taiwan in 2007 with a value of US$1.196
billion.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the brand value of Taiwan's top-rated Asustek is far less than that
of the American car-renting company Hertz, which ranked last on the list of the
world's Top 100 brand names this year with a brand value of US$3.3 billion,
showing how far Taiwanese companies lag behind in brand development, said Chao
Yuan-chuan, chief executive officer of Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA).</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has a long way to go to catch up with the development of international
brands. We're latecomers, but at least we're now on our way, " Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Most Taiwanese SMEs realized that branding is a road they have to travel if they
are serious about staying competitive, but they lack the necessary budget, an
essential factor in building up a brand name and expertise, Chao said.</P>
      <P>That was where the Branding Taiwan campaign comes in, said Chiu Yi-cheng,
General Manager of Kiddie's Paradise Inc., a child educational equipment
provider which started to build up its own "Weplay" brand in 1999. The company
is now selling its products in 50 countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese designers and inventors have been doing well in international
invention shows and design competitions -- such as the iF and Red Dot
competition in Germany -- Chiu said. With its already-strong manufacturing
sector, Taiwan will be in an excellent position to develop more international
brands if it can integrate the various value chains of different sectors, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chao encouraged SMEs intending to go into corporate branding to first identify
their niche markets and products in order to put their money in the right place.
Corporations were also encouraged to develop their brand names in Taiwan before
taking them international. Partnerships between several SMEs to develop a brand
is also an option, he said.</P>
      <P>"For example, A Team, the leading Taiwan cycling industry association, which
includes bicycle manufacturers Giant, Merida and others, has been influential
and important in the cycling world because of their strong partnership," Chao
said.</P>
      <P>The combined brand value of this year's top 20 Taiwanese brands exceeds NT$280.5
billion (US$8.443 billion) , representing a 33 percent increase over last year's
NT$211 billion (US$6. 464 billion). The brand valuation was organized by the
MOEA and conducted by TAITRA.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday it is regrettable  that Taiwan's
designation  in the Lions Clubs International has been changed to "China Taiwan"
simply because China wishes to be a member of this charity-minded organization.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office with Mahendra
Amarasuriya, president of the Lions Clubs International (LCI), accompanied by
executives of Taiwan's Lions Clubs at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Without the consent of Taiwan's Lions Club, one of the top three non-
governmental organizations in Taiwan, the LCI changed its designation in the
organization from "ROC Lions Club" to "China Taiwan Lions Club" in 2002 under
pressure from China.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a sovereign country, Chen stressed that Taiwan and China
are separate countries that do not belong to each other, and this is the reality
of the status quo between the two sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"It is unacceptable to the 23 million people of Taiwan to arbitrarily change
Taiwan's designation in the CLI just because of China's desire to join this
world organization," Chen added.</P>
      <P>All members of Taiwan's Lions Club hope that Taiwan's designation in the LCI
will soon be changed to "Taiwan", with its headquarters having established a
task force to push for the rectification of Taiwan's designation in the
organization.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that Taiwan also welcomes China's joining the LCI, but the status
quo between the two sides of Taiwan Strait should not be altered. He also
expressed hope that Amarasuriya and all of the LCI's executives will pay heed to
the voices of the 23 million people in Taiwan and acknowledge that the country
is not part or a province of China and do not want to be excluded or downgraded.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's call, Amarasuriya said he recognizes Taiwan is an
independent and sovereign country, and as the head of the LCI, promised that he
will seriously listen to the opinions of members of Taiwan's Lions Clubs and
render assistance in this regard in accordance with the regulations of LCI.</P>
      <P>The Lions Clubs International is the world's largest volunteer service
organization, with 1.3 million members scattered around 201 countries and

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian warned Wednesday that if different voting formats are
adopted in the upcoming legislative elections, the outcome will be endless
disputes.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while attending an anti-graft seminar sponsored
by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chen noted that during past elections, cities and counties adopted the same
voting system regardless of which political party was in charge, saying that
only by adopting an identical system can the outcome of the elections be
accepted by all.</P>
      <P>But if the election process and voting system differ from one city to another,
then the election is bound to end in chaos and disputes, the president said.</P>
      <P>He said that the Central Election Commission (CEC) has decided to adopt a "one-
step" voting system for the January 12 legislative elections, and local
government should abide by that decision.</P>
      <P>He regretted that some cities and counties have insisted on a "two-step" voting
system, which he said goes beyond their legal authority and may even violate the
Criminal Law.</P>
      <P>He said that the election work cannot be completed by the city or county chiefs
alone, and it will be "quite irresponsible" if they act rashly and leave the
conduct of the election to election staff alone.</P>
      <P>He stressed that according to the Constitution, the Election and the Recall Law,
and the Referendum Law, the CEC will be in charge of the January 12 legislative
elections and the CEC will monitor the conduct of local election commissions in
handling the elections."</P>
      <P>Since the CEC has decided to adopt the "one-step" voting format in accordance
with the law, local governments should abide by its decision, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He cited a recent public opinion poll as showing that 56.2 percent of the people
support the CEC's decision to adopt a "one-step" voting system, while 56.6
percent of the people think that the decision of some cities and counties to
boycott the "one-step" system is "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>Under the "one-step" voting format, voters will receive two ballots for the
legislative elections and two referendum ballots at different desks and then
cast them into four different boxes.</P>
      <P>Eighteen "pan-blue"-controlled localities have insisted that they will use the
"two-step" format under which voters will receive and cast referendum ballots
only after they have cast their ballots for the legislative elections, claiming
that the "one-step" format could cause confusion and chaos during the voting

      <P>Education agencies as well as teachers' and parents' groups have thrown their
support behind a teacher who was recently acquitted of a privacy infringement
charge for inspecting a student's backpack.</P>
      <P>The support came after the parents of a student filed a lawsuit against a
homeroom teacher, surnamed Lei, at a junior high school in Taipei City for
violating their child's privacy rights by searching the student's backpack. They
asked for NT$1 million in compensation.</P>
      <P>However, the Taipei District Court ruled in favor of Lei on the grounds that
searching backpacks is part of a teachers' duty to provide student counseling
and guidance.</P>
      <P>Yang Yi-fung, a spokesman for the National Teachers' Association asserted that
teachers have the right to conduct searches in accordance with a tobacco and
drug prevention project formulated by the Ministry of Education, adding that if
there is something wrong, the responsibility lies with policy makers, not policy
implementers.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that from the perspective of the law, there was nothing wrong
with the teacher's actions, and urged the public not to make too much of a
simple legal case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Wen-hu, deputy director of the National Alliance of Parents
organization, said that the court ruling guarantees the scope of teacher's
legitimate power to educate students. But he stressed that teachers should be
attended by a class representative or a third party while conducting a search of
a student's personal property.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No option other than 'one-step' voting method: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reiterated Wednesday in a weekly Executive Yuan
meeting that the decision made by some local units of the Central Election
Commission (CEC) to adopt a"two-step" voting method in two elections early next
year is invalid.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that the Executive Yuan, in accordance with the law, has no other
option but to adopt a CEC-designed "one-step" voting format for the Jan. 12
legislative polls and March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the basic spirit of the division of power in a democratic
nation, the Executive Yuan must fully abide by the decision jointly made by the
CEC members, Chang said, expressing his hope that an agreement will soon be
reached between the central and some local governments concerning the voting
format dispute so as to allow the elections to be held smoothly.</P>
      <P>In compliance with the Public Officials Election and Recall Act and the
Referendum Law, the CEC is authorized to organize and supervise the two
elections in 2008 -- each to be accompanied by two referendums, Chang said,
insisting that local CEC branches are not entitled to make their own decisions
regarding the voting method.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has asked the CEC to do its best to negotiate with its local
units to resolve the voting format dispute as soon as possible, he said, adding
that "we do not want to see Taiwan's hard-won democracy undermined."</P>
      <P>Executive  Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said following the Cabinet's weekly
meeting that the Executive Yuan is set to replace CEC branch chiefs who insist
on applying a "two-step" voting scheme in the two approaching polls on charges
of breaching Article 153 of the Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>Responding to reporters' questions concerning the premier's remark that the
central government will seek to talk over the issue with 18 local governments
controlled  by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) favoring the "two-step"
method, Shieh replied that "there is no such plan at present" and asserted that
"two different voting methods will not be tolerated in the same election."</P>
      <P>Local authorities should comply with the CEC's decision on applying the "one-
step" voting format, and there is absolutely no room for compromise on this
front, he said.</P>
      <P>As to the question of how a task force led by Vice Premier Chiou I-jen would
deal with the voting method impasse between central and local authorities, Shieh
replied that "an answer is due next Monday."</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin refused to respond to the Executive Yuan over what he
called the central government's flip-flops.</P>
      <P>"It is hard for us to respond to an inconsistent Executive Yuan, which said it
would negotiate, but later threatened to replace CEC branch chiefs," he said.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung said Tuesday that local CEC unit chiefs would be
prosecuted for "inciting others to defy a superior's orders" under Article 153
of the Criminal Code if they continue to reject the "two-step" voting format.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that if the "two-step" format is used in some localities, the
winners, and the legality, of the legislative and presidential elections must be
determined jointly by the CEC members within one week of the poll. "Only results
confirmed by the CEC are valid," he emphasized.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan makes progress in AIDS patients' human rights: civic groups</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan has made progress in protecting AIDS patients'  human rights by allowing
patients without household registrations to stay in Taiwan to file appeals to
their deportation, a representative of civic groups for AIDS patients' rights
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-huei, secretary-general of the Persons with HIV/AIDS Rights Advocacy
Association of Taiwan held a news conference on the same day to announce five
top news stories dealing with AIDS issues, as selected by 15 civic groups.
Reports on the right of AIDS patients to submit their appeals before deportation
were among the five top AIDS-related news events.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Lawmaker Huang Shu-ying pointed out that
previous AIDS Prevention and Control Act stipulated that foreign spouses,
diplomats or expatriate students without household registrations in Taiwan, if
found to have been infected with HIV, were to be deported before submitting an
appeal.</P>
      <P>Those who have annulled their previous nationalities thereby became stateless
persons under the previous regulations, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Social worker Yeh Chieh-yu expressed pessimism concerning the amendments, which
were passed in July, saying that the association helped two foreign spouses
infected with HIV to submit their appeals before being deported, but neither
appeal was successful.</P>
      <P>"A successful appeal does not necessarily guarantee a patient's long-term stay
in Taiwan and the acquiring of Taiwanese nationality," Yeh said. She explained
that a foreign spouse affected by HIV has to prove to the Department of Health
that the disease came from his or her Taiwanese spouse, and then apply for
Taiwanese nationality from the National Immigration Agency.</P>
      <P>The other four top news stories dealt with the content of the amendments, the
Harmony Home Association that houses AIDS patients being permitted to remain
where it is in Taipei City, the launch of an AIDS medical card for AIDS
patients' privacy, and an Investigation Bureau trainee with HIV being forced to
leave the organization because of his HIV status, Lin said.</P>
      <P>These five top news stories reflected the various concerns of a variety of civic
groups, Lin said, adding that the association will continue to pay close
attention to these stories to further improve the protection of the right of
people with AIDS in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT candidates publicize 2nd economic construction blueprint</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  19  (CNA)
12/19/07  23:24:26
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) presidential candidate, Ma Ying-jeou,
stressed in his second economic construction blueprint Wednesday that if
elected, he will work to promote industrial reform and innovation, and push
Taiwan to join in the global economic integration.</P>
      <P>Ma and his running mate, Vincent Siew, jointly publicized their blueprint
earlier in the day after Ma made public elements of his economic platform in
late November.</P>
      <P>Major topics in the blueprint include promoting traditional industrial  reforms,
pushing the service sector to become an employment driver in Taiwan, seeking to
normalize economic and trade ties with China, seeking to integrate business
opportunities in the Taiwan Strait area with those in global markets, and
carrying out efforts to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide.</P>
      <P>The KMT candidates' plan to pursue cross-strait normalization, which they
described as their key strategy to break through the current deadlock blocking
regional cooperation, drew the attention of the local and foreign media, and
raised questions as to whether the plan might contradict Ma's remarks during his
visit to the United States and Europe in 2006, when he said that Taiwan won't
conduct talks with Beijing unless the latter dismantles missiles targeting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Questioned  on this point,  Ma said the normalization  of cross-strait economic
ties and dismantling of missiles are two different matters which can be dealt
with separately.</P>
      <P>As the Democratic Progressive Party government has not touched on the missile
issue while engaging in talks with Beijing about offering charter flight
services between the two sides, Ma said he thinks it is not necessary to bring
up the missile problem during cross-strait negotiations on economic issues.</P>
      <P>If elected, he will at once begin efforts to normalize Taiwan's economic ties
with China, Ma added, noting that he will need more time to address issues
concerning means of ending the hostility between the two sides in a drive to
seek regional peace.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated that if the KMT regains power next year, it will act to resume
cross-strait negotiations based on the 1992 Consensus, which refers to an
understanding between the two sides that there is only one China, with both
sides free to make their own interpretation of what "one China" actually means.</P>

NT$390 billion (US$12.03 billion).</P>
      <P>Lai said that the bureau is also preparing to increase subsidies, to draw
foreign visitors, noting that a subsidies of NT$30 million (US$926,000) have
already provided for 100 charter planes bearing 15,000 visitors this year and
that subsidies will be raised to NT$50 million next year to bring 20,000
visitors.</P>

and US$30,000 for 2,000 passengers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to encourage foreign travel agencies to promote tourism in Taiwan,
the Tourism Bureau will share some expenses for printing Taiwanese tourism
package folders or running Taiwan tourism ads, Lai said.</P>
      <P>She also said that the 2009 Deaflympics and the 2009 World Games in Taiwan will

      <P>To develop a broad tourism base, the tourism bureau will also promote winter
golfing trips to Taiwan in Japan and South Korean.</P>
      <P>Targeting those who enjoy rail travel, the Tourism Bureau will also have high
speed rail, Taiwan Railway travel and steam rail package tours.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's popular singing group F4 has a great following in Japan and
South Korea, they will ask the group to serve as spokesman for Taiwan's tourism,
while popular singer Jolin will serve as the spokeswoman in Hong Kong, Singapore
and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>To make use of 2 million visitors making transit stops in Taiwan every year, the
tourism bureau will also cooperate with air carriers to offer short-stay
packages, for instance a US$97 tour of Taiwan, or half-day tour activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lions Clubs International asked to rectify Taiwan's designation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday it is regrettable  that Taiwan's
designation  in the Lions Clubs International has been changed to "China Taiwan"
simply because China wishes to be a member of this charity-minded organization.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office with Mahendra
Amarasuriya, president of the Lions Clubs International (LCI), accompanied by
executives of Taiwan's Lions Clubs at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Without the consent of Taiwan's Lions Club, one of the top three non-
governmental organizations in Taiwan, the LCI changed its designation in the
organization from "ROC Lions Club" to "China Taiwan Lions Club" in 2002 under
pressure from China.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a sovereign country, Chen stressed that Taiwan and China
are separate countries that do not belong to each other, and this is the reality
of the status quo between the two sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"It is unacceptable to the 23 million people of Taiwan to arbitrarily change
Taiwan's designation in the CLI just because of China's desire to join this
world organization," Chen added.</P>
      <P>All members of Taiwan's Lions Club hope that Taiwan's designation in the LCI
will soon be changed to "Taiwan", with its headquarters having established a
task force to push for the rectification of Taiwan's designation in the
organization.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that Taiwan also welcomes China's joining the LCI, but the status
quo between the two sides of Taiwan Strait should not be altered. He also
expressed hope that Amarasuriya and all of the LCI's executives will pay heed to
the voices of the 23 million people in Taiwan and acknowledge that the country
is not part or a province of China and do not want to be excluded or downgraded.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chen's call, Amarasuriya said he recognizes Taiwan is an
independent and sovereign country, and as the head of the LCI, promised that he
will seriously listen to the opinions of members of Taiwan's Lions Clubs and
render assistance in this regard in accordance with the regulations of LCI.</P>
      <P>The Lions Clubs International is the world's largest volunteer service
organization, with 1.3 million members scattered around 201 countries and
geographic areas worldwide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kitchen scraps to net NT$40 million for Tainan city government</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kitchen wastes collected in the city of Tainan are expected to generate NT$40
million in revenues for the city government over the next two years, officials
with the city's Environmental Protection Bureau said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that the biennial bidding for the rights to have the
city's kitchen scraps took place a day earlier, with the contract awarded to the
highest bidder, a hog raiser in Rende township, Tainan County, who offered to
pay NT$2.6 per kilogram -- nearly five times as much as the previous winning bid
two years ago.</P>
      <P>They noted that the competition was keen, as the number of bidders increased
from three in 2005 to nine this year.</P>
      <P>If the quantity of kitchen waste collected in Tainan remains at the same level
as in the past two years, the new contract will net NT$40 million for the city
government, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the windfall to recent prices hikes, which have made kitchen
scraps comparatively cheap as hog feed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President rebukes opposition for pushing 'money pit' bills</HEADLINE>

12/20/07  14:02:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lambasted the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -led "pan-
blue alliance" Thursday for promoting a series of so-called "money pit" bills
that favor special, minority groups ahead of the legislative and presidential
elections.</P>
      <P>Pointing to one bill that would provide more than 350,000 veteran households
that do not own a home with a home purchase subsidy of NT$3.2 million
(US$98,462) per household, Chen noted that the bill, if passed, would cost
NT$1.12 trillion -- a sum equivalent to the central government's total revenue
for a whole year.</P>
      <P>The amount is sufficient to cover the construction costs of two high-speed
railways or the costs of the National Health Insurance program for eight years,
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen said the move by the opposition goes against the principle of fairness and
justice because it creates a "privileged class" formed by veterans and their
families -- which have traditionally been supporters of the KMT -- at the
expense of the welfare of the vast majority of the country's citizens.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks in an article titled "Welfare for a Minority of
the People is Privilege" that appears in the latest issue of his online
newsletter.</P>
      <P>Chen said that during his recent visits to rural areas in central and southern
Taiwan, he often met farmers and workers who raised doubts over the government's
policy to provide a living allowance of NT$13,550 per month to veterans and
medical subsidies to veterans and their families, while elderly farmers only
receive NT$6,000 per month.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that over the past seven years, the Democratic Progressive Party
administration has been launching various welfare programs targeting senior
citizens and workers in an effort to balance such a biased policy, which has
existed since the former KMT administration.</P>
      <P>Still, the benefits enjoyed by average citizens remain small compared with those
enjoyed by military personnel, civil servants and public school teachers, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that for decades, retired military personnel, civil servants and public
school teachers had enjoyed an unreasonable 18 percent annual interest rate for
their deposits, adding that veterans are receiving NT$13,550 per month in living
allowance.</P>
      <P>Also, even before the National Health Insurance program was launched, veterans
and their families already enjoyed government subsidies for their medical bills,
he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the former KMT government spent NT$80 billion in compensation for
veterans and NT$500 billion on the reconstruction of residential communities for
military personnel and their families.</P>
      <P>Urging the KMT not to allow an unrestricted continuation of the "privileges"
enjoyed by a small minority of people, Chen said every citizen in this country
has a responsibility and obligation to contribute to the establishment of a
long-lasting, universal social welfare system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top financial regulatory official defended Thursday the government's
decision to pay NT$47.49 billion (US$1.46 billion) to HSBC Holding PLC for it to
take over the debt-ridden Chinese Bank, saying it is a "fair price."</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission, made the
remarks one day after the government-owned Central Depository Insurance Corp.
(CDIC) began the process of selling Chinese Bank, which is part of the Rebar
Group. The government assigned the CDIC to take over the struggling bank in the
wake of a bank run crisis triggered by the insolvency of two other companies
under the Rebar Group in January.</P>
      <P>Hu said that he "has done his best to ensure that the government pays less,"
adding that "it is a fair price judging from the asset quality of Chinese Bank."</P>
      <P>Chinese Bank had NT$29.7 billion more debt than assets as of Oct. 31, according
to the Financial Supervisory Commission.</P>
      <P>Hu pointed out that when the government approved the establishment of 16 new
banks in 1990, the fate of some newly established banks "had been sealed."</P>
      <P>He said that the FSC will promote an amendment to the Bank Law when the new
legislature begins its first session in February so that the government will
have a legal basis to step in and monitor potentially problematic banks early.</P>
      <P>If the amendment to the law passes, then when a bank's capital adequacy ratio
falls below 8 percent, a capital increase will be compulsory, Hu said.</P>
      <P>On collecting embezzled funds from fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng, founder and
owner of the Rebar Group, Hu said that the government will definitely not allow
him to get away with the billions of dollars he allegedly embezzled from the
70-odd companies under his group.</P>
      <P>He said the government will offer big rewards or employ other means to retrieve
the money from Wang, who is currently hiding in the United States with his wife.</P>
      <P>Hu cited the example of second-hand smoke litigation in the United States,
saying that a superb legal team can help win a thorny case and help plaintiffs
receive a high amount of compensation.</P>
      <P>Speaking on reports that foreign banks have frozen Wang's assets to the amount
of US$2.96 million, Hu said that Taiwan was informed of the matter through
judicial personnel in Europe.</P>
      <P>The FSC will work with the Bankers Association of the Republic of China and
creditor banks to offer lucrative incentives to attract capable personnel to
facilitate the debt collection process, Hu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>With Beijing Olympics approaching, concern grows over human rights</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  20  (CNA)
12/20/07  16:50:51
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games approaches, the international community,
including the European Union and non-government organizations (NGOs) such as
Human Rights Without Frontiers (HRWF) , has organized a series of events to
highlight criticism and concerns on China's poor human rights record.</P>
      <P>Given that economic and cultural ties between the EU and China have become ever-
more closely linked in recent years, the EU confirmed in a recent meeting that
it is mulling whether to lift its arms sales embargo against China. However, a
resolution unanimously adopted by the European Parliament Dec. 13 clearly states
that it will not rashly lift the embargo, as a result of China's poor human
rights situation.</P>
      <P>The resolution also expresses regret over the European Council and European
Commission's lack of success in raising their numerous human rights concerns "in
a firm manner" with the Chinese authorities during the 10th EU-China Summit held
Nov. 28, and their failure to take opportunity of the approaching Beijing
Olympics to pressure China into improving its human rights situation.</P>
      <P>In addition, a hearing on the human rights situation in China organized by the
Brussels-based HRWF and the political group Alliance of Liberals and Democrats
for Europe (ALDE), was held Dec. 18 in the European Parliament, which concluded
that there has been no progress in the country's human rights record since
Beijing was awarded the Olympics in 2001.</P>
      <P>Addressing  the hearing,  Hungarian Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and
ALDE member Istvan Szent-Ivanyi said that in order to see some real progress in
the human rights situation in China "it requires a stronger and more united
effort on behalf of the international community to call on China to respect its
commitments, " according to the press release from the HRWF.</P>
      <P>At the end of the event, the MEPs and 12 NGOs that participated signed a
declaration criticizing the "lack of progress" made by China in a number of
areas, including Internet censorship and human rights abuses.</P>
      <P>According to a report from Agence France Presse, Chinese cyber-dissident Wang
To-chia, who criticized the government over human rights abuses ahead of the
Olympics, was detained Dec. 19, while Amnesty International reported that
property owner Wang Ling was recently given 15 months of "re-education through
labor" for signing petitions and preparing banners to protest over the
demolition of her property for Olympic construction projects.</P>
      <P>These cases, along with many others,  not only prove the regression of the human
rights situation in China but also underscore the urgent need for action with
just eight months to go before the Olympics.</P>
      <P>Because of this, the European Union and many NGOs such as the HRWF, Reporters
Without Frontiers and Amnesty International have been making this issue the
center of their work and hope to induce more pressure and criticism on the
Chinese authorities to honor the promises of reform they made in 2001.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators traded barbs with their
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) counterparts Thursday over the opposition-dominated
legislature's resolution earlier in the day to freeze funding for the 228
Memorial Foundation.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tien Chiu-chin said at a news conference that she felt "sad,
sorry and indignant" that the 228 Memorial Foundation's NT$300  million
(US$9.26  million)  budget was frozen by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Describing the 228 Incident of 1947 -- in which thousands of native Taiwanese
were killed in a series of brutal crackdowns conducted by troops of the then-
ruling KMT in the name of calming social unrest -- as an incident of "state
violence, " Tien said the operations  of the 228 Memorial Foundation  are
necessary and imperative "to prevent similar tragedies from happening again and
to educate the people about the historical truth."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said her colleagues at the Legislative
Yuan decided to freeze the fund because they had decided the foundation's
operations "lack evident intent."</P>
      <P>Hung said the money should not have been allocated by the Ministry of Education
and that the few staff of the foundation each receive a monthly salary of
NT$50,000 "without doing anything."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hung quoted Ministry of Education officials as saying that the
foundation is "facilitating ethnic harmony in Taiwanese society." She noted that
"enhancing ethnic harmony" is already a policy of the Ministry of Education and
said the work has been done with or without the help of the 228 Memorial
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Hung claimed that the funds will "very likely" be used by the DPP before the
next presidential election slated for March 22 to "create more ethnic
divisions."</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a series of events in 1947 that led to a brutal
crackdown by the then-KMT government against the local population, particularly
the intelligentsia.</P>
      <P>It took place in a turbulent period of Taiwan's history. In 1945, the China-
based KMT government took over Taiwan -- which was at the time a Japanese colony
-- when Japan surrendered to the Allied forces. But the KMT's rule was brutal
and corrupt, leading to a massive protest Feb. 28, 1947, by the native
Taiwanese. More troops were sent from China to crush the demonstrators and in
the following months, soldiers arrested and killed thousands of people they
claimed were communists or saboteurs trying to overthrow the government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang called for the United States Thursday to
"trust in the wisdom" of the Taiwan people, saying they are capable of properly
handling a planned referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang, who is visiting the United States, made the remarks in a telephone
interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>His words came as the Taipei-based China Times reported that a high-ranking U.S.
official, possibly Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, might again reiterate
U.S. opposition to Taiwan's referendum on U.N. membership on Christmas Eve.</P>
      <P>Earlier  this month,  Thomas Christensen,  deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asia and Pacific affairs, described the planned referendum as "unwise."</P>
      <P>MOFA officials noted that the usually well-informed Nielsen Report recently
reported that China has pressured the United States to reiterate its stance on
Taiwan's planned referendum again, and that either President George W. Bush or
Rice could voice the opposition. But they said Taiwan was informed of similar
messages prior to the reports.</P>
      <P>Huang, in the CNA interview in New York, refused to comment on "speculative
reports."</P>
      <P>He said that whether in Taiwan or in the United States, he has conveyed Taiwan's
stance and that "no matter what level of U.S. official comments on the issue,
the stance will not change."</P>
      <P>Huang, who is in New York to meet with members of the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy, said communications with U.S. opinion leaders on
Taiwan's planned referendum will enhance their understanding of Taiwan's stance.</P>
      <P>Huang is scheduled to return to Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>China and the United States have expressed concern that the planned referendum
could be a step toward de jure Taiwan independence and a violation of President
Chen Shui-bian's "four noes" pledge, which includes no referendum on the
nation's status quo.</P>
      <P>But Chen has said that the planned referendum is a movement from the grassroots
and that he cannot buck the trend.</P>
      <P>On widespread international opinion that the U.N. bid might change the cross-
Taiwan Strait status quo, Chen said the status quo is that Taiwan is a sovereign
state and that its sovereignty lies with the people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not part of China, nor is it a province of China, and this fact is now
more clear to the international community, according to Chen.</P>

      <P>Hung Yi-chung was named the new manager of Taiwan's national baseball team for
the Olympic Qualifying tournament next year, a spokesman for the Chinese Taipei
Baseball Association (CTBA) announced Thursday in a press conference.</P>
      <P>Hung will replace Kuo Tai-yuan, who resigned Dec. 14 after Taiwan's subpar
performance in the previous tournaments. The pressure to win an Olympic seed
will fall on Hung's shoulder next March, when an eight-team qualifying
tournament will be held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan finished in eighth place in the Baseball World Cup and lost to Japan and
South Korea in the Asian Baseball Championship, failing to earn an automatic
seed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>The 46-year-old La New Bears head coach will need to turn in a top three finish
in the tournament, which will be held in Taichung and Yunlin from March 3-14,
2008, to earn the right to compete in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"We will do whatever it takes [to win a place at the Olympics], " said former
national team manager Hsu Sheng-ming, who served as the convener of CTBA's
Selection and Training Committee.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's roster for the tournament will have to be adjusted, CTBA Secretary-
General Lin Tsun-cheng said, adding that it's expected that none of the 40
players on the rosters of U.S. Major League teams next spring will be available

      <P>Teams participating in the qualifying tournament will include Taiwan, Australia,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) called for Taiwan's business people to be
on guard against the risks they may face when investing in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The SEF issued the warning upon its publication of a book on "risks Taiwan
business people cannot overlook when investing in China." The SEF is a quasi-
official body set up by Taiwan to handle civilian exchanges between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait in the absence of formal ties.</P>
      <P>The book contains the true stories of 36 Taiwanese business people who were
cheated, wronged, pressured, or even murdered after investing in China.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Hung Chi-chang noted that the investment environment in China has
undergone tremendous changes in recent years, citing the daunting challenges of
water shortages and electricity rationing in eastern and southern China.</P>
      <P>China's cut of export rebate rates for certain products, the unification of the
income tax system for domestic and foreign businesses, rising wages, as well as
the environmental protection policy for new businesses and the Labor Contract
Law -- which will come into effect next year -- have all increased operating
costs for enterprises and undercut their profit margins, according to Hung.</P>
      <P>But despite  the dramatic  changes  in China's  investment environment, Hung
said that tallies from the Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs show that investment in China has continued to rise in recent years.</P>
      <P>Even as the number of investment projects has decreased, the amount of money
flowing into any single investment project has continued to rise, showing that
the scale of investment has expanded.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said that the ratio of Taiwan's investment in China now constitutes
half of Taiwan's outbound investment, surpassing combined investments in Europe,
the United States, Japan and Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Hung said that if the "go west" investment trend is unstoppable, then those who
are keen to go must be vigilant as to the possible risks they will face once
they get there.</P>

      <P>Most of the Christmas products sold in Taipei's stores contain fluorescent
penetrant -- a whitening agent that may endanger human health, the Consumers'
Foundation warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Jen-hung, chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, told a press conference
that foundation workers conducted tests using ultraviolet light on 21 Christmas
products bought randomly from stores in Taipei and found that 20 of the samples
showed a fluorescent reaction.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that one of the products, a Christmas handbag, contains a "migratory
fluorescent substance" -- an even greater hazard to consumers if absorbed into
the body. The migratory fluorescent substance is known to be a cause of skin
allergies and cancer.</P>
      <P>Cheng urged related government agencies to regulate the use of fluorescent
penetrants as a whitening agent on a variety of products. He added that if
manufacturers are allowed to use fluorescent dyes, their products should carry
such discriptions so that consumers can exercise their right to choose safer
products.</P>

      <P>A high-ranking Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday that
shifts in the leaderships of two of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the South
Pacific are not expected to affect ties between Taiwan and the two countries.</P>
      <P>MOFA acting spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh made the remarks after both Prime Minister
Manasseh Sogavare of the Solomon Islands and President Ludwig Scotty of Nauru
were ousted recently in no-confidence votes by their parliaments, with new
leaders of the two countries being elected in the last few days.</P>
      <P>Sogavare was dismissed in a 25-22 no-confidence vote Dec. 13, and new Prime
Minister Derek Sikua was elected earlier Thursday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian immediately  sent a congratulatory message to Sikua,
expressing hope that the countries can further strengthen cooperative ties, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Sikua, who has served as minister of education and training,
has maintained a friendly attitude toward Taiwan and last visited Taiwan in
August 2006.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Scotty was ousted by more than half of the lawmakers in the Nauru
Parliament in a no-confidence vote Wednesday, with Marcus Stephen elected
immediately as the new president.</P>
      <P>Stephen has invited Taiwan's Ambassador Fu Cheng-kan to attend his inauguration
and has promised to continue strengthening relations with Taiwan, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Stephen is also familiar with Taiwan, having visited the country in March this
year. His newly appointed minister of foreign affairs Kieren Keke is the son of
Nauru's ambassador to Taiwan. Both of them are friendly toward Taiwan, according
to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that the political situations in the two countries are quite stable
now and that their new leaders have maintained cordial ties with Taiwan, adding
that bilateral cooperation projects will continue.</P>

      <P>Deutsche Bank A.G. has donated NT$1 million (US$30,760) to sponsor an online
reading program initiated by Fu Jen Catholic University (FJU) to help
disadvantaged students in central Taiwan, a bank spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came one day after James Wu, president of the bank, unveiled
the donation made through the Deutsche Bank Asia Foundation at a ceremony held
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the reading program, 300 FJU students will form online study
groups with elementary school students of 47 classes in remote areas of Miaoli
County and Miaoli City, said FJU President Bernard Li, who was also present at
the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Wu said Deutsche Bank attaches great importance to assisting disadvantaged
students all over the world and he expressed hope that the donation will help
the students read more, while calling on more college students to commit
themselves to doing charity work.</P>
      <P>Li for his part noted that the university launched the online reading program in
2006.</P>
      <P>Describing the collaboration project -- the first of its kind between a
university and a bank -- as a good model, Li said he hopes both sides can
further establish a virtual interactive learning network between university
students and primary students to bridge the digital divide between rural and
urban areas.</P>
      <P>Yang Te-yuan, principal of an elementary school in Miaoli City, said at the
ceremony that over the years, his school has set up Internet communities and
online study groups to promote reading among its students.</P>
      <P>However, due to insufficient numbers of teachers and books, the school's efforts
have failed to achieve results, Yang went on, adding that the Deutsche Bank-FJU
collaboration this year will effectively address such problems and arouse
students' interest in reading.</P>

pastimes of over 90 percent of children living in the greater Taipei area,
results of a public opinion poll showed Thursday.</P>
      <P>The poll conducted by Kentucky Fried Chicken Taiwan found that 56.2 percent of
children living in Taipei City, Taipei County and Keelung City pass their free
time by watching television.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted between Dec. 7-16 by telephone, found that 37.6 percent of

      <P>Less than 1 percent of the children in the area read, paint, write calligraphy,

      <P>A high 84.8 percent of parents responding to the survey believe that playing

26 percent of parents could afford to keep their children company. A majority of
these parents could only lament over the situation, and could not do anything to
improve the situation.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of responding parents also believe that reading Chinese
classical literature to their children will help in the child's mental

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday that a large proportion of new
government policies launched in the past half year are aimed at improving the
welfare of the middle and working classes, denying recent claims that the
government has failed to attach sufficient importance to these segments of
society, many of whom are having difficulty making ends meet.</P>
      <P>Chang also said a number of bills proposed by the government to improve people's
livelihoods are under review by lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came after a Ministry of the Interior official delivered a
report on the results of government measures for the middle and working classes
at a regular Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>He said that in recent years, the government has paid greater attention to the
needs of the people by allocating resources for financial aid, increasing the
employment rate and improving health care.</P>
      <P>In addition, it has made efforts to improve law and order and to offer
educational assistance to students from disadvantaged families, he went on.</P>
      <P>During his second term as premier from May this year, Chang said, he has striven

      <P>Chang previously served as premier from 2000 to 2002.</P>
      <P>He noted that several bills and amendments related to the renovation of
agricultural villages, insurance for laborers and social assistance have been

      <P>He added that the Cabinet has asked its ministries to step up efforts to
negotiate with lawmakers to pass the bills and amendments over the next few days
prior to the end of the current legislature's last session.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that in order to realize President Chen Shui-bian's new policy
declared May 14 to take care of the middle and working classes, the government
has raised the minimum wage and has been helping disadvantaged job seekers
during the past six months.</P>
      <P>The government further proposed plans to extend compulsory education from nine

    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea's just-concluded presidential poll has proved that the economy was
the core issue for voters there, that the public was disgusted with dirty tricks
used in the elections and that they keenly hoped for a transfer of power, main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at KMT headquarters, where he and his running mate, Vincent
Siew, launched a TV election campaign advertisement.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the three factors that helped former Hyundai CEO and former
Seoul Mayor Lee Myung-bak win a landslide victory in Wednesday's presidential
election also can be found in Taiwan in the runup to the March 22 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Although South Korea has in recent years performed much better than Taiwan in
economic terms, Ma said that South Koreans' growing discontent with the economic
situation over the past five years under the rule of President Roh Moon-hyun,
along with his ideological strife and the dirty tricks used by the ruling party
in the election were what led to Lee's electoral victory.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, it is "obvious" that over the past seven years, only rich people have
benefited from the country's economic expansion, Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>According to Siew, South Koreans chose Lee because of his past achievements,
execution and vision, and now he needs to take action to make good on his
election promises. The South Korean presidential election should provide
Taiwan's people with an opportunity to reflect on their own country's present
situation, he added.</P>
      <P>In the TV presidential campaign advertisement, Ma and Siew appeal for "a strong
Taiwan with a global presence." Hailing the Taiwan people's honesty, diligence
and pragmatism, the pair promised that if elected, they will lead Taiwan onto
the world stage, as Taiwan cannot afford to further idle away its time and
further undermine its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan should take advantage of its strategic location at the center of
East Asia to sharpen its competitiveness and added that the country must not
"remain in seclusion and shut its doors to the rest of the world."</P>
      <P>Taiwan should boost cooperation with China to seek breakthroughs in the fierce
regional competition -- something Ma described as an essential part of
reinvigorating the country's economy.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday that a planned
referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan is an
expression of the collective will of Taiwan's people, and urged China and the
United States to heed their voice.</P>
      <P>The MAC's appeal was contained in a six-point statement amid reports that a U.S.
ranking official may reiterate Washington's opposition to the planned referendum
following remarks by Thomas Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state for
East Asia and Pacific affairs, characterizing the plan as "unwise."</P>
      <P>The MAC said that to seek U.N. membership under the name Taiwan is the
aspiration and legitimate right of the 23 million people of Taiwan, saying it
will show the collective will and resolution of Taiwan to join the international
community.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that China's hostile approach towards Taiwan has antagonized the
people, noting that Beijing has blocked Taiwan's democratic development,
obstructed its efforts to join international organizations, and has attempted to
mislead the international community by saying that the planned referendum is
tantamount to "de jure" independence.</P>
      <P>The MAC also said that Washington's tilt toward Beijing in its policy will
affect peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and hurt the feelings of
Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a sovereign, independent county and has never been a part of People's
Republic of China, the MAC said, and the United States, as the leader of
democratic world, should support Taiwan's democracy instead of listening to the
rhetoric of an authoritarian country, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>The MAC urged China and the United States to stop suppressing Taiwan and listen
closely to the will of its people to pursue democracy, saying that their
resolution to pursue democracy will not fail under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>The MAC concluded by calling for the U.S. to safeguard Taiwan in order to
promote change in China, noting that this year marks the 20th anniversary of
cross-strait exchanges, that the world has witnessed the tremendous changes
taking place in China, and that Taiwan  has been one of the driving  forces
behind  China's transformation.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that Taiwan's process towards and experience of democracy can serve
as references as China moves toward democracy.</P>

      <P>Asserting that in accordance with the law, the local governments' rights to hold
elections and prepare the polling stations must be fully respected to ensure a
smooth and orderly election,  Ma encouraged local election commissions to choose
the method they believe best to organize the approaching legislative and
presidential elections and polling stations.</P>
      <P>Ma gave his assurances that local election commission officials will not be
breaking the law by doing so and stressed that it is necessary that elections be
held smoothly and orderly.</P>
      <P>Ma's comments came amid a fierce dispute between the central and some local
governments over the voting procedure in the legislative and presidential
elections, slated for Jan. 12 and March 22, 2008, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has repeatedly said that all 25 cities and counties around
the country must adopt a "one-step" voting format designed by the Central
Election Commission (CEC) for the two elections -- each to be accompanied by two
referendums, while 18 KMT-controlled localities, including Taipei City, insist
on applying a "two-step" scheme out of concern over chaos in the voting process.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said Wednesday that
local election commission chiefs will be replaced if they continue to reject the
"one-step" voting method, and claimed that the Executive Yuan is set to act on
the matter.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung announced Tuesday that if the coming two polls
are held using a "two-step" scheme in some localities, the legitimacy of the
results will have to be determined jointly by the CEC members within one week of
the polling day. "Only results confirmed by the CEC are valid," he said.</P>
      <P>In response to increased pressure from the Executive Yuan, Ma asserted that the
courts, not the CEC, have the authority to annul an election.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin said later the same day following a meeting with
KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan that the city will remain firm on its decision
to use the "two-step" voting method in the coming polls.</P>
      <P>Lien, a political science expert, also backs the municipal election commission's
stance to employ the "two-step" format, Hau said, adding that he has not heard
of different views in this regard from other KMT-controlled cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu questioned how the Executive Yuan or GIO could
speak for the CEC, an independent organization, concerning electoral affairs.</P>
      <P>Hu voiced his grave concerns that if ranking officials continue meddling in CEC
affairs, it will seriously affect the normal operations of the approaching
polls.</P>
      <P>Later the same day, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution demanding that the
CEC not refuse to allocate budgets to its local branches which have decided to
hold the two elections in a "two-step" voting method, rather than the CEC-
prescribed "one-step" format.</P>
      <P>The legislature approved the resolution while screening the 2008 central
government budgetary bill.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers also adopted another resolution mandating reparations from government
agencies which used some of their own budgets to help finance a GIO
advertisement promoting Taiwan's bid to push for U. N. membership.</P>
      <P>In line with the resolution, government agencies must repay funds they used to
help finance GIO ads in local media calling for Taiwan's U.N. membership. If
they refuse to do so, they would face prosecution and have to assume relevant
responsibilities, the resolution said.</P>
      <P>Two referendums aimed at pursuing the country's U.N. membership in the name of
Taiwan and seeking to have the country re-enter the world body as the Republic
of China will be held along with the March 22 presidential election. They were
called by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the KMT, respectively.</P>

      <P>The government will absolutely not tolerate the adoption of a "two-step" voting
format proposed by opposition Kuomintang-controlled local governments in
defiance of the Central Election Commission's (CEC's) resolution to adopt a
"one-step" voting procedure in the upcoming elections, Government Information
Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey re-affirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Noting that maintaining the rule of law and social stability is one of the
government's basic principles, Shieh said that as the CEC decided to use the
"one-step" procedure in accordance with the law, the government will absolutely
not allow the use of the illegal "two-step" format in the Jan. 12 legislative
elections and the March 22 presidential poll to avoid causing possible social
unrest and election upheaval.</P>
      <P>Shieh said that a situation of "one country, two systems" that pits the central
government against local governments in elections has never occurred over the
past 50 years in Taiwan and that the government will not tolerate the adoption
of two different voting formats in the coming elections.</P>
      <P>Shieh warned that if electoral officials in opposition-controlled local
governments  publicly  declare that they will adopt the "two-step" voting format
for the polls,  the CEC can appoint surrogates to replace them according to
Articles 7 and 8 of the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, as well as
Article 153 of the Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>Adding that the CEC is the only legitimate agency in charge of central elections
and electoral affairs, Shieh said the government will follow the CEC's "one-
step" voting format decision without exception.</P>
      <P>He added that an inter-ministerial task force consisting of experts and
officials from the CEC, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Justice
and the National Police Agency has been formed to study in advance any possible
scenarios that could sabotage the elections so as to prevent and deter any
illegal activities.</P>

      <P>A television documentary to premiere Dec. 23 reveal the story of the Kinmen
islands, the Taiwanese territory which is only two miles off the coast of China
and whose history has been often forgotten or unknown, an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Given how many shells Kinmen has taken for Taiwan in the past, it's time for
Taiwan and people around the world to better to understand the island, " said
Yang Chung-chuan, deputy magistrate of Kinmen County, in a press conference to
announce the premiere of "Unknown Kinmen, " a documentary produced by the
Discovery Channel.</P>
      <P>The documentary attempts to explore the islands, which have been described as
the "Asian Gibraltar" because of its unique strategic position, through its
culture, architecture and history, said Tommy Lin, vice president and general
manager of Discovery Networks Asia's Taiwan Office.</P>
      <P>Kinmen experienced extensive shelling from China in 1958, when it was hit by
more than 470,000 artillery shells in the span of 44 days. Over the following 20
years, it was hit by another 500,000 non-lethal shells containing propaganda
materials, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The experience still lingers in the minds of senior citizens, but the former
military  preserve  needs to move forward  because development on Kinmen was
extremely limited during the period of military rule, Yang said.</P>
      <P>People in Kinmen did benefit somewhat from the war as nowadays it is famous for
its knives, which are made from artillery shells, Yang said. The return to a
civilian government in the 1990s and the launch of the Mini Three Links six
years ago, which have brought many Taiwanese business people to the islands,
dramatically changed the face of Kinmen's economy, he added.</P>
      <P>"Now we thrive on the development of tourism, " he noted.</P>

      <P>Health officials at the Pingtung County government confirmed a case of imported
malaria Thursday, saying that the patient is a 35-year-old man who contracted
the disease during an overseas trip.</P>
      <P>The officials at the county government's Public Health Bureau said the patient,
whose name was not disclosed, stayed in New Guinea on business from Nov. 25 to
Dec. 15 and developed symptoms of malaria after returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although the patient took some non-prescription medicines, his condition did not
improve. He then sought help from a hospital, where a test confirmed that he had
contracted vivax malaria, the most common of four human malaria species.</P>
      <P>Vivax malaria is caused by Plasmodium  vivax that induces paroxysms of chills
and fever at 48-hour intervals. Other symptoms include headache, weakness,
vomiting and diarrhea.</P>
      <P>The disease is rarely fatal, but relapses often occur months to years after
treatment because the parasites can remain dormant in the patient's liver cells,
evading the body's defence system and the most commonly used drugs.</P>
      <P>Health officials pointed out that malaria is most prevalent in Southeast Asia,
South Asia, West Africa, North Africa, Central and South America, and Oceania.</P>
      <P>They suggested that people who plan to travel to those areas take precautionary
measures to avoid mosquito bites or take anti-malarial drugs.</P>

      <P>The newly amended Gender Equality Employment Law, extending maternity and
parental leave benefits, is expected to benefit more than 5 million local
workers, an official of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came one day after the Legislative Yuan passed the third and
final reading of the amendments to the act, making it the first time the
legislature has amended the act since its implementation March 8, 2002.</P>
      <P>Under the amended act, all employers must allow their employees to take parental
leave, without salary, yet retain their positions, which will benefit an
estimated 3.14 million workers, the CLA official explained.</P>
      <P>Companies hiring over five employees must grant family care leave to their
employees, which is expected to help 1.81 million workers, the official noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the amendments increase paternity leave from two days to three days
and forbid employers from refusing their employees to take paternity leave, the
official said, forecasting that 70,000 workers will benefit from this amendment
every year.</P>
      <P>The amendments stipulate new penalties for employers who refuse to allow their
employees to take menstrual leave, maternity leave, and family care leave, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Employers will also be fined if they do not allow their employees to hold their
positions, without salary, during parental leave, to breast feed at work, or to
reduce or adjust working hours, the official noted.</P>
      <P>In response to criticisms that previous penalties under the act were
insufficient, the amendments have raised the range of penalties from
NT$10,000(US$308) -NT$100,000 to NT$100,000-NT$500,000, the official added.
Meanwhile, the CLA will soon propose complementary measures to address the
concerns of local small and medium-sized enterprises about the possible impact
of providing employees with two-year-long parental on company operations, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The measures will also help address the tendency of local employers to hire
fewer women to avoid the possible impact of maternity leave, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) has begun to promote
babysitting services within local communities, and plans to offer subsidies in
the future.</P>
      <P>In the future, employees will be able to seek assistance and legal counselling
from local labor and social bureaus if they are laid off or unable to retain
their positions due to leave taking, the official noted.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will come up with a list of candidates for the National
Communications Commission (NCC) by the end of January and refer it to the
legislature for confirmation, government spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks after the Legislative Yuan finally passed an amendment to
Article 4 of the NCC Organic Law earlier in the day regarding the independent
media regulatory body's composition.</P>
      <P>The original provision stipulated that the NCC should be composed of 13 members
recommended by major political parties in proportion to the number of seats they
hold in the legislature. The controversial provision, passed in 2005, was later
declared unconstitutional by the Council of Grand Justices on the grounds that
it infringed upon the power of the executive branch.</P>
      <P>After nearly two years of haggling between ruling and opposition parties, a
compromise was finally worked out to end the controversy, with both camps making
a concession.</P>
      <P>While the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) agreed to drop its partisan "proportional
representation" principle concerning the NCC setup, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) gave the green light to refer the premier-proposed
nomination list to the legislature for sanction.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law, the number of NCC commissioners is cut to seven from 13,
and their term of office will be extended from three years to four years. The
premier will have full power to decide the nomination list, but the appointment
is subject to legislative approval. The amended act does not set any ceiling on
the number of terms an individual commissioner is allowed to serve.</P>
      <P>According to Sheih, requiring legislative confirmation for the NCC nomination
still constitutes an infringement upon the power of the executive branch,
Nevertheless, he said, the DPP administration is willing to accept such an
arrangement now that the opposition no longer insisted on its unconstitutional
principle.</P>
      <P>The incumbent NCC commissioners  reaffirmed  Thursday their determination to
step down from the post Jan. 31 as they promised after the grand justices ruled
that the media watchdog's formation was unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>As the new legislators to be elected Jan. 12 will not take office until Feb. 1,
the appointment of new NCC commissioners is not expected to be finalized before
the departure of their predecessors. Shieh said the Executive Yuan will make
every possible efforts to ensure the NCC operates normally during its personnel
transition period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The China Steel Corp. (CSC) board of directors resolved Thursday to invest some
US$293 million to jointly build with foreign counterparts a large steel mill in
Vietnam as part of its effort to grab a piece of Vietnam's growing market for
steel products.</P>
      <P>The CSC board directors decided to channel US$293 million into Vietnam for an
investment project that would include other investors, including Japan's
Sumitomo Metal, to jointly build a large steel mill that would initially cost
US$1.15 billion.</P>
      <P>Commercial production at the planned steel mill is scheduled to begin in 2011,
with an annual capacity of 1.7 million tons of steel products, including hot-
pressed steel rolls, said Chung Lo-min, a CSC deputy CEO.</P>
      <P>Noting that the demand for steel products has grown rapidly in Vietnam and other
Indochinese countries in recent years, Chung said the investment will not only
help CSC expand its exports to these countries, bypassing tariff barriers, but
also help CSC gain a niche in the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).</P>

      <P>A childhood education expert said Thursday that children could grow smarter
through meaningful play, suggesting parents to spend more time in significant
play with their children.</P>
      <P>Su Lan made the suggestion after a survey conducted by Kentucky Fried Chicken
(KFC) Taiwan found that most of the children in the greater Taipei metropolitan
area focus their entertainment  on television, computer and video games.</P>
      <P>Noting that many Taiwanese parents do not know how to play, not to mention how
to educate their children through play, Su suggested that parents stimulate the
potential of their children by spending more time in meaningful play with their
children, such as games focused on the continuation of a story told by the other
person.</P>
      <P>Su once asked some children what is the most important thing in their life, some
answered time, the other mentioned wisdom, while one child said loudly "eating
and playing."</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Su told the children that it is not easy
to have fun while eating and playing in a meaningful way, and encouraged them to
dedicate more energy to significant things.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Amended employment act to benefit millions of workers: CLA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly amended Gender Equality Employment Law, extending maternity and
parental leave benefits, is expected to benefit more than 5 million local
workers, an official of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came one day after the Legislative Yuan passed the third and
final reading of the amendments to the act, making it the first time the
legislature has amended the act since its implementation March 8, 2002.</P>
      <P>Under the amended act, all employers must allow their employees to take parental
leave, without salary, yet retain their positions, which will benefit an
estimated 3.14 million workers, the CLA official explained.</P>
      <P>Companies hiring over five employees must grant family care leave to their
employees, which is expected to help 1.81 million workers, the official noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the amendments increase paternity leave from two days to three days
and forbid employers from refusing their employees to take paternity leave, the
official said, forecasting that 70,000 workers will benefit from this amendment
every year.</P>
      <P>The amendments stipulate new penalties for employers who refuse to allow their
employees to take menstrual leave, maternity leave, and family care leave, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Employers will also be fined if they do not allow their employees to hold their
positions, without salary, during parental leave, to breast feed at work, or to
reduce or adjust working hours, the official noted.</P>
      <P>In response to criticisms that previous penalties under the act were
insufficient, the amendments have raised the range of penalties from
NT$10,000(US$308) -NT$100,000 to NT$100,000-NT$500,000, the official added.
Meanwhile, the CLA will soon propose complementary measures to address the
concerns of local small and medium-sized enterprises about the possible impact
of providing employees with two-year-long parental on company operations, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The measures will also help address the tendency of local employers to hire
fewer women to avoid the possible impact of maternity leave, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Ministry of Interior (MOI) has begun to promote
babysitting services within local communities, and plans to offer subsidies in
the future.</P>
      <P>In the future, employees will be able to seek assistance and legal counselling
from local labor and social bureaus if they are laid off or unable to retain
their positions due to leave taking, the official noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Executive Yuan to unveil NCC nomination list by end of January</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
12/21/07  10:38:49

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will come up with a list of candidates for the National
Communications Commission (NCC) by the end of January and refer it to the
legislature for confirmation, government spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks after the Legislative Yuan finally passed an amendment to
Article 4 of the NCC Organic Law earlier in the day regarding the independent
media regulatory body's composition.</P>
      <P>The original provision stipulated that the NCC should be composed of 13 members
recommended by major political parties in proportion to the number of seats they
hold in the legislature. The controversial provision, passed in 2005, was later
declared unconstitutional by the Council of Grand Justices on the grounds that
it infringed upon the power of the executive branch.</P>
      <P>After nearly two years of haggling between ruling and opposition parties, a
compromise was finally worked out to end the controversy, with both camps making
a concession.</P>
      <P>While the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) agreed to drop its partisan "proportional
representation" principle concerning the NCC setup, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) gave the green light to refer the premier-proposed
nomination list to the legislature for sanction.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law, the number of NCC commissioners is cut to seven from 13,
and their term of office will be extended from three years to four years. The
premier will have full power to decide the nomination list, but the appointment
is subject to legislative approval. The amended act does not set any ceiling on
the number of terms an individual commissioner is allowed to serve.</P>
      <P>According to Sheih, requiring legislative confirmation for the NCC nomination
still constitutes an infringement upon the power of the executive branch,
Nevertheless, he said, the DPP administration is willing to accept such an
arrangement now that the opposition no longer insisted on its unconstitutional
principle.</P>
      <P>The incumbent NCC commissioners  reaffirmed  Thursday their determination to
step down from the post Jan. 31 as they promised after the grand justices ruled
that the media watchdog's formation was unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>As the new legislators to be elected Jan. 12 will not take office until Feb. 1,
the appointment of new NCC commissioners is not expected to be finalized before
the departure of their predecessors. Shieh said the Executive Yuan will make
every possible efforts to ensure the NCC operates normally during its personnel
transition period.</P>

      <P>Approved inbound investment by overseas companies amounted to US$12.93 billion
for the first 10 months of this year, according to a report on Taiwan's latest
economic situation released Thursday by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The report noted that inbound foreign investment hit a record high of US$13.97
billion for 2006, with the annual value averaging US$5.69 billion during the
2001-2006 period, twice as much as the average annual value of US$2.85 billion
during the 1993-1999 period.</P>
      <P>Referring to the World Investment Report 2007 released by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development, CEPD officials said Taiwan's inward foreign
direct investment ranked 31st among the 218 economies surveyed in 2006, a leap
of 31 notches from the previous year.</P>
      <P>For the first 10 months of 2007, Taiwan's exports increased 9 percent year-on-
year to US$201.4 billion and imports rose 7 percent year-on-year to US$180.5

growth of 4.8 percent  for next year,  control the unemployment rate at 3.8
percent or below, and keep the inflation rate at below 2 percent, the report
said.</P>
      <P>The report noted that Taiwan's national fixed investment averaged NT$2.46

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Chinese spouses of Taiwan nationals, accompanied by members of a
social activists group, lodged their protests Friday against the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration over what they called "declining human
rights" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Several unnamed Chinese spouses said at a news conference held at the National
Immigration Agency that they hoped to adapt to their new lives in Taiwan as soon
as possible after marrying their Taiwan husbands, but unreasonable policies --
including the interview policy upon arrival,  long waiting  period  for ROC
citizenship  and restrictions on working in Taiwan -- have made their lives in
Taiwan increasingly difficult.</P>
      <P>Members  of  the  private  Chunghua  Cross-Strait  Marriage Consultation
Association, which sponsored the news conference, called for the DPP
administration to respect those basic rights for the Chinese spouses.</P>
      <P>Association members said that since the Republic of China government opened the
door to cross-strait marriages in 1987, mainland Chinese spouses living in
Taiwan have endured extremely unfair treatment in terms of their daily lives and
their status in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They said that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) -- Taiwan's official China
policy planning body -- even proposed in 2002 that the waiting period for
Chinese spouses to obtain ROC citizenship being prolonged from eight years to 11
years. The proposal was later dropped under protest from advocacy groups.
Nevertheless, the MAC then imposed a quota system for their citizenship
application, the Chinese spouses complained.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration has also launched an interview policy in recent years to
screen inbound Chinese spouses with questions that were considered by objective
observers as infringing on their privacy, they noted.</P>
      <P>They added that in June this year, the Ministry of the Interior publicized a new
demography white paper, in which quotas for Chinese spouses to obtain legal
residency were further restricted. As a result, they said, all quotas for
Chinese spouses settling in Taiwan, for short or long term stays, were limited
substantially.</P>
      <P>In addition, they continued to say, Chinese spouses of Taiwanese nationals
intending to visit the country for the first time after their marriage have,
since Sept. 1, been required to produce properly verified clean bills of health
issued by state-run hospitals, legally licensed private hospitals or university-
affiliated hospitals and certified by an officially designated Chinese notary
agency.</P>
      <P>The clean bill of health must also be certified by Taiwan's quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation to prove the document's validity, they added.</P>
      <P>Currently, according to the association, there are more than 250,000 mainland
Chinese spouses living in Taiwan, with only some 30,000 of them having received
their ROC IDs.</P>

      <P>Most of Taiwan's people view Taiwan as an independent nation and the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should have no reason to block the country's bid to
join world bodies if it agrees with that view, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) presidential hopeful Frank Hsieh said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the comments to reporters while presiding over a news conference
marking the launch of creative works of art in support of his presidential
campaign at his headquarter office.</P>
      <P>Stressing that "we should have confidence in pushing the country to enter the
international community, and to embark on concrete actions immediately to
safeguard our own interests and national dignity, "Hsieh said that "we must not
leave these tasks to the next generation."</P>
      <P>Commenting on a news report that the United States will again air its objections
to the DPP administration's holding a referendum on seeking the country's U.N.
membership in the name of Taiwan, Hsieh said that he was not at all surprised to
hear the news because U. S. President George W. Bush was reportedly planing to
do so during this year's summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum in September in Australia.</P>
      <P>Bush did not do so on that occasion, but several senior U.S. officials already
spoke out against Taiwan's U.N. referendum plan.</P>
      <P>"The European Union and the United States oppose Taiwan's U.N. membership bid to
further their own interests, which owe much to China's growing might," Hsieh
said, adding, however, that he was more astonished to hear opposition from
within Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on a reference  to Taiwan  as "an independent sovereignty" by
Vincent Siew, KMT vice presidential candidate, in his new book, Hsieh said that
this is the mainstream public opinion in Taiwan and questioned why Siew has
failed to recognize the fact in public.</P>
      <P>If the KMT really believes that Taiwan is an independent sovereignty, then the
party should not drag its feet on the government's efforts to pursue Taiwan's
representation at world bodies -- something which Hsieh said is extremely unfair
and deterrent to the country.</P>
      <P>"Every citizen should speak up for Taiwan, and the country needs more people to
speak for it," he asserted.</P>

      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) officials described Friday an air traffic
incident involving a Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) passenger aircraft as a
mystery after completing a probe into the Dec. 9 cabin-door incident.</P>
      <P>According to a local newspaper report, the Boeing 747 airplane was found having
an unlocked cabin door after taking off from the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport on route to Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>For safety concern, the plane returned to the airport for an urgent check after
the flight staff failed to fix the problem which saw the problematic cabin door
remain locked, as the staff have claimed, but continue to make strange noises.</P>
      <P>After a security check, the flight again took off from the Taoyuan airport, four
hours behind schedule, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In response to media inquiries Friday, the CAA officials said CAL informed the
CAA of the incident on that same day, and that a check on the problematic plane
that day found no signs of mechanical problems with the cabin door, nor
electronic problems with devices designed to display mechanical warnings.</P>
      <P>CAA technicians asserted that no pilot would let an aircraft take off when they
were uncertain as to whether all the cabin doors were tightly locked.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Dec. 9 incident, experts said that they have found the airplane's
electronic system did give warning of the problem with the cabin door before the
plane took off.</P>
      <P>Their probe into the actions of CAL air kitchen personnel responsible for the
meals on the Dec. 9 Taipei-Los Angeles flight -- those stationed nearest the
problematic door -- also found that the door was properly closed, the CAA
officials noted, adding the entire incident is mysterious.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the administration has completed the probe and concluded that
the case is not an air security-threatening incident and that therefore, there
will be no punishment over the incident.</P>
      <P>CAL apologized to passengers on the problematic airplane but underlined that the
company has addressed the event in a proper manner.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) will present a substantial
plan next month to push for the establishment of a World Environment
Organization (WEO), EPA Minister Winston Dang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Dang, reacting to a proposal put forth by President Chen Shui-bian in May
calling for the formation of the WEO, said the EPA met with environmentalists
and academics in November to discuss the issue and held seminars this month to
facilitate further discussions.</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting the establishment of the WEO, the EPA's policy
objectives over the next five years also include reducing the percentage of days
with poor air quality to below 1.5 percent by 2011 and improving the water
quality of five urban rivers in Taipei County, Keelung City, Tainan County,
Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County, Dang said.</P>
      <P>Also, the EPA will continue encouraging the use of dual-fuel cars, with the goal
of seeing the number of this type of vehicle increase to 150,000 and the number
of liquefied petroleum gas filling stations rise to 150 over the next five
years, he said.</P>

      <P>Ruling and opposition legislators traded barbs again Friday over the voting
format for legislative and presidential elections after the Legislative Yuan
passed a resolution to adopt the "two-step" system in defiance of the Central
Election Commission's (CEC's) decision.</P>
      <P>The legislature passed a resolution Thursday, 102-92, proposed by main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) that the "two-step" system should be adopted when
voting on the central government's budget for next year. According to the
resolution, the CEC, which decided to adopt a "one-step" system last month,
cannot refuse to appropriate funds to the local election commissions for
conducting the two major elections and referendums in "two-step" voting system.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, KMT legislator and the party's executive director of Policy
Committee, said that if the CEC ignores the resolution, insists on carrying out
"one-stage" voting format for the elections and referendums, or even run ads to
intimidate civil servants, then the KMT legislative caucus will file a
malfeasance charge against the CEC.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, convener of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
legislative caucus, said that if the legislature forces the CEC to adopt a "two-
step" system, it will be a violation of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Ker said that the KMT, which cited the interpretation of the grand justices to
say that budget bill passed by the legislature should be considered as a law,
but the grand justices are referring to the budget bill itself and not the
resolutions attached to it.</P>
      <P>He said that the Legislative  Yuan should  abide  by the government's "division
of the power" principle,  otherwise the Executive Yuan will be reduced to an
administrative bureau of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ker pointed out that any resolutions passed during the vote on the budget of the
central government will be invalid if they violate the Constitution.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan can take the view of the legislature as a reference, but the
KMT legislative caucus should not necessarily assume that it will be valid," Ker
said.</P>
      <P>Under the "one-step" voting format, voters will receive two ballots for the
legislative elections and the two referendum ballots at different desks, then
cast them into four different boxes.</P>
      <P>Eighteen KMT-controlled localities have insisted that they will use the "two-
step" format under which voters will receive and cast referendum ballots only
after they have cast their ballots for the legislative elections, claiming that
the "one-step" format could cause confusion and chaos during the voting process.</P>
      <P>The CEC and the 18 local election commission have continued to bicker over the
voting system despite the fact that the Jan. 12 legislative elections and two
referendums are drawing near.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't to address grievances of Chinese spouses</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) said Friday that it will conduct a
thorough review after Chinese spouses of Taiwanese nationals complained about
their plight in Taiwan, singling out for attention the inefficient interview
system among others.</P>
      <P>NIA officials pledged to address their grievances to promote the well-being of
cross-strait marriages after the private Chunghua Cross-Strait Marriage
Consultation Association led a number of Chinese spouses of Taiwanese nationals
to the agency to appeal for better treatment.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that after the interview mechanism kicked off in Sept. 1,
2003, the locations for conducting the interviews were limited to Taipei,
Taichung, Kaohsiung, Hualien, Kinmen and Matsu, with the waiting period
averaging between two and three months.</P>
      <P>But after the launch of the agency early this year, the locations at which
interviews might be conducted has increased dramatically to 25. Except for
Taipei City, Taipei County, and Taoyuan County, where the number of inbound
spouses is large (accounting for half of the inbound  spouses  of the nation)
and the waiting  period is comparatively longer -- by around one and a half
months -- waits for an interview in all other cities and counties are typically
less than one month, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The reports of "each interviewee having to wait for three months or more" are
unfounded, they clarified.</P>
      <P>On the regulations requiring the provision of a financial statement, officials
also explained that all Chinese spouses of Taiwanese nationals have to be
interviewed, but whether they have to provide a financial statement is decided
on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>They explained that when Chinese spouses enter Taiwan, they will not have a work
permit issued by the Council of Labor Affairs, and will, therefore, be unable to
work, meaning that Taiwanese nationals have to shoulder burden of providing
their living expenses.</P>
      <P>Although the NIA will ask their Taiwanese spouses to provide a financial status
statement, that will not be the only basis for approving entry as the statement
will "only be one of the references to check the marriage is real and not a
marriage of convenience," the officials said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the financial status statement will not be confined to deposits only,
officials said, adding that monthly wages, tax returns, real estate and other
sources can all serve to prove that Taiwanese nationals are capable of
supporting their Chinese spouses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On a suggestion by association members that the agency revise the regulations on
the interview system and the long-stay of Chinese spouses, the agency said that
related draft revisions were sent to the Executive Yuan for approval this
October.</P>
      <P>They also said that revisions to regulations governing long-stays by Chinese
spouses have been largely worked out, noting that Chinese spouses who have long-
stay certificates in Taiwan could apply to settle down in Taiwan and obtain
identification cards if their Taiwanese spouses die during their long-stay and
they have not remarried within five years of their deaths.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate stood at 3.87 percent for November, down 0.05
percentage points month-on-month but up 0.01 percentage points year-on-year,
according to tallies released Friday by the Directorate  General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>For the first 11 months of this year, the average unemployment rate increased
0.01 percentage points year-on-year to 3.92 percent, DGBAS officials said,

period hit their second-lowest level for the past seven years.</P>
      <P>In November, the number of jobless workers totaled 417,000, down 4,000 from
October but up 7,000 over the same month last year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>While the number of first-time job seekers who failed to find a job dropped by
1,000, the number of people who quit their jobs declined by 3,000. The number of
people who lost their jobs because of the termination of seasonal or temporary

      <P>Hope for "a bigger pie" and a better economy was why South Koreans voted for
President-elect Lee Myung-bak, who is expected to have little room to adopt a
new Taiwan policy, local and South Korean academics said Friday in a forum.</P>
      <P>"South Korea's economy has been doing O.K. in general, but the past regimes
focused too much on wealth distribution and social welfare in their socialistic
economic policies. People tended to see these policies as a failure, " said
Taeho Bark, chairman of the Korea International Trade Commission and a professor
at Seoul National University.</P>
      <P>The annual Taipei-Seoul Forum was held two days after the presidential election
in South Korea concluded with a landslide victory for Lee Myung-bak, who
garnered 48.7 percent of the votes, putting him 22 percentage points ahead of
his closest rival, Chung Dong-young.</P>
      <P>Economic issues proved to be the deciding factor in the election, Bark said, as
"the rich are not getting richer but the poor are getting poorer in Korea." He
said that while the country enjoys substantial economic growth, it's still
difficult for university graduates to find jobs, while established corporations
such as Samsung have been neglecting the domestic market.</P>
      <P>That is why people want a more liberal economy and expect Lee, a former mayor of
Seoul and chief executive of Hyundai Construction Co., to "make the pie bigger,
" he added.</P>
      <P>As Lee is expected to make mending fences with the United States his top
diplomatic priority, the forum participants said there will be little room for
him to adopt a new policy on Taiwan, given the current Northeast Asian
international order, said Lee Ming, a professor at National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>Ron Moo-hyun, the incumbent president, is seen as a leader driven by his
ideology, including anti-Americanism, while Lee is seen as more of a pragmatist
who can solve problems, said Kim Sunhyuk, director of the Global Leadership
Development Center of Korea University.</P>
      <P>"Voters chose pragmatism over ideology in this election, " agreed Lee Dong-bak,
president of the North Korea Democratization Forum and a former member of South
Korea's National Assembly.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that South Korean electorate had already decided two years ago
that they would vote for the Grand National Party, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>The two-day forum, which was organized by the Institute of International
Relations of National Chengchi University and the Seoul Forum for International
Affairs, will continue Saturday with three sessions to discuss the new phase of
Taiwan-South Korean relations and regional development in East Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND to shut down late presidents' mausoleums Monday</HEADLINE>

      <P>The administration of the mausoleums of the late presidents  Chiang Kai-shek and
Chiang Ching-kuo formally notified the Taoyuan county government Friday that it
will close the mausoleums from Monday in preparation for management transfer.</P>
      <P>The Tashi Mausoleum Administration, which is under the Ministry of National
Defense (MND), said the shutdown is to pave the way for the withdrawal of
military guards posted at the two mausoleums, located in the county's Tashi
township, and a check and inventory of the assets and artifacts before turning
them over to the Taoyuan county government.</P>
      <P>As droves of people have come to the mausoleums over the past few days in
anticipation of the impending closure, Tashi township chief Su Wen-sheng said
the decision to shut them down is "rash."</P>
      <P>Su said the town has benefited from the mausoleums, noting that visitors and the
business opportunities they bring -- such as sales of the town's famous bean
curd, amount to an annual revenue of more than NT$400 million (US$12.35
million).</P>
      <P>Su said the government's decision to close the mausoleums in such a short time
could harm the town's business.</P>
      <P>However, Taoyuan county government officials said that after the county
government takes over the management of the mausoleums, it will inject more
cultural factors to make them even more attractive to visitors.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said earlier this month that the military guards posted
at the mausoleums will be withdrawn from the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>Branding the elder Chiang a dictator, Chen said there is no reason to use
taxpayers' money to guard his mausoleum any longer.</P>
      <P>The elder Chiang died in 1975, while his son passed away in 1988. Both of them
have been interred in Tashi, originally until such time as their bodies could be
returned to China for burial.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jyh-wey announced last Friday that the government
will stop referring to the tombs as mausoleums and will simply call each a "tomb
or grave."</P>

      <P>The Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS), which aims to be the global benchmark
standard for project-based voluntary emission reductions, will be introduced
into Taiwan to help local companies comply with international efforts to cut
greenhouse gas emissions, industry sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after 38 industrialized countries agreed at the recent
United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali to decrease their carbon
dioxide emissions by between 20 percent and 40 percent by 2020.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, Taiwanese companies
still need to comply with the protocol if they want to sell products to
industrialized countries, said Johnny Shieh, a senior executive of the Taiwan
chapter of SGS Group.</P>
      <P>Local companies can use the VCS certification as proof of their efforts to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Shieh noted.</P>
      <P>Dell Inc. -- a U.S.-based computer company -- announced in September that it
plans to make its operations carbon neutral by the end of 2008, Shieh went on.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-registered SGS Group is the world's leading inspection, verification,
testing and certification company.</P>
      <P>In addition, Dell has asked its suppliers to report their emissions of
greenhouse gases and Dell will help its suppliers cut their emissions, Shieh
noted.</P>
      <P>Richard Huang, another executive of SGS Taiwan, described the VCS -- which was
launched Nov. 19 this year -- as an international standard.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwanese companies can use the VCS to obtain quotas for the carbon
dioxide emissions they cut.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwanese companies can buy and sell these quotas on the VCS
platform, which will also help them meet their requirements on carbon dioxide
emissions, Huang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is set to reduce the annual carbon dioxide emissions in Taiwan to
year 2000 levels by 2025, according to the Cabinet's chief technology adviser
Lee Yuan-tseh.</P>
      <P>Lee confirmed Thursday after the conclusion of the 27th meeting of the Executive
Yuan Science and Technology Advisory Group that Vice Premier Chiou I-jen has
signed the meeting minutes, which will require ministries to meet the C02
emission reduction goal by 2025.</P>
      <P>Noting that all the technology advisers are pleased with Chiou's having signed
the meeting minutes, Lee said that by 2025, the government is expected to cut
current greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 40 percent.</P>
      <P>In order to meet that goal, the government needs to make massive adjustments in
its policies governing relevant industries, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the National Energy Conference reached a temporary agreement under
which the government would aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the country
to year 2000 levels by 2020, Lee said.</P>
      <P>However, no consensus was reached on lowering carbon dioxide emissions at the
National Energy Conference held in 2005, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>According to the white paper on energy policy released at the 2005 National
Energy Conference, Taiwan emitted 221 and 276 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide in 2000 and 2005, respectively.</P>
      <P>Wu Tsung-tsong, deputy minister of the National Science Council (NSC), said
during an interview with the Central News Agency that the NSC will include the
new goal in the national energy plan at a commissioners' meeting slated for Dec.
25.</P>
      <P>Within the next two or three months, the NSC will begin to promote relevant
policies and convene a cross-ministerial meeting involving  the Ministry  of
Economic  Affairs (MOEA)  and the Environmental Protection Administration on the
formulation of related policies, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>If the government does not commit itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
then Taiwan will generate an estimated 570 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
emissions by 2025, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau said that as
the legislature has yet to pass the draft Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act, the
government cannot require local companies to report their emissions of carbon
dioxide.</P>
      <P>In addition, local companies do not need to collaborate with the government to
monitor their greenhouse gas emissions, the official said.</P>
      <P>Without such data on companies' carbon dioxide emissions, the government cannot
formulate relevant policies on greenhouse gas reduction, the official concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Decision on `one-step' voting method must be obeyed: CEC</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) has authority over the election
commissions in the country's 25 cities and counties, and therefore, all election
units must employ a CEC-designed "one-step" voting method in the coming polls,
CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the comments during a break in a meeting called by the CEC with
election commission chiefs and officials from around the country to settle a
deadlock between the central government and 18 cities and counties controlled by
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) over the voting format for the Jan. 12,
2008 legislative elections and two accompanying referendums.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the law, all local election commissions are subordinate to
the CEC in terms of electoral affairs, Chang pointed out.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu Shiu-kuang, chairman of Taipei City's election commission, said
that the municipal commission has decided to use a "two-step" voting method and
that there is no way anyone can alter the decision.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said that the Executive Yuan will do
whatever is necessary to prevent the 18 KMT-controlled local governments from
using the "two-step" procedure, by either replacing election commission chiefs
and workers or even through legal means.</P>
      <P>The CEC-prescribed "one-step" voting method is legally binding and the
government fully supports its decision to adopt the method to ensure smooth and
orderly elections, Shieh said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the CEC meeting, he explained that it was not held to "entice"
electoral personnel in the 25 localities but was aimed at encouraging them not
to yield to pressure and making them realize that it is their legal obligation
to adopt the "one-step" voting scheme.</P>
      <P>Shieh denied speculation that the CEC has prepared a compromise package to
resolve the voting method dispute and argued that doing so would mean giving way
to "evil forces."</P>
      <P>"The government must act on a legal foundation and it cannot issue an unlawful
response," he said.</P>
      <P>The "two-step" voting format being touted by main opposition Kuomintang  (KMT)
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou is absolutely
illegal, he said, adding that the government will not tolerate two different
voting systems in the same election.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lot of similarities can be found in the presidential elections of South Korea
and Taiwan, academics said Friday on the heels of Lee Myung-bak's landslide
victory in South Korea's presidential election.</P>
      <P>The first and most obvious similarity is that the economy has become one of the
most important issues in both elections, according to academics from Taiwan and
South Korea in the annual Taipei-Seoul Forum.</P>
      <P>Lee's victory shows voters recognized incumbent President Roh Moo -hyun's
economic policy as a failure, said Taeho Bark, chairman of the Korea
International Trade Commission and a professor at Seoul National University.</P>
      <P>The economy is also a hot topic in Taiwan, although there are other issues, such
as national identity and the United Nations referendum, being discussed at the
same time, said Lee Ming, a professor at National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>Presidential candidates in both countries are beset by legal cases, as Taiwan's
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate Ma Ying-jeou is in the middle of a
corruption trial and Lee Myung-bak faces investigation for his involvement in a
scandal.</P>
      <P>North Korea and China, which have interfered in every major election in South
Korea and Taiwan in the past, are surprisingly silent this time, said Lee Ming,
president of the North Korea Democratization Forum and a former member of South
Korea's National Assembly.</P>
      <P>North Korea did not want to see the conservative Grand National Party (GNP)
become the ruling party, so it "secretly" collaborated with socialists in South
Korea to undermine the GNP in past elections, Lee Dong-bak claimed, adding that
South Koreans said "no" to North Korea with their ballots.</P>
      <P>Lee also observed a "reversal theory" in elections in South Korea, where GNP and
the liberal United New Democratic Party (UNDP) have been exchanged leads in
presidential and parliamentary elections during the past few years.</P>
      <P>The same theory is also common in local discussions about elections,  as
political parties that lose in parliamentary or presidential elections will be
favored to win the next election because of the voter habit of "helping the
weak."</P>
      <P>Observers saw the South Korean presidential election as a showdown between Roh
and Lee Myung-bak rather than Lee versus UNDP candidate Chung Dong-young, said
Lee Ming.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, he continued,  some people are also under the impression that
President Chen Shui-bian has taken the lead role in the election, making the
March election a "Chen vs. Ma" tussle rather the "real" fight,  which is between
Ma and ruling Democratic Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>"I don't know much about Chen vs. Ma but I do know that in Korea, some people
saw this as an election between Lee and former President Kim Dae-jung, rather
than Roh Moo-hyun, " Lee Dong-bak said.</P>
      <P>The two-day forum, organized by the Institute of International Relations (IIR)
of National Chengchi University and the Seoul Forum for International Affairs
(SFIA), will proceed Saturday with three sessions to discuss the new phase of
Taiwan-South Korean relations and regional development in East Asia.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is not on Beijing's list of overseas areas in which Chinese people are
allowed to invest, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) spokesman Liu Te-hsun said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in response to media inquiries about independent Legislator
Lin Wei-chou's recent proposal that Chinese people be allowed to invest in
Taiwanese real estate.</P>
      <P>Lin cited MAC Chairman Chen Ming-tong as saying a few days ago after a meeting
with the Cabinet official that the MAC is considering relaxing restrictions
against Chinese people seeking to purchase real estate in Taiwan, to allow
Chinese citizens to apply for housing loans at local banks, and to cancel the
requirement that Chinese investors in Taiwan real estate must explain the source
of their funds.</P>
      <P>Liu denied Lin's allegations and explained that China does not allow its people
to invest in Taiwan. The issue is not one over which Taiwan has any authority
and it is not an issue that can be addressed by revising Taiwanese laws
unilaterally, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Liu also noted that Beijing takes strict measures in controlling the outflow of
funds overseas, with each outnound remittance limited to US$60,000 at the most.
This limitation severely limits the opportunities for Chinese people to buy real
estate overseas, he added.</P>
      <P>According to MAC statistics, only 10 Chinese citizens have invested in Taiwanese
real estate, most of whom are the spouses of Taiwanese people.</P>

      <P>South Korea's financial misery index in 2006 was 5.7 percent, higher than
Taiwan's 4.5 percent, signifying that the economic pressure on South Koreans is
higher than that on the Taiwanese people, according to a report released Friday
by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Taiwan outperformed South Korea in terms of economic growth and the level of
life satisfaction, according to the CEPD report comparing the economic
performance of Taiwan and South Korea over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>The report shows that for the period between 1997 and 2006, Taiwan's average
economic growth rate reached 4.4 percent, the same level as that of South Korea,
while between 2003 and 2006, Taiwan's average economic growth rate stood at 4.6
percent, in comparison with South Korea's 4.3 percent. As for this year,
Taiwan's growth rate is estimated at 5.5 percent, while that of South Korea is
estimated at 4.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also reported a higher level of life satisfaction, which is measured by
purchasing power parity (PPP), financial misery index and disposable income.</P>
      <P>The report shows that Taiwan's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was
US$15,271 in 2005 and US$16,030 in 2006, slightly lower than the US$16,306 and
US$18,392 registered by South Korea over the same period.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's PPP-converted per capita GDP reached US$30,687 in 2006, far higher
than South Korea's US$24,084. As for 2008, it is predicted to surge to US$32,490
in Taiwan, still ahead of the US$25,840 forecast for South Korea.</P>
      <P>As to the financial misery index composed of the unemployment rate and consumer
price index (CPI) , over the past decade Taiwan's CPI rose only 0.8 percent,
lower than South Korea's 3.4 percent. In terms of unemployment rate, Taiwan's
dropped to 3.9 percent in 2006, close to South Korea's 3.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The study also shows that although the gap in disposable household income
between the richest and poorest families in Taiwan over the past decade
increased to 6.01 fold, up from 5.41, the gap in South Korea surged sharply to
7.64 fold, up from 5.4 over the same period.</P>

      <P>Sewage emitted by increasing numbers of hot spring hotels and restaurants in
Wulai, Taipei County, has resulted in excessive E. coli counts in the water of
the Feitsui Reservoir, according to the results of a survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted  by the Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA)
on Taiwan's 20 reservoirs.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake in the central county of Nantou has the best water quality,
despite substandard sewage disposal from the Lalu, a local five-star hotel, said
Leu Horng-guang, director-general of the EPA's Bureau of Water Quality
Protection.</P>
      <P>From 2004, the Lalu Hotel has been given fines of just NT$60,000 (US$1,847) ,
NT$150,000 and NT$60,000, for its repeated failure to improve its sewage system,
Leu noted.</P>
      <P>The Fengshan Reservoir in the southern county of Kaohsiung has the poorest water
quality, Leu said.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Water Pollution Control Act, the EPA announced in July
that the waste water disposal of over 10,000 hotels, restaurants and hot spring
resorts will be subject to EPA control from July 1, 2008, Leu said.</P>
      <P>Most of the hotels and restaurants in Wulai wil have to improve their sewage
facilities or face penalties, Leu added.</P>
      <P>However, in response to the EPA survey results, Li Kung-cheh, head of the Taipei
Feitsui Reservoir Administration, said the reservoir water is safe and does not
contain high amounts of E. coli.</P>
      <P>The waste water produced by hot spring resorts in Wulai drains into the Nanshih
River, while the water of the Feitsui Reservoir comes from the Peishih River.</P>
      <P>Taipei city government Water Department officials also dismissed the EPA

      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved Friday free trade agreements (FTAs) between Taiwan
and two Central American diplomatic allies to further advance economic and
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>According to remarks made Nov. 12 by Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hsieh Fa-
ta in a legislative meeting, El Salvador and Honduras will agree to lower
customs duties on 3,151 and 3,451 items of industrial products, respectively,
after the free trade pacts take effect.</P>
      <P>As industrial goods make up the bulk of Taiwan's exports to both El Salvador and
Honduras, the FTAs will give Taiwanese products with preferential import
tariffs, allowing them to compete with China, Japan and South Korea and helping
Taiwan to better tap the two markets, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Citing an analysis by the Chunghua Institution for Economic Research, Hsieh said
the FTAs will help Taiwan boost its industrial product exports to the two
Central American countries by between 4.2 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively,
per year.</P>
      <P>In terms of agricultural produce, El Salvador and Honduras will also immediately
slash customs duty rates for 439 items and 430 items, respectively, from Taiwan,
he added.</P>
      <P>The FTAs will help Taiwanese companies make inroads into the vast American
markets and pursue globalization at a time when other countries in the region
are still negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Taiwanese exports to El Salvador and Honduras in 2006 hit
US$71.49 million and US$35.79 million, respectively, while imports from the two
countries reached US$8.98 million and US$14.36 million, respectively.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Serious confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties was a principal
feature that marred the sixth legislature, which ended its sixth and final
session Friday.</P>
      <P>The sixth legislature, which concluded a week early to allow incumbent
legislators more time to engage in campaign activities for the Jan. 12
legislative elections, set various records over the last three years, including
three failed attempts to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The sixth legislature opened in early 2005 in an atmosphere of extreme mutual
distrust,  with the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang and the
People First Party, convinced of the illegality of the 2004 presidential
election result.</P>
      <P>Shortly after Chen won re-election by a razor-thin margin, the "pan-blue"
presidential ticket of then KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong
filed lawsuits to challenge the outcome, claiming that Chen staged an election-
eve shooting that slightly injured him and Vice President Annette Lu, to win
sympathy votes in the hotly contested election.</P>
      <P>Bickering and confrontation stalled business in the legislature from that point
on.</P>
      <P>One of the most conspicuous was the boycott by the "pan-blue alliance" of the
list of Control Yuan members nominated by the president for legislative
confirmation, so that the nation's highest watchdog body was left empty after
the term of the previous members expired Jan. 31, 2005.</P>
      <P>The opposition attempted to recall the president three times in the latter half
of 2006, but failed every time because a recall requires the consent of two-
thirds of the 225-member legislature, while the "pan-blue" only commanded a slim
majority.</P>
      <P>Also, the budget law stipulates that the budget for the central government
should be passed one month before the start of a new fiscal year, but the 2007
budget did not pass until June 15 that year.</P>
      <P>The reason for the unprecedented stalling is attributed to the KMT listing the
controversial draft Organic Law of the Central Election Commission at the top of

      <P>Compared with the fifth legislature, however, which passed 611 bills, the just-

      <P>Taiwan has ordered its representative office in Geneva to lodge a strong protest
with the World Health Organization (WHO) over its wrong placement of several
Taiwanese ports on a list of certified ports in China, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs acting spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said the WHO has
published lists of certified ports of all member countries in accordance with
its newly passed International Health Regulations (IHR) , in which the WHO has
wrongly included some Taiwanese ports on the Chinese port list.</P>
      <P>Noting that such a move will not only affect the Taiwan people's rights  but
could  also cause  confusion  and difficulty  for international merchant
shipping and maritime transport operators, Yeh said the MOFA will seek the
assistance of major countries around the world to push the WHO to correct the
issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Because of China's opposition, Taiwan has been shut out of the WHO and its
decision-making World Health Assembly, causing a loophole in the world epidemic
control and health care network.</P>
      <P>Yeh said China has spared no effort to suppress Taiwan, even on public health
affairs. In September, she said, China blocked the WHO from directly informing
Taiwan of suspected contamination of a shipment of Thai corn on the grounds that
all WHO data and information should be passed to Taiwan via Beijing. China did
not inform Taiwan until two weeks later.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved Friday free trade agreements (FTAs) between Taiwan
and two Central American diplomatic allies to further advance economic and
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>According to remarks made Nov. 12 by Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hsieh Fa-
ta in a legislative meeting, El Salvador and Honduras will agree to lower
customs duties on 3,151 and 3,451 items of industrial products, respectively,
after the free trade pacts take effect.</P>
      <P>As industrial goods make up the bulk of Taiwan's exports to both El Salvador and
Honduras, the FTAs will give Taiwanese products with preferential import
tariffs, allowing them to compete with China, Japan and South Korea and helping
Taiwan to better tap the two markets, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Citing an analysis by the Chunghua Institution for Economic Research, Hsieh said
the FTAs will help Taiwan boost its industrial product exports to the two
Central American countries by between 4.2 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively,
per year.</P>
      <P>In terms of agricultural produce, El Salvador and Honduras will also immediately
slash customs duty rates for 439 items and 430 items, respectively, from Taiwan,
he added.</P>
      <P>The FTAs will help Taiwanese companies make inroads into the vast American
markets and pursue globalization at a time when other countries in the region
are still negotiating the Free Trade Area of the Americas, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Taiwanese exports to El Salvador and Honduras in 2006 hit
US$71.49 million and US$35.79 million, respectively, while imports from the two
countries reached US$8.98 million and US$14.36 million, respectively.</P>
      <P>Panama, Guatemala and Nicaragua, all of which are Taiwan's diplomatic partners
in Central America, have already signed FTAs with Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Confrontation mars just-concluded legislature</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Serious confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties was a principal
feature that marred the sixth legislature, which ended its sixth and final
session Friday.</P>
      <P>The sixth legislature, which concluded a week early to allow incumbent
legislators more time to engage in campaign activities for the Jan. 12
legislative elections, set various records over the last three years, including
three failed attempts to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The sixth legislature opened in early 2005 in an atmosphere of extreme mutual
distrust,  with the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang and the
People First Party, convinced of the illegality of the 2004 presidential
election result.</P>
      <P>Shortly after Chen won re-election by a razor-thin margin, the "pan-blue"
presidential ticket of then KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong
filed lawsuits to challenge the outcome, claiming that Chen staged an election-
eve shooting that slightly injured him and Vice President Annette Lu, to win
sympathy votes in the hotly contested election.</P>
      <P>Bickering and confrontation stalled business in the legislature from that point
on.</P>
      <P>One of the most conspicuous was the boycott by the "pan-blue alliance" of the
list of Control Yuan members nominated by the president for legislative
confirmation, so that the nation's highest watchdog body was left empty after
the term of the previous members expired Jan. 31, 2005.</P>
      <P>The opposition attempted to recall the president three times in the latter half
of 2006, but failed every time because a recall requires the consent of two-
thirds of the 225-member legislature, while the "pan-blue" only commanded a slim
majority.</P>
      <P>Also, the budget law stipulates that the budget for the central government
should be passed one month before the start of a new fiscal year, but the 2007
budget did not pass until June 15 that year.</P>
      <P>The reason for the unprecedented stalling is attributed to the KMT listing the
controversial draft Organic Law of the Central Election Commission at the top of
the agenda for discussion Jan. 16, 2007, which triggered even more riotous
confrontation between the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>After the fourth session of the legislature ended in pandemonium, Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng issued a rare written statement to condemn the DPP
legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>The non-stop conflict took its toll on the smooth operation of the legislature
and it became normal for lawmakers to ignore their duties in the regular
sessions, making it necessary to organize provisional sessions just to get some
work done.</P>
      <P>There are 10 provisional  sessions in the history of the legislature, and except

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will continue its arms sales to Taiwan in accordance with the
Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan defend itself against China's military
threat, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a news conference in response to a question about the recent
developments in U.S.-China relations, Gates said that Chinese officials again
raised the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during his recent visit to China.</P>
      <P>"I was very explicit that our arms sales were consistent with the Taiwan
Relations Act and the joint statement and that as long as they continued to
build up their forces on their side of the Taiwan Strait, we would continue to
give Taiwan the resources necessary to defend itself," Gates said.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum alongside the March 22, 2008 presidential
election on the country's bid to apply to join the United Nations under the name
Taiwan, Gates said he is not worried that there will be a military reaction from
China, adding that the United States is watching the situation very closely.</P>
      <P>Gates further said that also during his recent China visit, he told Chinese
officials that this matter should continue to be handled in a political way.</P>
      <P>Noting that Washington has made its opposition to the referendum plan very clear
to Taiwan, Gates said he believes Beijing knows that "we have weighted in
heavily on this matter with the Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a separate news conference held on the same day, U.S. Secretary of
State Condoleezza Rice repeated Washington's objections  to the planned
referendum,  which she called a "provocative policy."</P>
      <P>"It unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and it promises  no real
benefits  for the people of Taiwan on the international stage. That is why we
oppose this referendum, " Rice said.</P>

      <P>The United States should not overreact to Taiwan's planned referendum on
applying to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs James Huang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Huang said the U.S. government should trust that the Taiwan people have the
wisdom and ability to deal with issues such as referendums and cross-Taiwan
Strait relations properly.</P>
      <P>"I hope the United States will listen to the voices of the Taiwan people and try
to get a better understanding  of the actual situation, " Huang said.  "The
matter could become even more complicated if the United States overreacts to
it."</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks upon his return to Taiwan from a Central America visit,
in response to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's statement  Friday in
which she reiterated  Washington's objections to the referendum.</P>
      <P>Calling the referendum a "provocative policy, " Rice said during a news
conference held in Washington, D.C. that the referendum unnecessarily raises
tensions in the Taiwan Strait and promises no real benefits for the people of
Taiwan on the international stage.</P>
      <P>Her statement follows similar remarks made over the past few months by several
other lower-level U.S. officials,  including including Deputy Secretary of State
John Negroponte, Tom Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, and American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond
Burghardt.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on Rice's statement, Ministry of Foreign Affairs acting
spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said the referendum has obviously been "stigmatized."</P>
      <P>Yeh clarified that the referendum is aimed at allowing the Taiwan people to
exercise their democratic rights to express their desire to join the United
Nations, adding that the referendum does not involve changing the country's
official name, changing the status quo or seeking so-called "de jure
independence."</P>
      <P>Yeh  said  the deepening  of Taiwan's  democracy  and the establishment of the
Taiwanese identity are common assets of Taiwan and the United States and are
helpful to maintaining regional peace and stability.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's liquid crystal display (LCD) television shipments are expected to
increase more than 20 percent in 2008, with 32 inches remaining the most popular
TV module size, the Institute for Information Industry (III) forecast Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang Han-yi, an industry analyst with the III's Market
Intelligence Center, Taiwan's LCD TV shipments have risen 73 percent to
approximately 794,000 units this year, with 32-inch products accounting for 53.8
percent of the shipments.</P>
      <P>The shipments are expected to further jump 23.4 percent to 980,000 units next
year, thanks to suppliers' continued efforts to cut prices to promote sales,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>While the shipments of 32-inch LCD TVs are expected to account for 47.2 percent
of the total shipments for 2008, the shares of 37- inch, 40-inch and 42-inch
products are projected to be 16.8 percent, 6.1 percent and 13.4 percent,
respectively, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>She  predicted  that  LCD  TV  shipments  by international manufacturers,
household electrical appliance manufacturers and information technology (IT)
product manufacturers will continue to dominate Taiwan's market next year.</P>
      <P>For 2007, the market share of international brands stands at 37 percent, while
that of household electrical appliance brands and IT brands are 34 percent and

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan ranks 28th in global survey of PPP-converted per capita GDP</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's purchasing power parity (PPP) -converted per capita gross domestic
product (GDP) amounted to US$26,068 in 2005, ranking 28th in a global survey, a
government official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According  to  the  official  from  the  Cabinet-level Directorate-General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , Taiwan trailed five other Asian
countries and areas but ranked ahead of South Korea and China in terms of PPP-
converted GDP for 2005.</P>
      <P>The survey was part of a U.N.-sponsored International Comparison Program (ICP)
aimed at producing internationally comparable price levels, economic aggregates
in real terms, and purchasing power parity estimates, the official said, adding
that the ICP uses a series of statistical surveys to collect price data for a
basket of goods and services.</P>
      <P>For meaningful inter-country comparisons, the ICP considers the affordability
and price level of necessities and luxuries, which exchange rates ignore, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The data collected is combined with other economic variables from countries'
national accounts to calculate purchasing power parities -- a form of exchange
rate that takes into account the cost and affordability of common items in
different countries, usually expressed in the form of US dollars, the official
explained.</P>
      <P>The United Nations authorized the World Bank to handle the 2005 round of PPP-
converted per capita GDP survey, the official said, adding that the survey
covered 146 countries in six geographic areas around the world.</P>
      <P>As the Asian Development Bank (ADB), of which Taiwan is a member, was
commissioned to coordinate and integrate the survey in the Asia Pacific area,
the official said, the Central Bank of the Republic of China managed to persuade
the ADB to have Taiwan covered in the survey.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Taiwan was invited to join the ICP survey, with
the DGBAS contracted to execute the project, the official said.</P>
      <P>The results of the ICP survey show that the United States ranked first in the
world in 2005 with a PPP-converted GDP of US$12 trillion, followed by China at
US$5.33 trillion and Japan at US$3.87 trillion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's PPP-converted GDP for 2005 amounted to US$590.5 billion, ranking 18th
among the 146 countries and areas studied, the official said.</P>
      <P>In terms of PPP-converted per capita GDP, Luxembourg ranked first at US$70,014,
followed by Qatar at US$68,749.</P>
      <P>Among Asian countries and areas, Brunei topped the list at US$47,465, followed
by Singapore (US$41,478), Macau (US$37,259), Hong Kong (US$35,680) , Japan
(US$30,290) , Taiwan (US$26,068) and South Korea (US$21,342) . China's PPP-
converted per capita GDP totaled only about US$4,091 for 2005.</P>
      <P>By factoring in PPP, the resulting comparisons of GDP volumes enable economists
to measure the relative social and economic well-being of countries, monitor the
incidence of poverty, and track progress towards target programs effectively,
the official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An Academia Sinica researcher said Saturday that he believes the United States'
reiteration of its opposition to Taiwan's planned referendum on applying to join
the United Nations under the name Taiwan is aimed at discouraging the Taiwanese
people from passing the referendum.</P>
      <P>Washington regards the holding of the referendum as a move that may change the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait, said Lin Cheng-yi of the Academia Sinica
Institute of European and American Studies in a CNA interview.</P>
      <P>On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice reiterated in a press
conference held in Washington, D.C. the U.S. government's opposition to the
referendum.</P>
      <P>Calling the referendum a "provocative policy, " Rice said the referendum
unnecessarily raises tensions in the strait and promises no real benefits for
the people of Taiwan on the international stage.</P>
      <P>Her statement follows similar remarks made over past few months by several other
lower-level U.S. officials,  including Deputy Secretary of State John
Negroponte; Tom Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific affairs; and Stephen Young, director of the American Institute in
Taiwan's Taipei office.</P>
      <P>Lin said he thinks Rice made the statement to comfort China in an attempt to
discourage the latter from overreacting to the referendum and from putting forth
policies that will change the state quo.</P>
      <P>Criticizing Rice for only highlighting the "provocative" part of the referendum,
Lin suggested Washington should more frequently make public its intentions and
plans to help Taiwan join international organizations as part of efforts to help
realize the Taiwan people's greatest wish.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the current Taiwan-U.S. ties, Lin said that he thinks that relations
between the two countries are now at a "cold and deadlocked" stage and that
there will be no breakthrough until the summer in 2009, when a new U.S.
president will be in office.</P>
      <P>The scholar also said he believes that until next March when the Taiwan people
elect a new president, Washington will focus all its attention on issues
concerning Taiwan's U.N. bid, cross-strait ties, and Taiwan's upcoming
legislative elections slated for Jan. 12.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai I-chung, an executive member of Taiwan Thinktank, an independent,
nonprofit public policy research organization, said he suspects that
Washington's use of a high-level official to voice its opposition to the
referendum was the result of deal with Beijing in which the latter promised to
cooperate on the issue of North Korea's nuclear weapons threat.</P>
      <P>Lai told CNA that he believes the word "provocative" in Rice's statement was
used to "comfort" China in an attempt to prevent the communist regime from
taking more "provocative" action to change the state quo in the strait.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Saturday that the government has provided NT$1.8
trillion (US$555.56 million) in funds for housing loans over the past seven
years to help the construction sector recover from a protracted recession.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the construction sector serves as the leading industrial
locomotive and that in 2000, when he first served as the premier, the
construction sector was at its low ebb.</P>
      <P>He noted that when the first national economic development conference was held
in August 2001, the participants suggested several measures, including halving
the land value-added tax, to shore up the struggling construction sector.</P>
      <P>The government has since adopted the suggestion and pledged to local governments
that if tax revenues decrease in the next two years because of the new measure,
the government will provide subsidies to make up the shortfall.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that cutting the land value-added tax has helped increase the
number of land transactions and that in the last few years, the government has
never actually had to provide subsidies to the local governments.</P>
      <P>To help people purchase their own houses and stimulate the real estate market,
the Executive Yuan also announced it will provide NT$520 billion in preferential
housing loans, and it has provided NT$1.8 trillion in housing loans over the
past seven years, he said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday the drive for a referendum on whether the
country should apply to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan is an
expression of the public's aspiration and by no means a provocative policy.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks on the sidelines of a seminar on the urban development of
the central city of Taichung in response to a press query about his view on U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's reference to Taiwan's planned U.N. bid
referendum as a "provocative policy" the previous day.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the referendum initiative was proposed by the grass-roots public
and endorsed by about 2.73 million citizens, Chen said his administration is
obliged to hold the referendum in accordance with the existing law.</P>
      <P>"It's a response to a public petition, not a provocative policy. As a
democratically elected government, we must respect public opinion," he added
categorically.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed his finger at Beijing, saying that China, rather than Taiwan,
is provocative. "Just recently, China listed eight Taiwanese ports, including
Keelung, Hualien, Kaohsiung, Mailiao and Taichung, as its domestic ports. Such a
move is starkly provocative, " he emphasized.</P>
      <P>In his remarks, Chen expressed gratitude for Rice's reaffirmation of the U.S.
commitment to helping maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait. The president further
said he is convinced that the U.N. bid referendum will be passed in a vote
slated for March 22, 2008 when the electorate will also elect a new president.</P>
      <P>Rice reiterated the United States' opposition  to Taiwan's referendum plan in a

    <TEXT>
      <P>A vote simulation showed that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is expected to
post a landslide victory in the Jan. 12 legislative elections, grabbing almost
two-thirds of the 113 seats, a researcher said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin Jih-wen, a researcher at Academia Sinica, said during the annual Taipei-
Seoul Forum held in Taipei that according to his calculations, the KMT is
expected to win 72 seats in the elections, while the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) is expected to win 38 seats.</P>
      <P>Calculating the vote share in the township within the 73 single-member
districts, Lin concluded that the DPP won't be able to win more than 25
district-based seats, adding that it may win 13 of the at-large seats to be
allotted to the various political parties based on the percentage of the total
vote they each garner. Only political parties that manage to win at least 5
percent of the total vote cast in the polls will be eligible to secure at-large
seats.</P>
      <P>The KMT is likely to grab 72 seats, while other parties will win the rest, he
said.</P>
      <P>A "single-member constituency, two votes" system will be used for the first time
in Taiwan's election history, with 73 of the 113 legislators to be chosen from
the districts, 34 to be selected in a nationwide district, and six chosen from
indigenous districts.</P>
      <P>Lin predicted that the DPP's failure in the legislative elections will have an
impact on the party's campaigning strategy, forcing it to resort to Taiwanese
consciousness to balance the tilt in the ensuing presidential election.</P>
      <P>As for the DPP-initiated referendum on retrieving the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets,
Lin said the DPP doesn't care whether it is passed. The main objective of the
referendum, he said, is to boost the voter turnout rate in certain districts for
the party to win more at-large seats.</P>
      <P>"Most people care about whether vote-buying will be reduced in this election. My
observation is, unfortunately, the answer is no, " he said.</P>

      <P>The survey conducted by the non-profit Tosun Public Interests Foundation also

teenagers, the category of government performance saw the highest level of
misery, at 73.2 points on a scale of 1 to 100 points.</P>

      <P>Contemplation and discussion on the possible regional economic cooperation
between South Korea and Taiwan is very "well-timed" as closer cooperation will
benefit both sides, a South Korean professor said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Both South Korea and Taiwan are major trading countries, and they are each
other's fifth largest trading partner. The recent crisis regarding the World
Trade Organization (WTO) system and the hype of regionalism can never be
favorable to any country that has a high dependency on trade, said Bark Taeho,
dean of Seoul National University's Graduate School of International Studies,
in the Taipei-Seoul Forum held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea have been competitors in the business world, but they can
also collaborate, Bark said, adding that the two countries ought to concentrate
on reinforcing the WTO-centered multilateral trade system since Taiwan is a WTO
member.</P>
      <P>Detailed practical ideas in various organizations, such as the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council, the Pacific Basin Economic Council, and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, should be developed, and efforts to draw up
agreements among the countries involved should be made, he said.</P>
      <P>Trade between South Korea and Taiwan has grown rapidly despite the absence of
formal diplomatic relations between the two countries and of systematic
integration. As East Asian countries have expanded their regional trade
agreement networks since the late 1990s, Taiwan's trade could be negatively
affected, Bark noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea should also make joint efforts to reduce the harmful use
of trade remedy measures, such as anti-dumping and countervailing measures,
against Taiwanese and Korean goods by advanced countries, he said.</P>
      <P>"A regional cooperation mechanism between the two countries achieved through the
APEC mechanism would be most desirable, " he said.</P>
      <P>"First, political issues have been resolved as Taiwan is already an APEC member;
and second,  the inefficiency  of concluding independent free trade agreements
between individual East Asian countries and countries in the Americas could be
reduced. Lastly, this will ultimately reinforce the WTO-centered multilateral
trading system, " he said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over a ceremony held in the central Taiwan
city of Taichung Saturday to mark the transference of a large plot of land in
the greater Taichung area from the Air Force to the Taichung city government.</P>
      <P>The ceremony also represented the president's delivering on his promise to the
city to transfer the plot of land -- site of the former Shuinan Airport -- to
allow the municipal government to develop the land plot in the heart of the city
into a modern urban center.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Taichung citizens will always
remember and feel grateful for Chen's benevolent decision to hand the vast plot
of land over to the city government.</P>
      <P>Regarding the old airport as a valuable asset with which Taichung can expand
into a metropolis and one of Taiwan's major transportation hubs along with the
Chingchuankang airport and high-speed railway operations, Chen said he believes
the city will become more and more important to the country's industrial
development.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that the old airport will be developed into a "central park"
of Taichung City that will help accelerate the city's urban rejuvenation and
modernization.</P>
      <P>Shuinan Airport was built during the period of Japanese colonial rule of the
island to serve as a military airport. It was taken over after the end of World
War II by the ROC Air Force, which established a logistic command center and an
aviation industrial development center at the airport.</P>
      <P>From that time until 1980, all Taiwan-produced aircraft were manufactured and
underwent tests at that airport, according to the city government. As Taichung
expanded,  the airport's relative location shifted from the outskirts to the
center of the city. It is now situated  near the Central Taiwan Science Park,
Fengchia University and the Aerospace Industrial Development Corp., which
designed and built Taiwan's Indigenous Defense Fighters.</P>
      <P>As the airport's existence was often blamed for hindering the city's land
traffic and urban development, the city government kicked off efforts after the
relocation of the airport facilities in 2004 to develop the place into a modern
urban center that has been planned to house a university city, a trading
exhibition center, a forest park, a dome-shaped stadium and an urban cultural
hall.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu and Minister of National Defense Lee Tien-yu also
attended the land transference ceremony.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Chen mentioned that a special team has been formed
in the central government to push for the city's integration  with neighboring
Taichung  County  into a single administrative district and its upgrading to the
status of special municipality.</P>
      <P>Chen also revealed at a conference on the greater Taichung area's development
that it is very likely that Taichung City may be chosen to house the Ministry of
Economic Affairs' planned institute of business research.</P>
      <P>He said he is increasingly confident that the central Taiwan city will become a
new capital city of the country following the transference of the plot of land
to the municipal government.</P>

      <P>A failed attempt to make the world's longest roll of sushi was reported from the
eastern county of Hualien Saturday, despite the ambitious plan having drawn
around 2,500 people to try to help it succeed.</P>
      <P>According to the Yuhsi Farmers' Association which launched the challenge to the
existing Guinness World Record for the longest roll of sushi at 1,500 meters,
1,800 people gathered to make a roll of sushi with a planned length of 1,501
meters.</P>
      <P>The activity then drew the participation of many other locals who displayed
interest in setting a world record in the county.</P>
      <P>However, the huge party of up to 2,500 sushi makers still failed to break the
world record due to a shortage of food materials, including locally-grown rice,
cucumbers and laver, prepared for the world-record-challenging sushi roll,
according to association members.</P>
      <P>The Yuhsi association members said they will make a second attempt next year to
set a new world record.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Frank Hsieh lashed
out at his rival Saturday for echoing China's stance to provide it with a
pretext to attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Ma Ying-jeou, presidential candidate of the main opposition
Kuomintang, should not be "in league with" China in voicing opposition to
Taiwan's planned referendum on applying to join the United Nations under the
name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that Ma has echoed China's position that the referendum is a step
toward "de jure Taiwan independence," adding that "Ma has provided China with a
reason to use force against us."</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to Ma's remarks about his concerns about deteriorating
Taiwan-U.S. relations and Taiwan security after U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice on Friday reiterated U.S.</P>
      <P>opposition to Taiwan's planned referendum.</P>
      <P>Calling the referendum a "provocative policy," Rice said during a news
conference held in Washington, D.C. that the referendum unnecessarily raises
tensions in the Taiwan Strait and promises no real benefits for the people of
Taiwan on the international stage.</P>
      <P>Hsieh criticized Ma for not speaking for Taiwan, saying that he deserves no
support from a great number of people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said that a national leader who loves Taiwan should not let
Taiwan-U.S. relation deteriorate.</P>
      <P>Ma was responding to President Chen Shui-bian's comments earlier in the day that
Taiwan has no "provocative policy" and only a policy that "respects the public
will and acts according to the law."</P>
      <P>The president said that the planned referendum, to be held alongside the March
22 presidential election, is not a government policy and is instead a display of
public will, adding that it is not Taiwan, but China, that is provocative.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the president can continue his rhetoric, but it will only lead to a
further deterioration in relations between Taipei and Washington, which he said
is not a thing that "a leader who loves Taiwan would do."</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA to promote use of discarded kitchen scraps as compost</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) is planning to promote the use
of kitchen scraps for compost in the wake of the success of their use as hog
feed.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that the practice of recycling kitchen waste has been in
place for seven years and that the volume of kitchen waste recycled hit a new
high this year, with nearly 80 percent being used as hog feed.</P>
      <P>Although using recycled kitchen scraps as hog feed has proved to be very
successful, the officials said, the recycling rates for leaves, nut shells, clam
shells, and duran and coconut peels have been low, adding that they are now
looking at tapping this waste resource.</P>
      <P>If these materials can be recycled properly, then it is possible that they can
generate NT$2.2 billion (US$67.9 million) worth of organic compost per year
based on an estimate of around 2,000 metric tons of these forms of waste being
produced daily.</P>
      <P>The EPA has since 2001 promoted the recycling of kitchen</P>
      <P>scraps, with the recycled volume having ballooned to 1,812</P>
      <P>metric tons daily this year from 80 metric tons a day at the start.</P>
      <P>Seventy-seven percent of the recycled kitchen scraps are used as hog feed.
Thanks to the soaring price of grain in the international market, the cheap
recycled kitchen scraps have been highly sought after, the officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Students in Taiwan endeavoring to become teachers should consider heading to the
United States because there are more job openings in the field and the pay is
better there, a manager of an online employment service provider said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-jieh, head of the education section of 1111 Job Bank, made the
suggestion following the release of Ministry of Education statistics that show
that only 3 percent of examinees passed the teacher recruitment tests in 2006.</P>
      <P>Quoting Ministry of Education statistics, Wang said over 120,000 people
registered for teacher recruitment tests in 2006 and that only 3 percent
received job offers. The recruitment rate was the lowest at 0.66 percent for
elementary school teaching posts, he noted.</P>
      <P>In comparison, more teaching jobs are available in the United States, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang encouraged Taiwanese to find teaching jobs in the United Staes because the
salary is better, adding that a U.S. elementary school teacher earns between
NT$1.35 million (US$42,000) and NT$2.46 million per year, far more than his or
her Taiwanese counterpart's average annual salary of NT$420,000-to-NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Special education, bilingual, mathematics and science teachers are the most in
demand in the United States, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He added that special education teachers can earn as much as US$76,000 per year
in the United States, while math and science teachers can earn up to US$ 53,000.</P>
      <P>Wang suggested that Taiwan students interested in becoming teachers can consider
focusing on mathematics or science as teachers with a background in these
subjects are in higher demand in the United States.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday Taiwan has no "provocative policy" and
only a policy that "respects the public will and acts according to the law."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the planned referendum on whether the country should apply to
join the United Nations under the name Taiwan is not a government policy and is
instead a display of public will, Chen said the referendum plan is a response to
a public petition.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks on the sidelines of a seminar on the urban development of
the central city of Taichung in response to a press query about his view on U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's reference to Taiwan's planned U.N. bid
referendum as a "provocative policy" the previous day.</P>
      <P>Noting that the referendum initiative was proposed by the grass-roots public and
endorsed by about 2.73 million citizens, Chen said his administration is obliged
to respect the public will and organize a referendum in accordance with the
Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Pointing his finger at China, Chen said it is not Taiwan, but China, that is
provocative. Just recently, he said, China has unilaterally included eight
Taiwanese ports, including Keelung, Hualien, Kaohsiung, Mailiao and Taichung,
into its International Health Regulations (IHR)-certified ports.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is neither a part nor a province of China. The inclusion of Taiwanese
ports into China's IHR-certified port list is starkly provocative," Chen
emphasized.</P>
      <P>He also cited China's other provocative acts, such as its enactment of the so-
called Anti-Secession Law that provides a legal basis for Beijing to use force
or non-peaceful means against Taiwan and its deployment of 988 ballistic
missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his remarks, Chen expressed gratitude for Rice's reaffirmation of the U.S.
commitment to helping maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait. Chen also affirmed
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates' statement in a separate news conference in
Washington, D.C. Friday that he is not worried that there will be a military
reaction over Taiwan's referendum plan.</P>
      <P>Describing the planned referendum as an expression of Taiwan people's common
will, Chen said the people of Taiwan want their voice heard in the international
community through the referendum.</P>
      <P>"By holding the referendum we are hopeful that the world will listen to our
appeal for U.N. representation and pay heed to the reality that Taiwan is an
independent sovereignty state and by no means a part or province of China, "
Chen said, adding that he is convinced that the U.N. bid referendum will be
passed in a vote slated for March 22, 2008 when the electorate will also elect a
new president.</P>
      <P>Rice reiterated the United States' opposition  to Taiwan's referendum plan in a

      <P>China's unilateral inclusion of Taiwanese ports into its IHR-certified port list
would only expose its inability to fulfill its duty under the International
Health Regulations (IHR), according to a Taiwan official posted in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-hsun, director of the Taipei Cultural and Economic Office in Geneva,
made the remarks after Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) decried
Friday over the recent posting of China's wrongly arranged IHR-certified port
list on the World Health Organization (WHO) Website.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, Taiwan has on many occasions expressed its stance on the
issue. None of Beijing's unilateral moves that undermine Taiwan's sovereign
status and legitimate rights and interests will be acceptable or recognized by
Taiwan, he added,</P>
      <P>Noting that the port listing issue is yet another example of China's relentless
political suppression against Taiwan on the world stage, Shen said China's
incluion of Taiwanese ports in its IHR port list is totally unfounded.</P>
      <P>The WHO-sponsored IHR 2005 lays out a new legal framework for the global
community to better manage its collective defences against acute public health
risks that can spread internationally and have devastating impacts on human
health as well as unnecessary negative interference on trade and travel. It
requires all signatories to report and address public health emergencies of
international concern.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is neither a WHO member nor an IHR signatory, it already
voluntarily declared its commitment to abiding by relevant regulations in May
2006. After the IHR took effect June 15, 2007, Taiwan again informed the WHO
Secretariat, WHO member countries' representative offices in Geneva and
international media outlets of Taiwan's determination to observe IHR provisions
and China's illegitimacy and inability to represent Taiwan in IHR enforcement.</P>
      <P>Since the unveiling of the IHR 2005, Shen said Taiwan has issued 166 port health
certificates in accordance with IHR provisions, proving that China has no rights
and is incapable of representing Taiwan in implementing the IHR regulations.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, MOFA officials said the ministry has ordered its representative
office in Geneva to lodge astrong protest with the WHO over its wrong placement
of several Taiwanese ports on a list of certified ports in China.</P>
      <P>Noting that such a move will not only affect the Taiwan people's rights  but
could  also cause  confusion  and difficulty  for international merchant
shipping and maritime transport operators, MOFA acting spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh
said the MOFA will seek the assistance of major countries around the world to
push the WHO to correct the issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Because of China's opposition, Taiwan has been shut out of the WHO and its
decision-making World Health Assembly, causing a loophole in the world epidemic
control and health care network.</P>
      <P>Yeh said China has spared no effort to suppress Taiwan, even on public health
affairs. In September, she said, China blocked the WHO from directly informing
Taiwan of suspected contamination of a shipment of Thai corn on the grounds that
all WHO data and information should be passed to Taiwan via Beijing. China did
not inform Taiwan until two weeks later.</P>

      <P>The quasi-official intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) is slated to
release a new book Monday aimed at serving as a reminder to Taiwan
businesspeople and companies of the risks involved in investing in or doing
business in China.</P>
      <P>The new book, titled "Heading for China -- Previous Follies That You Can't
Afford to Ignore, " is a collection of 36 failed investment cases in China
involving Taiwan businesspeople or companies over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman  Hung  Chi-chang,  who is also  an incumbent legislator-at-large of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, says in the book's introduction  that
heading to China is now an irresistible trend for Taiwan businesspeople in terms
of global positioning. However, he also points out that those who are planning
to do so must remain vigilant of the risks facing Taiwan investors in China,
including "invisible  traps" that could lead them "to bankruptcy, becoming
beggars or even being killed."</P>
      <P>The book is mainly aimed at reminding Taiwan businesspeople that they should
learn more about China's laws and practices and assess the various risks before
investing in that country, Hung added.</P>
      <P>The 36 cases of failed investments presented in the book can serve to educate
Taiwan businesspeople and companies planning to invest or do business in China
on a wide range of issues, including trade matters, investment, buying or
leasing real estate, trademark and patent issues, labor management, corporate
merger, banking and currency exchange, customs policy, tariffs and taxes,
founding private schools,  judicial affairs and arbitration,  compulsory
execution, retreating of funds, and personal safety and security, Hung noted.</P>
      <P>Each case study also includes analysis and comments by experts in related
fields, he added.</P>

      <P>Former Finance Minister Wang Chien-shien said Sunday that members of the Taiwan
public who feel their standard of living is declining and Taiwan is losing
ground should blame themselves and not the president or the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Wang, one of the founding members of the tiny opposition New Party, said Taiwan
voters have themselves to blame for the chaotic domestic political situation and
declining economy, pointing out that in a democracy, people have to live with
the consequences of the decisions they make.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a campaign rally held at the 228 Memorial Park in downtown Taipei to
drum up support for New Party legislative candidates, Wang said he would not
pick up his referendum ballots when he votes in the Jan. 12 legislative
elections since he does not think the referendums are necessary or make any
sense in terms of reviving the sagging economy, reducing unemployment or earning
the country greater respect in the international community.</P>
      <P>Wang, who had been nicknamed "Mr. Saint" for his renowned integrity as a
politician, lamented the fact that when he served as finance minister between
1990-1992, South Korea was far behind Taiwan in almost every economic aspect and
trying hard to emulate Taiwan. Nowadays, the situation has reversed, with South
Korea being a strong country and Taiwan trying to catch up with it.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that South Korea has surpassed Taiwan in almost every economic
category, Wang asked, "What happened to Taiwan and its people?"</P>

      <P>A pediatric cardiac surgeon in the eastern county of Hualien is soliciting
donations for the building of a new "library on wheels" to allow poor aboriginal
children living in remote areas to have access to more books.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Li-yun, herself a mother of three, built her first library on wheels --
using a 20-foot container mounted on a leased trailer and stocking it with some
1,000 illustrated children's books -- four years ago. The mobile library was
recently closed down due to a lack of funds for maintenance.</P>
      <P>After four years of roaming from villages by the coast to communities deep in
the mountains in 13 rural townships around Hualien County, the library ended its
mobile services. It is now stationed permanently at Tong Men Elementary School
in Hualien's Hsiulin Township.</P>
      <P>The moving library was built in late 2003, eight years after Chen founded the
Hualien New Aspect Foundation, where she built her first library for children.</P>
      <P>The New Aspect Library for Children has been a mecca for Hualien children,
particularly pre-school kids, who can listen to stories read by volunteer
mothers there.</P>
      <P>However, as only children living in Hualien City has access to the illustrated
books, Chen came up with the idea of building a library on wheels to enable
aboriginal children in remote villages to also enjoy the books.</P>
      <P>Chen said the aboriginal children loved the moving library. One kid even visited
it at the break of dawn everyday and waited outside for the volunteer mothers to
arrive to read him stories. During the one month that the mobile library was in
his village, the child helped clean up in and around the library . When the time
came for the library to move on to another village, the child had "read" almost
all the books in the library, she said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, another older child, who was really "hungry for knowledge and
thirsty for reading, " borrowed over 1,000 books from the mobile library during
the one month it was in his village. When the time came for the mobile library
to depart, the child was on the verge of tears, Chen recalled.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed her appreciation to all the volunteer mothers around the county
who helped out by reading stories to children. Noting that some mothers even
stayed overnight and slept on the floor of the library, she thanked them for
their dedication to helping the library accomplish its mission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan sets world record in broadband infrastructure</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has set yet another world record in terms of broadband infrastructure,
with broadband Internet access now available in all but one of its townships and
villages, National Communications Commission (NCC) Chairman Su Yeong-chin said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks a day after the inauguration of broadband service in five
remote villages in the eastern county of Taitung.</P>
      <P>"We have surmounted tremendous technological challenges and accomplished an
almost impossible mission ahead of schedule, " Su said, adding that Taiwan is
the first country in the world to have a broadband infrastructure set up in
every remote township and village.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Su joined several other officials, including Taitung County
Magistrate Kuang Li-chen and Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Ho Chen-tan, in presiding
over the launch of broadband service in five remote aboriginal communities in
Taitung County.</P>
      <P>The five villages -- Tachu, Chenhsing, Senyung, Chiafeng and Langtao on Orchid
Island off the Taitung coast -- were the last areas in the country not to have
broadband Internet access.</P>
      <P>In an effort to narrow the digital divide between urban and rural areas,  the
NCC -- the country's telecommunications and media regulatory body -- identified
early this year 46 remote or secluded villages that lacked broadband service.</P>
      <P>"We must make necessary hardware and software investment to prevent these places
from falling behind in this digital era, " Su said, adding that broadband
Internet access will serve as a window for children and other residents in
remote areas to acquire much more knowledge.</P>
      <P>The NCC designated Chunghwa Telecom, the country's largest telecommunications
service  provider,  to  build  broadband infrastructure in 43 of the villages or
townships in eight counties, and Taiwan Fixed Network to do so in three mountain
villages in Alishan Township in the southern county of Chiayi. The NCC also
demanded that the Internet connection speed in all these areas be increased to
2Mb per second or faster.</P>
      <P>The two companies used either optical fiber or wireless network technologies to
overcome a lot of technological barriers and finally completed the challenging
work ahead of schedule, Su said, adding that the partially state-owned Chunghwa
Telecom alone injected more than NT$93 million in broadband infrastructure setup
in 43 barely accessible townships in mountain or offshore regions in Miaoli,
Hualien, Pingtung, Taitung, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Nantou counties.</P>
      <P>The "broadband  for every township" project was originally scheduled for
completion by the end of this year, but all the work was completed by Dec. 15,
except in Haucha Village in Pingtung where it was delayed due to typhoon damage.
The broadband infrastructure setup in the mountain village has been rescheduled
for completion in late February, Su said.</P>
      <P>Saturday's launch ceremony took place in Chenhsing Village. In addition to
offering preferential service charge packages to boost broadband penetration,
Chunghwa Telecom has also opened a digital classroom in Chenhsing Village and
donated 10 brand new computers for use by local residents. The Chunghwa Telecom
Foundation has also sent volunteers to assist in organizing training programs
for village residents interested in computer and Internet use.</P>
      <P>The Chenhsing village chief said at the launch ceremony that the entire village
will benefit from the broadband service as information about the village can now
be accessed online.</P>
      <P>Under a "digital good neighbor" program, Chunghwa Telecom has already opened
digital classrooms in 16 remote communities to offer computer training programs
for local residents and is scheduled to offer similar services in 21 other
remote townships next year, a Chunghwa spokesman said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan ranks 2nd in Asia in gender empowerment measure: DGBAS</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan ranks second in Asia and 19th in the world in terms of gender empowerment
measure (GEM) , officials from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials quoted the latest United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
report as showing that in 2005, Norway, Sweden and Finland had the world's top
three GEM indices, indicating that females in these countries have more
opportunities to take part in formulating political and economic policies than
their counterparts in the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>The UNDP began in 1995 to compile and publish GEM rankings, using data provided
by surveyed countries on the numbers and ratios of female politicians and female
executives at or above the managerial level, as well as on females' contribution
in terms of gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>In terms of GEM, Taiwan ranks high on the list in 19th position, well ahead of
Japan's ranking of 55th and South Korea's 65th. In Asia, only Singapore has a
higher ranking than Taiwan, placing 16th in the world, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the UNDP report, the "better half" gender of the world's population
of 6.5 billion has not only become much more active in terms of political
participation and business management, they have also been significant
contributors in terms of GDP.</P>
      <P>Women in Kenya, Sweden and Mozambique had the world's three highest rankings in
terms of per capita GDP generated by females for 2005, contributing to their
respective countries' GDP to the tune of some 80 percent of the amount generated
by men in 2005.</P>
      <P>In this category, Taiwan women contributed to the country's GDP to the tune of
67 percent of the amount generated by men to rank 26th in the world, ahead of
Japan's 119th ranking and South Korea's 132nd ranking, according to the GDBAS
officials.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that since Taiwan is not a U.N. member, they decided to work
out the relevant figures and positions concerning Taiwan themselves based on
data from the World Economic Outlook Databank compiled by the International
Monetary Fund and using the UNDP's calculation formula.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-proposed U.N. bid referendum will not have side effects: Ma</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate called Sunday for
widespread public support for a KMT-initiated referendum on the country's U.N.
bid on the grounds that it will not provoke uncertainties or have any side
effects in the region.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou issued the call on a tour of Chungpu township in the central Taiwan
county of Taichung.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the KMT-proposed referendum on pushing for the country's U.N.
membership under its official title, the Republic of China, will not stir up
concerns from other countries, because the party has taken into account their
possible response before seeking public endorsement for the referendum.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has the right to apply to join the United Nations, but it must be done
via an adequate approach to avoid dire costs, although it is a common desire of
the Taiwan people, " Ma said, pointing out that "the United States has spoken
out against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) U.N. bid referendum
plan several times, but it has not criticized the KMT-proposed one."</P>
      <P>"The KMT-initiated referendum is more flexible and thus is beneficial to
Taiwan," he argued.</P>
      <P>Along with the presidential election slated for March 22, 2008, two referendums
on the country's U.N. bid, one initiated by the KMT and the other initiated by
the DPP, will be held simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The United States has repeatedly voiced opposition to the DPP-proposed
referendum on the country seeking U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said last Friday in a year-end news
conference that the United States supports a one-China</P>
      <P>policy and opposes Taiwan's referendum to join the United nations as
provocative.</P>
      <P>"It unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and it comes with no
real benefits for the people of Taiwan on the international stage. This is why
we oppose this referendum, " Rice said.</P>
      <P>U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte said in August that Washington
opposes such a referendum as it would mark a step toward declaring full Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Rice's remarks, DPP presidential hopeful Frank Hsieh said that the
KMT-proposed referendum on applying to rejoin the United Nations under the name
of the Republic of China and the party's insistence on adopting a "two-step"
voting method in the coming legislative  and presidential  elections are "plots"
to undermine the DPP's referendum on Taiwan's U.N. cause.</P>
      <P>The KMT dose not intend to really promote its U.N.  bid referendum, and it is
merely a covert move to bungle the one proposed by the DPP, Hsieh claimed,
adding that the United States is very aware of this and that Beijing does not
mind.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has to endure a lot of difficulties and challenges ahead if the country
is determined to reach out," he said.</P>

      <P>The strategy of Kuomintang (KMT) presidential  candidate Ma Ying-jeou to bring
down the ruling Democratic Progressive  Party is a mistake,  former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) chairman Lin Yi-hsiung said in a television interview
Saturday.</P>
      <P>"If you want to pull someone down from his position, you must be underneath that
person, " Lin said on the SET TV's political program, adding that although Ma is
a "nice" and "friendly" person, his campaign strategy of finding fault with the
DPP does not put him in a better position in the presidential race.</P>
      <P>Citing last year's attempted impeachment of scandal-plagued President Chen Shui-
bian as an example, Lin said that as much as he considered Chen's behavior
inappropriate, the KMT should not have wasted time on trying to impeach him as
the attempt had no chance of succeeding in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Instead, Lin said, the KMT, which has a slight majority in the legislature,
should have focused on coming up with policies and bills favorable for the
country and people. "If the KMT had done so, the DPP would have fallen far
behind," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, Ma should lead the KMT to get to a higher level that the DPP
cannot reach by making good use of its strength and trying to perform better in
the legislature.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the presidential election next March, Lin pointed out that if the
DPP candidate Frank Hsieh wins, it will be a message to the KMT to the effect
that it did poorly in the legislature by just trying to bring down the DPP.</P>
      <P>If the KMT wins a majority in the legislative elections and Ma is elected
president, Ma will be more prone to act in an authoritarian manner than in a
democratic manner, based on his past political performance, Lin said, adding
that the responsibility of defending Taiwan's democracy will then lie in the
people's hands.</P>
      <P>Ma and his KMT administration might sign new treaties with China for further
exchanges and cooperation, Lin said, adding that although he is not against
friendship with China, whether such treaties would compromise the sovereignty of
Taiwan should be a cause of great concern.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that even if the DPP loses the legislative and presidential
elections to the KMT, he does not think the KMT will act in as authoritarian
manner as it did when it was last in power. However, he added that the DPP and
the public will have to play an aggressive role in supervising the new ruling
party.</P>

      <P>With Christmas and New Year just around the corner, the economic slow down seems
to have had no effect on the people's party mood as sales have been booming for
hotels' countdown parties and stay packages, Taipei City has been adorned with
all kinds of iridescent decorations, and a festive atmosphere has reigned in
every spot in the city.</P>
      <P>Christmas and New Year should brim with fun and joy. Taipei City, like many
other big cites around the world, has plenty of live entertainment, champagne
toasts and party favors to enjoy during the festive season.</P>
      <P>With every five star hotel having special Christmas and New Year's Eve packages
and bashes, there's no reason not to enjoy the holidays. However, the biggest
event of all will be the spectacular fireworks display at the Taipei 101 tower
to bring in 2008.</P>
      <P>The fireworks display at the 509-meter Taipei 101, which was the world's tallest
building until being eclipsed by the unfinished Dubai Tower this year, is no
doubt one of the most spectacular New Year's Eve countdown events in Taiwan and
has received global attention in the last two years.</P>
      <P>Entering its third and probably final year of staging a fireworks display,
Taipei 101 is determined to outshine all others with a NT$20 million
(US$615,688)  investment  in creating  an unforgettably resplendent show. A
total of 12,000 rounds of fireworks will be launched from the specially
illuminated tower for a 188-second show.</P>
      <P>However, ever since the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communication was awarded the right to stage this year's fireworks display,
there have been rumors and speculation that it might use the show to promote the
nation's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>After days of speculation, the message to be illuminated on the exterior of the
building is still a secret, and it will only be revealed on the evening of Dec.
31, according to a Tourism Bureau official.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the scheduled fireworks display, hotels with rooms facing the Taipei
101 have been fully booked as early as September, while the occupancy rate for
other rooms in these hotels has also increased to 80-90 percent.</P>
      <P>For example, the Grand Hyatt Taipei, located right next to Taipei 101, has 200
"firework rooms." These rooms were fully booked for Dec. 31 three months ago,
and 98 percent of the hotel's 856 rooms have been booked for New Year's Eve.</P>
      <P>Beginning  with specially selected seasonal cuisine on its Christmas menu and
culminating in the grand finale on New Year's Eve, the Grand Hyatt Taipei is
presenting a countdown party, dubbed "The Hanging Garden, " on the theme of the
illumination of the sky and an array of colorful flowers, magical fruit balls
and gigantic vegetable centerpieces hanging from above to represent the four
seasons</P>
      <P>Although the price for attending the party is not cheap, at NT$6,288, plus
10-percent service charge, per person, 80 percent of the tickets have already
been sold, said Luanne Li, the hotel's marketing communication manager, adding
that the economic gloom seems to have had no effect on the hotel's business.</P>
      <P>May Hu, assistant communications manager of the Shangri-La's Far Eastern Plaza
Hotel Taipei, said that business is booming ahead of Christmas and New Year,
adding that business for the whole year has been good at the hotel, which
targets foreign businesspeople.</P>
      <P>The Shangri-La Far Eastern's rooms from which the fireworks display can be seen
have also all been booked, she said, adding that the hotel will also give two
free tickets, worth NT$2,800 each, to guests in the other rooms to attend its
New Year's Eve countdown party by its swimming pool on the 43rd floor.</P>
      <P>However, if you want to see something new, the Venetian Carnival Masked
Masquerade at the Grand Formosa Regent Taipei and the musical performance at the
Grand Howard Plaza Hotel in which guests can sway elegantly to romantic
melodies, savor the exquisiteness of Italian cuisine, and marvel at the
wonderful circus acts,  live band performances and outstanding DJs, can
certainly get everyone filled with excitement.</P>
      <P>People's hearts should leap in joy during the Christmas and New Year holidays,
blowing away a year of grim headlines of endless political struggles and
enjoying the biggest party of all -- Taipei City itself.</P>

step" and "two-step" voting formats stems from the regulation in the Referendum
Act that stipulates that the turnout rate must exceed 50 percent for a
referendum to pass, adding that it is almost impossible to attain and that such
a requirement does not exist in advanced democratic countries.</P>
      <P>In order to boost the turnout rate, Lin said, the distribution and collection of
the ballots should be as convenient as possible within the law, adding that the
"one-step" format is the most appropriate.</P>
      <P>The reason why the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) wants to adopt the two-step
voting format, in which voters will receive and cast their referendum ballots
only after they cast their ballots for the legislative elections, is to drive
down the turnout rate, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The two-step voting format is more troublesome, and therefore people are less
likely to collect the referendum ballots, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said it makes no sense for the KMT to propose referendums only to try to
kill them, predicting that "such a move will damage the party's image."</P>
      <P>The KMT initiated  the referendum  on fighting  government corruption to counter
the DPP-initiated referendum on retrieving the KMT's "ill-gotten"  assets,  and
that the party initiated the referendum on rejoining the United Nations under
the country's official title, the Republic of China,  to counter the DPP's
referendum on the country applying for U.N. membership under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Lin said, whichever voting format is adopted, the
difference in turnout rate will be no more than three percentage points, and
Taiwanese voters will definitely know how to vote since they are very smart.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian criticized family members of late President Chiang Kai-
shek and Chiang Ching-kuo Sunday for cheating Taiwanese by trying to inter their
bodies in their Chinese hometown of Fenghua, Zhejiang Province.</P>
      <P>Stumping for legislative candidates of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan, Chen quoted Chiang Fang Chi-yi, daughter-in-
law of Chiang Ching-kuo who is the son of Chiang Kai-shek, as saying earlier the
day that she was considering burying the two Chiangs' bodies in their hometown
after President Chen ordered the withdrawal of honor guards posted at their
mausoleums in Tashi, Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Chen said it was Chiang's family members who had asked to inter them at a
military cemetery in Taipei in March 2004, now that the construction of their
proposed graves at the cemetery had finished at the cost of NT$30 million
(US$923,503) and their family members wanted to bury them in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"This is a case of cheating the Taiwan authorities and the Taiwan people," the
president said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile  some 70,000 visitors descended on the two late presidents' Tashi
mausoleums Sunday on the last day before the honor guards are withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has labeled Chiang Kai-shek a dictator and the mastermind of the 228
incident of 1947 in which many Taiwanese were killed in an uprising against the
Nationalist government, said the country has no reason to post honor guards at
his mausoleum at a cost of NT$70 million a year.</P>

      <P>The Home Party is slated to host a dialogue on Kategalan Boulevard in front of
the Presidential Office Dec. 29 in which two prominent figures will exchange
views and ideas on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, party officials announced
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Home Party Chairman Chen Yao-chang,  Secretary-General  Yao Lee-ming and Chang
Fu-chung, a founding member of the party, made the announcement in a news
conference.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. Honorary Chairman Robert H. C. Tsao and former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh will be invited to
discuss relevant issues, according to the three men.</P>
      <P>Tsao, a prominent high-tech businessman, ran two advertisements in major local
newspapers  calling for the legislation  of a cross-strait  peace  law  last
month,  while  Shih  led mass anti-corruption demonstrations against President
Chen Shui-bian last year in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, both DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and his main
opposition Kuomintang rival Ma Ying-jeou have shunned sensitive political issues
in this regard which are of an extremely critical importance to Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Both Hsieh and Ma should  provide  the public with clear explanations of their
respective positions concerning several key cross-strait issues, Chang said,
adding that this is the reason why Tsao and Shih have been invited to speak
about these issues directly to the public.</P>
      <P>"Neither Ma nor Hsieh have ever delved into these delicate cross-strait issues,
" Chen said, insisting that both candidates should face up to these questions
and seek good solutions to them so as to help put an end to fierce political
infighting at home if they are keen on pursuing the presidency.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the Dec. 29 forum will merely be a beginning, and the Home
Party will continue to organize similar events in the run-up to the March 22,
2008 presidential election to allow the public to air their views. "Tsao and
Shih will not evade any sensitive questions in next Saturday's dialogue," he
said.</P>

      <P>Taichung city government's Environmental Protection Bureau hosted a seminar
Sunday exhibiting the fruits of its recycling efforts for which the central
Taiwan city has been ranked tops in the nation for two consecutive years.</P>
      <P>According to Taichung City Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi, the city government  was
cited  in 2005 and 2006 by the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) as being the best in the country in terms of resource
recycling.</P>
      <P>In November of this year, 42 percent of the city's waste resources and 12
percent of its kitchen scraps were recycled, Hsiao pointed out, adding that the
amount of garbage produced by households was down by 54 percent on average year
on year.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government implemented a mandatory garbage classification
system in July 1999 in line with an EPA campaign promoting safety and cleanness
in nationwide recycling centers, and the city's recycling plant has become a
model for similar facilities in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion,  EPA Deputy Minister Chang Tze-ching hailed
Taichung City's performance in resource recycling and also praised the nation's
overall progress in this regard.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Taiwan has won international acclaim in recycling because
its average recycling ratio is expected to grow to over 30 percent for 2007,
marking an astounding jump from just 1 percent in 1998.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top representative to the United States said Sunday that the Taiwan
people's expressing of their desire for membership in the United Nations is a
peaceful and rational move which should never be considered as "provocative."</P>
      <P>Speaking during a news conference with Taiwan media members, Joseph Wu said that
Taiwan is the only country in the world being barred from the United Nations,
adding that for decades, Taiwan has not obtained any substantive assistance from
the international community.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wu said, the Taiwan people must speak out in a loud voice
about their plight in order to prevent the country from being completely
isolated.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in response to U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's
reference Friday to Taiwan's planned referendum on whether the country should
apply to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan as a "provocative
policy."</P>
      <P>Rice reiterated the United States' opposition  to Taiwan's referendum plan in a
press conference held in Washington, D.C. Calling the referendum a "provocative
policy, " she said the referendum "unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan
Strait" and "promises no real benefits for the people of Taiwan on the
international stage."</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that China has been "provocative, " pointing out that it has
continued to deploy more and more ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan, as well
to try to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and attempt to have Taiwan's designation
in international organizations changed to downgrade its status.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, Beijing unilaterally included Taiwanese ports as  certified
ports  in China  on the  International  Health Regulation-certified port list on
the World Health Organization (WHO) Web site recently.</P>
      <P>Even worse, he added, China is planning to inaugurate a new flight route 4.2
nautical miles west of the median of the Taiwan Strait next January,  which
could severely affect cross-strait stability and international flight safety.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that Taiwan and the United States have shared many common values and
have maintained close and cordial business, trade, cultural and security ties,
which he said have helped form the bedrock of a solid relationship between the
two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No change in Taiwan-Malawi relations: Malawian ambassador</HEADLINE>

      <P>Bilateral relations between Malawi and Taiwan are firm and solid, Malawian
Ambassador to the Republic of China Thengo Maloya reaffirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang Monday morning,
Maloya denied there has been any change in bilateral Taiwan-Malawi diplomatic
relations as rumored recently by a Malawian newspaper.</P>
      <P>Maloya made the reassurance amid reports that a delegation of Malawian officials
is ready to visit China, which may put Taiwan's formal diplomatic relations with
Malawi in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>Malawi's Nyasa Times reported on its Web site Dec. 21 that Malawian President
Bingu wa Mutharika has agreed that Malawi will sever its formal diplomatic
relations with Taiwan and forge formal ties with China.</P>
      <P>The Nyasa Times report said that two Malawian ministers, in the company of
Malawian foreign ministry officials, are scheduled to depart Malawi Dec. 24 for
Beijing. The Malawian official delegation will sign a memorandum of
understanding in Beijing to pave the way for the establishment of formal
diplomatic relations between Malawi and China, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In response to the report, Foreign Minister James Huang met with his Maloya
Monday morning to gain a better understanding of the latest development
surrounding bilateral relations between Taiwan and Malawi, said Phoebe Yeh,
acting spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>It marked the second time that Huang has met with Ambassador Maloya since the
Nyasa Times report was posted Saturday, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh said that Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Tzu-pao has departed
Taipei for Malawi to get a better grasp of the situation.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the Foreign Ministry sought clarification from Maloya and was
told that nothing  negative  has occurred  in Taiwan-Malawi diplomatic
relations.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry was also told Monday that the Malawian officials who were
reportedly scheduled to depart from Malawi for China on Dec. 24 "have yet to
depart," according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Yeh added that Malawian Foreign Minister Joyce Banda told the Foreign Ministry
Sunday that China has attempted many times over the past several years to build
better relations with Malawi. Banda said Malawi has maintained formal diplomatic
relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan over the past 40 years, and it
was not the first time that Beijing has tried to undermine Malawi-Taiwan  ties,
according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Despite Malawi's reassurance, Yeh said, the Foreign Ministry is remaining highly
vigilant and closely watching related developments.</P>
      <P>Huang had offered to resign to take political responsibility after the country
severed formal diplomatic relations with Costa Rica on June 7 this year, but
President Chen Shui-bian declined his resignation.</P>

      <P>The Penghu Clan Association in Taipei City is set to launch a tree-planting
drive on the outlying island of Penghu shortly to help boost the island's
tourism.</P>
      <P>Kao Chien-wen, chairman of the Penghu Clan Association in Taipei, claimed that
the "only viable way" of bolstering Penghu's tourism in autumn and winter --
difficult seasons for conventional tourism due to the inclement weather -- is to
plant trees to green the islands and make them appeal to visitors.</P>
      <P>Kao said that despite Penghu's white sand beaches, emerald sea and beautiful
scenery, the island group attracts in winter less than one-fourth of the
tourists who visit in spring and summer.</P>
      <P>He called for Penghu natives who live on Taiwan proper or people who have
visited Penghu before -- Taiwan citizens or foreign nationals -- to each donate
NT$2,000 (US$61.73) for each tree to be planted on the islands.</P>
      <P>The donated trees, which will carry the donors' names and the date of planting,
will be taken care of by caregivers on a daily basis as part of a long-term care
project, Kao added.</P>
      <P>There are about 1 million Penghu natives who live permanently on Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Kao, who was scheduled to depart for Penghu the following day to officially

scheduled to be held in the Penghu capital of Makung Jan. 18-19, with ensuing
planting to be carried out regularly each year between October and March.</P>

      <P>The 2008 New Year's Eve countdown will feature a fireworks display of
unprecedented scale at Taipei 101, though the slogan to be illuminated on the
world's tallest building remains a mystery, according to information released at
a press conference Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the press, Michael Liu, Assistant Vice President of the Taipei
Financial Center Corp which owns the skyscrapper, said he does not want to spoil
the surprise in advance. The cancellation of the originally planned press
release of the Tourism Bureau, of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communication, which contributed NT$21 million in sponsorship to the project,
has added to the suspense surrounding the event.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, preparations for the show are taking place under a tight
schedule but will be completed Friday for a circuit test.</P>
      <P>When the clock strikes midnight Dec. 31, a total of 12,000 rounds of fireworks,
3,000 more than last year, will be launched from sites as high as 500 meters up
the building, in 18 to 20 motifs, for a splendid 188 seconds, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Noting the economic adversity in 2007, the color of "gold", symbolizing wealth
and happiness, has been chosen as the theme color of this year's firework
display, signifying a prosperous future and robust economy, he added.</P>
      <P>The show will be 80 percent different from the previous ones, with the most up-
to-date fireworks to ensure that the festivities outshine all other such events
around the world, Liu went on, adding that this grand celebration is bound to be
packed with excitement and splendor.</P>
      <P>To accommodate  people attending the fireworks display and countdown party, the
101 shopping mall, its food court, and all restaurants and cafes on the 4th
floor will open until 2 a.m., Liu said, adding that there will also be a car
exhibition featuring Italian luxurious automobiles from Ferrari and Maserati,
Dec. 28 to Jan. 6.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that
if elected, he will form a task force on constitutional reform after two years
in office.</P>
      <P>Ma said the task force will study the merits and deficiencies of the existing
Constitution, as well as the performance of the new, streamlined legislature
that will have the number of its members halved to 113 from the present 225.</P>
      <P>He said that if the ruling and the opposition parties can reach a consensus on
constitutional reforms, he would be willing to push for further constitutional
reforms "to live up to the aspirations of the public." The present Constitution,
put into practice in 1947, has been amended seven times since 1991.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks when he attended a symposium to mark the 60th anniversary of
the Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>He described democracy as being aimed at the prevention of abuse and corruption,
as well as the defense of the people's basic rights.</P>
      <P>But he claimed that since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration
came to power in 2000, it has dwelled on expanding ethnic division and creating
rifts in Taiwan's "harmonious society."</P>
      <P>The turbulence that has marred the DPP administration has shown the failings of
a democracy "which has elections and no constitution," according to Ma.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the present Constitution is far from perfect, but said that in
general, it is a reasonable constitution that needs to be cherished.</P>
      <P>Instead of "crafting a new constitution, " and "constitutional re-engineering"
as advocated by the DPP, he urged the public not to damage or destroy, but to
abide by the Constitution.</P>
      <P>If elected president, he promised to appoint a candidate endorsed by a majority
party or a majority coalition as premier, and said he will establish a mechanism
that provides a better system of checks and balances in the spirit of the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>If the DPP wins a majority in the legislature, Ma said, he will appoint a DPP
member to serve as premier.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's upcoming presidential election will not cause China to relent in its
obstruction of Taiwan internationally,  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
officials predicted Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that some analysts have forecast that China will not bash
Taiwan in the runup to the presidential election lest it backfires and boosts
the campaign of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, although there have
been signs recently that China will not relax its Taiwan policy due to the March
22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"The suppression has in fact risen unabated, " they said, adding that Beijing's
Taiwan policy includes taking all of Taiwan's diplomatic allies, blocking all
channels for Taiwan internationally and crushing all Taiwan's international room
for maneuvering, commonly known as the "three all policy."</P>
      <P>In addition to the African ally of Malawi, the ministry is also on full alert
about possible changes in three Central American allies -- Panama, Dominican
Republic and Haiti -- that Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang recently
visited, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials said this is because the ministry has learned that the three
allies have been greatly pressured by China, prompting Huang to make a personal
visit to solidify ties. The situation with Panama is especially stark, they
noted.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that President Chen Shui-bian should attend the inauguration
ceremony of Guatemalan President-elect Alvaro Colom Jan. 14 so as to meet with
other national heads of state during the event and contribute to bilateral and
multilateral relations between Taiwan and the nations of Central America.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that while Huang was visiting Central America, the situation
in Malawi gave cause for concern and that Deputy Foreign Minister Yang Tzu-pao
was sent there to help shore up ties.</P>
      <P>Reports said that a delegation of Malawi officials is ready to visit China,
which might put bilateral ties with Taiwan in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>Foreign officials have said that China has multiple strategic considerations
with regard to Africa and that China knows exactly what it wants from the
continent -- its valuable resources as well as Taiwan's allies switching
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>But they said that when Africa eyes major investment projects promised by China,
they often neglect to consider whether China can deliver on its promises.</P>

      <P>A seven-year colorectal cancer fighter who loves swimming overcame her fatigue
and sickness to carry out her last wish Monday -- enjoying a last swim as a
Christmas gift from her family and friends.</P>
      <P>Shue Yue-chi had been a morning swimmer for over a decade before she was
diagnosed with cancer.</P>
      <P>She did not give up swimming immediately, but continued her hobby in an effort
to increase her strength so that she could better combat the cancer.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, she swam across Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan and the
following year, swam across South Bay in Kenting, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, as her cancer recently worsened, Shue lost her strength and was unable
to swim again, according to her husband, Chang Feng-chuang.</P>
      <P>With fewer than six months to live as assessed by her doctors, Shue received
encouragement from her swimming friends and decided to swim for the last time on
Christmas Eve, although as the day dawned she considered giving up on the plan
because she was too weak to walk. However, she later regained enough strength to
follow her plan.</P>
      <P>Helped by her friends and medical staff, Shue enjoyed 30 minutes of walking
slowly in a swimming pool.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chen-hua, Shue's doctor at Taipei Medical University Hospital, said that it
requires careful preparation -- including forcing the patient to vomit and
giving an injection of pain killers -- to allow a serious cancer sufferer to
swim.</P>

pool to monitor her situation.</P>

secretaries of state -- to visit Taiwan prior to the country's March 22
presidential election, a DPP lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chuang Ho-tzu made the announcement in response to a recent
report of the United Evening News claiming that the DPP is working through
"international  friends" to invite former U.S. presidents to take part in an
activity supporting Taiwan's quest for membership in the United Nations under

be members of a foreign delegation to observe Taiwan's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Expressing worries that exposure of the details of the plan might trigger
obstruction from China, Chuang said that media coverage of the DPP plan would
increase the difficulties in inviting the guests.</P>

ministers, former South Korean presidents, political heavyweights from the

winners, but also other celebrities who are concerned about Taiwan.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian thanked visiting Tuvaluan Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia
Monday for the country's steadfast support of Taiwan's bid to join the United
Nations and the World Health Organization, and for speaking up for Taiwan in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his gratitude during a meeting with Ielemia and his wife at the
Presidential Office, during which he also mentioned that Taiwan has several
times dispatched mobile medical missions to Tuvalu this year, and said that he
hopes bilateral medical exchanges and cooperation can be further strengthened.</P>
      <P>Expressing his admiration for Taiwan's agricultural technical mission in Tuvalu,
Chen noted the team has been successful growing more than twenty varieties of
fruit and vegetables to help improve local people's diet and health.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ielemia also voiced his appreciation for Taiwan's assistance in
fields including health care and agriculture, among others, adding that the
medical missions were particularly welcome when providing care in his country's
capital Funafuti as many of the people receiving medical care were from the
country's offshore islands.</P>
      <P>Ielemia, accompanied by Minister of Foreign Affairs James, visited the
president, who was accompanied by Presidential Office Secretary-General Yeh Chu-
lan.</P>

      <P>A preparatory office was set up Monday to organize the establishment of a
service center for the Tree Valley Park in Tainan County -- the world's first
industrial park specifically serving LCD TV production and supporting
industries.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih, together with executives of the
Linklinear Development Co., an affiliate of the Chi Mei Group, and top officials
of the Southern Taiwan Science Park attended a ceremony to inaugurate the
office.</P>
      <P>Chin Mei plans to invest NT$15 billion (US$461.34 million) in developing the
park. Linklinear, which holds an 11 percent stake in Chi Mei Optoelectronics
Corp. -- Taiwan's second-largest LCD panel manufacturer -- was awarded the
build-operate-transfer (BOT) project in 2004.</P>
      <P>The county government signed a 30-year contract with Linklinear in November to
entrust the company with the management of the Tree Valley Park. The contract
will generate NT$1 million in annual royalties in addition to savings of NT$24.7
million a year for the county government.</P>
      <P>The 247-hectare industrial zone, located on the west edge of the Southern Taiwan
Science Park, is intended to attract LCD TV upstream suppliers of glass,
backlights, polarizer, lamps and driver ICs -- a key component of LCD panels --
to build facilities in the park to form an optoelectronics cluster that will
dramatically improve LCD TV supply chain performance in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The development project passed an environmental impact assessment by a committee
of the Cabinet-level  Environmental  Protection Administration in November.</P>
      <P>A total of 150 hectares in the industrial park will be reserved for factory
housing, with 50 hectares for a lake and an ecological area. The Tree Valley
Park is so named because it will have 100,000 trees planted along a route around
the park. To date, 13 LCD-related companies have purchased 60 percent of the
land reserved to house factories, with nine of these having set up shop.</P>
      <P>When fully operational, the Tree Valley Park is expected to create 20,000 jobs,
with a business turnover of NT$300 billion per year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Licence for 1st nuclear power plant might be renewed: AEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
12/24/07  19:57:31
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Atomic Energy Council (AEC) confirmed Monday that the licence for the
country's first nuclear power plant might be renewed for another 20 years.</P>
      <P>AEC Chairman Su Hsien-chang said at a year-end news conference that his council
has completed a time-limited integrated plant assessment (TLIPA) of the plant in
Shihmen, Taipei County, which certifies that the plant can apply to operate for
20 additional years after its original licence of 40 years expires after 2017.</P>
      <P>Su noted that if Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower), which runs the country's nuclear
power plants, applies for extended operation and if the AEC gives it a green
light, then it will become the first extended operation nuclear power plant in
Asia.</P>
      <P>The AEC calculated that carbon dioxide emissions will be cut by 7.3 million tons
a year if it can replace the country's thermal power plants powered by coal.</P>
      <P>Asked whether more nuclear power plants should be built, Su only said that
"Taiwan definitely will not have a fifth nuclear power plant."</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has three nuclear power plants in operation. The fourth,
located in Kungliao, Taipei County, is expected to be completed in 2012 after
years of controversy.</P>
      <P>Because President Chen Shui-bian wanted to deliver on his no-nuclear power
campaign promises after his election victory in 2000, the Executive Yuan stopped
the construction of the fourth nuclear power plant in October that year. The
suspension caused billions of dollars in losses before the government was forced
to make an about-face and resume construction early the following year.</P>
      <P>But the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan also reached an agreement Feb.
13, 2001 that while the construction of the fourth nuclear power plant should be
resumed, the eventual goal would be a nuclear-free Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government thought about decommissioning the aging first and second nuclear
power plants at that time, but a policy on the issue was never forged.</P>
      <P>Su pointed out that because of soaring crude oil prices, licence renewals for
nuclear power plants has become a trend.</P>
      <P>He cited examples from the United States, saying that out of 103 nuclear power
plants there, half of them have completed the process of licence renewal.</P>
      <P>The AEC will send officials to the United States to receive related training, Su
said, adding that once Taipower makes an application, the council will start the
review process according to relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>The review operation is expected to take between a year and 18 months, Su said.</P>
      <P>The first of the two generating units of the first nuclear power plant started
commercial operation in December 1978 and its licence will expire in 2017.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government will purchase more generating units for its nuclear
power plants, Su said the first, second and fourth nuclear power plants could
each add two more units. The third nuclear power plant has the room for six more
units. Taipower will make its own assessment of the matter, Su added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Too late to change MRT Neihu line train's interior design: officials</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the interior space of train cabins to be used on the still under-
construction Taipei Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system's Neihu line seems cramped,
city officials said Monday that it is too late now to change the cabins'
interior design.</P>
      <P>Media reporters and other guests were invited by the city's Department of Rapid
Transit Systems (DRTS) to take a trial run between the Neihu line's Sungshan
Airport station and Jiannan station earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The new MRT cabins,  manufactured  by Bombardier  Inc.  a Canada-based
manufacturer of regional aircraft, business jets, mass transportation equipment,
appear to be similar in size to the French-made cabins used on the Muzha line,
but the interior design is entirely different.</P>
      <P>According to the DRTS, the Neihu line train cabin features an inner space 202
centimeters high -- 2 cm shorter than the Muzha line cabin. However, with LED
devices on the ceiling, the new cabin is only 190 cm tall from the ceiling to
ground.</P>
      <P>In comparison with the inner width of the Muzha cabins, which are between 224 cm
and 227 cm wide, those of the Neihu cabin measure 209 cm across. As a result,
visitors to the Neihu line Monday were seen bumping against handrails from time
to time.</P>
      <P>Tsai Tien-ho, the DRTS official responsible for mechanical and electronic
engineering affairs, admitted that the inner space of the new MRT cabins is more
cramped than that of the Muzha train carriages, but 70 of 101 trains the city
government has ordered from Bombardier have been delivered.</P>
      <P>"It is too late to change the interior design, " he noted.</P>
      <P>One possible means of resolving the space problem, he went on, is to increase
operation  services  on the new line after  its inauguration.</P>
      <P>The Neihu line, which is still under construction, is a medium capacity system,
with most of the line running on an elevated corridor,  except for the section
near Sungshan Airport. When complete, it will have a total length of 14.8 km and
will connect directly to the Muzha Line, providing transfers to Neihu, Nangang
and Muzha, according to the city government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Executive Yuan issues ultimatum on voting method</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
12/24/07  20:44:27

    <TEXT>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Jin-chun announced Monday that Taiwan's 25
cities and counties must adopt a "one-step" voting method in the coming polls,
and that electoral personnel who do not follow the order will be replaced and
may even be brought to justice.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Central Election Commission (CEC) will issue a formal
notification to this effect in two days to all local governments, their election
commission chiefs and officials.</P>
      <P>After the CEC has notified all cities and counties across the country of that
demand, local authorities must obey the central government's order to employ the
CEC-designed "one-step" voting procedure and will not be allowed to promote any
other format in any materials, Chen said, adding that all election bulletins and
polling stations must be prepared fully in line with the "one-step" voting
method.</P>
      <P>Anyone who defies the "one-step" method order will be dealt with strictly in
accordance with the law, he asserted.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks following a cross-agency task force meeting led by Deputy
Premier Chiou I-jen to evaluate possible means to deal with 18 local governments
controlled  by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) which have insisted on
applying a "two-step" method.</P>
      <P>Chiou called the meeting with officials from the CEC, the Ministry of Justice,
the National Police Agency and the Central Personnel Administration.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said earlier the same day that the
Executive Yuan might draw up a replacement list of election commission chiefs
and personnel in some local governments due to the voting method dispute.</P>
      <P>Now that the CEC has decided to employ the "one-step" voting method, the central
government will absolutely not compromise on the voting method dispute, Shieh
said, reiterating that to ensure smooth and orderly elections the central
government will not permit two different voting systems to be applied during the
same election.</P>
      <P>Answering questions on whether these election commission chiefs and officials
will be replaced, Shieh pointed out that the CEC has authority over local
governments' election commissions which must abide by the central body's
decision.</P>
      <P>Shieh acknowledged that the central government has evidence that some local
governments have printed materials against the CEC's "one-step" method decision.</P>
      <P>In the face of Shieh's warning, Taipei city government spokesman Yang Shiao-tung
said the city government will still adopt the "two-step" voting method, but he
refused to comment on the Executive Yuan's plan to possibly replace municipal
election commission personnel.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the Taipei city government will respond to the issue only after
it has received a formal written notification from the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and head of the party's Policy Coordination
Committee, threatened to sue the CEC on charges of "dereliction of duty" if it
withdraws election commission chiefs and officials favoring the "two-step"
format.</P>
      <P>The KMT will absolutely do so, as the Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution last
week with a vote 102-92 demanding that the Executive Yuan employ the "two-step"
voting method, Tseng said, claiming that the CEC has "shamefully become a dupe"
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

      <P>The central government must act in accordance with the law and local governments
do not have to follow its orders if they are not issued legally, main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) presidential hopeful Ma Ying-jeou said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments while answering questions from reporters after the
Executive Yuan's spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said earlier the same day that it would
consider replacing local election commission chiefs and officials who insist on
adopting a "two-step" voting format in the coming elections.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has repeatedly said that all 25 cities and counties across
the country must apply a "one-step" voting procedure designed by the Central
Election Commission (CEC) and that the "two-step" scheme being broached by 18
KMT-controlled localities is unlawful.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, all government authorities must act based on the law and, if
they do not, the parties concerned do not have to follow their illegal and
therefore non-binding orders.</P>
      <P>As neither side in the dispute has showed any willingness to compromise over the
impasse, Ma said that in compliance with the Law on Local Government Systems,
such a dispute should be settled by the Legislative Yuan, rather than the
Executive Yuan itself.</P>
      <P>"It is difficult for the central government to expect others to abide by its
orders if it fails to follow due process in issuing them," Ma said.</P>

      <P>Coast Guard Administration (CGA) officials seized 7,000 pirated video game DVDs
from a fishing boat in Nanliao Fishing Port in Hsinchu early Monday.</P>
      <P>A CGA spokesman said the CGA officials found the pirated DVDs, with an estimated
market value of NT$12 million (US$461,340) in polystyrene boxes concealed under
18 tons of fish in the fishing boat.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that Tsai Tsung-ming, the 43-year-old captain of the fishing
boat Hsieh Fu, and his two crew members were referred to the Hsinchu Public
Prosecutors Office for violations of the nation's Copyright Law and the Customs
Anti-smuggling Act.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the pirated Wii, Xbox and PS2 games were apparently
manufactured  in China because the DVDs carry simplified Chinese characters. The
captain of the fishing boat admitted that he was asked by a friend to take the
fake video games from Pintan, Fujian province, to Taiwan, where they would fetch
good prices during the Christmas holiday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the fishing boat left Nanliao Port Dec. 18 and returned three
days later. CGA officials had placed the boat under surveillance and waited
until the captain began to unload his catch of fish to confiscate the pirated
goods.</P>

      <P>As many as 78 percent of Taiwan's people still support holding a referendum on
pushing for the country's U.N. membership under the name Taiwan despite a
negative response from the United States, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Tung Cheng-yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Tung, only 14.2 percent of the respondents said they would change
their attitude due to U.S. opposition to the planned referendum initiated by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party on Taiwan's U.N. cause.</P>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said last Friday in a year-end news
conference that the United States supports a one-China policy and opposes
Taiwan's referendum to join the United Nations as a provocative move.</P>
      <P>"It unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and it comes with no
real benefits for the people of Taiwan on the international stage. This is why
we oppose this referendum, " Rice said.</P>
      <P>Tung published the results of the MAC-commissioned public opinion poll at a
seminar sponsored by the privately-run Taiwan Thinktank. The MAC will officially
make public the survey's results Friday.</P>
      <P>In response  to Rice's description  of the referendum  as "provocative," Tung
said that the United States might have overlooked China's growing saber-rattling
over Taiwan and its relentless attempts to squeeze Taiwan out of the
international arena.</P>
      <P>Tung gave his assurances that Taiwan's official title, the Republic of China,
will be retained even if voters approve the referendum, and pointed out that it
is China which is continuously engaged  in altering  the cross-Taiwan  Strait
status quo and undermining peace in the region.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, China's ambition to swallow up Taiwan has been
unmistakable, with the number of its missiles targeting Taiwan increasing to
more than 1,000 at present.</P>
      <P>The root cause of cross-strait problems lies in China's refusal to recognize
Taiwan's independent sovereignty and the fact that Taiwan does not form part of
China, he said, stressing that the DPP-initiated referendum merely aims at
airing, in a peaceful and democratic manner, the keen desire of Taiwan's people
to play a greater international role.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu presided over a ground-breaking ceremony Monday for a
tropical botanical garden to be built in the southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has set aside NT$200 million (US$6.15 million)  to
develop the 23-hectare  garden bordering Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Chen said the botanical garden project is scheduled
for completion in two years: before Kaohsiung hosts the biennial World Games in
July 2009.</P>
      <P>She added that in the future, the botanical garden will be expanded to link with
two plots of land reserved for the No. 6 and No. 7 municipal parks and the
Fengshan reservoir, so that these facilities will form a vast ecological area,
with its 114-hectare area providing much space for the leisure activities of
Kaohsiung's residents.</P>
      <P>Chen said the city government has chosen the Hsiaokang district as the location
of the botanical garden because the area is bristling with factories that
discharge a lot of carbon dioxide into the neighborhood, and that residents in
the area deserve something good in return.</P>

bilateral ties after a Malawian newspapers said that African state is paving the

Foreign Affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>Phoebe Yeh, acting spokeswoman for the ministry said Yang is on a mission to

      <P>As many as 78 percent of Taiwan's people still support holding a referendum on
pushing for the country's U.N. membership under the name Taiwan despite a
negative response from the United States, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Tung Cheng-yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Tung, only 14.2 percent of the respondents said they would change
their attitude due to U.S. opposition to the planned referendum initiated by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party on Taiwan's U.N. cause.</P>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said last Friday in a year-end news
conference that the United States supports a one-China policy and opposes
Taiwan's referendum to join the United Nations as a provocative move.</P>
      <P>"It unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and it comes with no
real benefits for the people of Taiwan on the international stage. This is why
we oppose this referendum, " Rice said.</P>
      <P>Tung published the results of the MAC-commissioned public opinion poll at a
seminar sponsored by the privately-run Taiwan Thinktank. The MAC will officially
make public the survey's results Friday.</P>
      <P>In response  to Rice's description  of the referendum  as "provocative," Tung
said that the United States might have overlooked China's growing saber-rattling
over Taiwan and its relentless attempts to squeeze Taiwan out of the
international arena.</P>
      <P>Tung gave his assurances that Taiwan's official title, the Republic of China,
will be retained even if voters approve the referendum, and pointed out that it
is China which is continuously engaged  in altering  the cross-Taiwan  Strait
status quo and undermining peace in the region.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, China's ambition to swallow up Taiwan has been
unmistakable, with the number of its missiles targeting Taiwan increasing to
more than 1,000 at present.</P>
      <P>The root cause of cross-strait problems lies in China's refusal to recognize
Taiwan's independent sovereignty and the fact that Taiwan does not form part of
China, he said, stressing that the DPP-initiated referendum merely aims at
airing, in a peaceful and democratic manner, the keen desire of Taiwan's people
to play a greater international role.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu presided over a ground-breaking ceremony Monday for a
tropical botanical garden to be built in the southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government has set aside NT$200 million (US$6.15 million)  to
develop the 23-hectare  garden bordering Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Chen said the botanical garden project is scheduled
for completion in two years: before Kaohsiung hosts the biennial World Games in
July 2009.</P>
      <P>She added that in the future, the botanical garden will be expanded to link with
two plots of land reserved for the No. 6 and No. 7 municipal parks and the
Fengshan reservoir, so that these facilities will form a vast ecological area,
with its 114-hectare area providing much space for the leisure activities of
Kaohsiung's residents.</P>
      <P>Chen said the city government has chosen the Hsiaokang district as the location
of the botanical garden because the area is bristling with factories that
discharge a lot of carbon dioxide into the neighborhood, and that residents in
the area deserve something good in return.</P>

      <P>"Happy Kaohsiung" will include the development of a healthful economy, provision
of a comfortable living environment in its communities, the city's
transformation into an international metropolis, and turn the city into a model

      <P>Better later than never, a health official said Tuesday in an effort to persuade
more members of the general public to get vaccinated against the flu.</P>
      <P>Shih Wun-yi, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control under the
Department of Health, said the vaccine shot becomes fully effective only after
three weeks, meaning that those taking it now will be shielded for only part of
the peak flu season, which lasts from Christmas to early February. The vaccine
is effective in helping to ward off the disease for a year afterward, but is
most useful in the first six months.</P>
      <P>Noting that the incidence of flu has reached alarming levels in the counties of
Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Hualien, Taitung, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung,
Shih said there are still 350,000 doses of the vaccine available in the country.</P>
      <P>He urged people who intend to take the government-funded free flu vaccine shots
go to nearby hospitals or medical centers.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the remaining 260,000 doses for adults and 88,000 doses for
children will last through the next two weeks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No change in status quo despite U.N. bid referendum: MOFA</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's planned referendum on pursuing U.N. membership under the name Taiwan
will not alter the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) reiterated Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA acting spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh made the comments in a news conference after
Singapore's Foreign Ministry aired its objection to Taiwan's referendum plan
earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>According to Singapore, a referendum on applying for U.N. membership for Taiwan
is provocative and would increase Taiwan's isolation in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Foreign Ministry also stressed its "one China" policy and its
opposition to either side of the strait taking unilateral move to change the
status quo between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Expressing regret over Singapore's negative response to the issue, Yeh ascribed
the development to pressure from China.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that holding the referendum merely aims to transmit the keen desire of
Taiwan's people to join the United Nations, and asserted that doing so will
neither contribute to a change in Taiwan's official designation, nor alter the
cross-strait status quo, or cause instability in the region.</P>
      <P>According to a ranking MOFA official, Singapore's negative reaction to Taiwan's
planned referendum is a follow-up to explicit opposition from the United States.</P>
      <P>The official, who preferred anonymity, criticized the U.S. side for dancing to
Beijing's tune and voiced grave concerns that pressure from China  and the
United  States  would  negatively  affect international opinion toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he expressed hope that the international community would have
faith in Taiwan's ability to adequately  hold the referendum and deal with
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said last Friday in a year-end  news
conference that the United States  supports  a "one China" policy and opposes
Taiwan's referendum to join the United Nations, describing the move as a
"provocative policy."</P>
      <P>"It unnecessarily raises tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and it comes with no
real benefits for the people of Taiwan on the international stage. This is why
we oppose this referendum, " Rice said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said Tuesday that it will continue
safeguarding the mausoleums of the late presidents Chiang Kai-shek and his son
Chiang Ching-kuo before handing over administration of the sites to the Taoyuan
county government.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Yu Sy-tue said at a briefing Tuesday that after the shutdown of
its mausoleum administration in Taoyuan county, northern Taiwan and the
withdrawal of military guards posted at the two mausoleums Dec. 24, security
will still be provided.</P>
      <P>Yu said the district reserve command is now in charge of taking inventory of the
assets and artifacts of the mausoleums to pave the way for transfer operations.</P>
      <P>In addition to the reserve command officials and the transfer team,  the
military police stationed nearby will also provide security, said Yu.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed out that the Ministry of the Interior will be in charge of the
relocation and interment of the two late presidents, and the MND will act in
accordance with its instructions.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the ministry had originally planned to complete the relocation of
the remains of the two late presidents to Wutzushan military cemetery in Taipei
county for burial by September 2005, but family members of the late presidents
-- citing the deaths of Faina Chiang, wife of Chiang Ching-kuo, in December
2004, and Nancy Chiang, daughter-in-law of the late president in August 2005,
which dealt the family a great blow -- couldn't reach a decision on the time of
relocation.</P>
      <P>The MND said the ministry wrote to the late president's family members Nov. 29
to inform them that the MND management and the guards of the two mausoleums will
be withdrawn and to express the ministry's hope that they would make a decision
on interment, but has yet to receive an answer.</P>
      <P>MND officials also said that out of security concerns, before the handover of
the mausoleums and their re-opening, the military will only consent to visits
from Chiang's family members.</P>
      <P>The elder Chiang died in 1975, while his son passed away in 1988. Originally,
both were temporarily placed in Tashi until such time as their bodies could be
returned to China for proper burial.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, branding the elder Chiang a dictator, said recently
that there is no reason to use taxpayers' money to guard his mausoleum any
longer.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan county government has said it is willing to take over the
administration of the two mausoleums, noting that they bring a great deal of
tourism revenue to the county annually. revenue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of containers handled at Kaohsiung harbor in southern Taiwan in 2007
is expected to hit a new high of 10.2 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs),
officials at the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The figure would mean an increase of 4.4 percent, or 430,000 TEUs, over 2006 --
the year in which Kaohsiung harbor handled a record 9,774,670 TEUs to retain its
status as the sixth largest container port in the world.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the number of containers handled at Kaohsiung harbor
this year formally surpassed the 10 million mark Dec. 24 when Ever Ursula, a
container ship of Evergreen Marine Corp. -- Taiwan's biggest shipping line --
offloaded over 5,000 containers.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung  Harbor Bureau is currently  working  on an intercontinental
container center project within the harbor. When the first stage of the project
is completed, the harbor's container handling capacity will increase by 2
million TEUs a year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung used to be the world's third largest container port in the 1990s, but
its ranking has slipped in recent years.</P>
      <P>Based on figures from 2006,  Containerisation International Magazine, an
authoritative source of information about the container industry, has ranked
Kaohsiung as the world's sixth largest container port, after five other seaports

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and his wife were summoned early this
month for questioning on the use of Lien's "special allowance funds" during his
tenures as premier and vice president, a spokesman for the Special Investigation
Task Force under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the special task force is also engaged in the investigation into the
legitimacy of the KMT's sale of its assets, the spokesman for the panel said
that the unit has been looking into the party's asset transaction records and
relevant materials to learn more about the party's funding sources and cash
flow.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added the actions came after the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party legislative caucus filed a petition with the Supreme Prosecutors Office to
probe into suspected misuse of "special allowance funds" of 97 Cabinet chiefs
and officials under the previous KMT administration, including former premiers
Hau Pei-tsun, Lien Chan and Vincent Siew as well as the KMT's standard bearer
for the 2008 presidential election Ma Ying-jeou, who used to be minister of
justice, chairman of the Research, Development, and Evaluation Commission and
vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the panel has looked into the original accounting
proofs and accounting  books and summoned witnesses to give testimony in the
cases against Lien, the current KMT's vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew,
incumbent KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung,  former Examination Yuan President Hsu
Shui-teh and many other officials.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Lien was allowed to return after answering inquiries from the
prosecutors as to how he claimed reimbursement of his "special allowance funds"
and "state affairs fund" during his premir and vice presidential terms,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that to gain a better understanding of progress in the
handling of the cases, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators Gao
Jyh-peng, Hsieh Hsin-ni, Wang Tuoh and Yang Fang-wan paid a visit to Chen Yun-
nan, director of the Special Investigation Task Force, Monday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the investigative panel handled special fund cases involving the
DPP officials in an extraordinary speedy manner, the DPP lawmakers complained
during their meeting with Chen that the cases involving the KMT's Lien, Siew and
Wu have progressed in a relative slow manner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, indicating that Lien allegedly used Pacific Sogo Department Store's
uniform invoices to claim reimbursement from his "state affairs fund" totalling
NT$1.2 million while serving as the country's vice president, Hsieh questioned
why the investigation panel has yet to produce any results concerning the case.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen explained that as prosecutors, who were assigned to take
charge of cases related to the transfer of KMT assets and special funds, have
been concurrently dealing with the special allowance cases involving DPP
heavyweights, such as Vice President Annette Lu, they are too busy to handle all
the cases at the same time.</P>
      <P>Chen added, however, that the prosecutors will ratchet up their efforts on the
KMT cases.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential hopeful Ma Ying-jeou, and his
running mate, Vincent Siew, may be summoned for questioning over their use of
special allowance funds while serving as ranking appointees in the previous KMT
administration, Chen Yun-nan, a spokesman for the Supreme Prosecutors Office

Prosecutors Office, said Ma and Siew may be summoned and questioned by
prosecutors if necessary, regardless of any possible impact on the approaching
March 22, 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the special investigation panel has been doing its best to
probe the cases involving Ma and Siew following due process of the law after the
legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) filed a
charge May 17 with the Supreme Prosecutors Office accusing 97 former KMT Cabinet
chiefs and ranking government officials of embezzling special allowance funds or
state affairs funds allocated for their discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Ma, who used to be justice minister, chairman of the Research, Development, and
Evaluation Commission and vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, and
Siew, who served as premier and minister of economic affairs, are among those
under investigation, as are former Vice President Lien Chan and former Premier
Hau Pei-tsun.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the prosecutors in charge have interrogated Lien and his wife
as well as secretaries and accounting officials of ex-Examination Yuan President
Hsu Shui-teh, among many others, for the same purpose.</P>
      <P>In response to speculation that Siew might be interrogated in the near term by
the special investigation panel over his special allowance funds when serving in

      <P>The government will boost its investment in a power plant renovation project in
the northern county of Taipei to NT$152.4 billion (US$4.7 billion) due to
soaring international prices for raw materials and machines, an economic
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
originally planned to allocate NT$83 billion for the state-run Taiwan Power
Co.'s (Taipower's) Linkou power plant renovation, the CEPD official noted.</P>
      <P>The investment plan has been held up for two years due to some
environmentalists' concerns about the environmental impact of the plan, the CEPD
official noted.</P>
      <P>Two years ago, prices of equipment and materials were low, the official went on,
adding that now, the approval of the plan comes amid a boom in construction
projects in China and India, which has resulted in skyrocketing prices of raw
materials and rising demands for equipment and machines.</P>
      <P>In addition,  an increasing  number of professionals  with experience working on
the plant have begun to retire, which will further delay the completion of the
renovation, slated for 2020, and increase costs, according to a Taipower
spokesman.</P>
      <P>The power plant, which supplies electricity to northern Taiwan, will use more
efficient components in the future and produce less air pollution, the spokesman

      <P>Wei Hsi-ju, a student of the NCKU's Department of Life Sciences, won an award

      <P>The Apple Daily newspaper produces the most detailed news reports and has the
greatest influence on society compared with other Chinese-language newspapers in
Taiwan, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that the United Daily News has the most in-depth news
stories, while the Taipei-based China Times has the most widespread coverage of
global events.</P>
      <P>The survey, now in its fourth year, was conducted by Shih Hsin University's
College of Journalism and Communications among 1,100 people aged between 15 and
64 in 25 cities and counties via face-to-face interviews.</P>
      <P>The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The survey -- which also included the interviewees' preferences in terms of
local magazines, radio stations, television stations and Web portals in Taiwan
-- is part of the college's efforts to understand the public's evaluations of
the quality of the media and the media's social influence, said James Hsiung,
dean of the college.</P>

newspapers and the Internet and that TV news channels are the biggest source of
news for the respondents.</P>
      <P>However, he described the objectivity of TV news as doubtful, as TV stations
often compete to obtain news as fast as possible.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that the respondents regard the United Daily News, Apple Daily,

the United Daily -- has the most detailed and news stories, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>The top three newspapers in terms of in-depth news articles are the United Daily

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reiterated Tuesday the central government's support
for a "one-step" voting format designed by the Central Election Commission (CEC)
for the coming legislative elections and two accompanying referendums.</P>
      <P>Chang made clear the Executive Yuan's stance to reporters in YiIan County,
northeastern Taiwan, where he attended two ceremonies marking the inauguration
of a national highway memorial plaque and a Tourism Bureau administration office
in the Northeastern National Scenic Area in the county.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside accusations that the Executive Yuan's insistence on applying the
"one-step"  voting format is merely electoral maneuvering  or political
infighting,  Chang said the central government, based on the principle of rule
of law, aims to ensure smooth and orderly polls by choosing the "one-step"
procedure legally prescribed by the CEC.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan announced a day earlier that the "one-step" format must be
fully employed throughout Taiwan's 25 cities and counties in the legislative and
presidential elections slated for Jan. 12 and March 22, respectively.</P>
      <P>Election  commission  chiefs  and officials  of some local governments who
insist on the adoption of a "two-step" voting procedure in the two elections
will be replaced or brought to justice, according to Executive Yuan Secretary-
General Chen Jin-chun. Most of those who insist on adopting a "two-step" format
are from the main opposition Kuomintang-controlled localities.</P>

      <P>More than 110 million sleeping pills containing zolpidem were prescribed in
Taiwan in 2006, marking per capita annual consumption of nearly five pills,
Department of Health (DOH) officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A subsequent probe, the officials went on, discovered that at least 50 people
consumed the drugs -- covered by national health insurance -- in an amount
"beyond imagination, " with one consumer getting more than 7,300 pills with
doctor's prescriptions in a period of six months.</P>
      <P>The DOH has issued 17 marketing certificates for depressants and sleeping pills
containing zolpidem, a prescription medication used for the short-term treatment
of insomnia. Among these, the most popular in Taiwan is Stilnox, said Hsu Ping-
chang, head of the second division of the DOH National Bureau of Controlled
Drugs.</P>
      <P>Citing bureau statistics, Hsu said that 55.79 million pills of Stilnox were
prescribed in Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>In the middle of this year, Hsu went on, the bureau received many reports from
hospitals and clinics around the island suggesting that people were being paid
to get Stilnox prescriptions at hospitals and clinics.</P>
      <P>Since the cost of the medication is covered by the national insurance system,
the DOH suspects that many of the people who got prescriptions for large amounts
of Stilnox over the past half year were paid to do so by drug traffickers, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>The probe found that one woman from Taipei acquired 7,398 Stilnox-containing
sleeping pills during the January-June period, making her the largest single
consumer. The second-largest Stilnox consumer was found to have acquired 7,137
pills from various medical facilities, Hsu said, noting that such a volume would
mean that the person was consuming an average of 40 pills of Stilnox per day.</P>
      <P>These two people, along with 15 others, have been blacklisted by the DOH, which
has imposed restrictions against their requests for Stilnox, Hsu said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan spent NT$307 billion (US$9.5</P>
      <P>billion) on research and development in 2006, accounting for 2.58 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) for the year, a National Science Council
(NSC) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>NSC Vice Chairman Yang Hung-tun made the remarks after a meeting of NSC
commissioners during which the results of a national survey on 2006 R&amp;D were
unveiled.</P>
      <P>Quoting the survey results, Yang said the country's 2006 R&amp;D expenditure
grew by 9.3 percent over the 2005 level.</P>
      <P>In terms of the GDP ratio, Yang said, the 2006 figure increased 0.13 percentage
points from 2005, when R&amp;D spending accounted for 2.45 percent of that
year's GDP.</P>
      <P>Of the 2006 R&amp;D funding, the government sector contributed 31.4 percent of
the total, the industrial sector accounted for 67.2 percent and the remaining
1.4 percent came from other sectors, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the government's share of R&amp;D funds dropped slightly from the
2005 level of 31.5 percent, but the industrial sector's contribution increased
from 66.9 percent to 67.2 percent. In terms of the share contributed by other
sectors, including higher education  institutions,  non-profit  private
organizations  and expatriate donors, there was a decrease from 1. 6 percent to
1.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Because of legislative cuts, Yang said, the government's R&amp;D investment
increased a mere 8.8 percent in 2006 compared with the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Given the slow growth in the public R&amp;D funds, Yang said the NSC's goal of
having the country's total R&amp;D investment reach 3 percent of GDP cannot be
realized in 2008.</P>
      <P>"Many NSC commissioners expressed hope at Tuesday's meeting that the 3 percent
goal can be achieved in 2010, " Yang said, adding that the goal could be
attained if the government's annual R&amp;D spending can be increased by 10
percent to 12 percent.</P>

ongoing visit in mainland China is to promote the development of Taiwan-funded
companies and to establish a bridge of communication with related mainland
officials.

2000: Premier Chang Chun-hsiung presides over the inaugural ceremony of an
administrative coordination center on the frontline island of Kinmen for
managing affairs related to the "mini three links."

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A gentleman never competes in anything he does,
except perhaps in archery. But even then, when he wins he courteously makes his
bow before he advances to take his place among the winners; and, when he has
lost, he walks down and drinks his cup of forfeit. Thus, even in this case of
competition, he shows himself to be a gentleman."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>3.6% of industries, services overstaffed in 2007: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 3.6 percent of businesses in Taiwan's industrial and service sectors
were overstaffed this year, down 4.8 percentage points from 8.4 percent in 2005,
according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the improvement in the overstaffing situation to the
bettering business climate or corporate mergers in the manufacturing, financial
and insurance industries as well as the professional, scientific and technical
service industries.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the DGBAS in August, revealed that 4.5 percent of
businesses  in the industrial sector had too many employees, including 5.1
percent of those in the mining and quarrying industries, 4.7 percent in the
manufacturing industry, and 3.8 percent in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 3.1 percent of businesses in the service sector were overstaffed,
including 5.5 percent of those in the accommodation and restaurant industries,
5.4 percent in the cultural, sports and leisure service industries, and 5
percent in the medical and healthcare service industries, the results showed.</P>
      <P>Among businesses in the Hsinchu Science Park, only 1 percent were overstaffed,
marking a drop of 7.3 percentage points from 8.3 percent in the previous survey
carried out in June 2005. No overstaffing was reported among businesses in the
Central Taiwan Science Park and the Southern Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>The survey found that sluggish sales were responsible for the overstaffing
problem in Taiwan's industrial and service sectors, with 92 percent of the
overstaffed businesses coping with the situation by leaving new vacancies
unfilled.</P>
      <P>While 66.7 percent of overstaffed businesses in the Hsinchu Science Park
attributed the problem to corporate reorganization, 33.3 percent blamed it on
sluggish sales.</P>
      <P>On measures to cope with overstaffing, 66.7 percent of the businesses laid off
excess workers or transferred them to other departments or affiliated
businesses, compared with 33.3 percent which left new vacancies unfilled,
according to the survey results.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan economic growth forecast at 4.2% for 2008: think-tank</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA)
12/26/07  13:08:48
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Polaris Research Institute forecast Wednesday that Taiwan's
economic growth will reach 4.2 percent for 2008, slightly lower than this year's
5.41 percent, mainly as a result of slower growth abroad.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth for 2008 is expected to be lower mainly due to the fact
that overseas markets, particularly the United States, Europe and China, which
have been driving forces behind Taiwan's economic growth over the last two
years, are forecast to be "highly uncertain, " said Liang Kuo-yuan, president of
the research think-tank, at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Domestically, Liang said, consumption in the private sector is expected to grow
"mildly" for 2008 due to a higher level of per capita income.</P>
      <P>On the inflation rate, Liang predicted that the consumer price index (CPI) will
reach 1.95 percent for 2008, marking an increase over the level for 2007 which
is forecast to top 1.55 percent, mainly as a result of rising prices of crude
oil and raw food materials on the international market.</P>
      <P>Liang also predicted that the country's currency, the New Taiwan dollar, will
not gain much against the U.S. dollar next year -- saying the exchange rate will
be around NT$32 to US$1 for the year -- mainly because the NT dollar has not
appreciated much while the greenback has depreciated over the past several
months and because an end to capital flight from Taiwan is not yet in sight.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the think-tank revised upward its forecast for Taiwan's economic
growth for 2007 from 4.61 percent to 5.41 percent, with a CPI expansion of 1.55
percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Feb. 1 launch of bullet train service which has shortened travel time
between Taiwan's two largest cities --  Taipei in the north and Kaohsiung  in
the south --  to one-and-a-half hours has been selected as the top domestic news
event of 2007.</P>
      <P>The Central News Agency annually selects the year's top 10 local news stories.
For this year, the selection was based on events occurring before Nov. 30.</P>
      <P>The inauguration of the 345-km high-speed railway which has emerged as one of
Taiwan's most important long-distance transport arteries linking all major
cities and counties in western Taiwan has drawn prominent media coverage in
Taiwan, leading to its selection by CNA as the top news story of 2007.</P>
      <P>Second on the top 10 list is the successive breakouts of financial scandals
involving Rebar Asia Pacific Group and Eastern Multimedia Group, led by Wang
You-theng and his son Gary Wang, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Wangs were accused of having embezzled more than NT$100 billion (US$3.09
billion) in corporate funds and committing a spate of other financial crimes.
The senior Wang and his wife remain at large in the United States, while Gary
Wang has been detained for investigations. The snowballing Wang family financial
scandals led to the resignation of Shih Jun-ji as Financial Supervisory
Commission chairman on Jan. 12.</P>
      <P>Other news events that made the top 10 list are as follows in order of
importance:</P>
      <P>-- The 2008 presidential election is poised to be a "final duel" between the
country's two bitter rival political camps that will pit the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) ticket of Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang against the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) team of Ma Ying-jeou and Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>-- Investigations into suspected misuse of "special allowance funds" by
incumbent and former senior government officials continue unceasingly. Ma Ying-
jeou was indicted on charges of graft over misuse of the public funds allocated
for his discretionary use during his tenure as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006 but
was acquitted in the first trial. In the DPP-led "pan-green" camp, Frank Hsieh
and Su Tseng-chang were exonerated of any corruption charges with regard to
their use of public funds during their respective tenures as premier and local
government head, but Vice President Annette Lu and former Premier Yu Shyi-kun
were indicted on charges of embezzlement of public funds.</P>
      <P>-- Skyrocketing oil and raw material prices, coupled with typhoon damage, have
fueled an upward spiral in domestic consumer prices, with the annual growth rate
of the Consumer Price Index reaching a 13-year high of 5.34 percent in October.</P>
      <P>-- The government applied to join the United Nations under the name Taiwan for
the first time. The Executive Yuan has launched an intensive publicity campaign
to drum up support for this new policy, with the ruling DPP initiating a
referendum on the bid to be held alongside next year's presidential election
scheduled for March 22. As a counter move, the KMT initiated a referendum on the
country applying to return to the United Nations under its official title, the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>-- The Legislative Yuan completed the third reading of the National Pension Act,
which is set to take effect Oct. 1, 2008. Under the act, those who are not
covered in the existing civil service and labor insurance programs can join the
national pension program and will be eligible to receive about NT$9,000 per
month until their death so long as they pay a due amount of premium for 40 full
years.</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan-born New York Yankees star pitcher Chien-Ming Wang made the "2007 Time
100" list, making him the third Taiwanese citizen to be selected by Time
Magazine as one of the 100 most influential persons in the world after President
Chen Shui-bian and Oscar-winning film director Ang Lee.</P>
      <P>-- Ang Lee won the coveted top honor in the 2007 Venice Film Festival with his
steamy spy thriller "Lust, Caution." It was the second time that the New York-
based director captured the Golden Lion for best film, the Italian film
festival's top honor. In 2005, Lee won the award for "Brokeback Mountain, " a
gay cowboy romance movie which also earned him a best director Oscar.</P>
      <P>-- The government launched a drive to replace the word "China" or "Chinese" in
the titles of several state-owned enterprises with the word "Taiwan" to protect
them from being mistaken as companies in China. For instance, Chunghua Post was
renamed Taiwan Post; Chinese Petroleum Corp. was re-designated CPC Corp.,
Taiwan; and China Shipbuilding Corp. was renamed Taiwan Shipbuilding Corp.
Meanwhile, the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, which was dedicated to the late
President Chiang Kai-shek, has been renamed the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall.
Chiang was branded by the DPP as a dictator and main perpetrator of the tragic
228 Incident of 1947.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't to purchase domestically-grown rice at higher prices</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has decided to offer a higher unit price for the purchase of
domestically-grown rice in a bid to help offset rice farmers' higher production
costs, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will offer an extra NT$2 for each
kilogram of rice that the government purchases from domestic rice farmers,
beginning from the first rice harvest next year, Chang said at a regular Cabinet
meeting.</P>
      <P>Some 230,000 rice farmers around the country are expected to benefit from the
policy, with their income increasing by an estimated NT$21,000 for each hectare
of rice they grow, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that rice has been the country's most important farm crop, with about
270,000 hectares of rice paddies nationwide. However, he continued, the unit
price that the government has offered for the purchase of rice from private rice
farmers has remained unchanged for over 14 years.</P>
      <P>Rice farmers have suffered from higher production costs and lower profit margins
in recent years mainly as a result of higher-priced fertilizers and oil products
for their rice-farming machines, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the COA will work to help domestic rice farmers establish a
nationwide traceability system to help raise their crop's competitiveness
against imported rice.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's investor sentiment for December plunged to the second-lowest level in
the past four years as confidence collapsed amid recent fluctuations in global
stock markets and domestic political uncertainties, according to the results of
a bimonthly survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The results showed that Taiwan's investor sentiment  index nosedived 102 points
from October to stand at -104.7 in December, the second-lowest level since the
survey started in December 2003. The lowest level was recorded in October 2005
at -109.4.</P>
      <P>Also falling in December were investors' optimism about achieving their
investment targets over the next three months, maintaining their present income
over the coming year, the stock market outlook over the next three months, the
unemployment rate over the next three months, and consumer prices over the next
three months.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Shih Hsin University in cooperation with Business
Today magazine on 1,119 stock investors Dec. 10-20. It has a margin of error of
3 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that the outcome of the March 22, 2008 presidential election
will affect the trading decisions of the investors.</P>
      <P>Compared with 41 percent of respondents who said they will increase their stock
purchases if opposition Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou is elected, 42 percent
said they will reduce the number of stocks they own if ruling Democratic
Progressive Party candidate Frank Hsieh is elected, according to the results.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the largest number of respondents believe that the
relations between the ruling and opposition parties are the most important
factor that will affect the movement of Taiwan's main stock index over the next
two months. Other major factors mentioned include the movement of international
stock markets, the development of the U.S. subprime mortgage financial crisis,
and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results showed that 86 percent of respondents will invest in
mutual funds in 2008, with over 50 percent preferring those targeting Asian
emerging markets. The second-most popular type of mutual funds are those
targeting European markets and Latin American markets.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy in 2007 is forecast to expand by 5.46 percent, far outpacing
the government's original target of 4.6 percent, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a regular Executive Yuan weekly meeting in which a
2008 national development program was approved.</P>
      <P>Citing the most recent forecasts of the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , compiled in November, Chang reported
that private sector investment funneled into the domestic market for the whole
of this year will hit NT$2.67 trillion (US$82.5 billion) , up by 5.07 percent
over the 2006 level, and that the country's annual foreign trade will total
NT$529.4 billion, a 24.07 percent increase over the previous year's figure.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the better-than-expected economic growth to an improved
domestic investment  environment  and he thanked all government agencies for
their efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the government's economic theme in 2008 will focus on
boosting investment, taking care of the underprivileged, sustainable development
of national territory, cracking down on corruption and exploring foreign
relations so as to "create jobs and narrow the gap between urban and rural areas
and between rich and poor."</P>
      <P>The country's economic growth rate for the coming year has been set at 4.8
percent, with a jobless rate of below 3.8 percent and a consumer price index
increase of less than 2 percent, according to Chang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local economist criticized Wednesday a proposal by opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
vice presidential candidate Vincent Siew to develop Taiwan into a free trade
zone (FTZ) as "more a loss than a gain, " claiming that such an opening would
harm local manufacturers and workers.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih,  chairman of the non-profit  policy research organization Taiwan
Thinktank, made the comment in a speech titled "The Direction and Strategies of
International Cooperation" at a conference held by the Industrial Development
Bureau on industrial upgrading and transformation.</P>
      <P>Chen, who once served as minister of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said no country will be willing to open its doors to Taiwan just
because Taiwan opens its own for barrier-free trading.</P>
      <P>Under World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations in terms of most-favored nation
treatment, any WTO member that opens its market and offers privileged trading
treatment to another member is obliged to treat all other members in the same
way, unless the opening is part of a mutual free trade agreement (FTA), Chen
explained.</P>
      <P>"Will there be a country willing to open its doors to the whole world only
because Taiwan unilaterally opens its own and that country wants to do the same
thing for Taiwan?" the economist asked.</P>
      <P>Once they get the Taiwan market, the foreign countries will never want to
"sacrifice" theirs, which Chen claimed would be the result of an FTZ. He further
claimed that Taiwan's opening its market would put the country in a situation in
which foreign economies would take advantage of the Taiwan market, while Taiwan
would not have access to theirs.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said that international cooperation is still a good way for local
enterprises to expand their business and profits, and he suggested that the
government try to find other kinds of cooperation relations that would pose a
lesser threat to local businesses.</P>
      <P>He said that signing FTAs with developed countries is the way Taiwan should
follow in efforts to boost foreign trade.</P>
      <P>Siew, a former premier who also served as minister of economic affairs in the
previous KMT administration, proposed the FTZ idea in May in a speech to a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
12/26/07  17:15:30
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Chiou I-jen said Wednesday that it is easy to talk about
liberalizing business and trade exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, but
difficult to really do it.</P>
      <P>Noting that the presidential candidates of both the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the opposition Kuomintang have vowed to open cross-strait
business and trade if elected, Chiou said that actually doing so would be a real
challenge, as any opening is "stuck" at the thorny issue of sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on his opinions at an Executive Yuan year-end news conference, Chiou
took the tourism exchange program as an example, saying that Taiwan will never
accept the notion of "Taiwan, China" to refer to Taiwan during cross-strait
tourism talks. "Such talks will definitely come to a dead end if China refuses
to budge on the sovereignty issue," he added.</P>
      <P>On the opening of Chinese banking institutions establishing branches or
subsidiaries in Taiwan, Chiou said it is an unavoidable trend and that Chinese
banks will be allowed into Taiwan sooner or later.</P>
      <P>This matter, however, has also been "stuck" and has not make any headway because
both sides are firm on their respective insistence on the establishment of a
supervisory system over banking operations.</P>
      <P>Talking about the surge of activity in sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) on
international financial markets, especially in China and the Middle East, Chiou
said an SWF -- defined by Investopedia as "a pool of money derived from a
country's reserves, set aside for investment purposes that will benefit the
country's economy and citizens" --  is a financial product that has advantages
and disadvantages. "My stance is that SWFs should be managed vigilantly," he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted, most of the partially or wholly state-owned banks in Taiwan
are small in size and big in number. He said that two would be enough for
Taiwan, adding that the rest should be either merged or sold. "The government
would like to help if any foreign financial group is interested in the
acquisition of these banks, " he said.</P>
      <P>Chiou made the remarks while answering questions from local and foreign
reporters on a wide range of topics, including the opening of cross-strait
business and trade, the second round of the government's financial reforms and
bank mergers.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung also spoke at the news conference to blame Beijing for
a "lack of progress" in tourism-opening talks because of China's political
considerations.</P>
      <P>He added that officials from the two sides must meet to work out a solution to
this issue.</P>

    <TEXT>Los Angeles TimesG Court backs rights of insured.

California health insurers have a duty to check the accuracy of applications for
coverage before issuing policies--and should not wait until patients run up big
medical bills, a state appeals court ruled Monday. The court also said insurers
could not cancel a medical policy unless they showed that the policyholder
willfully misrepresented his health or that the company had investigated the
application before it issued coverage. ]By Lu-sheng Chu^</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung expressed hope Wednesday that controversy surrounding
the voting format of the upcoming elections will come to an end now that the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has addressed misgivings about the voting system.</P>
      <P>The premier said 18 cities and counties controlled by the main opposition
Kuomintang might think local election commissions can decide the setup of
polling stations under a provision of the Public Officials Election and Recall
Law.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that when the MOI -- which is in charge of disputes over
election affairs and the application of the Public Officials Election and Recall
Law -- makes an interpretation of the law, it is legally binding.</P>
      <P>Chang said the setup of the polling stations covers such issues as the location
of the stations and the management of election staff, while the voting system is
not part of the polling station setup but a "voting procedure."</P>
      <P>Chang reaffirmed that the CEC is in charge of the Jan. 12 legislative elections
and will command local election commissions.</P>
      <P>"Since the MOI has decided on a 'one-step' voting system, the election
commissions  of Taipei  and 17 other local election commissions have no right to
make different resolutions," he said.</P>
      <P>The ruling and the opposition parties are on a collision course over the Jan. 12
elections with accompanying referendums.</P>
      <P>Under the one-step format, each voter will receive two ballots for the
legislative elections and two referendum ballots at the same time and then cast
them into four different boxes. One of the two legislative ballots is for a
candidate, while the other is for a political party.</P>
      <P>Voters will also be asked to use the two referendum ballots to indicate whether
they support the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-initiated proposal to
force the KMT to return its ill-gotten assets to the national coffers, as well
as a KMT-backed proposal to wipe out official corruption.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang-controlled 18 cities and counties want to use a "two-
step" system, which means that voters will be given two ballots in the first
step, after which they will cast these ballots before deciding whether to take
part in the referendum votes. Local election officials in these areas claim that
the format, used in the 2004 presidential election, will avoid error and
confusion.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opened an anti-vote-buying center
Wednesday as part of efforts to thwart vote-buying in the approaching
legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who also serves as DPP chairman, held a news

new facility, urging voters to support clean elections and say no to "black
gold" or politicians with shady links to organized crime.</P>
      <P>The idea of building an anti-vote-buying mechanism in the party was formed in a

instructed that a task force be organized to oversee anti-vote-buying
activities. Vice President Annette Lu was appointed as the team's convener.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is glad to see the party set up the center within less than a

in Israel's GIZA Venture Fund V to  facilitate  the  transfer  of information

      <P>Yeh Ming-feng, an executive secretary of the NDF, said GIZA is Israel's third-
largest private venture capital company and that the NDF also previously
invested NT$450 million (US$14 million) in the GIZA Venture Fund IV.</P>

      <P>People who spend too much time playing video games, especially violent video
games, may risk damaging brain functions and affect their learning and emotional
control, according to findings of a study released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Yuan-hua, a doctor in the Department of Psychiatry of Taipei Veterans
General Hospital, enlisted 30 youngsters -- all aged 25 -- as research subjects.</P>
      <P>They were given physical examinations to monitor changes in blood circulation in
their brains before and after each played a video game for 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>The study found that the act of playing video games obviously causes a decreased
blood flow in the brain, and that the effect is even more pronounced in those
playing violent video games.</P>
      <P>Noting that the study focused on subjects who played video games for only 30
minutes, Chou said many youngsters spend far more time on video games each day,
unaware that doing so on a long term basis could damage the frontal lobe of the
brain, as well as the anterior cingulate gyrus.</P>
      <P>He explained that the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, located at the front
of the brain, is associated with thinking, speaking, decision-making and impulse
control, while the anterior cingulate gyrus, located in the medial wall of the
frontal lobe, modulates internal emotional responses.</P>
      <P>Although no conclusions as yet have been drawn regarding what might happen if
blood flow to these brain areas is diminished frequently, it is already known
that frontal lobe damage can leave a person emotionally adrift, opening him or
her up to odd mood changes and variations in social behavior and personality.</P>
      <P>Chou added that clinical experiences have proven that patients with
schizophrenia or depression have significantly lower blood flows in their
frontal lobes and anterior cingulate gyruses.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday that the government will continue
working on "cementing democracy, reinforcing Taiwan's sovereignty, improving
social security and stepping up balanced development in all regions."</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while presiding over an Executive Yuan year-end news
conference. He hailed what he described as the Cabinet's performance in building
"prosperity, justice, democracy and sustainable growth" in society over the past
seven months since he assumed office.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Chiou I-jen, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Jin-chun and
several ministers without portfolio also attended the press conference.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, Taiwan's economy will grow by 5.46 percent for 2007,
its jobless rate will drop to a low of 3.81 percent and export levels will
achieve a record high. All the Taiwan people are entitled to share the country's
economic progress, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang  promised  that  the government  will wipe  out all irregularities that
could affect the smooth and orderly holding of the coming legislative and
presidential elections, which he said will write a new page in Taiwan's
development.</P>
      <P>The government's "pragmatic" efforts to advance the country's bid to join the
United Nations under the name Taiwan this year has pushed the world to face the
reality that Taiwan is not part of China, he went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the government is also engaged in promoting welfare
programs for the elderly, the young, the underprivileged and minority groups.</P>
      <P>In terms of the industrial upgrading of traditional and small businesses, he
added, the government earmarked NT$10 billion in August to help small companies
and another NT$10 billion to assist some 150 enterprises in the agricultural
sector in innovating expertise.</P>
      <P>To reverse a long-term lack of development equilibrium between north and south,
the government will allocate NT$100 billion over the coming 10 years to finance
a village renovation program aimed at helping farmers overhaul their living
environments, he said.</P>

      <P>The number of containers handled at Keelung harbor in northern Taiwan in 2007
hit a record high of 2.17 million 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) as of Dec. 25,
officials at the Keelung Harbor Bureau said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The figure indicates an increase of 4.39 percent, or 91,664 TEUs, over the same
period last year, breaking the record of 2.16 million TEUs set in 1995.</P>
      <P>Harbor officials said that although the world economy has not been in the best
of shape due to the U.S. subprime crisis and soaring crude oil prices, Keelung
harbor has performed well for two consecutive years, attributing the reason to a
series of preferential measures offered by the harbor.</P>
      <P>They said that Israel's ZIM, one of the largest container shipping companies in
the world, chose Keelung as its container transshipping center in Asia this
year, which has also contributed greatly to the volume increase.</P>
      <P>The officials said that looking ahead, the volume handled next year should reach
2.26 million TEUs, based on average growth of 2.43 percent over the past three
years.</P>

lines of the Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Mass Rapid Transit Bureau under the Kaohsiung city government

    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a voting method dispute between the central and some local governments,
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman  Huang Yu-chen said Wednesday  that
none of the 18 KMT-controlled localities has softened its stance regarding the
issue.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the KMT's insistence on adopting a "two-step" voting format,
rather than the "one-step" method prescribed by the Central Election Commission
(CEC), is aimed at securing a smooth and orderly holding of next year's
legislative and presidential elections slated for Jan. 12 and March 22,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In compliance with the Constitution,  the Public Officials Election and Recall
Law, Law on the Local Government Systems, interpretations by Council of Grand
Justices or a recent legislative resolution, the 18 cities and counties are
legally entitled to employ a "two-step" format, Huang stressed.</P>
      <P>The CEC has been manipulated by the Executive Yuan and the Executive Yuan erred
severely by meddling in the CEC's operations, he said.</P>
      <P>Huang also expressed his belief that Hsinchu City will remain firm in the
application of the "two-step" voting format, although its mayor, Lin Junq-tzer,
resigned a day earlier from his post as municipal election commission chief due
to pressure from the central government.</P>
      <P>In a press release issued later the same day, Lin stressed that he decided to
quit Hsinchu City's election commission chairmanship to help prevent the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and CEC from rigging the elections.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said Monday that the "one-step"
method must be implemented throughout Taiwan's 25 cities and counties in the
coming two polls, and electoral personnel who disobey the order will be replaced
or brought to justice.</P>
      <P>In response to the CEC having added an article to its regulations on replacing
electoral officials in localities, Tseng Yun-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and head of
the party's Policy Coordination Committee, said such a move seeking to remove
electoral personnel through an administrative decree is totally unconstitutional
and attacked the Executive Yuan for reducing the CEC to its pawn.</P>

      <P>Among these,  the investment  project presented  by Taiwan Polysilicon Corp.,

industry, accounts for the bulk of new investment.</P>
      <P>With its new investment reaching NT$6.33 billion, the Taiwan Polysilicon Corp.

industry are imported from the United States, Japan and Germany, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that polysilicon will be in strong demand over the next three to five

    <TEXT>
      <P>The year 2008 is expected to be one of slow economic growth for almost all major
economies and Taiwan is no exception with an economic growth rate estimated at
4.23 percent, the head of the Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The estimated economic growth rate for Taiwan is slightly lower than the 10-year
average of 4.38 percent and more than one percentage point lower than the
expected economic growth rate of 5.29 percent for 2007. The growth in domestic
consumption and investment are also limited, said TRI President Liu Tai-ying.</P>
      <P>A slowing economy in the United States and higher oil prices are the biggest
factors expected to impact Taiwan and the rest of the world in 2008, Liu said at
a forum looking into the economic prospects for 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's already robust export sector is still expected to grow by more than
four percent, but the same cannot be said of domestic consumption and investment
given the falling consumer confidence, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>TRI estimated a 2.92 percent growth rate in domestic consumption next year,
which will be higher than the 2.88 percent growth rate of 2007. The slight
increase will result from an increasing labor force participation rate and
relatively low unemployment rate as well as the short-term impact of the
presidential election, said TRI Vice President Wu Tsai-yi.</P>
      <P>The growth rate in private sector investment is expected to be 4.12 percent,
lower than the 4.99 percent of 2007, Wu said. The rate will be about the same as
the economic growth rate, although in the past it was 1.8 times the economic
growth rate, Wu said.</P>
      <P>A number of instances of pubic investment have not been passed in the
Legislature over the past year after becoming ensnared in the process of
environmental evaluation and by protests from environment protection groups,
which are hurting the national economy, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>The global economy will be in a period of adjustment in the first quarter of
2008 due to the impact of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and high oil prices,
but is expected to be more stable starting in the second quarter, said Wu Chung-
hsu, a researcher at Academia Sinica.</P>

      <P>Cho made the remarks at a news conference held Dec. 18 to celebrate the second
anniversary of his assuming office and review the progress made thus far.</P>
      <P>Soon after taking up his post, Cho began to implement a blueprint for the
development of the county.</P>
      <P>According to the blueprint, the county government is to push forward with two
major city projects, develop four major industrial areas, establish six major
traffic networks, and enhance the quality of life in eight major areas, Cho
noted.</P>
      <P>The county  government  has also  proactively  raised  the international profile
of the county and engaged in exchanges with many countries, Cho said. He pointed
out that in June of this year, the county government sent 100 junior high school
and primary school students from disadvantaged families to visit the Nagano
Prefecture in Japan, and in August sent another group of elementary school
students to visit the Western Australia city of Perth.</P>
      <P>Cho added that in November the county government organized the fifth Asian Cup
Woodball Championship.</P>
      <P>He also noted that his administration has won the bid to host the National
Athletic Games in 2011 this year and that the county government plans to set up
a bicycle industrial park, a special area for light sport aircraft, and an
international-standard racetrack for motorcycles and cars.</P>
      <P>In August, the county government hosted a forum attended by chiefs and deputy
chiefs of Taichung City, Taichung County, and Nantou County to discuss
integrating the tourism resources of central Taiwan, Cho went on.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the county government is looking to build a convenient transportation
network, create a prosperous economy, market local tourism, and foster a diverse
and innovative education system, Cho concluded.</P>

      <P>The Changhua County government began efforts Wednesday with an academic
conference to promote the central Taiwan county becoming the capital city of the
country.</P>
      <P>The conference on issues concerning the Changhua bid and national development
was attended by governmental, industrial and academic representatives, including
Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen, National Changhua University of
Education President Chang Huei-po and Mingdao University President Wang Ta-yung.</P>
      <P>In his address, County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan introduced Changhua as enjoying a
significant position in Taiwan's history, noting that its Lugang township was
once the second largest city on the island, following Tainan in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Changhua, the first Taiwanese county to house a population surpassing one
million people, is now the fourth largest county in the nation with a population
above 1.3 million people.</P>
      <P>In geography, Changhua county lies against the central mountain range, which
shields the county from typhoons, allowing it to develop stably, Cho indicated.</P>
      <P>The magistrate also mentioned that 88.1 percent of the county has not yet
undergone urban renewal, meaning that there is ample space in the  county  for
the construction  of political  and economic establishments.</P>
      <P>Topics on Changhua's strengths in history, politics, geography, traffic,
population, industry, LOHAS (an abbreviation for Lifestyles of Health and
Sustainability) and balanced development were discussed during the conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Nearly 45% want to maintain status quo: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 45 percent of the people polled hope to maintain the status quo for the
present and decide Taiwan's future later, according to the result of a public
opinion poll published by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This represents the highest figure since the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party took helm of the nation in 2000.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted Dec. 21-23 by the market research company Berkeley BIGC
at the MAC's commission. A total of 1,067 effective samples were collected with
a margin of error of three percentage points.</P>
      <P>Asked about their views on unification with China, declaring Taiwan independence
or maintaining the status quo, 44.9 percent said they hope to maintain the
status quo and decide on the nation's future later, the highest point since
2000.</P>
      <P>One noteworthy finding is that only 11.8 percent of those polled said they hope
to maintain  the status  quo until  achieving independence, which is a dramatic
decrease from 16.5 percent in August and represents the lowest point of the past
four and a half years.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Teh-hsun said that past public opinion polls conducted by the
MAC have shown that voters tend to be more conservative on the eve of major
elections and will not give definite views on the future of Taiwan. Taiwan's
legislative elections are scheduled for Jan. 12 and presidential election March
22.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the reason to the reality Taiwan faces in the international
community as well as China's relentless obstruction, which discourages many of
those polled from expressing their views.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese perceptions of China's animosity also reflect this point, as the
survey shows that 66.8 percent of those polled think that Beijing is hostile to
Taiwan's government, a new high in recent years.</P>
      <P>The number of those who think Beijing is not friendly to Taiwan's people rose to
reach 50.6 percent, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>On restrictions imposed on Taiwan business people investing in China, those who
believe the government should be stricter fell below 50 percent for the first
time with only 44.3 percent saying that the government should be more stringent,
the poll showed.</P>
      <P>Those who think that the government should ease restrictions rose to 37.7
percent for the first time, and those who think that the government should
maintain the current policy also reached double-digit figures for the first time
at 11.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that this has to do with a litany of regulations governing
investment in China unveiled by the government in recent years, making the rules
of the game more open and transparent.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese non-governmental medical team has earned public praise and special
thank from a Tibetan Buddhism Gyalwang after it completed a seven-day free
medical service in a northern Indian town of Bodhgaya in Bihar Province.</P>
      <P>The team,  consisted of 17 medical doctors,  dentists and pharmacists as well as
30 nurses and volunteers, is organized by the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps
(TRMPC) , a private medical charity dedicated to international medical aid
service.</P>
      <P>Led by TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun, the group arrived in New Delhi early
Wednesday to a warm welcome by Andrew Hsia, Taiwan's representative to India.
Hsia personally cooked Taiwanese-style breakfast to entertain all team members
who have not had hot foods since starting their current charitable medical tour.</P>
      <P>Liu told CNA in an interview that witnessing the needs of the poor in the
backward area has helped TRMPC members realize how people can contribute to
helping others, adding the experience they have learnt from the medical service
tour was beneficial to themselves.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, many residents in the Indian town are infected with pneumonia
due to the filthy living environment. Lack of money to receive regular
treatments has even left many patients suffering from multiple drug resistant
pneumonia, he noted.</P>
      <P>"This in not a good phenomenon," Liu said, adding that the World Health
Organization has warned that India could fall victim to a pneumonia epidemic
within a decade if no proper efforts are made.</P>
      <P>Liu also noticed some cases of malaria during his stay in Bodhgaya, saying the
situation is also a result of the dirty environment.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of the TRMPC members got cold or had diarrhea during their
service mission due to different dining style and sharp temperature differences
between day and night in the region, Liu said that if without the TRMPC doctors,
team members would have been unable even to take care of themselves.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC has been carrying out free medical services in India annually since
2000, and about 5,600 patients received the TRMPC treatments this year, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, India is a country that badly needs charitable medical aids.
"The TRMPC will continue its medical service in other Indian towns next year,"
he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>High-tech industry benefits, hurts local economy: researcher</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Led by the semiconductor sector, Taiwan's high-tech industry led the way for the
national economy, but hurt it at the same time, a researcher said Wednesday in a
forum.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economy is export-driven and most of the contribution came from the
high-tech industry. There is no doubt about it. However, Taiwanese citizens did
not benefit from the profits made by the industry, " said Liu Tai-ying,
President of Taiwan Research Institute (TRI).</P>
      <P>Speaking in a forum looking at the prospects for economic growth in 2008, Liu
explained that the high-tech industry is a high capital sector, and although it
has made huge profits, most companies have to re-invest in themselves as well as
increasing capital through public offerings due to the short life-cycle of their
equipment and products.</P>
      <P>"That means that not only did the money made not go into the people's pockets,
but the sector also took money out of the public's pocket," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the industry created massive output values but failed to create
local jobs given the fact that most of their factories have been shifted to
China and Southeast Asian countries, he added.</P>
      <P>"That is simply the nature and characteristics of the business, " he said
matter-of-factly.</P>
      <P>The institute predicted robust export growth of more than four percent for
Taiwan in 2008. Liu said the high-tech sector is still expected to be the
driving force behind the growth. It is estimated that the growth rate for
private sector investment will also exceed four percent, with much of it coming
from the high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>According to the TRI's research, the economic growth rate for Taiwan in 2008 is
estimated to hit 4.23 percent, which is slightly lower than the 10-year average
of 4.38 percent and more than one percentage point lower than the estimated
economic growth rate of 5.29 percent in 2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's airline companies will no longer ask passengers to pay war-risk
premiums beginning Jan. 1, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the surcharge will be canceled to reflect reduced war-risk
insurance fees paid by airlines to international insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The officials added that passengers who have already bought air tickets for the
next year can ask for a refund of the pre-paid war-risk premiums.</P>
      <P>Currently, a passenger is required to pay a war-risk surcharge of NT$40 when
buying a ticket on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route. Taiwan's airline companies also
charge each passenger about NT$49 for travel on international routes.</P>
      <P>The practice of collecting war-risk surcharges began in October 2001 after
insurance consortiums in the United States and other countries significantly
increased the war-risk premiums paid by airline companies following the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the United States in that year.</P>

      <P>The government will stick with the "one-step" voting format in the Jan. 12
legislative elections and the March 22 presidential elections, Vice Premier
Chiou I-jen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiou made the remarks at a year-end news conference held at the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Also present  at the news conference  were Premier  Chang Chun-hsiung, Executive
Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun, Cabinet Spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey, and
several ministers without portfolios.</P>
      <P>Expressing his regret over the voting format dispute, Chiou said that if the
government allows local cities and counties controlled by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) mayors to use the "two-step" voting format, there will be even more fierce
disputes before and after the elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, if the government does not uphold the CEC's decision, there will be a
hugely adverse impact on the functioning of the government system, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the government will forcibly implement the "one-step" voting
format in line with the decision of the Central Election Committee (CEC)
regardless of accusations against him or the government, Chiou went on.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that the relationship between the CEC and the Cabinet has remained
the same as during the KMT's rule in past decades, describing the CEC as an
independent institution and an arm of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chiou noted that the Cabinet must strongly support the CEC's legal decisions and
dismissed criticisms from the KMT.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiou denied that the Cabinet has prepared a list of names to
replace the chiefs of local election committees, while stressing that whoever
violates the CEC's decision will be replaced.</P>
      <P>Asked about the recent resignation of Hsinchu City Mayor Lin Junq-tzer of the
KMT as a local election commission chief, Chiou said that he "respected" Lin's
decision.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) passed a raft of legal amendments
Wednesday that will empower the CEC to ask the Executive Yuan to replace law-
breaking members of city and county election commissions.</P>
      <P>CEC members passed the amendments to the organic rules of local election
commissions with a vote of 6-3 after more than three hours of debate at a
meeting of all commissioners, CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-you said, adding
that the meeting proceeded in a roughly peaceful atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Under the revised rules, the CEC can ask the Executive Yuan to replace members
of city and county election commissions if they cannot perform their official
duties due to disease, or they violate existing laws or are guilty of
dereliction of duty, or they have been detained or indicted on criminal charges.</P>
      <P>Teng said the revised rules will be referred to the Executive Yuan soon for
approval and implementation.</P>
      <P>The rule amendment came amid nagging squabbling between central and some local
governments over the voting format for the upcoming legislative elections and
two accompanying referendums.</P>
      <P>While the CEC insists on adopting a "one-step" voting format and the opposition
Kuomintang-controlled 18 localities want to follow a "two-step" formula.</P>
      <P>Despite the passage of the organic rule amendments to authorize the CEC to
replace defiant local election commissioners,  KMT authorities said they are not
prepared to make any concession on their stance on upholding the "two-step"
voting format.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen also claimed that the revised rules violate the
stipulation of alegislative resolution passed last week that affirms local
election commission's rights to decide setup of polling stations and relevant
voting format.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan medical team completes free service in remote Indian town</HEADLINE>

      <P>A Taiwanese non-governmental medical team has earned public praise and special
thanks from a Tibetan Buddhism Gyalwang after it completed a seven-day free
medical service in the northern Indian town of Bodhgaya in Bihar Province.</P>
      <P>The team, consisting of 17 medical doctors, dentists and pharmacists as well as
30 nurses and volunteers, is organized by the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps
(TRMPC), a private medical charity dedicated to international medical aid
service.</P>
      <P>Led by TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun, the group arrived in New Delhi early
Wednesday to a warm welcome by Andrew Hsia, Taiwan's representative to India.
Hsia personally cooked a Taiwanese-style breakfast to entertain all team members
who have not had a hot meal since starting their current charitable medical
tour.</P>
      <P>Liu told CNA in an interview that witnessing the needs of the poor in the
backward area has helped TRMPC members realize how people can contribute to
helping others, adding that the experience they have learnt from the medical
service tour was personally beneficial.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, many residents in the Indian town are infected with pneumonia
due to the filthy living environment. A lack of money to receive regular
treatments has even left many patients suffering from multiple drug resistant
pneumonia, he noted.</P>
      <P>"This is not a good situation," Liu said, adding that the World Health
Organization has warned that India could fall victim to a pneumonia epidemic
within a decade if proper efforts are not made.</P>
      <P>Liu also noticed some cases of malaria during his stay in Bodhgaya, saying the
situation is also a result of the dirty environment.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of the TRMPC members got colds or had diarrhea during their
service mission due to different dining styles and sharp temperature differences
between day and night in the region, Liu said, adding that without the TRMPC
doctors, team members would have been unable even to care for themselves.</P>
      <P>The TRMPC has been offering free medical services in India annually since 2000.
About 5,600 patients received TRMPC treatments this year, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, India is a country that badly needs charitable medical aid.
"The TRMPC will continue to offer medical services in other Indian towns next
year," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's airline companies to cease charging war-risk premiums</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's airline companies will no longer ask passengers to pay war-risk
premiums beginning Jan. 1, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the surcharge will be canceled to reflect reduced war-risk
insurance fees paid by airlines to international insurance companies.</P>
      <P>The officials added that passengers who have already bought air tickets for the
next year can ask for a refund of the pre-paid war-risk premiums.</P>
      <P>Currently, a passenger is required to pay a war-risk surcharge of NT$40 when
buying a ticket on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route. Taiwan's airline companies also
charge each passenger about NT$49 for travel on international routes.</P>
      <P>The practice of collecting war-risk surcharges began in October 2001 after
insurance consortiums in the United States and other countries significantly
increased the war-risk premiums paid by airline companies following the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the United States in that year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Nearly 45% want to maintain status quo: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 45 percent of the people polled hope to maintain the status quo for the
present and decide Taiwan's future later, according to the result of a public
opinion poll published by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This represents the highest figure since the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party took helm of the nation in 2000.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted Dec. 21-23 by the market research company Berkeley BIGC
at the MAC's commission. A total of 1,067 effective samples were collected with
a margin of error of three percentage points.</P>
      <P>Asked about their views on unification with China, declaring Taiwan independence
or maintaining the status quo, 44.9 percent said they hope to maintain the
status quo and decide on the nation's future later, the highest point since
2000.</P>
      <P>One noteworthy finding is that only 11.8 percent of those polled said they hope
to maintain  the status  quo until  achieving independence, which is a dramatic
decrease from 16.5 percent in August and represents the lowest point of the past
four and a half years.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Teh-hsun said that past public opinion polls conducted by the
MAC have shown that voters tend to be more conservative on the eve of major
elections and will not give definite views on the future of Taiwan. Taiwan's
legislative elections are scheduled for Jan. 12 and presidential election March
22.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the reason to the reality Taiwan faces in the international
community as well as China's relentless obstruction, which discourages many of
those polled from expressing their views.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese perceptions of China's animosity also reflect this point, as the
survey shows that 66.8 percent of those polled think that Beijing is hostile to
Taiwan's government, a new high in recent years.</P>
      <P>The number of those who think Beijing is not friendly to Taiwan's people rose to
reach 50.6 percent, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>On restrictions imposed on Taiwan business people investing in China, those who
believe the government should be stricter fell below 50 percent for the first
time with only 44.3 percent saying that the government should be more stringent,
the poll showed.</P>
      <P>Those who think that the government should ease restrictions rose to 37.7
percent for the first time, and those who think that the government should
maintain the current policy also reached double-digit figures for the first time
at 11.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that this has to do with a litany of regulations governing
investment in China unveiled by the government in recent years, making the rules
of the game more open and transparent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>High-tech industry benefits, hurts local economy: researcher</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Led by the semiconductor sector, Taiwan's high-tech industry led the way for the
national economy, but hurt it at the same time, a researcher said Wednesday in a
forum.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economy is export-driven and most of the contribution came from the
high-tech industry. There is no doubt about it. However, Taiwanese citizens did
not benefit from the profits made by the industry, " said Liu Tai-ying,
President of Taiwan Research Institute (TRI).</P>
      <P>Speaking in a forum looking at the prospects for economic growth in 2008, Liu
explained that the high-tech industry is a high capital sector, and although it
has made huge profits, most companies have to re-invest in themselves as well as
increasing capital through public offerings due to the short life-cycle of their
equipment and products.</P>
      <P>"That means that not only did the money made not go into the people's pockets,
but the sector also took money out of the public's pocket," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the industry created massive output values but failed to create
local jobs given the fact that most of their factories have been shifted to
China and Southeast Asian countries, he added.</P>
      <P>"That is simply the nature and characteristics of the business, " he said
matter-of-factly.</P>
      <P>The institute predicted robust export growth of more than four percent for
Taiwan in 2008. Liu said the high-tech sector is still expected to be the
driving force behind the growth. It is estimated that the growth rate for
private sector investment will also exceed four percent, with much of it coming
from the high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>According to the TRI's research, the economic growth rate for Taiwan in 2008 is
estimated to hit 4.23 percent, which is slightly lower than the 10-year average
of 4.38 percent and more than one percentage point lower than the estimated
economic growth rate of 5.29 percent in 2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The year 2008 is expected to be one of slow economic growth for almost all major
economies and Taiwan is no exception with an economic growth rate estimated at
4.23 percent, the head of the Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The estimated economic growth rate for Taiwan is slightly lower than the 10-year
average of 4.38 percent and more than one percentage point lower than the
expected economic growth rate of 5.29 percent for 2007. The growth in domestic
consumption and investment are also limited, said TRI President Liu Tai-ying.</P>
      <P>A slowing economy in the United States and higher oil prices are the biggest
factors expected to impact Taiwan and the rest of the world in 2008, Liu said at
a forum looking into the economic prospects for 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's already robust export sector is still expected to grow by more than
four percent, but the same cannot be said of domestic consumption and investment
given the falling consumer confidence, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>TRI estimated a 2.92 percent growth rate in domestic consumption next year,
which will be higher than the 2.88 percent growth rate of 2007. The slight
increase will result from an increasing labor force participation rate and
relatively low unemployment rate as well as the short-term impact of the
presidential election, said TRI Vice President Wu Tsai-yi.</P>
      <P>The growth rate in private sector investment is expected to be 4.12 percent,
lower than the 4.99 percent of 2007, Wu said. The rate will be about the same as
the economic growth rate, although in the past it was 1.8 times the economic
growth rate, Wu said.</P>
      <P>A number of instances of pubic investment have not been passed in the
Legislature over the past year after becoming ensnared in the process of
environmental evaluation and by protests from environment protection groups,
which are hurting the national economy, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>The global economy will be in a period of adjustment in the first quarter of
2008 due to the impact of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and high oil prices,
but is expected to be more stable starting in the second quarter, said Wu Chung-
hsu, a researcher at Academia Sinica.</P>

      <P>Nearly half of Taiwan's top 300 business groups saw their profits grow in 2007,
a credit rating service company said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu Jen, editor-in-chief of the China Credit Information Service, made the
remarks as the company published its ranking of Taiwan's top 300 business
groups, which showed that around 71 percent of the business groups maintained
revenue growth, and nearly 85 percent of them registered a profit.</P>
      <P>Liu said that based on the financial statement of the top 300 business groups in
2006, they have set up 9,500 subsidiaries around the world with combined assets
of NT$42.949 trillion (US$1.326 trillion) and global revenues of NT$18.263
trillion, surpassing Taiwan's gross national product.</P>
      <P>Nine out the top 10 business groups in terms of assets are financial groups,
with the exception of Formosa Plastics Group, which ranks sixth.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial Holdings tops the 10 business groups, followed by Taiwan
Cooperative Bank, Taishin Holdings, Mega Holdings, Chinatrust Financial Holding,
Fubon, Hua Nan Financial Holdings, Shin Kong Financial Holding and First
Financial Holding, in that order.</P>
      <P>In terms of assets, Formosa Plastics Group ranks first among traditional
industries, while the Foxcoon Technology Group sits atop the high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>In terms of revenues, the top 10 groups are Formosa Plastics, Foxcoon, ASUS,
Kinpo, Quanta, Mitac-Synnex, BanQ, Acer, Inventec, Far Eastern.</P>
      <P>In terms of after-tax net profits, the top 10 are Formosa Plastics, TSMC,
Foxcoon, UMC, Chuanghwa Telecom, China Steel, Far Eastern, Powerchip
Technologies, Fubon, and VIA Technologies.</P>
      <P>Liu said that thanks to the effects of a sluggish economy, less than 50 percent
of the top 300 business groups were able to maintain profit growth, and some
businesses maintaining profit growth may not be included in the top 300.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom is one of the nine business groups making into the top 100
business groups for the first time.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom actually made it into the ranks of the top 20 business groups,
Liu pointed out. It set up two overseas holding companies in British Virgin
Islands in 2006, showing its ambition in expanding overseas, Liu said, adding
that it has an ample room for development in Chinese market.</P>
      <P>In terms of business performance, the TSMC was placed at the top of the first 10
groups, followed by Powerchip Semiconductor, which made it into the top 10 for
the first time.</P>
      <P>The other eight companies rounding out are VIA Technologies, Media Tek, Formosa

    <HEADLINE>Sales of Taiwan's largest online bookstore rise nearly 40% for 2007</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's largest online bookstore -- books.com.tw -- has seen its turnover
increase nearly 40 percent this year, thanks to its successful alliance with
7-Eleven, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Established in 1995, the bookstore posted sales of less than NT$10 million per
annum in the beginning and was soon stranded in an operational crisis following
the bursting of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s.</P>
      <P>However, an NT$100 million investment in the bookstore in January 2001 by
President Chain Store Corp. (PCSC) -- which runs the chain of 7-Eleven
convenient stores in Taiwan -- revived the business, and the alliance has since
provided customers with a new option -- paying upon delivery at any 7-Eleven
outlet nationwide.</P>
      <P>The bookstore saw its turnover increased to NT$1.37 billion and its net profit
amounted to NT$53 million in 2006, with almost 90 percent of orders being payed
upon delivery at 7-Eleven, officials at the bookstore said.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the bookstore's turnover has further expanded to NT$1.9 billion,  with
book sales accounting  for NT$1.3 billion,  up approximately 40 percent over the
year-earlier level, the officials said.</P>
      <P>A total of 6 million copies of 229,845 kinds of books have been sold so far this
year, with one copy sold every five seconds on average, they said.</P>
      <P>According to market research data provided by PCSC, the scale of Taiwan's
potential book market is estimated at NT$30 billion per year, with the virtual
market accounting for NT$12 billion, or 40 percent.</P>
      <P>As the total turnover of online booksellers has amounted to only NT$3 billion to
NT$3.5 billion in 2007, the PCSC expects online book sales to increase by up to
NT$4.5 billion, or 40 percent, in 2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, books.com.tw tallies reveal that the five top-selling categories of
books in 2007 are finance and investment, arts, comics, healthcare, and fiction,
in that order.</P>
      <P>On books providing financial and investment information, the number of buyers
for this type of book has risen 119 percent among men and 152 percent among
women in 2007, with men preferring those focusing on practical, technical
analysis, and women favoring those discussing theories, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>Although books on art accounted for only 4 percent of all books available on the
Taiwan market, their sales have posted an increase of 130 percent in 2007, owing
to the enhancement of Taiwan citizens' beauty awareness, according to the
bookstore.</P>
      <P>On comics, the sales of the top-10 best-selling comics series have accounted for
14 percent of the total turnover for 2007, and the sales of some of the comics
series have been boosted by their adaptation into TV drama series.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the popularity of books on healthcare has been increasing with the
aging of the country's population. Between 2005 and 2007, the quantity of books
purchased by buyers in the 41-50 age group has jumped 75 percent. While the
number of buyers of books providing healthcare information has climbed 16
percent among men and 21 percent among women in 2007, the number of buyers aged
over 40 is 2.5 times as high as that of buyers in the 23-30 age group.</P>
      <P>As for works of fiction, the number of new fiction works as a percentage of all
fiction works available on the Taiwan market increased from 49 percent in 2006
to 54 percent in 2007, with the number of male buyers rising 9.4 percent -- 4.7
times as high as the growth rate among female buyers, according to the tallies.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san denied categorically Thursday that the
city's Bureau of Environmental Protection (BEP) has been involved in
electioneering.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks after BEP Director Hsiao Yu-cheng was taken into custody
early in the morning for allegedly dining and wining city street cleaners in the
hopes of winning their support for a specific candidate running in the Jan. 12
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Hsiao was accused of having solicited support for a legislative candidate while
throwing a lunch party Nov. 24 to entertain 20-plus members of city cleaning
staff, including heads of several street cleaning squads in the Sanmin district.</P>
      <P>Claiming that entertaining Sanmin district street cleaners was part of Hsiao's
efforts  to boost the morale  of grassroots environmental protection workers
after the city's dengue fever outbreak was brought under control, Chiu said the
lunch party in question had nothing to do with the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"No legislative candidate appeared at the lunch party, and no campaign
literature was handed out during the occasion, " Chiu said, adding that nobody
spoke for any candidate during the gathering.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Hsiao had not only entertained Sanmin district grassroots street
cleaning staff but also those in other city districts, Chiu said he believes
that Hsiao was unlikely to campaign for any candidate on such an occasion.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that judicial authorities can complete relevant investigations
and get to the bottom of the case as early as possible, " Chiu said, adding that
he is convinced that a thorough probe into the case will clear the names of
Hsiao and other grassroots city environment cleaning staff.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) denied Thursday that the ministry has
left Taiwan nationals imprisoned in Thailand out in the cold, saying it has
provided various forms of assistance to them.</P>
      <P>MOFA acting spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said the ministry has continued to help the
prisoners apply for amnesty, although she added that Thai judicial authorities
will make a ruling based on their investigations and that "we can only do what
we can."</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks after Taipei-based China Times reported that Taiwan lumber
businessman Chen Yi-hsiung, currently in a Thai prison for drug trafficking, has
repeatedly written to the Taiwan government for assistance "to no avail" over
the past six years.</P>
      <P>Chen was found to have concealed narcotics in his rental car when he returned to
Bangkok from a market survey trip in northern Thailand in September 2001, the
reports said. Chen, as well as 118 other Taiwanese nationals in Thai jails, were
not included in a royal pardon or commutation program for prisoners to mark Thai
King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 80th birthday Dec. 5. Chen is now planning to file an
extraordinary appeal, the reports added.</P>
      <P>Yeh reaffirmed that Taiwan's representative office in Thailand has continued to
show concern for the 119 Taiwan nationals scattered in 10 Thai prisons, adding
that the office has done many things and that it continues to provide assistance
to them.</P>
      <P>She said most of the Taiwan nationals are in prison for narcotic offenses, while
a few have been convicted of forgery.</P>
      <P>To protect the rights of Taiwan prisoners, the office has helped them apply for
amnesty, and six of them have been granted amnesty, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Thirty-four Taiwanese nationals are currently applying for amnesty, and the MOFA
is keeping tabs on the progress of their applications, she continued.</P>
      <P>Thailand also grants pardon on special occasions, such as the Thai King's
birthday or other festivities, Yeh said, noting that a Taiwan national who was
convicted for injuring others may be released under the royal pardon program to
mark the Thai King's birthday.</P>
      <P>She said that the country's Thai representative office visits Taiwan nationals
in prison regularly to give them daily necessities or books. The office also
provides extra assistance if they are sick or being treated unfairly, handling
between 50 and 70 such cases a month, she added.</P>
      <P>The ministry has continued to provide assistance to Chen, including hiring
lawyers, communicating with Thai judicial authorities, and applying for his
amnesty, according to Yeh.</P>

marketing service charges will be canceled from the first day of next year.</P>
      <P>The cancellation was made in a meeting of the Executive Yuan price stabilization
working task force a few days ago. It was also decided during the meeting that
the customs testing and quarantine service fees on imports will be cut to a
lower level in a drive to help stabilize consumer prices, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Asked about possible price fluctuations next year, Chen said that Taiwan has
"almost no way" to curb price fluctuations resulting from price hikes of raw
materials in the international market, because the country itself relies heavily
on raw material imports.</P>
      <P>However, Chen continued, the international community has begun efforts to curb
raw material price hikes. For example, the U.S. government has launched measures
to encourage the planting of more wheat, he said, noting that despite such
efforts, there are still many other factors that will play a role in determining
prices, including weather, supply and demand, and whether some agricultural raw
materials will be used to produce energy.</P>

      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Chang Chen-hsiung said Thursday that
there has been no change in the CEC's decision that a "one-step" voting method
must be implemented throughout Taiwan's 25 localities in the coming legislative
and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks to reporters following a local newspaper claim earlier
that same day that the CEC has agreed to allow some local governments to
flexibly adopt a "two-step" voting method after CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-
you said Wednesday that a new "two-step" voting procedure proposed by Taitung
County is "not unlawful, " although the CEC does not encourage the proposed new
scheme.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said later that the "one-step" format legally
prescribed by the CEC must be fully implemented in all localities to ensure
smooth and orderly legislative and presidential elections, slated for Jan. 12
and March 22, respectively.</P>
      <P>Each of the elections will be accompanied by two referendums -- a critical point

      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey reiterated the central government's

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday that Taiwan Financial Holding Co. will
become the 18th-largest in Asia and the 89th-largest financial institution in
the world when it is formally inaugurated Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks when he attended a party to mark the inauguration of the
national-level financial company.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan Financial Holding, formed as the result of a merger of the
Bank of Taiwan, the Land Bank of Taiwan and the Export-Import Bank of the
Republic of China, has combined assets of NT$5.12 trillion (US$158.02 million).</P>
      <P>It has deposits of NT$3.88 trillion and active loans of NT$3.24 trillion, the
premier said, adding that it will become the nation's top financial services
provider, overtaking Cathay Financial Holding Co., currently the largest
financial institute in terms of assets.</P>
      <P>The merger of the three state-owned financial institutions was part  of the
government's  efforts  to upgrade  the  overall competitiveness of the country's
financial industry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Financial Holding has 308 domestic branches and 16 overseas units in
Europe, the United States and Asia. It has also set up footholds in Vietnam and
Macau, giving it good globalized deployment.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out recently that following the implementation of the Financial
Holding Company Act,  various domestic financial institutions have established
holding companies as a means of heightening their operating efficiency and
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>However, they have met with strong challenges from international holding
companies,  which enjoy the advantages  of huge size, international awareness,
product development capability and global branch networks. The establishment of
a national-class financial holding company in Taiwan, therefore, is an urgent
matter, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
has said that if elected president in 2008, he will put forward a package of
measures, including expanding cross-Taiwan Strait chartered flights, to help
boost local tourism.</P>
      <P>Hsieh  made  the  pledge  Wednesday  while  meeting  with representatives from
the travel and tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Addressing his policy vision on the occasion, Hsieh said that during his tenure
as premier from Feb. 1, 2005 through Jan. 25, 2006, he had pushed for direct
cross-strait chartered flights to create a win-win situation in relations
between the two sides, but the program was later called off by China.</P>
      <P>In addition to expanding the number of cross-straight chartered flights, Hsieh
also promised to push for multiple-point direct chartered flight services, an
arrangement he said that can bypass the controversy over whether the flights
should be defined as domestic or international.</P>
      <P>However,  he  said  the  opening  of  direct  cross-strait transportation should
proceed based on the principle of promoting local tourism.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also vowed to open Taiwan to Chinese tourists and study the possibility of
cutting or even abrogating taxes on all recreational activities, except for
golf.</P>
      <P>Adding that Taiwan should ease restrictions on visa applications by Chinese
tourists, the DPP standard bearer said that if Chinese visitors have already
obtained visas from the United States and Japan, Taiwan should approve their
visa applications accordingly.</P>
      <P>The DPP presidential  hopeful  added that to realize  the government's plan to
double the number of tourist arrivals to boost the tourism industry, Taiwan
should capitalize on its cutting-edge technologies and abundant resources to
develop diversified tourism, including cosmetic surgery tourism and medical
tourism.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said that if elected president, he will make efforts to establish
marine activity centers by furbishing harbors and piers that now sit idle around
the island to develop marine tourism.</P>

      <P>The government will list preschoolers as its main target for child abuse
prevention and control next year, as preschoolers have been proven to be the
most vulnerable group of victims of child abuse, a Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-hsia, director-general of the MOI's Children's Bureau, noted that
10,290 cases of child abuse were reported around the country in the first nine
months of this year, compared with 10,094 cases recorded for the whole of 2006.</P>
      <P>This year's cases include those uncovered in 1,700 of 35,000 families that have
been listed by the MOI as high-risk households, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Of the 10,290 cases, nine resulted in death, with all the victims being
preschoolers aged 6 or younger, she said, adding that the number does not
include another 17 children who were killed in 13 filicide-suicides recorded
during the Jan.-Sept. period.</P>
      <P>To help in the prevention and control of child abuse among preschoolers, the MOI
is planning to cooperate with the Bureau of Health Promotion and the Taiwan
Pediatric Association to facilitate the gathering of information about possible
child abuse cases, in addition to charging chiefs of villages and boroughs with
the responsibility of reporting such cases to the authorities, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-jen, executive director of the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families
(TFCF) , said the discovery of child abuse involving preschoolers can be
difficult, as many children in that age group are not enrolled in school, adding
that the results of a TFCF survey found that only 3.4 percent of child abuse
involving preschoolers were reported by preschool educational institutions.</P>
      <P>Referring to MOI tallies, Wang noted that 580,000 children aged 3-6 are not sent
to daycare institutions or kindergartens and 84,000 children aged 0-2 have not
received preventive inoculation provided by health authorities, which he said
means more than 660,000 preschoolers are not subject to any extra-familial
monitoring or protection.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government set up a more comprehensive child daycare and
preventive healthcare system to better protect preschoolers.</P>
      <P>For example, he went on, health authorities should trace the causes behind
parents' failure to get their children inoculated and transfer the cases to
social affairs authorities if any suspicious situations are detected, he said.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Hung Chi-chang called for China
Thursday to respect the free will of Taiwan businessmen operating in China and
refrain from pressuring them over the approaching elections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hung made the appeal in a year-end news conference of the SEF, a quasi-official
body set up to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal ties
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hung noted that the Taiwanese business group in China titled the All-China
Federation of Taiwan Compatriots -- is planning to hold a meeting in Wuhan Jan.
6 in a show of support for the presidential ticket of Ma Ying-jeou and Vincent
Siew of the main opposition Kuomintang to which many Taiwan businessmen have
been invited.</P>
      <P>Hung said the government is concerned about the move as it is believed to be an
attempt to try to sway the Jan. 12 legislative and March 22 presidential
elections in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that in addition to the meeting in Wuhan, similar activities will
be held around China prior to the elections.</P>
      <P>Hung protested at China using its political clout to try to sway the free will
of Taiwan businessmen in their election choices.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General You Ying-lung also said Beijing's interference in Taiwan's
elections will be regarded as interference by foreign forces.</P>
      <P>"China should address squarely the fact of the separate rule on both sides of

said, adding that it is "unjust and unfair" to the Taiwan businessmen who have
made great</P>
      <P>contributions to China's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, You announced that the SEF will inaugurate in March a</P>
      <P>service center for Chinese people who find themselves in dire</P>
      <P>straits in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>You noted that such a mechanism has been in practice for many years, but said
that in view of the possible opening of Taiwan to Chinese people for tourism in
2008, cross-strait exchanges will increase unabated, creating a need for the

      <P>It will be the third service center established under the SEF following one set

rate registering 7.9 percent for 2006, 15.3 percent for 2007 and 20.2 percent
for 2008.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the total number of mega-yachts ordered worldwide has risen from 688
units for 2006 to 916 units for 2008, with the growth rate standing at 6 percent

    <HEADLINE>Dioxin-digesting bacterium discovered by high school student</HEADLINE>

      <P>A new bacterium endemic to Taiwan has been identified by a high school student
in Kaohsiung as capable of decomposing dioxin, a group of highly persistent
chemicals hazardous to humans and animals, academic sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The microbial species, identified as pseudomonas mendocina NSYSU, was first
spotted by Li Ya-ting, a sophomore at Affiliated Senior High School of National
Kaohsiung Normal University, during a laboratory experiment on dioxin-purging
substances a year ago, the sources reported.</P>
      <P>Li said she decided to find a solution for dioxin-related pollution after an
introductory lesson in her freshman year focusing on the case of the Tainan
City-based Anshun plant run by the China Petrochemical Development Corp, which
emitted large amounts of dioxin into the environment during its 40 years of
operation since 1942.</P>
      <P>Even after millions of dollars were spent on the site and its surroundings, the
dioxin pollutants still exist in the soil at high concentration, leaving the
land unusable both in terms of housing and agriculture, according to
microbiologists at National Sun Yat- sen University (NSYSU) and Cheng Shiu
University (CSU) , who helped Li's work in its later stages.</P>
      <P>In the beginning, Li said, she used earthworms as the dioxin- digesting agent,
but the worms died quickly in the highly toxic environment. However, Li said she
was surprised to find that the worm's body decomposed after a week, indicating
there could be bacteria in the contaminated earth.</P>
      <P>Seeking assistance from NSYSU and CSU, Li redirected her study to dioxin-
resistant microbes that could also decompose the substance, she said, adding
that the result was the discovery of pseudomonas mendocina NSYSU, a sub-strain
existing only in Taiwan and named after the university.</P>
      <P>In the laboratory, the bacterium is capable of digesting 80 percent of a given
dioxin in two months,  according  to the researchers. Meanwhile, the microbe is
also effective in breaking down hazardous substances such as PBDD, PBDE, PCB and
PAH.</P>
      <P>"The bacterium has great potential in field applications, " commented Chang-
Chien Guo-pin, director of the CSU's Super Micro Mass Research and Technology
Center who participated in the project.</P>
      <P>"It exists and evolves in the local environment, therefore it may not disturb
the ecology. The cost and time for cultivation is minimal, but it provides a
solution with short decomposition time and high dissolution efficiency. And the
purging process produces no hazardous byproducts, eliminating the possibility of
subsequent pollution," he said.</P>
      <P>Even with such benefits, Liu Jong-kang, director of NSYSU's Department of
Biological Science and also a project member, cautioned against releasing large
amounts of the species into the environment before detailed field experiments
have been conducted and suggested that the local government should set aside an
area near the Anshun plant for research purposes.</P>
      <P>"The impact of mass breeding of this species in the environment is still
unknown, " he said, adding that "we have to determine that the species will not
disturb or destroy the microbial ecology."</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged the public Thursday to devote more energy to
studying Taiwan sovereignty issues in the face of China's constant sovereignty
claims over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal while presiding over an award presentation ceremony for the
winners of an online competition for essays on the topic of Taiwan's sovereignty
issues.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, she came up with the idea of organizing a Taiwan sovereignty-
themed essay competition after the U.N. Secretariat refused  earlier this year
to accept Taiwan's  instrument  of ratification of the multilateral Convention
on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women.</P>
      <P>Upon learning in April that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon misquoted U.N.
Resolution 2758 in rejecting Taiwan's instrument of ratification, Lu said she
reported the case to President Chen Shui-bian and asked the president to call
for U.S. attention to the gravity of the issue.</P>
      <P>Saying that Ban's claim that Resolution 2758 recognizes China's sovereignty over
Taiwan was outrageously wrong, Lu said she asked U.S. officials during a transit
stop she made in San Francisco in July to attach importance to the issue.</P>
      <P>Afterwards, Lu went on, the U.S. authorities decided not to back Ban's
interpretation of the U.N. resolution, forcing him to promise not to quote the
resolution to back the PRC's sovereignty claim over Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>Noting that the core value of Taiwan's bid to join the U.N. lies in safeguarding
Taiwan's sovereignty, Lu said the public should not ignore this key element and
should spend more time and energy pondering the issue in a rational manner.</P>
      <P>The U.N. Resolution 2758, passed in 1971, only recognized the PRC as the sole
legitimate representative of China and gave the "China" seat to Beijing at the
expense of Taipei. It didn't address Taiwan's representation issue nor did it
affirm China's right to represent Taiwan in the U.N. or its sovereignty claim
over Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should take advantage of the opportunities presented by the election of
new Korean leadership to develop closer relations with South Korea, especially
on the economic front, which will benefit both sides, academics said in a forum
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"President-elect Lee Myung-bak is the first so-called 'economy president' in
South Korean history. Although Taiwan does not enjoy official diplomatic
relations with South Korea, it should still seize the opportunity to develop
further economic ties with its former ally, " said Lee Tsai-fang, Taiwan's
former representative to the Republic of Korea.</P>
      <P>"For example, signing a Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) is a
realistic and achievable goal, " said Lee, who served as director of the
International  Relations Center of Ming Chuan University, in a forum discussing
Korea's presidential election and the East Asian security.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's focus in its relations  with Korea should be on economics,  not only
because the lack of official  diplomatic relations, but also because of South
Korea needs China to deal with the North Korean issue politically, said Liu To-
hai, a political professor at National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>"It [South Korea] will not engage in any serious political talk with Taiwan, "
Liu pointed out at the forum, organized by the Taiwan Thinktank, a private
policy research organization.</P>
      <P>An attempt to expand bilateral exchanges and cooperation is also necessary as
bilateral trade reached an unprecedented level of US$22.2 billion in 2006, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea can collaborate by exchanging information on investing in
China and South Asian countries, said Academia Sinica researcher Lin Cheng-yi,
before noting that both sides will have more "maneuvering space" if South Korea
manages to improve relations with its northern counterpart during Lee Myung-
bak's term.</P>
      <P>"If that's the case, in the future it may be possible for Taiwanese businesses
to invest in North Korea through partnerships with South Korea. If so, Taiwanese
businesses will be able to benefit from cheap labor," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Before anything can happen, it's necessary that Taiwan improve its understanding
of the two Koreas, said Lee Ming-jun, Deputy Secretary-General of Taiwanese
Society of International Law.</P>
      <P>"We know too little about South Korea and have to engage in full-scale research
and study, " he said.</P>
      <P>Most people don't realize that, historically, Taiwan's destiny has been tied up
with the events in the Korean Peninsula, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He further explained that Taiwan (Formosa) and the Pescadores Islands (Penghu)
were ceded to Japan in 1895 after the First Sino-Japanese War, which broke out
over control of Korea. Also, upon the escalation of the Korean War in 1950, then
President of the United States Harry Truman ordered the Seventh Fleet to protect
Taiwan from potential invasion of China.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R. L. Chen was reserved Thursday about
meeting a carbon dioxide emission reduction target set by the Executive Yuan,
pointing out that it would be more difficult at present to de-commission nuclear
power plants in active service.</P>
      <P>According to an Executive  Yuan plan to cut Taiwan's CO2 emissions, the country
must keep its greenhouse gas emissions for 2025 at the level of some 221 million
metric tons -- similar to the 2000 level -- representing a 40 percent cut of the
current emissions level.</P>
      <P>To serve that end, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has to first explore
the plan's effects on different sectors in line with a quota management
mechanism that needs to be precisely assessed in advance, he explained.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the planned cut will impact Taiwan's economic growth or whether
the MOEA should adjust its nuclear power policy, Chen said only that his
ministry basically encourages local industry to voluntarily take part in the
plan.</P>
      <P>As to whether his ministry should adjust its nuclear power policy, Chen admitted
that it would be more difficult for the government sector to shut down nuke
power plants now despite a promise of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to
make Taiwan a nuclear-free country.</P>
      <P>But Chen said his ministry will definitely cooperate with the Executive Yuan to
meet the CO2 emissions reduction target as long as it has put complementary
measures in place, adding that Taiwan is committed to playing a constructive
role in the international community, even though it is not a signatory to the
Kyoto Protocol.</P>

      <P>The government is considering including vegetable staples such as cabbages in
its production pre-warning system targeting important agricultural products as
part of efforts to prevent supply/demand imbalances, Council of Agriculture
(COA) officials revealed Thursday.</P>
      <P>The COA held a press conference to announce its measures to help vegetable
growers adjust their crops to market demand after prices experienced steep drops
over past weeks, triggering an outcry among local farmers about the government's
incompetence in addressing the problem of market imbalances.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Minister Lee Jen-chyuan attributed the price plunges to increased
planting after the country sustained a vegetable shortage that led to price
hikes in October due to losses caused by Typhoon Krosa.</P>
      <P>Moderate winter weather has also helped accelerate plant growth and boost
production, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei Agricultural Products Marketing Co. tallies, the average
wholesale price of vegetables plunged to NT$12.74 per kilo Wednesday from
NT$52.3 per kilo registered Oct. 21.</P>
      <P>The prices increased Thursday to NT$13 per kilo, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>To address price fluctuations caused by supply/demand imbalances, Lee said the
COA has activated a "95" mechanism to purchase over-produced vegetable staples,
including cabbages and broccoli, at 95 percent of the production cost.</P>
      <P>Addressing the COA-operated production pre-warning system, which was put into
operation in January this year, Lee said that at present only seven kinds of
agricultural products, including bananas, papayas, oranges, pineapples, garlic,
onions and peanuts, are included in the system.</P>
      <P>Including vegetable staples in the system would be a challenge because the
vegetable production period is shorter, Lee noted, explaining it is difficult to
control harvests.</P>

      <P>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are expected to fall to a more stable level,
while those across the Taiwan Strait are expected to rise, said an ex-official
in a forum Thursday.</P>
      <P>"While the military situation between North and South Korea should be stabilized
by the current six party talks, the cross-strait situation is moving in the
other direction, " said Lee Tsai-fang, Taiwan's representative to South Korea
from 2003 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Recent statements from officials of the United States show that cross-strait
tensions have risen to a level at which the U.S. feels it is necessary to speak
up, Lee said in a Taiwan Thinktank-organized forum discussing South Korea's
presidential election and East Asian security.</P>
      <P>The "unification versus independence"  argument is Taiwan's particular political
issue, he said, adding that his personal view was that it would be better to
maintain the status quo and let time take care of the problem.</P>
      <P>Lee Myung-bak's landslide victory in the presidential election also suggests
that South Korea's "North Korea policy" will follow a road map to a peaceful
resolution rather than confrontation, he added.</P>
      <P>Relations between the two Koreas have been governed by a "top-down"  process
and  handled  by  government-to-government negotiations in contrast to cross-
Taiwan Strait relations, which have been characterized by a "bottom-up" process
dominated by civic exchanges and activities, he said.</P>
      <P>"But, of course, there is no 'national identity issue' among the Koreans. The
problem they have is more of a 'regional complex.' In Taiwan, the situation is
just the opposite, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-jun, deputy secretary-general of Taiwanese Society of International
Law, agreed with the ex-official's observation, saying that on the Korean
Peninsula "politics goes before the economy", while economic considerations take
precedence in relations between Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>The Evergreen Group, the Taipei-based shipping and transportation conglomerate,
is extending a helping hand to cabbage farmers in central Taiwan hard-hit by a
market slump.</P>
      <P>Shipping tycoon Chang Yung-fa, chairman of the Evergreen Group, placed two
orders Thursday through the Chang Yung-Fa Foundation, a charitable organization,
providing timely relief for cabbage farmers in dire need of assistance.</P>
      <P>Chang bought 20 metric tons of cabbage from Yunlin County and another 19 metric
tons from Changhua County. He agreed to pay NT$10 per kilogram, twice as the
going price. The cabbage will be distributed among Evergreen enterprises and
employees.</P>
      <P>Wholesale cabbage prices in Taiwan have plunged to around NT$5 per kilogram
since the beginning of December -- barely enough to cover the production costs
-- mainly because cabbage crops at many farms which were devastated by Typhoon
Krosa in October are now maturing at the same time.</P>
      <P>The market slump caused by overproduction has been further exacerbated by recent
news reports that a duckling died of pesticide poisoning after its owner fed it
the outer leaves of a cabbage.</P>
      <P>Earlier Thursday, farmers staged a protest and dumped a truckload of cabbage in
front of the Changhua county government. They urged the county government to
work out measures to prevent further losses.</P>
      <P>Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan responded by buying 5,000 head of cabbage
to give the vegetables  to county government employees. He urged the public to
buy and eat more cabbage to help the farmers.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin County government also announced that farmers can receive subsidies
by selling up to 1,500 metric tons of their cabbage crops to the government for
refrigeration at NT$5 per kilogram or by turning them into green compost in
their fields at a rate of NT$70,000 per hectare.</P>

      <P>The new opening measure also aims at attracting overseas, Taiwan-funded

Hu said.</P>
      <P>Although the current requirement that companies listed in the Taiwan securities
market should not invest more than 40 percent of their paid-in capital in China
may dampen the interest of China-based Taiwanese companies to issue an IPO in
Taiwan, Hu said he is confident that the incentives to be adopted will be
effective in luring promising startups to seek a listing on the local stock
exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT presidential candidate awaits verdict on corruption case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   27  (CNA)
12/27/07  23:48:37
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou reiterated
Thursday that he is a man of integrity and expressed hope that the Taiwan High
Court will uphold a lower court's decision and find him not guilty on corruption
charges.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks as the High Court is set to hand down at 10 a.m. Friday its
verdict on the high-profile corruption case involving the appropriation of
"special allowance funds" set aside for his use during his tenure as Taipei
mayor from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Friday's ruling will be closely watched by both Ma's camp and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) because of its critical importance for next
March's presidential race.</P>
      <P>If the High Court upholds the district court's "not guilty" ruling, Ma's
presidential bid will get a significant boost, political analysts said, adding
that it could also be a boon to the KMT's standing in the Jan. 12 legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>If Ma is found guilty, he faces a minimum sentence of seven years' imprisonment.
A sentence of 10 years or more would force him to drop out of the contest, which
could cause political upheaval in the bitterly polarized local society,
political analysts said. Ma will be eligible to appeal his case to the Supreme
Court if the high court gives a sentence of less than 10 years.</P>
      <P>Speaking before supporters Thursday, Ma played down the chances that the lower
court's verdict might be overturned.</P>
      <P>"I am confident of my integrity and have expectations that justice will
prevail," he said.</P>
      <P>In August, the Taipei District Court found Ma not guilty of funneling NT$11
million (US$333,000) of public money into his private account while serving as
mayor of Taipei. Judges accepted Ma's argument that Taiwanese law recognized the
"special allowance funds" as an official subsidy, but prosecutors appealed the
decision, sending the case to the High Court.</P>
      <P>Ma maintained that one of the main charges against him -- using discretionary
funds without providing detailed accounting -- had long been common practice
among Taiwanese municipal leaders and other government officials. Rather than
pocketing the funds, Ma claimed that he used them to make donations to charity.</P>
      <P>Several leading politicians face charges similar to Ma's. Vice President Annette
Lu and former Premier Yu Shyi-kun were charged in September of using false
receipts to collect reimbursements for their special allowance funds. Bout Lu
and Yu have pleaded not guilty.</P>

Taiwan High Court Friday.</P>
      <P>The court said the public funds Ma allegedly lined his pockets with during his
term as the mayor of Taipei City between 1998 and 2006 are more of an allowance
for senior government officials than public funds earmarked for use for official
affairs.</P>

fraud, both of which are necessary for conviction on corruption charges.</P>

it did not apply to Ma's case.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Evergreen Group, the Taipei-based shipping and transportation conglomerate,
is extending a helping hand to cabbage farmers in central Taiwan hard-hit by a
market slump.</P>
      <P>Shipping tycoon Chang Yung-fa, chairman of the Evergreen Group, placed two
orders Thursday through the Chang Yung-Fa Foundation, a charitable organization,
providing timely relief for cabbage farmers in dire need of assistance.</P>
      <P>Chang bought 20 metric tons of cabbage from Yunlin County and another 19 metric
tons from Changhua County. He agreed to pay NT$10 per kilogram, twice as the
going price. The cabbage will be distributed among Evergreen enterprises and
employees.</P>
      <P>Wholesale cabbage prices in Taiwan have plunged to around NT$5 per kilogram
since the beginning of December -- barely enough to cover the production costs
-- mainly because cabbage crops at many farms which were devastated by Typhoon
Krosa in October are now maturing at the same time.</P>
      <P>The market slump caused by overproduction has been further exacerbated by recent
news reports that a duckling died of pesticide poisoning after its owner fed it
the outer leaves of a cabbage.</P>
      <P>Earlier Thursday, farmers staged a protest and dumped a truckload of cabbage in
front of the Changhua county government. They urged the county government to
work out measures to prevent further losses.</P>
      <P>Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan responded by buying 5,000 head of cabbage
to give the vegetables  to county government employees. He urged the public to
buy and eat more cabbage to help the farmers.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin County government also announced that farmers can receive subsidies
by selling up to 1,500 metric tons of their cabbage crops to the government for
refrigeration at NT$5 per kilogram or by turning them into green compost in
their fields at a rate of NT$70,000 per hectare.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian telephoned new Nauru President Marcus Stephen and new
Solomon Islands Prime Minister Derek Sikua, respectively, Thursday to
congratulate them on their election victories, according to a Presidential
Office news release.</P>
      <P>The press statement said Chen invited the new national leaders of Taiwan's two
South Pacific diplomatic allies to visit Taiwan in the near future to exchange
views on matters of mutual interest, including measures to further expand
bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>In their telephone conversations, the statement said, Chen assured both the
Nauruan president and the Solomon Islands' prime minister that his
administration will continue with various existing cooperative projects for
their mutual benefit. He also called for ongoing support from the two countries
for Taiwan's bid to join major international organizations, including the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>For his part, Nauru President Stephen told Chen that he values his country's
cordial relations with Taiwan and will work to further upgrade bilateral
cooperation in various fields.  Stephen also expressed his gratitude for
Taiwan's longtime support and aid to his country, the Presidential Office
statement said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Sikua expressed hope that President
Chen will either attend in person or name a special envoy to attend celebrations
of the 40th anniversary of the founding of his country, scheduled for Jan. 31,
2008.</P>
      <P>Sikua also told Chen that the Solomon Islands is more than willing to host the
2009 Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit. He further said he will do his utmost to help
Taiwan join the U.N. and the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>The third Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit is scheduled to take place in the
southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung next year. Chen invited Sikua and Stephen
to attend the meeting and expressed his hope that Taiwan and the Solomon Islands
will finalize talks on the signing of a free trade agreement as early as
possible.</P>

      <P>Attracting blue-chip foreign companies to issue their initial public offerings
(IPOs) in the local stock market is one of the Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC) major goals for the next year, FSC Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an year-end news conference, Hu said the FSC has overhauled the IPO
underwriting system to facilitate attracting foreign companies to apply for
listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange or GreTai Securities Market.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, Hu said, the FSC is setting its sights on small-  and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs)  in Southeast Asian countries,  with paid-in
capital ranging between NT$50 million (US$1.54 million) and NT$600 million.</P>
      <P>The new opening measure also aims at attracting overseas, Taiwan-funded
companies, including those in China, to apply to be listed in the local bourse,
Hu said.</P>
      <P>Although the current requirement that companies listed in the Taiwan securities
market should not invest more than 40 percent of their paid-in capital in China
may dampen the interest of China-based Taiwanese companies to issue an IPO in
Taiwan, Hu said he is confident that the incentives to be adopted will be

      <P>The production value of Taiwan's shipbuilding industry is expected to amount to
NT$52 billion (US$1.6 billion) for 2007, up 21 percent over the year-earlier
level, according to tallies released Thursday by the Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>This will mark the first time the country's shipbuilding output has topped NT$50
billion, IDB officials said, predicting that the production value will further
expand to more than NT$60 billion for 2008.</P>
      <P>For the first 11 months of this year, Taiwan's state-owned shipbuilder -- CSBS
Corp., Taiwan -- saw its revenue amount to NT$26.2 billion and its pre-tax net
profit hit a record-high of NT$4 billion, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, CSBC had held orders for 60 container vessels worth a
total of NT$125.9 billion and 30 fast missile attack boats worth a total of
NT$12.62 billion, and the orders will keep the production line of CSBC's
Kaohsiung shipyard busy until April 2012 and that of the Keelung shipyard
occupied until July 2011, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, to prepare for expected changes in the global shipping industry
after the completion of the Panama Canal expansion project, CSBS has established
a partnership with the American Bureau of Shipping to develop new Panamax-class
container vessels with a capacity of 12,500 twenty-foot equivalent units, they
noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's largest private-owned shipbuilder -- Jong Shyn Shipbuding
Co. -- has invested an additional NT$1.75 billion in expanding existing
shipyards and building new facilities this year, and the company's annual
turnover is expected to increase to NT$4 billion after the completion of the
project, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer confidence has continued to decline in December to hit a new
low, according to the results of a monthly survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey results, issued by National Central University's Research Center for
Taiwan's Economic Development, show that the consumer confidence index for
December stands at 62.58, down 0.76 points from the previous month and marking
the lowest level since December 2001.</P>
      <P>Four out of the six sub-indices fell in December, with the sub-index for stock
market investing over the next six months seeing the largest decline, dropping
3.4 points from November's level to stand at 70.90.</P>
      <P>The second largest decrease was seen in the sub-index for durable good purchases
for the next six months, which lost 1.05 points to stand at 108.95.</P>
      <P>The sub-index for domestic economic outlook over the next six months fell 0.2
points to 46.35, while the sub-index for family finances for the next six months
slid 0.1 points to 49.00, the lowest level since the survey began in January
2001.</P>
      <P>The sub-index for employment opportunities for the next six months leveled off
at 72.10.</P>
      <P>The only sub-index that increased in December was that for domestic consumer
prices for the next six months, which gained 0.15 points to stand at 28.15.</P>
      <P>The survey of 2,344 adults around Taiwan was carried out via telephone Dec.
20-22. It has a margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.</P>

      <P>The Evergreen Group, the Taipei-based shipping and transportation conglomerate,
is extending a helping hand to cabbage farmers in central Taiwan hard-hit by a
market slump.</P>
      <P>Shipping tycoon Chang Yung-fa, chairman of the Evergreen Group, placed two
orders Thursday through the Chang Yung-Fa Foundation, a charitable organization,
providing timely relief for cabbage farmers in dire need of assistance.</P>
      <P>Chang bought 20 metric tons of cabbage from Yunlin County and another 19 metric
tons from Changhua County. He agreed to pay NT$10 per kilogram, twice as the
going price. The cabbage will be distributed among Evergreen enterprises and
employees.</P>
      <P>Wholesale cabbage prices in Taiwan have plunged to around NT$5 per kilogram
since the beginning of December -- barely enough to cover the production costs
-- mainly because cabbage crops at many farms which were devastated by Typhoon
Krosa in October are now maturing at the same time.</P>
      <P>The market slump caused by overproduction has been further exacerbated by recent
news reports that a duckling died of pesticide poisoning after its owner fed it
the outer leaves of a cabbage.</P>
      <P>Earlier Thursday, farmers staged a protest and dumped a truckload of cabbage in
front of the Yunlin county government. They urged the county government to work
out measures to prevent further losses.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin County government later announced that farmers can receive subsidies
by selling up to 1,500 metric tons of their cabbage crops to the government for
refrigeration at NT$5 per kilogram or by turning them into green compost in
their fields at a rate of NT$70,000 per hectare.</P>
      <P>Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan also decided to buy 5,000 head of cabbage
to give the vegetables  to county government employees. He urged the public to
buy and eat more cabbage to help the farmers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that 2007 was a hard and arduous year for Taiwan, its efforts
to expand and maintain its diplomatic ties with other countries in addition to
its attempts to join international organizations have created a grand new stage,
Minister of the Foreign Affairs James Huang said Friday.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA's) year-end
press conference, Huang said that despite China's expeditious rise over the
years which has empowered it with tremendous political and economic clout to
exert every conceivable means to repress Taiwan in the international community,
his ministry has striven to have Taiwan join the World Health Organization and
the United Nations under the name Taiwan as well as to hold three summits with
Taiwan's allies in Central America, Africa, and the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people should feel proud of such achievements, he went on, saying that
Taiwan has managed to consolidate its democracy further despite its difficult
diplomatic situation and without the efforts leading to war with China.</P>
      <P>Looking back on the numerous diplomatic battles against China's ruthless
oppression in 2007, it is clear that Taiwan should take new initiatives from the
strategic high ground in order to fight for the international status it
deserves, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"If we do not make a step forward, we will end up being squashed," he added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said that Taiwan should also adjust its policies to conform to
the international trend of environmental protection and sustainable development
not only because that it is an inevitable path for Taiwan to embark on but also
because the more Taiwan does in this regard, the more respect it will earn from
the international community, adding that such respect is a "precious asset" for
Taiwan, which can be transformed into an "asset of the national security".</P>

      <P>Amid news reports that Malawi is to break off diplomatic ties with Taiwan,
Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang stated Friday that links between Taiwan
and Malawi remain "unchanged".</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA's) year-end press conference,
Huang said the MOFA has received assurances from both Malawian authorities and
the Malawian ambassador to Taiwan Thengo Maloya after a series of "close
contacts".</P>
      <P>However, Huang said the MOFA will not lower its guard as rumors have been
swirling that two Malawian ministers have already traveled to China and Malawian
authorities will soon announce their decision to establish diplomatic relations
with China.</P>
      <P>Malawi is an important ally of Taiwan in Africa, Huang went on, saying that it
should make a wise choice between China -- a big country with strategic
ambitions casting covetous eyes on the natural resources in Malawi -- and Taiwan
-- a trustworthy friend that serves as a fine example to the developing country
and always takes into consideration the improvement of the living standard and
livelihood of Malawi's people in bilateral undertakings.</P>
      <P>Huang reiterated that the MOFA will do all it can to maintain the country's
friendship with Malawi, but will not compete with China through so-called "money
diplomacy".</P>
      <P>Huang also said the MOFA has advised the president to attend the inauguration
ceremony of the Guatemala president Jan. 14 as Guatemala is a very important
friend of Taiwan and the inauguration presents a significant diplomatic occasion
at which to cement and solidify bilateral and multi-lateral relations with that
and other Central American countries.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said the Presidential Office has not yet made a decision on the
trip as the coming legislative elections are to be held Jan. 12, just days
before the inauguration. The MOFA will continue working on the matter while
looking at alternatives.</P>

      <P>Due to the fact that facilities at 26 of the nation's 55 industrial parks

force dedicated to mapping out measures for their rejuvenation, Ho went on.</P>
      <P>According to the proposed measures, the CEPD will implement the project in

earliest stage, beginning sometime in the first quarter of the next year, and
those parks will guide the CEPD in designing rejuvenation projects in the second

      <P>Taiwan-based transport conglomerate Evergreen Group is set to establish a new
cancer hospital in Sijhih, Taipei County, utilizing the heavy ion therapy
introduced from Japan, group senior officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>They noted that the therapy deploys a complicate particle accelerator to
expedite carbon and neon ions to treat certain cancers, and that specialists in
Japan have concluded that it best cures breast, cervical, and prostate cancer.</P>
      <P>"Conventional  radiotherapy  sometimes  provides  less-than- necessary radiation
dosage to cancers in certain body parts, while surgery sometimes undermines the
organ's normal function," they said. "But heavy ion therapy can be a third, non-
intrusive alternative when both therapies are inapplicable."</P>
      <P>During a press conference Thursday, Group Chairman Chang Yung-fa said that the
new heavy ion institute and hospital may require initial funding of US$200
million to acquire the technology and equipment from Japan, as well as to
establish a 13.2-hacter building complex to accommodate the facilities.</P>
      <P>The institute  and hospital will be dedicated  to therapy improvement and
ensuring the patient's welfare, Chang said, adding that he believes in "no
patient should be left unattended, " so even though  full course treatment  in
Japan costs 3 million  yen (approximately US$26,600) , medical subsidies will be
provided to local patients without financial viability to ensure their right to
proper treatment.</P>
      <P>In the preparatory stage, Chang said, experts in engineering physics, medical
engineering, chemotherapeutics, and medical science will be recruited and sent
to Japan for one-year training on the heavy ion therapy.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's real estate market signaled a slowdown with monitoring indicators
flashing yellow-blue for the third quarter of 2007: the second consecutive
quarter in which a yellow-blue cautionary light has appeared, according to a
quarterly report released Friday by the Architecture and Building Research
Institute (ABRI).</P>
      <P>The overall monitoring score dropped to 10 in the third quarter: the lowest
level recorded over the past three years, ABRI officials said.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the market's
outlook in the coming two quarters -- stood at 102.46 in the third quarter, down
0.21 percent from the previous quarter, officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the index of coincident indicators, which represents the current
situation, declined 1.85 percent to 101.78.</P>
      <P>While the indicators on investment, production and trade all fell in the third
quarter, more than 50 percent of businesses surveyed predicted the real estate
climate will worsen over the next two quarters, they said.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-o, a professor at National Chengchi University's Department of Land
Economics, said the results indicate Taiwan's real estate market is posed for a
correction owing to an oversupply of properties.</P>
      <P>As past corrections in the real estate market have always lasted six to seven

      <P>Three local power plants and one petroleum refinery have obtained verification
from the International Standards Organization (ISO) after reducing greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions by following the ISO 14064-2 principles and requirements,
said Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials Friday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen presented the ISO 14064-2
certificates to the Taoyuan refinery owned by the state-run CPC Corp., Taiwan
(CPC) petroleum company, as well as Taiwan Power Company's (Taipower's)
Tunghsiao, Taichung and Hsingta power plants, during a ceremony held by the MOEA
to publicize GHG management results in the energy sector.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government began helping the CPC, Taipower and another eight
private power plants around the country in planning a voluntary GHG emission
reduction project long before the legislative committee of sanitation and
environment passed a draft bill in May setting concrete targets for the
reduction of GHG emissions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The country, he went on, is expected to cut its total anticipated GHG emissions
amount during a 10-year period between 2005 and 2015 by 12 million tons: the
equivalent of the amount of carbon dioxide that can only be absorbed by 12,860
forest parks the same size as Daan Park in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The MOEA Energy Bureau began operations to help local energy producers
calculate, record and cut GHG emissions in 2005. So far, 75 companies in the
power generation, oil refinery and gas fuel sectors have received assistance to
reduce GHG emissions.</P>
      <P>The ISO 14064-2 standard provides guidance at the project level for the
quantification, monitoring and reporting of activities intended to reduce GHG
emissions.</P>
      <P>The system includes requirements for planning a GHG project, identifying and
selecting GHG sources, sinks and reservoirs relevant to the project, a baseline
scenario,  monitoring, quantifying, documenting and reporting GHG project
performance, as well as managing data quality, according to the Switzerland-

      <P>The acquittal of main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma
Ying-jeou by the Taiwan High Court on corruption charges will help boost the
local housing market, brokers said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Sinyi Realty Estate Inc. Assistant Manager Wu Ming-hsiung,
political uncertainties, including Ma's case and the legislative and
presidential elections slated for early next year, are the factors most likely
to affect the domestic real estate and property market.</P>
      <P>The settlement of Ma's case in a second trial will effectively mitigate
potential negative effects on the two approaching elections, providing a
reprieve for the domestic housing market which is bound for a turnaround at the
end of this year after four years of gains, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan's stock market is also closely related to the real estate
and property markets.</P>
      <P>For instance, he pointed out, the transaction value of Taiwan's housing market
in November again contracted as a result of the ongoing U.S. sub-prime mortgage
crisis, a weakened U.S. dollar and high-flying oil prices.</P>
      <P>The transaction value of the housing market rose by 15.1 percent in October as
the local bourse surged to a new high in recent years of over 9,800 points, he
said, adding that in September, the transaction value of the housing market grew
by 5.6 percent as the Taiwan Stock Exchange climbed.</P>
      <P>In August, the transaction value of the domestic housing market shrank by more
than 10 percent while the local bourse plunged heavily due to the U.S. credit
loan crunch, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou was found not guilty on all
charges by the Taiwan High Court Friday.</P>
      <P>The court said the public funds with which Ma allegedly lined his pockets during
his term as the mayor of Taipei City between 1998 and 2006 were more of an
allowance for senior government officials than public funds earmarked for their
use for official affairs.</P>
      <P>These public funds constituted half of a special allowance fund set aside by the
government for the mayor's use and were usually transferred to Ma's bank account
upon receiving a simple receipt from him.</P>
      <P>The court said the funds were assumed to have been used by the mayor for job-
related purposes as soon as he received them.</P>
      <P>The other half of the special allowance fund had to be used for job-related
purposes, with the mayor providing proof in the form of invoices. Such funds
were not in issue in this case.</P>
      <P>The practices governing the use of special allowance funds were established by
the government over many years, and Ma followed those practices in his use of
the funds; he should not be held to account on that basis, said the court.</P>
      <P>Also, the court said Ma had donated to charity NT$51.5 million during his terms
as Taipei mayor which is more than the NT$15.34 million special fund he had
received in office: a fact which proves that he had no intention of embezzling
the funds, nor of obtaining them by fraud, both of which are conditions
necessary for conviction on corruption charges, the court said.</P>
      <P>As to the charge of breach of trust, the court said it did not apply in this
case.</P>
      <P>The court's decision is subject to appeal, although one of Ma's lawyers said he
hoped the prosecution would not pursue that option.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted on Feb. 13 on charges of mishandling funds and embezzling a
total of NT$11.17 million (US$343,701) from his special allowance fund during
his terms as Taipei mayor between Dec. 1998 and July 2006.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor in charge of the case claimed in the indictment that Ma
transferred half of the public funds to his personal bank account each month
after handing in his receipts, then kept that portion in full knowledge that
these were public funds.</P>
      <P>He was acquitted of the charges by the Taipei District Court Aug. 14, but the
prosecution appealed the decision to the Taiwan High Court Aug. 27.</P>

      <P>Cloud Gate Dance Troupe 2 was founded in 1999. Unlike Troupe 1, which
specializes mainly in international tours, Troupe 2 aims to cultivate young
choreographers by giving performances in Taiwan's communities.</P>
      <P>Troupe 1 began its islandwide tour Nov. 23, staging some 70 performances of
"Nine Songs," a full-length dance that reinterprets a cycle of ancient ritual
songs. The tour will end Dec. 29 in Lin's hometown, Chiayi, with the final
performance of the year presented at the Chiayi Performance Arts Center.</P>
      <P>Lin choreographed Nine Songs in 1993 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Cloud
Gate. He said he was inspired by an ancient Chinese poem of the same name. The
piece has been presented at a number of high-profile events, including the 2000
Olympic Arts Festival in Sydney.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan-U.S. relations have had their ups and downs over the past seven-
and-a-half years and although differences between the two countries have grown
greater as a result of Taiwan's U.N. bid under the name of Taiwan, Minister of
Foreign Affairs James Huang said Friday at a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
year-end press conference that overall, Taiwan-U.S. relations remain "sound,
stable, close and friendly."</P>
      <P>Describing the differences as "structural problems, " Huang said they emerged
under the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) rule rather than that of the
preceding Kuomintang regime because while the DPP acknowledges the importance of
improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations, it thinks establishing Taiwan's
identity is even more significant and will not sacrifice that to improve
relations with China.</P>
      <P>He said a well-established Taiwan identity and consolidated democracy should be
regarded as assets rather than liabilities in Taiwan-U.S. relations, adding that
they are also key elements to safeguarding peace, stability and prosperity in
the Asia-Pacific region, and constitute the best self-defense mechanism against
the threat posed by China.</P>
      <P>"Although our American friends may not be accustomed to these `structural
changes' in the short term, such changes are in fact in line with the interests
of both Taiwan and the U.S. in the long run," according to Huang.</P>
      <P>He added that despite China's repeated claims to a "peaceful rise, " what China
is doing to Taiwan at present completely diverges from the spirit of peace and
that of the 2008 Olympic Games. He urged the Chinese authorities to handle
bilateral relations prudently and improve the human rights situation in China,
as they will be examined closely by the international community.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court revoked Friday a Taiwan High Court ruling that gave a seven-
year sentence to President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law Chao Chien-ming for his
role in an insider trading scandal involving Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC)
stock.</P>
      <P>The high court sentenced Chao to seven years in prison plus a fine of NT$30
million (US$$915,383) June 26 on insider trading charges, a penalty harsher than
a six-year sentence handed down in the first trial by the Taipei District Court
Dec. 27 last year. Chao then appealed his case to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court demanded that the High Court retry the case and return a new
ruling.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court also revoked the High Court ruling on other defendants in the
case, including Chao's father Chao Yu-chu, who was sentenced to nine years and
six months plus a fine of NT$30 million.</P>
      <P>The High Court sentences for two other defendants in the case - Yu Shi-yi and
former TDC Chairman Su Teh-chien -- were also revoked by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Yu received a sentence of seven years and two months in prison in addition to a
fine of NT$60 million (US$1.83 million) , while Su was given seven years and six
months and a fine of NT$30 million, in the second instance.</P>
      <P>The case stems from a dinner party attended by the younger Chao and then-TDC
Chairman Su Teh-chien July 14, 2005, during which Chao learned that the loss-
making TDC was to be bailed out by a syndicated loan from several banks.</P>
      <P>He relayed the information to his father, who bid for 5,000,000 shares July 25,
2005 and sold them after the banks approved the loan to TDC.</P>
      <P>Su did not engage in insider trading but was found guilty of tipping off the
Chaos.</P>
      <P>Yu is a friend of the Chaos who was also present at the dinner party and bought
TDC stocks along with them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to bring HIV-positive blood donor to justice</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) will bring to justice an HIV-
positive blood donor responsible for infecting three individuals through
transfusions, DOH officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>One of the three victims infected with HIV died of an unrelated disease in early
December, said Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The DOH will offer assistance to the other two recipients of the tainted blood,
Shih noted.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks after confirming that further test results show that blood
donated by the HIV carrier in July of this year contained the deadly virus.</P>
      <P>Back in July, the DOH tests did not detect the virus in the donated blood, Shih
explained.</P>
      <P>The infections were the first of the kind this year, Shih went on.</P>
      <P>The HIV-positive blood donor made a total of six donations, most recently in
November of this year, Shih said, adding that the donated blood was destroyed
soon after being found to be HIV-positive.</P>
      <P>The infected individual also donated blood in last March, according to Shih, who
added that another two individuals who received blood from this individual have
already died due to other diseases.</P>
      <P>Shih explained that the blood products made from the HIV-positive blood donors'
donation prior to last March should be virus free as the carrier was in the
"window period" at that time.</P>
      <P>Those who suspect that they might be HIV positive, who have engaged in dangerous
sexual behavior, or who have contracted sexual diseases are not allowed to
donate blood, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Homosexuals, bisexuals, sex workers, or those who have multiple sex partners are
also barred from donating blood, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>The HIV-positive blood donor was clearly aware that he was not allowed to donate
blood and thus faces a maximum jail term of 12 years, Shih said.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to minimize infection risks as a result of blood
transfusions, a DOH official said that the health department has donated NT$20
million (US$614,062) to sponsor a project being conducted by the Taiwan Blood
Services Foundation to expand the scope of HIV screening tests.</P>

      <P>Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Shieh Jhy-wey defended Friday the
Executive Yuan's decision to adjust the position of Taipei City Election
Commission Chairman Samuel Wu,  saying that the decision has nothing to do with
a replacement.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks one day after the Cabinet sent a notice to the Taipei
City Election Commission about changing Wu's position to that of a commissioner
of the capital's election commission.</P>
      <P>Shieh said Wu insists that the Taipei City Election Commission use the "two-
step" voting format, which violates the resolution of the Central Election
Commission requiring the adoption of the "one-step" voting format in the Jan. 12
legislative elections and two accompanying referendums.</P>
      <P>According to the Election and Recall Act,  local election commissions are
subject to the authority of the CEC and should abide by the CEC's decision,
Shieh said, urging Wu not to "create further chaos" and to accept the
arrangement.</P>
      <P>Responding to criticisms of the Cabinet's appointment of the Taipei City
Election Commission member Tsai Tien-chi of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party to take Wu's position, Shieh explained that the Cabinet selected Tsai
through a legal screening process, and declined to make further comment.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung hailed Friday the Taiwan
High Court's acquittal of the party's presidential hopeful of corruption charges
and urged voters to discard the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in two key
elections slated for early this year.</P>
      <P>Wu made the call in a written statement after the Taiwan High Court acquitted Ma
Ying-jeou earlier in the day of corruption charges in a second trial related to
the handling of the special allowance fund allocated for his discretionary use
when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Wu praised the court's independence amid what he called strong pressure from the
DPP government and lashed out at the ruling party for attacking Ma with the
special allowance fund case.</P>
      <P>He also accused the DPP of seeking to rig the legislative and presidential
elections,  slated  for Jan.  12 and March  22, respectively, by pursuing the
case against Ma, reminding the public that Su Tseng-chang, the DPP's vice
presidential candidate, said while serving as premier that the disputed system
governing the special allowance funds is responsible for involving a large
number of incumbent and former ranking government officials in similar cases.</P>
      <P>Wu said he shares Su's view that the special allowance funds are a remnant of
the past which needs to be overhauled and urged the ruling and opposition camps
to jointly resolve the issue to protect the dignity and good name of Taiwan's
civil servants.</P>
      <P>Now that Ma's name has been cleared, Wu urged DPP presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh to walk out of President Chen Shui-bian's shadow and engage in a
"gentlemen's race" with Ma in the coming presidential poll by putting forward
good policy proposals.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) warned Friday of growing social upheaval in
China and said that increased resentment among the Chinese public will lead to
social instability.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun issued the warning at a routine news conference.</P>
      <P>Citing  statistics  compiled  by  China's  public  security authorities, Liu
reported that the number of social unrest cases around China has exploded over
the past 13 years -- from some 8,700 in 1993 to more than 32,000 in 1999 and
599,392 last year.</P>
      <P>Although China's economy is expanding rapidly at 10 percent per year, Liu said
the country's vast underprivileged population has become increasingly
disgruntled with the sharp disparity in the social classes and with the
increasing wealth gap.</P>
      <P>As China is quickly moving toward a polarized society, the Chinese people,
mostly farmers, workers and poor citizens, are growing more and more
dissatisfied with the imbalance in development and injustice in society, leading
to more and more mass protests against the authorities, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Although the Chinese authorities are trying hard to maintain social harmony and
public order superficially through hardline means, Liu warned that conflict

      <P>Prosecutors will continue to appeal the verdict that acquitted opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou of embezzlement charges
against him if the verdict violates the law, a spokesman for the Taiwan High
Prosecutors Office said Friday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman further said the office respects the ruling of the High Court but
added that prosecutors had yet to receive the verdict and will decide whether or
not to appeal after reviewing the verdict.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after the Taiwan High Court upheld earlier in the
day the "not guilty" ruling of Ma's first trial.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the High Court and the prosecutors realize that the ruling
will have a major impact on the legal interpretation of the special allowances
for senior government officials.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the prosecutors will follow the law and make the decision that
best ensures social justice and equity, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of misusing funds and embezzling a total of
NT$11.17 million (US$343,701) from his special allowance fund during his terms
as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors in charge of the case claimed in the indictment that Ma
transferred half of those public funds to his personal bank account every month,
keeping that portion which was not used as his personal income, with the
knowledge that they were public funds.</P>
      <P>Ma was exonerated of the charges by the Taipei District Court Aug. 14, but the
prosecutors appealed the decision to the Taiwan High Court Aug. 27.</P>
      <P>In a related verdict, the Taiwan High Court that same day reduced the graft and
forgery jail term of Taipei city government staffer Yu Wen -- who was indicted
on charges of using invoices from other people to help Ma claim reimbursement
from the special allowance fund -- from 14 months to 12 months.</P>

      <P>Shen Fu-hsiung, who was a veteran member of the ruling Democratic Party (DPP)
before he withdrew from the DPP Oct. 3, made the comment in a conference held by
the non-profit Taiwan Competitiveness Forum at the Legislative Yuan.</P>

after he was cleared of the charges earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Based on his observations and statistics he claimed to have collected, Shen went
on, the KMT will win a majority in the Jan. 12 legislative elections and that
due to the possible "one-party domination" last seen in Lee Teng-hui and Chiang
Ching-kuo eras, he expects the Legislative Yuan to be free of notorious backroom
negotiations and inter-party conflict.</P>
      <P>If DPP presidential candidate Frank Hsieh wins the election, Shen claimed,
Taiwan could plunge into another round of political turmoil expected to last at
least four years because the DPP will not win a majority at the legislature in

      <P>Although prominent high-tech leaders such as United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC)
Honorary Chairman Robert H.C. Tsao may have little interest in politics, a Home
Party official said Friday that they are seeking to persuade Tsao to vie for the
presidency.</P>
      <P>Home Party Secretary-General Yao Lee-ming,  who is also a university professor
and veteran political analyst, made the comments to reporters while answering
questions on the eve of a Home Party-hosted dialogue on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations scheduled to take place on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Tsao and former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh have
been invited to exchange views and ideas on key cross-strait issues during the
dialogue, in order to provide the public with a clear understanding of their
respective stances on the issue, Yao said.</P>
      <P>Yao confirmed a local media report that his party has been trying to push Tsao
and Shih to pair up on a ticket in the March 22 presidential election with the
aim of offering the public a third choice apart from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, Shih is also encouraging Tsao to solicit widespread  public
support following the suit of South Korean President-elect Lee Myung Bak, who
enjoyed strong voter backing for his pro-business policy line.</P>
      <P>Tsao ran two advertisements last month in major local newspapers calling for the

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should publish a detailed list of its
members in the judicial and law enforcement agencies as part of the country's
pursuit of transitional justice to consolidate its young democracy, a senior
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey, who is also Government Information
Office minister, made the call after the Taiwan High Court upheld a lower
court's not guilty verdict on corruption charges against KMT presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou earlier that same day.</P>
      <P>Shieh said he does not trust the judiciary's integrity after learning that the
High Court's presiding judge handling Ma's case, Liu Ching-hsing, played a
leading role in a high-profile case against pro-independence activists during
Taiwan's infamous martial law era.</P>
      <P>After the unification of East and West Germany, said Shieh, who is a former
Taiwan representative to Germany, all judges and prosecutors of communist East
Germany were relieved of their posts on the grounds that it was the only way to
win the public's trust in the judiciary following Germany's unification under a
democratic system.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma's corruption case was politically sensitive, Shieh said it is
very controversial to have a person who once collaborated with  the  previous
authoritarian  KMT government  to convict pro-independence activists in a highly
political case to serve as the presiding judge in Ma's second trial.</P>
      <P>"In a normal and reasonable situation, Liu should have been relieved of his
judicial post or should have at least made a public apology," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>Accusing the KMT of abusing its legislative majority to prevent the passage of
legislation to facilitate the handling of some transitional justice cases or
problems, Shieh said he could find no peace of mind nor any feeling of justice
having prevailed as a result of the High Court verdict on Ma. He further said
the KMT should at least make public how many of its members work in the
judicial, prosecutorial and investigative organs.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Feb. 13 on charges of misappropriating public funds and
embezzling a total of NT$11.17 million (US$343,701) from his special allowance
fund during his terms as Taipei mayor from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>He was acquitted of the charges by the Taipei District Court Aug. 14, but the
prosecution appealed the decision to the Taiwan High Court Aug. 27.</P>

      <P>Although prominent high-tech leaders such as United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC)
Honorary Chairman Robert H.C. Tsao may have little interest in politics, a Home
Party official said Friday that they are seeking to persuade Tsao to vie for the
presidency.</P>
      <P>Home Party Secretary-General Yao Lee-ming,  who is also a university professor
and veteran political analyst, made the comments to reporters while answering
questions on the eve of a Home Party-hosted dialogue on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations scheduled to take place on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Tsao and former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh have
been invited to exchange views and ideas on key cross-strait issues during the
dialogue, in order to provide the public with a clear understanding of their
respective stances on the issue, Yao said.</P>
      <P>Yao confirmed a local media report that his party has been trying to push Tsao
and Shih to pair up on a ticket in the March 22 presidential election with the
aim of offering the public a third choice apart from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, Shih is also encouraging Tsao to solicit widespread  public
support following the suit of South Korean President-elect Lee Myung Bak, who
enjoyed strong voter backing for his pro-business policy line.</P>
      <P>Tsao ran two advertisements last month in major local newspapers calling for the
legislation of a cross-strait peace law to secure peace in the region and put an
end to domestic political infighting.</P>
      <P>Shih,  a  long-time  pro-democracy  activist,  led  mass anti-corruption
demonstrations against President Chen Shui-bian in autumn last year in downtown

Friday.</P>

magnets, cheap children's jewelry and children's face or body paints,  according

are potentially harmful to children, Wang said, adding that the bureau has
ordered that the responsible manufacturers recall the toxic products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 43, or 66 percent, of the products surveyed were not properly
labeled, and their manufacturers were ordered to make improvements within a

      <P>He advised parents shopping for children's products to check that the products
come with complete labels that include information such as data of the
manufacturers or importers, the main ingredients, volume and manufacture date of
the products, instructions on the use and preservation of the products, and any

cumulative punishments for repeat offenders. Fines will be doubled to NT$2,400
for first offenders who litter using other kinds of garbage bags, he added.</P>
      <P>Li said that 150 digital cameras have been procured to collect evidence and

      <P>Fewer workers have indicated an intention to change jobs at the end of this year
in light of the risk of doing so in a sluggish economy, according to the results
of a recent survey released Saturday by an online employment services provider.</P>
      <P>The survey by 104 Job Bank revealed that only 28.1 percent of the respondents
are certain about leaving their present positions after the Chinese New Year,
marking a decrease of 25.8 percentage points compared with the results of a
similar survey conducted at the same time last year.</P>
      <P>While only 2.4 percent of respondents said they had already found a new job,
37.5 percent said they have no intention of changing jobs immediately  but will
pay  close  attention  to any new job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Another 15.1 percent of respondents said they totally have no intention of
quitting their present jobs, with 43.6 percent of these workers believing it
would be highly risky to give up their jobs when the economy is sluggish.</P>
      <P>Other reasons mentioned by the respondents included that they maintain good
partnerships with their present colleagues and that they do not want to give up
the benefits and annual leave they enjoy in their present jobs. Only 17.1
percent said they are staying because they are very satisfied with their salary.</P>
      <P>On the biggest advantages of changing jobs, 32.9 percent of the respondents who
have changed jobs before mentioned that they received higher pay from their new
jobs, 21 percent said their new jobs were more interesting and 17.7 percent said
the benefits and annual leave offered by their new employers better fitted their
needs.</P>
      <P>However, 18.3 percent of respondents said they did not benefit from their new
jobs because the working conditions were worse than those of their previous
jobs.</P>
      <P>While job-changers received a 13.6 percent increase in their salaries from each
job change on average, approximately 30 percent of job changers saw no change in
their salaries.</P>
      <P>Among workers born in the 1980s, who are generally considered to display lower
employment stability, 44.4 percent saw their salaries level off or decrease
after a job change.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out Nov. 21-30 among 5,468 workers. It had a margin of
error of 1.33 percent.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet will announce next week more personnel  adjustments  targeting the
heads of local electoral commissions who disagree with the central government
over the voting format for the upcoming legislative elections and referendums,
Cabinet spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shieh said the Cabinet cannot delay the matter any further because the problem
must be solved before the election gazettes are printed.</P>
      <P>He would not identify the targeted localities but said officials subject to
replacement will definitely include those have promoted a "two-step" voting
format in handbooks for electoral workers.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet will also not rule out the possibility of referring these officials
for prosecution, he said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet made the move in response to a decision by the 18 counties and
cities controlled by the opposition Kuomintang-led "pan blue" alliance to follow
the "two-step" voting format, in defiance of the Central Election Commission's
decision to adopt a "one-step" voting format.</P>
      <P>The measure was only made possible following a recent amendment to the organic
rules of local election commissions, according to which the Central Election
Commission can ask the Cabinet to replace law-breaking members of city and
county election commissions.</P>
      <P>Over the past several days, the Cabinet has announced the replacement of the

      <P>Subsidization for language learning programs in various localities will be the
primary initiative for the National Immigration Agency (NIA) , as the language
barrier is the most important factor marring communication between new
immigrants and Taiwanese, an NIA official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>An annual fund of NT$300 million has been allocated and placed under the
administration of the NIA, to which local governments can apply for establishing
language learning programs to help new immigrants learn Mandarin and Taiwanese,
said NIA Director Wu Cheng-chi.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) established the Foreign Spouse Care and
Counseling Fund in 2005 with a total budget of NT$3 billion over a 10-year
period, Wu said on the sidelines of a seminar discussing care for new
immigrants.</P>
      <P>The language issue is the biggest challenge for foreign spouses and workers in
Taiwan, said Wen Chih-yi, director of a film titled "Nyonya's Taste of Life,
which tells the stories of two female Indonesian caretakers and a Thai worker in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Once we get to understand and befriend them, we will realize that they are no
different to us. Most of the cultural differences and misunderstandings come
from the language barrier, " she said.</P>
      <P>Another important initiative  for the coming year will be after-school tutoring
for the children of immigrant families because some foreign spouses have
difficulties counseling their children, Wu said, adding that this also
originates from the language barrier.</P>
      <P>Wu denied that the welfare of spouses from China has been ignored by the
authorities, saying that the biggest problem for Chinese spouses is obtaining
citizenship. Because of "national security issues, " it takes Chinese immigrants
eight years to get citizenship, he said.</P>
      <P>The NIA will also devote efforts in 2008 to catching runaway foreign workers.</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, runaway workers are a serious problem and we are too short-
handed to track all of them, " he said.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday that it would "compromise" by
accepting the Central Election Commission's (CEC's) rules for the voting format
in the Jan. 12 legislative elections and simultaneous referendums.</P>
      <P>The KMT's policy committee executive director, Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, made
the remarks after bitter bickering on the voting format between the Central
Election Commission  (CEC)  and 18 KMT-controlled local election commissions.</P>
      <P>Tseng noted that the voting format controversy had been raging for weeks,
leaving local election officials in a difficult situation. He claimed that "this
is why the KMT-controlled cities and counties are willing to compromise so as to
let Taiwan democracy continue to prosper."</P>
      <P>The renegade local election officials had been threatened with sacking and
prosecution if they went ahead with their unlawful action.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that it would accept the "two-step" ballot distribution and "one-
step" ballot casting recently offered by the CEC.</P>
      <P>This means that voters will claim two ballots for the legislative elections --
one ballot for legislative candidates and another for their favored political
party -- at one table. At a second table, they will claim another two ballots
for the accompanying referendums. The voters will then cast each ballot in one
of four ballot boxes in a "one-step" format.</P>
      <P>The CEC had originally planned to have voters claim four ballots at once and
cast them at different boxes in a different "one-step" format.</P>
      <P>But 18 KMT-controlled cities and counties wanted the "two-step" format that was
used in the 2004 presidential election, claiming that this would avoid confusion
and maintain the confidentiality of the voters.</P>
      <P>Under the "two-step" format, the voters would have claimed two referendum votes

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed Saturday that if the pro-unification Kuomintang
(KMT) garners more than half of the seats in the Jan. 12 legislative elections,
it will mean "the disaster of the nation."</P>
      <P>Chen,  who concurrently  serves as chairman of the ruling pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), urged voters to support  the  DPP,  which
he said  represents  Taiwan-centric consciousness.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the legislative election is no longer the battle for an
individual candidate or a party, but a battle to protect Taiwan from being taken
by China, predicting that if no DPP candidates win in Taipei's eight
constituencies, the party will "surely be ridiculed by China."</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when accompanying DPP legislative candidates Kao
Chien-Chih and Wang Shih-chien on a visit to a temple in Shihlin, Taipei to
canvass support.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Taipei City, a stronghold of the KMT and administered by
a KMT mayor,  will not only support the DPP presidential ticket of Frank Hsieh

garner its target of 50 seats in the streamlined 113-seat legislature to form a
stable majority.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was suffering from a cold, said his disabled wife Wu Shu-jen also had
a fever of 39 degrees Celsius, and he prayed to the goddess Matsu to seek her

      <P>A group of liberal scholars formed a new organization Saturday to pursue the
truth about human rights abuses during Taiwan's infamous martial law era as part
of their efforts to to promote reconciliation and put the country's
authoritarian past to rest.</P>
      <P>"The new organization  --  Taiwan Truth and Reconciliation Commission or Taiwan
TRC -- will dig for the truth of human rights violations  and  political
persecution  during  the  previous authoritarian rule and clarify political and
legal responsibilities of those cases, " said Wu Nai-teh, a board director of
the non-governmental organization.</P>
      <P>Noting that for a country to make a successful transition to democracy, it must
make a full accounting of the abuses committed by the previous administration,
Wu said pursuing transitional justice requires not only a well-rounded or
circumspect discourse but also long-term hard work.</P>
      <P>"We need a private truth commission to explore a broad picture of human rights
suppression,  abuses  and violations  during the authoritarian period," Wu said,
adding that getting to the bottom of truth is the bedrock for national
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>He further said digging for previous human rights abuses and political
persecution should not be aimed at getting a basis for prosecution or punishment
of perpetrators.</P>
      <P>The findings should mainly be used as teaching materials to inspire self-
reflection and prevent recurrence of similar atrocities, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the Taiwan TRC's work agenda might cause misgivings of the
country's two bitter rival groups -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-led
"pan-green" camp and the main opposition Kuomintang-led "pan-blue alliance, " Wu
said the work is not just a political one, but also a cultural movement.</P>
      <P>So long as the new organization can push society to gradually face and
acknowledge what happened in the past and draw inspirations from past incidents,
Wu said he believes that the Taiwan TRC will get sympathy and support.</P>
      <P>In addition to looking into the previously classified historical documents, Wu
said the organization will launch a publicity campaign to help the public better
understand the gist of transitional justice, foster social consensus and push
for legislation of relevant laws to pave the way for materialization of
transitional justice.</P>
      <P>"Seeking transitional justice involves many dimensions of work, " Wu said,
adding that common to all forms of justice is official acknowledgement of what
happened.</P>
      <P>As official disclosure of the truth is a form of justice, Wu said the former
ruling party and relevant government organs should offer access to information
or archives held by them.</P>
      <P>Stressing that seeking transitional justice should go beyond consideration of
partisan interests, Wu said exploring cases of human rights abuses or violations
during the rule of the two late President Chiangs -- Chiang Kai-shek and his son
Chiang Ching-kuo -- requires extensive and sophisticated investigations and that
reconciliation between rival political camps can only be accomplished on the
basis of the results of such delicate work.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan TRC has some 40 founding members. Wu said he hopes more like-minded
academics can join the group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scholars form organization to promote transitional justice</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of liberal scholars formed a new organization Saturday to pursue the
truth about human rights abuses during Taiwan's infamous martial law era as part
of their efforts to to promote reconciliation and put the country's
authoritarian past to rest.</P>
      <P>"The new organization  --  Taiwan Truth and Reconciliation Commission or Taiwan
TRC -- will dig for the truth of human rights violations  and  political
persecution  during  the  previous authoritarian rule and clarify political and
legal responsibilities of those cases, " said Wu Nai-teh, a board director of
the non-governmental organization.</P>
      <P>Noting that for a country to make a successful transition to democracy, it must
make a full accounting of the abuses committed by the previous administration,
Wu said pursuing transitional justice requires not only a well-rounded or
circumspect discourse but also long-term hard work.</P>
      <P>"We need a private truth commission to explore a broad picture of human rights
suppression,  abuses  and violations  during the authoritarian period," Wu said,
adding that getting to the bottom of truth is the bedrock for national
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>He further said digging for previous human rights abuses and political
persecution should not be aimed at getting a basis for prosecution or punishment
of perpetrators.</P>
      <P>The findings should mainly be used as teaching materials to inspire self-
reflection and prevent recurrence of similar atrocities, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the Taiwan TRC's work agenda might cause misgivings of the
country's two bitter rival groups -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party-led
"pan-green" camp and the main opposition Kuomintang-led "pan-blue alliance, " Wu
said the work is not just a political one, but also a cultural movement.</P>
      <P>So long as the new organization can push society to gradually face and
acknowledge what happened in the past and draw inspirations from past incidents,
Wu said he believes that the Taiwan TRC will get sympathy and support.</P>
      <P>In addition to looking into the previously classified historical documents, Wu
said the organization will launch a publicity campaign to help the public better
understand the gist of transitional justice, foster social consensus and push
for legislation of relevant laws to pave the way for materialization of
transitional justice.</P>
      <P>"Seeking transitional justice involves many dimensions of work, " Wu said,
adding that common to all forms of justice is official acknowledgement of what
happened.</P>
      <P>As official disclosure of the truth is a form of justice, Wu said the former
ruling party and relevant government organs should offer access to information
or archives held by them.</P>
      <P>Stressing that seeking transitional justice should go beyond consideration of
partisan interests, Wu said exploring cases of human rights abuses or violations
during the rule of the two late President Chiangs -- Chiang Kai-shek and his son
Chiang Ching-kuo -- requires extensive and sophisticated investigations and that
reconciliation between rival political camps can only be accomplished on the
basis of the results of such delicate work.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan TRC has some 40 founding members. Wu said he hopes more like-minded
academics can join the group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>There has been only one voting format: President</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that there has been only one voting format
set for adoption in the Jan. 12 legislative elections and referendums and there
is no "compromise" version.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a campaign rally to stump for ruling Democratic Progressive
Party legislative candidate Chien Chao-tung in Taichung County, central Taiwan,
Chen said there has been only one voting format adopted for the upcoming
legislative elections -- the "one step" voting format worked out and promulgated
by the Central Election Commission (CEC) more than a month ago.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, said he would still like to offer his appreciation to the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) for its decision the day before to accept a
"compromise" version of voting format, thereby helping to put an end to bitter
bickering over the voting format between the Cabinet-level CEC and 18 KMT-
controlled local governments over the past several weeks.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung also spoke Sunday to express relief and to welcome the
KMT's decision to no longer insist on adopting a "two step" voting format.  He
said the administration  needs local governments' cooperation in order to carry
out electoral affairs smoothly.</P>
      <P>KMT Policy committee executive director and Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan
announced at a news conference Saturday that the KMT, taking the interests of
the whole country into account, would "compromise" by accepting the CEC's rules
for the voting format in the Jan. 12 legislative elections in a bid to ensure
that Taiwan's democracy continues to flourish.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the KMT would accept the "two-step" ballot distribution and
"one-step" ballot casting option recently offered by the CEC. This means that
voters will claim two ballots for the legislative elections -- one ballot for
legislative candidates and another for their favored political party -- at one
table. At a second table,  they will claim another  two ballots  for the
accompanying referendums. The voters will then cast each ballot in one of four
ballot boxes in a "one-step" format.</P>
      <P>The CEC has planned to have voters claim four ballots at once and cast them at
different boxes in a different "one-step" format. But 18 KMT-controlled cities
and counties wanted the "two-step" format that was used in the 2004 presidential
election, claiming that this would avoid confusion and maintain the
confidentiality of the voters. Under the "two-step" format, the voters would
have claimed two referendum votes after casting their legislative votes.</P>

      <P>First lady Wu Shu-jen's condition is improving after being attended by doctors,
but she will remain under close observation,  a spokesman for National Taiwan
University Hospital (NTUH) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's wife was admitted to the NTUH Saturday suffering from
pneumonia caused by a cold.</P>
      <P>NTUH spokesman Tan Ching-ding said that Wu had developed a fever, which reached
39.2 degrees Celsius before she was admitted to the NTUH. Her temperature was
still high at around 38 degrees Celsius Sunday.</P>
      <P>The first lady has been diagnosed as having an elevated level of white blood
cells, low blood pressure and an electrolytic imbalance as a result of high
levels of potassium in her blood, Tan added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wong Chao-min, a chief physician with the NTUH's Department of
Internal Medicine, said that Wu's fever has been brought under control and the
physicians attending her believe that their diagnosis and treatment directions
are on the right track.</P>
      <P>Wong noted that presently it is still difficult to predict when Wu could be
discharged from the hospital, adding that in addition to diagnosis and
treatment, other factors, including the patient's condition and body's
constitution, could contribute to alter the time of discharge.</P>

      <P>A group of small parties urged the public Sunday to reject the referendums
initiated by two major parties in the upcoming legislative elections and cast
their ballots for them instead.</P>
      <P>Led by Hwang Kwang-kuo, chief of the Democratic Action Alliance, these small
parties claim at a news conference in Taipei that both the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, which initiated a referendum on the country's bid for U.N.
membership under the name of Taiwan, and leading opposition of Kuomintang (KMT)
, which initiated the referendum on the country's return to the U.N., are
cheating the voters as neither of their proposals is feasible.</P>
      <P>Hwang and representatives of New Party, Home Party, Nonpartisan Solidarity
Union, Taiwan Citizen Party, Taiwan Hakka Party and Taiwan Farmer's Party told

referendums  to turn out their supporters, in full knowledge that the matters
being voted on won't be realized through a referendum.</P>

      <P>Christina Liu,  a legislative candidate of the Nonpartisan Solidarity Union told

      <P>A kbusiness tycoon and the leader of the 2006 anti-corruption movement aimed at
President Chen Shui-bian engaged in a dialogue Saturday on Ketagalan Boulevard
to elaborate on their views regarding a cross-Taiwan Strait peaceful co-
existence law and making Taiwan a nation of freedom.</P>
      <P>Microelectronics Corp (UMC) Honorary Chairman Robert Tsao met with Shih Ming-
teh,  former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman and leader of the anti-
Chen campaign, at the open air forum organized  by the Home Party during which
Tsao dismissed the possibility that he would team up with Shih to run in the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Addressing the forum, Tsao first renewed his call for the passing of a cross-
strait peace law, adding that the law will be conducive to the development of
cross-strait political and economic relations.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that key points of his proposed law include dropping any plan to
conduct a referendum on independence for Taiwan, not ruling out the possibility
of unification with China, with the proviso that a unification referendum first
be put to the people.</P>
      <P>He added that the unification referendum will only be held at the request of
China and before the referendum is voted on, China must clearly specify all the
rights and obligations of Taiwan under which unification would take place to
allow the people of Taiwan to make an informed decision.</P>
      <P>Should the referendum be adopted, unification could be achieved, if not, China
could make a new request for a second unification referendum, Tsao said, adding
that there should be no limitation on how many times the referendum would be
held.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tsao's calls for no referendum on independence, Shih said that as the
majority of the 23 million people of Taiwan see Taiwan as an independent and
sovereign nation, there is no need to hold a referendum on the issue, adding
that only a referendum on unification is needed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih broached the concept of the division of power and forming a
great coalition government to allow more capable and qualified people to manage
state affairs, while appealing to national leaders to take the lead in
accomodationg differing factions of society and further building Taiwan into a
free country.</P>
      <P>Touching on the development of cross-strait economics and trade, Tsao attributed
Taiwan's lackluster economic performance over the past eight years to rampant
anti-China sentiment in the country, deploring that Taiwan has missed a good
opportunity to take advantage of access to the greater China market during its
economic rise over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Shih said that although the main opposition Kuomintang has revealed its economic
policies, it still needs to work on developing more concrete details for future
economic development.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will maintain a hands-off policy for the time

no time to think about how to solicit support for the referendum proposal it
initiated.</P>

mark, while the trade surplus is expected to expand to US$30 billion, according
to the latest forecast released Sunday by the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The report shows that the country enjoyed booming exports this year and that as
of Dec. 15 exports had grown by approximately 9.6 percent, while the cumulative
trade surplus reached US$25.56 billion and the total value of foreign trade
topped US$439.8 billion.</P>
      <P>The latest figures also forecast that the value of total foreign trade for the
year is likely to break the US$450 billion mark, while the trade surplus is
expected to amount to US$27.5 billion: both record highs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the forecast published December by Global Insight Inc.,
an international economic forecasting company, the global economic growth rate
for this year would drop to 3.8 percent, down from 4 percent for last year due
to slowing economic growth in the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>Global Insight also lowered the global growth forecast for 2008 to 3.4 percent
because of the negative effects of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.</P>
      <P>However, the report of the Bureau of Froeign Trade showed that given increased
economic interdependence between China and Taiwan, Taiwan is expected to benefit
from China's steady economic growth, which will cushion the impact from falling
global markets.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Taiwan's growth in exports for 2008 is likely to slow slightly to an
estimated 8.52 percent, with total exports reaching an estimated US$265.32
billion. The projected import growth rate will be 8.36 percent, with total
imports estimated to reach US$234.83 billion, according to the report.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu reminded the Taiwanese people to cherish the country's
hard-won democracy in light of the fact that , people in neighboring Hong Kong
will have to wait another 10 years before they can elect their own leaders, and</P>
      <P>Lu made the comments Saturday while stumping for Lin Shu-feng, a legislative
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Lu was referring to reports on an announcement issued earlier the same day by
Hong Kong's chief executive that China would allow Hong Kong to directly elect
its own leader by 2017 and all of its lawmakers by 2020.</P>
      <P>Describing Hong Kongers' demand for universal suffrage as a humble wish, Lu
lamented that it cannot be fulfilled. She added that despite the fact that Hong
Kong is free and rich, it still lacks full democracy.</P>
      <P>Mentioning China on the same occasion, Lu said that although the 1.3 billion
Chinese people eagerly look forward to becoming a democratic country, nobody
could forecast when they will be granted the right to elect their own leaders.</P>
      <P>To emphasize the preciousness of democracy, Lu cited Pakistan as an example,
claiming that the country's lack of democracy had led to the exile of its former
premier Benazir Bhutto and her recent assassination after risking her life to
return home earlier this year to run in an upcoming election.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's hard-earned democracy has come about as the result of the
sacrifices of an enormous number of people, Lu said that should make the
Taiwanese people cherish it even more.</P>
      <P>Lu also appealed to Taiwan's people to treasure what they now enjoy, including
freedom of speech and economic freedom.</P>
      <P>Even though the country is facing a surge in unemployment and a slump in
business due to a mass exodus of local traditional industries to China, Lu
rebutted reports that South Korea's economic performance outshone Taiwan's,
citing to bolster her arguments recent statistics showing that for the first 10
months of this year, Taiwan's exports increased 9percent, the trade surplus
reached US$25.7 billion and foreign direct investment stood at US$10.1 billion.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu claimed Sunday that the Ministry of Education's bungle
in changing the name of the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall has negative impact
on the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party's (DPP's)  campaign for upcoming
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lu said the administration's decision to change the inscription on the gateway
of the hall, which was initially built in memory of the late President Chiang
Kai-shek, from one honoring Chiang to "Liberty Square" is right, but the
Ministry of Education has bungled it by doing it tactlessly and thereby prompted
protest from the government of Taipei City which houses the hall and followers
of Chiang.</P>
      <P>Lu apologized for the ministry's bungle and urged the Minister of Education Tu
Cheng-sheng to follow suit and don't try to shift the blame onto his
subordinates.</P>
      <P>She made the comment while stumping for DPP legislative candidate Jao Yung-ching

      <P>Japan has recently explained that it "does not oppose" Taiwan's plan to hold a
referendum on its bid for a seat in the United Nations under the name Taiwan,
but hopes the referendum will not raise tension in the Taiwan Strait, a senior
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Japan told the ministry that it will not support the planned referendum "if it
leads (Taiwan) to take unilateral action to change the status quo, " noted Huang
Ju-hou, chief executive officer of the MOFA Committee on Japanese Affairs.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks in an interview with CNA in response to questions about
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's comment on the U.N.-bid referendum during
a visit he made to China last week. The comment drew international attention,
with Fukuda reported to be opposed to Taiwan's holding of the referendum along
with its 2008 presidential election slated for March. 22.</P>
      <P>Huang claimed that Fukuda's remarks on the issue were "distorted" by some
foreign media outlets.</P>
      <P>Citing Japan's mass-circulation Sankei Shimbun, Huang said Fukuda said in a
Friday meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao in Beijing that Japan
does not support "two Chinas" or "one China and one Taiwan" and neither does it
support Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, a Japanese foreign ministry official in charge of Asia-
Pacific affairs told reporters covering the meeting that "not supporting" and
"opposing" have different meanings, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>According to a Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' publication on Fukuda's
statement, Huang went on, the Japanese prime minister underlined that he will
not support any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo, and hopes
Taiwan's referendum will not increase cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>Judging from this statement, Huang said it is "obvious" that Japan "is not
opposed" to the referendum.</P>
      <P>What Japan will not support is a referendum that will change the status quo in
the strait, Huang went on.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official  told CNA that after receiving  Japan's explanation of
Fukuda's remarks, MOFA expressed its understanding and reiterated that joining
the U.N. is a common consensus and a common wish of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>The planned referendum does not touch the issue of independence and unification
and will not change the status quo in the strait, Huang stressed, calling for
the Japanese government's trust and respect for the right of the Taiwanese
people to exercise their rights as citizens of a democratic country.</P>

      <P>For example,  Kuo's  work is inspired  by the traditional architecture of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided Monday to boycott the referendums to be
held alongside the Jan. 12 legislative elections and was immediately accused by
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration of being "a puppet party
of China."</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung said his party, which has itself initiated one of the
referendum proposals -- to rid the government of corruption -- made the decision
"with pain, " claiming that the referendums are being used by the DPP -- which
has initiated a referendum proposal on retrieving the KMT's ill-gotten assets --
as a means of bringing out its supporters or triggering conflict.</P>
      <P>Wu said the decision was made at a meeting of the party's Central Standing
Committee in which almost all its members participated earlier that day and was
acknowledged by the party's presidential candidate, Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>He apologized to the party's supporters for urging them to support the KMT-
initiated referendum proposal at first only to later ask them to stay away from
it.</P>
      <P>Wu said boycotting the referendum is the last resort for his party after it was
forced to accept the Central Election Commission's decision to employ a "one-
step" voting format in the referendum rather than a "two-step" voting format
preferred by the KMT.</P>
      <P>Under the "one-step" format, voters will be given two referendum ballots along
with two ballots for the legislative elections being held at the same time,
while the "two-step" voting format would give voters their referendum ballots
only after they have cast their legislative ballots.</P>
      <P>Unless the DPP stops using referendums as an electioneering gambit, Wu said, the
KMT will also boycott a referendum initiated by the DPP on the country's bid for
U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan, which is scheduled to be held March 22
alongside the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey told a news conference that the KMT is
cooperating with China to scuttle the country's U.N. bid and said the KMT's
decision has "betrayed its scheme to kill referendum via referendum."</P>
      <P>He challenged the KMT to establish relations with China outright, and urged
voters to punish the party by denying it their support.</P>

      <P>The U.S.-based Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) rated Taiwan the
sixth lowest-risk country for investment in its third quarterly Business
Environment Risk Report of 2007.</P>
      <P>In the BERI's report, which evaluates the business environment of over 50
countries, Taiwan has maintained its 6th place ranking among the world's lowest
risk countries for investment, behind Switzerland, Singapore, the Netherlands,
Japan, and Norway.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintained its scores from the last BERI report, receiving a rating of
1A, and a score of 72 on BERI's profit opportunity recommendation (POR) score.
The score indicates that Taiwan is a low-risk country well-suited for
investment.</P>
      <P>The report predicts that Taiwan's overall investment environment would continue
to improve, and that Taiwan's POR score will rise to 73 by 2008, and 74 by 2012,
while maintaining its sixth ranking.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked third among Asian countries for its business environment, behind
only Singapore and Japan, but ahead of China, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand,
India and the Philippines, among others.</P>
      <P>The Business Environment Risk Report is designed to assess the business
environment of various countries based on three main indices: the operations
Risk Index, political Risk Index, and remittance and repatriation factor index.
In the latest report, Taiwan ranked third worldwide in terms of the Operations
Risk Index, with a score of 72, the same ranking and score as in the last
report. Only Switzerland and Singapore scored higher.</P>
      <P>BERI sees Taiwan's operating risks as stable and predicted that the nation will
continue to improve in this regard from 2008 to 2009.</P>
      <P>On the Political Risk Index, Taiwan ranked 15th globally, with a score of 59,
both the same as in the last report. The report indicated  Taiwan's score most
likely reflects the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming legislative and
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>As to the remittance and repatriation factor, Taiwan ranked fifth globally and
third in Asia, and its ranking and scores remained unchanged from the last BERI
report.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan, with its trade surplus and international
payment surplus, will maintain a strong position in the rankings. The report

      <P>A decision will be made at the end of January on whether or not to maintain the
current price levels for domestic gasoline through February, Minister of
Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Gasoline prices have been frozen since Nov. 2 when they were adjusted upwards
using a floating pricing mechanism, with the prices of all grades of the state-
run CPC Corp., Taiwan's unleaded gasoline rising to over NT$30 per liter.</P>
      <P>Chen noted in response to media inquiries that a decision on whether or not to
adjust prices for February will be arrived at after the government conducts an
overall review of fluctuating commodity prices, the country's economic
situation, social justice, as well as international crude oil price
fluctuations.</P>
      <P>Asked how the CPC will be affected if gasoline prices are frozen at the current
level,  Chen indicated that the state-operated company's operational income
recorded a decline of NT$5 billion in December compared with the previous month.</P>
      <P>Despite the drop, he went on, the company still enjoyed an operating surplus for
the year.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education announced Monday anew initiative to help students from
low-income families as more and more children are reporting difficulties paying
school bills.</P>
      <P>The School Education Savings Accounts, to be officially opened Jan. 1, will
enable 2,114 elementary, junior high and high schools and their individual
students to receive aid from donors.</P>
      <P>On the outset, the accounts will share a lump sum of NT$200 million (US$6.15
million) provided by the Ministry of Education, said Minister Tu Cheng-sheng.</P>
      <P>The new measure is aimed at helping over 50,000 students each year from the 6th
to the 12th grades whose families cannot afford the basic tuition and school
lunches.</P>
      <P>These include students from low to lower- middle income families and those whose
families have suffered financially due to unforeseen circumstances.</P>
      <P>The measure will add to the current help being provided to those underprivileged
students, Tu said. For the last few years, the ministry has subsidized school
meals for those who have applied as long as the application comes with a
teacher's approval.</P>
      <P>The basic fees excluding lunch for each semester is about NT$1,100 for a child
enrolled in a public junior high school, and NT$1,300 for an elementary school
student. In addition, textbook fees range from NT$300 for a 1st or 2nd grader to
about NT$660 for a 12th grader per semester.</P>
      <P>School lunches cost about an extra NT$2,750 for each semester.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly half of the people responding to a recent poll said they were not
satisfied with their income in 2007, according to the results of a survey
released by Global Views Monthly magazine Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted between Nov. 30 and Dec. 5, elicited information from an
effective sample of 1,007 people. The survey has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points 19 times out of 20.</P>
      <P>The results show that 42.8 percent of respondents believe that Taiwan's economy
will deteriorate further in 2008.</P>
      <P>Their pessimism is due to a series of factors, including the government's
ambiguous policies, confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties,
politicians paying only lip service to the economy, the reluctance of foreign
investors to invest in Taiwan and the delayed realization of the three direct
links in transport, trade and postal services between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Only 29 percent of interviewees are optimistic that the economy will improve in
2008.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 34 percent of those polled said the stand-off between
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the main opposition Kuomintang is
the foremost issue to be resolved as soon as possible, followed by economic
development, education, unemployment and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall to re-open Tuesday</HEADLINE>

      <P>A special exhibition will open at the main hall of the National Taiwan Democracy
Memorial Hall Tuesday to mark the completion of its renovation, a spokesman for
the hall said Monday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will attend the opening ceremony, during which he will
open the main entrance to the hall where a giant bronze statue of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek will remain in place, said Tseng Kun-ti, the hall's
curator.</P>
      <P>The main hall has been shut since its name plaque and an inscription on the arch
gateway to the memorial hall complex were replaced earlier this month to get rid
of all references to the late president who has been branded by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as a dictator and the main perpetrator of the
tragic 228 Incident of 1947.</P>
      <P>President Chen said last weekend while stumping for a DPP legislative candidate
that Chiang's statue will stay put, but the walls of the hall will be decorated
with posters featuring the names, photos and life accounts of those who were
wrongly killed or persecuted during Chiang's authoritarian rule of Taiwan until
his death in 1975.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the exhibition has been planned by the 228 Incident Memorial
Foundation and that he does not know the content of the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Tseng made the remarks while explaining the itinerary of the exhibition's
opening ceremony at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony will open with a song performed by the National Taiwan
Symphony Orchestra and the National Experimental Chorus, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Afterwards, a group of 100 people will sing four more tunes before Chen opens
the hall gate, Tseng went on.</P>
      <P>After visiting the special exhibition at the main hall on the second floor of
the building, Chen will pay a visit to two exhibitions on the ground floor
featuring the government's lifting of a ban on the launch of new newspapers and
the country's human rights promotion efforts, respectively, Tseng noted.</P>
      <P>For safety concern, areas close to the memorial hall will be closed to public
access from 2: 00 a.m. to noon Tuesday, Tseng said, adding that the exhibition
at the hall will be open to the public from Tuesday afternoon.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou will issue
a New Year's message Tuesday in which he will call for the government to assure
that there will be a peaceful transition of power May 20, 2008 regardless of the
results of the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to a pre-released copy of his New Year's message made available to the
media Monday evening, Ma describes 2008 as a critical year that will determine
Taiwan's destiny and its democratic future.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 2008 presidential election will decide whether Taiwan's young
democracy will continue to prosper and whether clean politics can be achieved,
Ma's New Year's message says that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration should be required to ensure smooth and orderly proceeding of the
election in an open and fair manner.</P>
      <P>And regardless of the electoral outcome, the statement says the DPP
administration is obligated to guarantee a peaceful transition of power without
any chaos or upheaval.</P>
      <P>Ma will deliver his new year's message after attending a flag-raising ceremony
in front of the Presidential Office Tuesday morning.</P>
