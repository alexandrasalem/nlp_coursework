    <HEADLINE>Taiwan seeks IPR protection assistance from Chinese officials</HEADLINE>

      <P>Officials of Taiwan's Intellectual Property Office (IPO) sought advice from
their mainland Chinese counterparts in Taipei Monday on how Taiwanese companies
can better defend their intellectual property rights (IPR) against infringement
in China.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with a visiting group of Chinese officials, the Taiwan office took
the opportunity to express Taiwan's wish that the Chinese government would
establish consultation service windows in major cities around China to assist
Taiwanese companies whose intellectual properties have been pirated, but faced
difficulties making compensation claims, said IPO Director-General Wang Mei-hua.</P>
      <P>Wang said her office has been approached by a large number of Taiwanese
companies who have complained that they have suffered from IPR infringement in
China of their products, including printed or audio-visual publications and
motion pictures, but do not have a clue about where to make a claim.</P>
      <P>"Quite unlike in Taiwan, where victims of IPR piracy go to the court directly
for their complaints, similar cases were handled in administrative offices in
China," Wang noted.</P>
      <P>For Taiwanese music producers, she said, they would have to approach a semi-
official Chinese agency based in Hong Kong first for an approval certificate
before their publications or products could actually enter the mainland Chinese
market.</P>
      <P>They also complained that the fees that they have collected in China for karaoke
music download authorization were disproportionate compared to that collected in
Taiwan, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Before the closed-door meeting, the officials from the two sides attended a
forum on cross-strait IPR and related affairs organized by the General Chamber
of Commerce of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The Chinese official leading the delegation that attended the meeting was Zhao
Xiuling, a department head in charge of law enforcement against IPR violations
and infringement at China's National Copyright Administration.</P>
      <P>When asked at the forum what the Taiwanese individuals or companies should do
when their intellectual property rights were infringed upon in China, Zhao said
they should approach relevant governmental agencies for administrative reviews
and administrative rulings on their appeals.</P>
      <P>If the infringement case is "particularly serious" and involved criminal
charges, she said, the accusatory parties could seek judicial protection and
justice.</P>
      <P>Neither side released any figure on how much copyright violations have cost
Taiwanese companies, but the number of copyrights across the strait on
publications of all kinds totaled around 12,000 between 2002-2008, according to
the forum organizer.</P>

      <P>Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) announced Monday that from Dec. 1, its flights
to Rome will transit via the Indian city of Delhi rather than the Thai city of
Bangkok.</P>
      <P>CAL, which operates three flights per week to Rome, will become the only airline
in the world to fly the route via Delhi, a move that is expected to cut the
flight time by an hour, the company said.</P>
      <P>"The change is based not only on the factor that there is a significant number
of Indian immigrants in Italy, but also on the potential of an increasing number
of Italian and Taiwanese passengers using this route for tourism and business in
India," CAL said.</P>
      <P>"It will also strengthen Taiwan's geographic position as a transit hub," it
added.</P>
      <P>The twice-weekly Taipei-Bangkok-Rome flights will be replaced by three Taipei-
Delhi-Rome flights per week, according to CAL.</P>
      <P>Flights will depart from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 8:25 a.m. every
Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, reaching Delhi at 1: 10 p.m. for a 75 minute
transit stop before arriving in Rome at 6: 40 p.m. the same day.</P>
      <P>The return flights will leave at 10: 40 p.m. from Rome and reach Delhi at 10: 55
a.m. the next day for a 75 minute transit stop before arriving in Taiwan at 8:20
p.m. that day.</P>
      <P>In addition to hiring Italian-speaking flight attendants to work the route, CAL
said it has also recruited Indian cabin crew to provide diversified services for
international travelers.</P>

      <P>An increasing number of Taiwanese senior high school students are learning a
second foreign language aside from English, according to the Ministry of
Education (MOE) Monday.</P>
      <P>Citing the latest statistics, the MOE pointed out that 30,272 of the more than
400,000 senior high school students around the country are taking a class in a
second foreign language during the first semester of the 2009 academic year.</P>
      <P>The number of students taking a second foreign language marks a growth of 5
percent compared with the previous semester, the MOE said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The most popular languages for the students to study as a second foreign
language are Japanese, Spanish, German and French, according to the MOE
statement.</P>
      <P>To encourage the students to seek advanced studies in a second foreign language,
they will have the chance to take advanced language courses in universities as a
preparatory course before graduating from high school so long as they gain four
credit points, or complete 72 hours of the basic course at their senior high
school and pass proficiency tests, the MOE said.</P>
      <P>According to MOE statistics, there are eight universities, including  National
Taiwan  University  and National  Chengchi University, which offer the
preparatory language courses in Japanese, German, French and Spanish for senior
high school students.</P>
      <P>Taiwan did not include a second foreign language in its senior high school
curriculum framework until 2004.</P>
      <P>MOE officials said that to help local students sharpen their international
competitive edge, the ministry will expand the number of foreign language
courses offered in the future and open courses in a wider variety of languages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Descendants from China of Taiwanese tribe on roots-tracing visit</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two descendants of Taiwan's indigenous Tsou tribe from a small village in
China's Henan Province are currently on a roots-tracing visit to Taiwan to learn
more about their tribal heritage and their clan.</P>
      <P>Chen Chaohu and Chen Chaojie are visiting Taiwan for the first time and are
scheduled to travel to the Tsou tribe's home territory around Taiwan's famous
Alishan mountain resort later this week to pay tribute to their ancestors.</P>
      <P>The Chen clan can trace its ancestry back 13 generations to Alishan in southern
Taiwan's Chiayi County, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>The Chens are the 12th-generation offspring of Tsou tribesman Yina Silo, who
along with his brother joined the army of Cheng Cheng-Kung (1624-1662), better
known in the West as Koxinga, to expel Dutch colonists.</P>
      <P>Afterwards, Yina Silo stayed with Cheng's army while his brother returned to
their tribal settlement. Yina Silo became a stablehand of Huang Ting, a general
in Cheng's army.</P>
      <P>Huang later led a large body of troops, including Yina Silo, that defected to
the Qing Dynasty after Cheng died in 1662, and Huang and his subordinates were
assigned to garrison the area known today as Nanyang.</P>
      <P>Yina Silo married a local Han Chinese woman and took up residence in the village
of Shangying. Fearing discrimination by the Han people, he changed his name to
Chen Nien, adopting his wife's family name.</P>
      <P>The couple had four children, and when Huang was ordered to lead Qing Dynasty
troops on an invasion of Taiwan, Yina Silo persuaded his superior to take two of
his sons -- Yuanhsun and Yuanchieh -- back to Alishan in the hope that he would
be able to organize a family reunion in Taiwan upon his retirement.</P>
      <P>However, Yina Silo failed to realize his wish. He never set foot in his homeland
again and after he died, his offspring in Shangying lost contact with the
descendants of the two sons who returned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following 300 years of cultural assimilation,  Yina Silo's descendants in China
have settled into the Han Chinese lifestyle, but their aboriginal
characteristics, such as a high-bridged nose and prominent cheekbones, remain
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Some of the Tsou tribal customs, such as singing and dancing at wedding
ceremonies and placing a wooden slab beneath coffins, have also been preserved.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Chen clan's aboriginal origins did not become widely known
until 1982 when the Nanyang area conducted a census. A local official
inadvertently discovered documents showing that the 200-plus-strong Chen clan in
Shangying village are of Tsou descent.</P>
      <P>The ancestral relationship was further confirmed in 1997 when the Chen clan's
genealogical book surfaced, clearly recounting the family's history.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Wu Tien-hsi, a Taiwanese businessman in Henan Province's Zhengzhou
City, volunteered to help the Chen clan search for their relatives back in
Taiwan. With help from various local officials, he located the clan's Taiwanese
relatives in Alishan's Dana settlement.</P>
      <P>Two years later, the Tsou chieftain headed a group of Yina Silo's Taiwanese
descendants on a visit to Shangying village, where a Tsou ritual was performed
to usher the clan's ancestral spirit back to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Since Taiwan and mainland China agreed to provide each other assistance in
fighting cross-border crime in June, the two sides have gradually established
an institutionalized cooperation mechanism and have successfully cracked down on
a cross-strait scam ring, a Taiwanese official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Between June 25 and Oct. 31, judicial authorities in Taiwan and mainland China
received a total of 4,199 requests to investigate and arrest criminals,
according to Liu Te-shun, vice chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC).</P>
      <P>While it will take time for the cooperation platform to function more
effectively, Liu said, he noted that judicial authorities on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait have achieved initial success in fighting crime by exposing a
fraud ring and arresting 76 Taiwanese and more than 10 Chinese suspects earlier
this month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also requested Chinese authorities extradite Taiwanese nationals who
have committed economic crimes in Taiwan, taken advantage of the judicial
loopholes, and fled across the strait, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The "Agreement on Joint Cross-Strait Crime-fighting and Mutual Judicial
Assistance," between the two sides took effect on June 25.</P>
      <P>It was reached on April 26 upon the conclusion of the third round of talks
between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Ping-kun and
mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS)
Chairman Chen Yunlin in Nanjing.</P>
      <P>The two bodies negotiate for the two sides in the absence of formal government-
to-government relations.</P>
      <P>In addition to the agreement, the two representatives signed accords in which
the two sides agreed to increase the number of direct flights and flight
destinations between two sides, as well as to promote mainland Chinese
investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On July 4, the first large group of Chinese tourists arrived in Taiwan, Liu
said, adding that between July and October, Taiwan received a total of 513, 229
Chinese visitors and grossed some US$1.05 billion in foreign exchange from the
tourist arrivals from China.</P>
      <P>Among the over 500,000 tourists from China, only 15 cases of tourists gone
missing or overstaying their visas have been reported, according to Liu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A big chunk of Taiwan's imports of Chinese herbal and traditional medicines came
from mainland China, the non-profit Development Center for Biotechnology
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported US$29.66 million worth of Chinese herbal medicine from the
Chinese mainland in 2008, making the island China's fifth largest export market
for this type of exports, Liu Tzu-hui, a researcher with the center, quoted a
Chinese government customs report as indicating.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's customs statistics, however, the percentage of Taiwan's
Chinese medicine imports from mainland China was even greater - at about 60-70
percent of its total imports of this type of product.</P>
      <P>Ginseng preparations made the bulk of these imports, constituting about 28.5
percent of the total, Liu said, citing Taiwanese official statistics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports of Chinese herbal medicine materials from around the world,
excluding prepared herbal medicines, totaled NT$2.42 billion (US$75 million) in
2008, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Liu said China is the world's major exporter of raw materials of Chinese herbal
medicines and prepared herbal medicines as its production chain in this industry
is well rounded, with a huge number of suppliers and processors.</P>
      <P>The quality of these medicines, however, was unstable and hard to control, said
Liu.</P>
      <P>She noted that 30 percent of the prepared herbal medicines sold around China
last year were found to be below standards by Chinese health authorities.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the wide gap between the import and export figures from Chinese
and Taiwanese customs authorities, Liu said it is normal that the official
figures from across the strait varied considerably since the two sides do not
maintain any system of exchanging their customs data or any mechanism to verify
the veracity of trade figures reported by the private importers and exporters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's exports of Chinese herbal medicine materials stood at NT$635
million for the same year, according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan's locally-produced Chinese medicinal preparations made
up about 10 percent of the country's total pharmaceutical output annually,  and
were worth between NT$5-6 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  competitive  edge  over  China  is that  it has well-developed
production technology, solid research and development foundation and good brand
name images, she added.</P>

      <P>As the high cost of buying a home topped Taiwanese people's list of complaints
in a recent survey, Premier Wu Den-yih said on Monday that the government will
try to find land along the mass rapid transit (MRT) lines for the construction
of affordable residential buildings.</P>
      <P>The government will "take advantage of zone expropriation or land consolidation
to acquire the land that is spacious, convenient and suitable for construction,
" Wu said in response to media inquiries on the results of an online survey held
by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) to
learn about issues that most upset the public.  Survey results, publicized
earlier Monday,  show excessively high property prices in the metropolis of
Taipei tops 10 public complaints.</P>
      <P>Next on the list were telephone  scams and online fraud, difficulty finding a
job and high unemployment, high consumers prices, as well as the problem of drug
proliferation.</P>
      <P>Other complaints were over the enforcement of traffic regulations in an
excessively strict manner, unsafe baby care services, dirty public toilets,
loose measures on food safety screening, and the illegal occupancy of public
road space.</P>
      <P>Asked about the problem of high housing prices, Wu said he understands that a
high population density results in high property prices in the metropolis of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>OK LIKE THIS? Analysts and others however said speculation and the lack of
affordable housing are also factors. The consequences are that many people are
unable to buy their own homes and are forced to live with their parents or in-
laws.</P>
      <P>The government has thought of using the MRT lines to resolve the problem, Wu
said, explaining that land close to the MTR station at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport,  which is now under construction, as well as some other
MRT stations, can be used to build houses that are reasonable in price for
Taipei commuters.</P>
      <P>Besides, the government will also provide low-interest loans for people to
easily buy or rent a home, he added.</P>
      <P>As for the top-10 public complaints, the premier said he will take them as an
important reference for the administration.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's reliance on China as biggest export market continued to rise, as 32.2
percent of its exports in September,  totaling US$6.14 billion in value, went to
China, according to statistics released by the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) on
Monday.</P>
      <P>However, the BOFT statistics indicate that the economic downturn may have
affected two-way trade.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, two-way trade between Taiwan and China
amounted to US$60.35 billion, down 29.7 percent from that of the same period
last year, statistics showed.</P>
      <P>In January-September, cross-strait trade accounted for 22. 7 percent of Taiwan's
foreign trade in value.</P>
      <P>During the nine-month period, Taiwan's exports to China amounted to US$43.45
billion, down 28.6 percent from that of the same period of last year; imports
from China were valued at US$16.9 billion, down 32.4 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>In September, Taiwan's exports to China registered a record high for the past 12
months at US$6.14 billion, a slight decrease of 0.3 percent from that of the
same month last year.</P>
      <P>Imports from China in September were valued at US$2.49 billion, also a single
month high for the past 12 months, though a 7.5 percent drop from that of the
same month a year ago.</P>
      <P>Statistics on export orders released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show
that after months of sluggishness, export orders from China were picking up
since July and has been gaining momentum, with month-on-month growth at 2.2
percent in July, 7.3 percent in August, 9.47 percent in September and 19.6
percent in October.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics compiled by China's customs authorities indicate that
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were the three major sources of supplies, with its

      <P>With only five full days to go before Taiwan's county magistrate and city
mayoral elections, Taiwan's two main political parties continued to canvass
voters on Monday.</P>
      <P>President and ruling Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou again traveled to Hsinchu
County to stump for Chiu Ching-chun, the party's standard-bearer in the
magistrate election.</P>
      <P>Ma has traveled extensively around the northern county in recent weeks as Chiu
is fighting a tight race against two rivals - a KMT maverick and a challenger
from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chiu faces another disadvantage as incumbent Hsinchu Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin
has thrown his weight behind Hsinchu County Council Speaker Chang Pi-chin, who
was expelled from the KMT after she registered for the magisterial election in
defiance of the party's nomination decision.</P>
      <P>Ma attended a campaign rally in the county's Guanxi township Monday evening to
woo voter support.</P>
      <P>As the DPP was also holding a campaign rally for its candidate Peng Shao-chin in
the vicinity, police and the president's security personnel heightened alert and
imposed strict security measures to prevent a recurrence of a clash between KMT
and DPP supporters that happened in the county last week.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the United Daily News apologized for publishing a commentary
which said the DPP did not field any candidate in Hsinchu County's election.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence DPP accused the newspaper of deliberately making the
mistake to mislead voters as the party's candidate stands a chance to win the
election given a split in the KMT ranks. The party threatened to file a lawsuit
against the paper for what it called the paper's violation of the Public
Officials Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen traveled to eastern Taiwan's Hualien
County Monday to publicly campaign for Chang Chih-ming, an independent candidate
running for the magistrate post.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Tsai has stumped for Chang, the county's incumbent
deputy magistrate who withdrew from the KMT to run as an independent after the
party nominated Tu Li-hua.</P>
      <P>As Hualien has been a KMT stronghold, the DPP did not field any candidate for
the county's magistrate election this time around. Chang faces two strong
opponents -- Tu and KMT Legislator Fu Kun-chi, who is also running as an
independent. It remains to be seen whether the DPP's support can help Chang
realize his electoral bid.</P>
      <P>The polls are for the election of mayors and magistrates, city and county
councilors, and city and township chiefs.</P>
      <P>As six cities and counties -- Taipei County, Taitung City and County, Tainan
City and County, Kaohsiung County -- will be upgraded or merged into
municipalities, the elections will be held in only 17 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and the DPP have been going all out to gain the upper hand in the
elections as the polls will be the first crucial test of Ma's leadership since
he assumed office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The elections are also seen as a litmus test for the outcome of next year's
municipal elections and even the 2012 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan gets most of its herbal medicine from China: report</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A big chunk of Taiwan's imports of Chinese herbal and traditional medicines came
from mainland China, the non-profit Development Center for Biotechnology
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported US$29.66 million worth of Chinese herbal medicine from the
Chinese mainland in 2008, making the island China's fifth largest export market
for this type of exports, Liu Tzu-hui, a researcher with the center, quoted a
Chinese government customs report as indicating.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's customs statistics, however, the percentage of Taiwan's
Chinese medicine imports from mainland China was even greater - at about 60-70
percent of its total imports of this type of product.</P>
      <P>Ginseng preparations made the bulk of these imports, constituting about 28.5
percent of the total, Liu said, citing Taiwanese official statistics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports of Chinese herbal medicine materials from around the world,
excluding prepared herbal medicines, totaled NT$2.42 billion (US$75 million) in
2008, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Liu said China is the world's major exporter of raw materials of Chinese herbal
medicines and prepared herbal medicines as its production chain in this industry
is well rounded, with a huge number of suppliers and processors.</P>
      <P>The quality of these medicines, however, was unstable and hard to control, said
Liu.</P>
      <P>She noted that 30 percent of the prepared herbal medicines sold around China
last year were found to be below standards by Chinese health authorities.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the wide gap between the import and export figures from Chinese
and Taiwanese customs authorities, Liu said it is normal that the official
figures from across the strait varied considerably since the two sides do not
maintain any system of exchanging their customs data or any mechanism to verify
the veracity of trade figures reported by the private importers and exporters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's exports of Chinese herbal medicine materials stood at NT$635
million for the same year, according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan's locally-produced Chinese medicinal preparations made
up about 10 percent of the country's total pharmaceutical output annually,  and
were worth between NT$5-6 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  competitive  edge  over  China  is that  it has well-developed
production technology, solid research and development foundation and good brand
name images, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government to find land for cheap residential units: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Nov.  30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the high cost of buying a home topped Taiwanese people's list of complaints
in a recent survey, Premier Wu Den-yih said on Monday that the government will
try to find land along the mass rapid transit (MRT) lines for the construction
of affordable residential buildings.</P>
      <P>The government will "take advantage of zone expropriation or land consolidation
to acquire the land that is spacious, convenient and suitable for construction,
" Wu said in response to media inquiries on the results of an online survey held
by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) to
learn about issues that most upset the public.  Survey results, publicized
earlier Monday,  show excessively high property prices in the metropolis of
Taipei tops 10 public complaints.</P>
      <P>Next on the list were telephone  scams and online fraud, difficulty finding a
job and high unemployment, high consumers prices, as well as the problem of drug
proliferation.</P>
      <P>Other complaints were over the enforcement of traffic regulations in an
excessively strict manner, unsafe baby care services, dirty public toilets,
loose measures on food safety screening, and the illegal occupancy of public
road space.</P>
      <P>Asked about the problem of high housing prices, Wu said he understands that a
high population density results in high property prices in the metropolis of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Analysts and others however said speculation and the lack of affordable housing
are also factors. The consequences are that many people are unable to buy their
own homes and are forced to live with their parents or in-laws.</P>
      <P>The government has thought of using the MRT lines to resolve the problem, Wu
said, explaining that land close to the MTR station at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport,  which is now under construction, as well as some other
MRT stations, can be used to build houses that are reasonable in price for
Taipei commuters.</P>
      <P>Besides, the government will also provide low-interest loans for people to
easily buy or rent a home, he added.</P>
      <P>As for the top-10 public complaints, the premier said he will take them as an
important reference for the administration.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's reliance on China as biggest export market continued to rise, as 32.2
percent of its exports in September,  totaling US$6.14 billion in value, went to
China, according to statistics released by the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) on
Monday.</P>
      <P>However, the BOFT statistics indicate that the economic downturn may have
affected two-way trade.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, two-way trade between Taiwan and China
amounted to US$60.35 billion, down 29.7 percent from that of the same period
last year, statistics showed.</P>
      <P>In January-September, cross-strait trade accounted for 22. 7 percent of Taiwan's
foreign trade in value.</P>
      <P>During the nine-month period, Taiwan's exports to China amounted to US$43.45
billion, down 28.6 percent from that of the same period of last year; imports
from China were valued at US$16.9 billion, down 32.4 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>In September, Taiwan's exports to China registered a record high for the past 12
months at US$6.14 billion, a slight decrease of 0.3 percent from that of the
same month last year.</P>
      <P>Imports from China in September were valued at US$2.49 billion, also a single
month high for the past 12 months, though a 7.5 percent drop from that of the
same month a year ago.</P>
      <P>Statistics on export orders released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show
that after months of sluggishness, export orders from China were picking up
since July and has been gaining momentum, with month-on-month growth at 2.2
percent in July, 7.3 percent in August, 9.47 percent in September and 19.6
percent in October.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics compiled by China's customs authorities indicate that
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were the three major sources of supplies, with its
January-September imports from Japan amounting to US$92.35 billion, from South
Korea totaling US$72.55 billion, and from Taiwan valued at US$59.71 billion.</P>
      <P>China's customs statistics show that Taiwan remained China's No. 1 supplier of
electrical appliances and parts and second largest supplier of optical products
and plastics products, although Taiwan's exports to that market dropped by 29.2
percent in value in January- September this year.</P>

      <P>The government is planning to make Dec. 12 the national day of immunization
against influenza A(H1N1), with the nation's entire population expected to get a
shot against the highly infectious disease from that day, the health minister
said Monday.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that all people in the country, regardless of ages or priority
order, can go to the designated hospitals, clinics or injection stops for a
vaccination shot from Dec. 12, Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang
said.</P>
      <P>"The greater the number of people who get immunized, the better the efficiency
of collective immunization will be, " Yaung said during a hearing at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>About 8.75 percent of Taiwan's population, or some 2 million people, have been
vaccinated based on an order of priority prescribed by the government against
influenza A(H1N1), also known as swine flu, as of Monday, according to
statistics from the Central Epidemics Command Center.</P>
      <P>The national immunization program began on Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>Of those immunized, one elementary school student died seven days later, but the
death was not caused by the H1NI virus or the H1N1 vaccination shot, said Steve
Kuo, director-general of the Centers for Disease Control.</P>
      <P>Another  junior high school student,  who became partially paralyzed after
receiving the H1N1 vaccination, is getting better now, Kuo added.</P>

      <P>It was the second year that the association has opened its competition to
foreign entries.</P>
      <P>The competition, which took place in Fukuoka Nov. 28-29, saw a record high of
2,888 entries this year. Most came from Japan, but other entries were from from
Taiwan, China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Two other Taiwanese contestants also won special prizes at the competition. Li
Huan-ming from Fuli Township of Hualien won with his rice dubbed "Kaohsiung No.
139, " and Kuo Tzu-feng from Hsinkang Township of Chiayi County was honored for
his rice dubbed "Taikeng No. 9."</P>
      <P>Kuo also won a special prize in the prestigious Japanese rice competition in
2008 with his "Taikeng No. 9, " which he described as "fluffy but chewable."</P>
      <P>According to Peng Ching-hsing, who returned to Taiwan Monday with his father
after capturing his award, the prize winners were selected after a three round
competition.</P>
      <P>The Japanese association used both men and precision equipment in the second
round to sort out the better selections among the entries, according to Peng.</P>
      <P>A total of 50 judges, who were comprised of professional rice tasters, average
rice consumers and supermarket purchasing executives specializing in buying
rice, tasted cooked entries in the final round to help select the winners, Peng
said.</P>
      <P>Despite being thrilled by his repeat victory in Japan, Peng lamented that rice
growing in Taiwan is a money-losing proposition because the government has kept
rice prices too low.</P>
      <P>He said the average retail price of US$1 per kilo of rice in Taiwan was below
cost,  even after government  subsidies  are considered, making it impossible to
treat rice farming as a business.</P>
      <P>"We rice farmers can only make rice farming a hobby or exercise for our health,"
Peng complained.</P>
      <P>The low sale price for the labor-intensive crop has also scared the younger
generation away from rice paddies, Peng added.</P>
      <P>He expressed his hope that the government will help old farmers market their
rice online to reduce their reliance on middlemen and improve their sales in
global markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Movie sponsored by Taipei City causes controversy</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taipei City's sponsorship of a movie set in the city's Wanhua district has
sparked controversy, with local residents criticizing it for tarnishing the
area's image.</P>
      <P>The city government offered an NT$4 million grant to the filmmaker to make the
movie, hoping that it would enhance the city's profile.</P>
      <P>Critics argue, however, that the film titled "Monga, " the Hoklo name for the
district, features prostitutes and gangsters and harks back to the district's
dark past, one local residents are eager to forget.</P>
      <P>Monday's United Daily News quoted Cingshan borough chief Lee Chao-cheng as
saying that the film is fraught with sex and violence and does not fairly depict
Wanhua.</P>
      <P>"It blemishes the whole district, " Lee told the daily. "I have been living here
for 54 years. Gangsters' turf wars and prostitution are a small part of the
district's history, and we have tried hard to get rid of them, but the film will
undo our efforts."</P>
      <P>He is not the only critic. One individual who serves as a guide in Wanhua
complained in his blog that Monga is known as the place where Taipei City began,
but the film, which is still being shot, does not make any mention of that.</P>
      <P>He criticized the Taipei City government for not only offering financial support
to the project but also helping with the film's shooting by cordoning off a
block in the district.</P>
      <P>City officials defended the decision, and Mayor Hau Lung-bin was cited by the
United Daily News as urging critics to be patient.</P>
      <P>"They should voice their opinions after they have watched it, " Hau said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  vice mayor and Department  of Cultural Affairs commissioner Lee
Yung-ping said the city government respects the filmmaker's artistic freedom and
also asked the public to reserve judgment on whether the movie presents Wanhua
in a positive or negative light until the film is completed next January.</P>
      <P>Film scholar  Huang Chien-yeh  lauded the city's hands-off position.</P>
      <P>He told the United Daily News that the government is in no position to censor
films in advance and argued that a positive film is not necessary to promoting
the city's image.</P>
      <P>The movie's director Doze Niu was cited by the paper as saying that he could not
anticipate what impression his film would leave with the audience, but he
believes he is "creating the film with the purpose of bettering the world."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to fight for reasonable treatment at Copenhagen meeting</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will continue to strive for "reasonable  treatment"  at the upcoming
Climate Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, after the meeting's organizers
ignored Taiwan's national sovereignty and treated the country as part of China,
an environmental official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Although a similar situation has existed for years, Taiwan will continue to try
(for a breakthrough), " said Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese organizations taking part in the conference, slated for Dec. 7-18,
have been classified as being part of China on the official United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Web site, prompting objections
from Taipei.</P>
      <P>Though it is not a member of the United Nations, Taiwan hopes to be treated as
fairly as it was in May at the 62nd World Health Assembly, in which it took part
as an observer under the name of "Chinese Taipei," Shen said.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time in 38 years that the Republic of China (ROC) had
participated in a meeting hosted by a U.N. agency.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ying-shih, chairman of the Taipei-based Environment Quality Protection
Foundation, said the foundation applied to participate in the Copenhagen meeting
under the national name of "Taiwan, " but the designation was changed to "China"
on the UNFCCC Web site.</P>
      <P>"It is an international political reality, " he acknowledged, but argued that
despite such a reality, Taiwan could not refrain from attending because climate
change issues extend beyond the boundaries of sovereign countries.</P>
      <P>Aside from the foundation, the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy and the
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) will also represent Taiwan at
the Copenhagen meeting. Notably, the ITRI delegation will be headed by the
deputy minister of the EPA, Chiu Wen-yen.</P>
      <P>Chiu was cited by a local newspaper as saying that the only way for Taiwan to
gain the attention of the international community is to strengthen its efforts
on global climate change research.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-shou, president of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union,
disagreed however with the government's "passive protest" against the UNFCCC's
unreasonable treatment, saying his group decided not to apply to take part in
the Copenhagen meeting after learning it had to file the application under the
name "China."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has bought energy supplies and even food from abroad, Wang said as he
wondered "why Taiwan cannot keep its sovereignty."</P>
      <P>Attending meetings under names that belittle its sovereignty because of Chinese
suppression has often posed a dilemma to Taiwan's government and nongovernmental
organizations, but Liu Chung-ming, the director of the Global Change Research
Center at National Taiwan University, endorsed Taiwan's attendance at the
meeting.</P>
      <P>In an article published in the United Daily News' opinion page Tuesday, Liu
argued that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member and it can only send NGOs to
Copenhagen under the name of China, "for the sake of general national
development, Taiwan should still be there even if it must endure all disgrace
and insults."</P>
      <P>He suggested that either the premier or vice premier visit Copenhagen for the
conference that will see the participation of 60 percent of national leaders
from around the world.</P>
      <P>By attending the meeting, the premier or his deputy could gain knowledge of the
international situation and the latest on the climate change issue. Talks with
high-ranking officials of countries that do not maintain diplomatic relations
with Taiwan could also be arranged and improve the country's diplomatic
position, the professor contended.</P>
      <P>Even if a high-ranking official were blocked from entering the venue, it would
still draw international attention to Taiwan's plight, Liu said. He suggested
that in such a case, the government detail its efforts to have the premier
attend the meeting to demonstrate the importance it attaches to the climate
change issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan opened a representative office in Sapporo Tuesday, its first new office
in Japan in 30 years, which Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng described as a
"breakthrough in Japan-Taiwan relations."</P>
      <P>Wang along with many other dignitaries from Japan and Taiwan attended the
ceremony marking the opening of the office, the first since an office was opened
in Yokohama in 1979.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker not only lauded the move as a promising development in
bilateral ties, he said it would be "a shot in the arm for tourism exchanges."</P>
      <P>Noting that relatively few Hokkaido residents visit Taiwan, Wang said he hoped
the opening of the Sapporo office would help lure more people from the northern
Japanese island to vacation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The hospitable Taiwanese people welcome Japanese visitors with open arms," Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Hokkaido Governor Harumi Takahashi said Taiwan is very
important to Hokkaido in terms of tourism.</P>
      <P>"The opening of the Taiwan office in Sapporo will help facilitate Taiwanese
tourists' visits here and further bolster bilateral exchanges," she said.</P>
      <P>She also disclosed that authorities from Hokkaido's Kushiro subprefecture had
decided to give a pair of Japanese-bred red-crowned cranes to the Taipei Zoo as
a token of friendship.</P>
      <P>Shinichi Sakamoto, head of a Hokkaido organization aimed at promoting local
tourism, said his organization will cooperate more closely with Taiwan's office
in Sapporo to get more people in Hokkaido interested in sightseeing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sakamoto believed that most Hokkaido residents who had visited Taiwan would be
happy to repeat their trips there, attracted by Taiwan's delicious food, good
tea and convenient high-speed railway system.</P>
      <P>Also on hand to offer their congratulations on the opening of the new office
were Taiwan's top representative in Japan, John Feng, and Atsushi Hatanaka,
chairman of the Japan Interchange Association, the de facto Japanese embassy
authorized to handle civilian exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>The Sapporo office is the sixth Taiwanese  liaison office established in Japan,
after offices in Tokyo, Osaka, Okinawa, Fukuoka and Yokohama.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has filed a protest
with the organizer of the 2009 Climate Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, after
it was listed as being in "China, " ITRI Executive Vice President Chu Hsin-sen
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>While the institute has sent a letter of protest, however, it "cannot reject"
the opportunity to speak on the international stage because of the address
change, Chu told reporters.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is unable to join the conference of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as a national delegation because it is not
a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>As a result, the ITRI will represent Taiwan's official voice at the Copenhagen
meeting slated for Dec. 7-18, with Chu to head the delegation and Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) Deputy Minister Chiu Wen-yen acting officially
as an adviser.</P>
      <P>On the official listing of the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) admitted to
the conference on its official Web site, however, "China" is shown as the
institute's country.</P>
      <P>Chu stressed that the institute applied to participate "in the name of a
nongovernmental organization of Taiwan,  not as an industrial research institute
of China."</P>
      <P>Asked why the Hsinchu County-based institute's country was listed as China, Chu
said it was a mistake by the UNFCCC Secretariat and that the ITRI had responded
by filing a protest.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the EPA are now working on how Taiwan can
participate in the global climate change conference with dignity, Chu added.</P>
      <P>Three other NGOs from Taiwan -- the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation,
the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy and the Supreme Master Chinq Hai
International Association -- have also been listed on the roster of admitted
NGOs as being from China.</P>
      <P>At the  meeting,  the ITRI  expects  to present  Taiwan's self-developed
technologies in energy recycling and Taiwan's efforts in seeking to slow down
global climate change. ITRI scholars and experts will also deliver speeches in
conference seminars, Chu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutors probe rampant allegations of vote-buying</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan prosecutors on Tuesday indicted three candidates in the local elections
that are four days away, as investigators continue to probe a raft of vote-
buying allegations.</P>
      <P>The three candidates -- Wei Hsueh-ching, , Yen Chung-chieh and Tsai Sheng-hung
who are all running for county councilor office -- were indicted  by Taoyuan
County prosecutors  on charges  of distributing presents or cash of up to
NT$3,000 per person in return for promises of voter support.</P>
      <P>In the rural township of Hsikou in Chiayi County, a man surnamed Huang was
released by prosecutors on bail of NT$20,000 after he confessed to paying two
people NT$2,000 each to vote for specific magistrate, township chief and
councilor candidates.</P>
      <P>However, Huang claimed that he had taken the initiative to offer the bribe and
had not acted on behalf of any candidate.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung County, prosecutors sought to detain Kaoshu township chief Wang Shu-
wei in connection with vote-buying activities.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said that Wang, who is running for county councilor, was using
public money to fund the activities of a specific private group in an effort to
secure the support of its members.</P>
      <P>However, the court rejected the prosecutors request to detain Wang, saying that
the evidence against him was insufficient.</P>
      <P>In Caotun, Nantou County, a female candidate for councilor, surnamed Hsu, was
detained by prosecutors after a woman, whose name was withheld, was caught
buying votes for the candidate.</P>
      <P>Two of three candidates running for township chief in Guangfu, Hualien County
had earlier been detained by prosecutors in connection with vote-buying.</P>
      <P>However, local election officials said the Guangfu polls will go ahead as
scheduled on Dec. 5 with all of the candidates on the ballots.</P>
      <P>The candidate with the most votes will be declared the winner, even if he is in
custody, and will not be stripped of his seat unless he is found guilty in
court, according to the law.</P>
      <P>Vote-buying has become a major issue in the elections, with the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party claiming that none of its candidates have so far
been detained for election-fixing and the ruling Kuomintang rejecting the claim
as "baloney."</P>
      <P>According to a report Tuesday in the China Times newspaper, candidates have been
offering bribes ranging from NT$500 to NT$3,000 per person for voters to support
them. On the island of Dongyin in the outlying county of Lienchiang, the bribes
were reportedly as high as NT$30,000 per person.</P>
      <P>Some candidates for magistrate have been collaborating with county councilor and
township chief candidates to offer "package bribes" of NT$5,000 per person to
voters, the China Times report claimed.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-tsung, the chief prosecutor in Lienchiang County, said that his office
is looking into allegations that some candidates are offering NT$30,000 for a
vote.</P>
      <P>Lin said most residents of Lienchiang  County have strong political allegiances,
but foreign spouses and migrant workers from Taiwan proper are usually swing
voters and are likely to be targeted in vote-buying scams.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor said his office is probing nine allegations of vote-buying and 31
suspected cases of phantom voters who had taken up residence in Lienchiang four
months before the election date for the sole purpose of supporting specific
candidates.</P>
      <P>In another outlying island county, Kinmen, prosecutors have received 91
complaints of election-fixing, 11 of which they said appeared to be
substantiated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's top representative to Taiwan has submitted his resignation, citing
personal reasons, the Asahi Shimbun reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The surprise move of Masaki Saito, chief of the Taipei office of the Japan
Interchange Association (JIA) -- Japan's de facto embassy in Taiwan -- was
widely speculated as a result of the implications caused by controversial
remarks he made in Taiwan in May, the Japanese daily said.</P>
      <P>Saito said on May 1 at an annual meeting of the Republic of China International
Relations Association held in National Chung Cheng University in Chiayi county
that "Taiwan's status was still unclear."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Asahi Shimbun report, Naohiro Tsutsumi, Saito's deputy and
director-general of the JIA Taipei Office, said the resignation will take effect
only after the JIA board of directors approves it.</P>
      <P>Tsutsumi, however, declined to comment on whether and how Saito's resignation
will affect Japan-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>According to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Saito has been sulkily quiet over the past several months and has
seldom interacted with Taiwanese officials in charge of relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>The official said Saito did not have a chance to accompany a group of visiting
Japanese dietmen during their recent meetings to see President Ma Ying-jeou
because the Japanese politicians asked not to have such arrangements made.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lee Hung-chun, who heads a legislative
subgroup on Japan-Taiwan friendship, said in Hokkaido, Japan Tuesday that Saito
has offered his apology over his remarks, but the Ma administration has adopted
a strong stance on the matter.</P>
      <P>Lee suggested that Taipei adopt a softer attitude when dealing with foreign
countries and their officials.</P>
      <P>"It's crucial that Taiwan makes more friends than turn friends into enemies," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on Saito's resignation, opposition Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Tsai Huang-liang claimed that Saito offered  to resign  because  of
pressure  from the Kuomintang administration.</P>
      <P>Tsai speculated that Saito's resignation -- announced Friday, on the same day
that Taiwan opens a liaison office in Sapporo, Hokkaido -- was intentionally
designed as a means to protest against Taiwan over the Saito incident.</P>

      <P>A visiting Chinese banker said Tuesday that preparations for a currency
clearance and settlement system between Taiwan and China are now 80 to 90
percent complete.</P>
      <P>"An agreement on the system will be concluded before the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is signed," said Hu Xiaolian, vice
governor of the People's Bank of China.</P>
      <P>The ECFA issue is expected to be broached during the fourth round of talks
between Taiwan and China later this month in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Hu, who arrived in Taipei Monday for a cross-Taiwan Strait financial seminar,
told reporters after the opening of the forum that preparations for the currency
system have been in progress for quite some time.</P>
      <P>Noting that currency clearance services would be provided by commercial banks of
both sides of the strait, Hu said the preparations include matters such as the
transport of currency, the opening of accounts in the participating banks, and
the compilation of statistics.</P>
      <P>The system would allow for the conversion of Taiwan and China currency in banks
on both sides, which will lower the cost of currency conversion and reduce the
circulation of counterfeit banknotes, thereby encouraging Chinese tourists to
spend more in Taiwan, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top negotiator with China, said at the
seminar that during the fifth round of cross-strait negotiations, Taiwan and
China will conclude an agreement to allow bank ventures in each other's market.</P>
      <P>He said that when he and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin meet in Taiching
later this month, they will put the issue on the agenda for the next round of

      <P>Taiwan has eased restrictions on visits by overseas Chinese people, making it
easier for Chinese nationals who live in foreign countries or in Hong Kong or
Macau to visit the island, National Immigration Agency (NIA) officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Starting  Tuesday,  Chinese people can come to Taiwan for sightseeing as long as
they have lived in a foreign country or in Hong Kong and Macau for at least one
year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Previous regulations required them to have lived overseas for at least four
years. Overseas Chinese must still have a job in the countries and areas where
they live, or be the spouse or lineal relative of such overseas Chinese, to
apply for a tourist permit to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan only began opening the doors for tourist visits by Chinese people who
live overseas, in Hong Kong or Macau, in 2002.</P>
      <P>Chinese people who meet the requirements can apply to visit Taiwan for tourism
by providing their employment certificates, proofs of family relationship,
identification cards, application forms, travel plans and itineraries.</P>
      <P>The applications can be filed with the agency either by travel agents or by the
applicants themselves, the official added.</P>
      <P>In light of the increased demand for urgent entry permits by Chinese people
wishing to come to Taiwan, the immigration agency has set up a mechanism to
streamline the processing of travel documents of Chinese tourists on a case-by-
case basis in order to increase efficiency, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under the revisions, travel agencies who put down a NT$1 million (US$31,250)
security deposit with the Travel Agent Association of ROC Taiwan for arranging
tours for overseas Chinese to visit Taiwan will not be charged NT$100,000 for
each inbound-Chinese tourist who goes missing because there have been no case of
overstaying or absconding reported since Taiwan opened its doors to overseas
Chinese tourists in 2002, according to the official.</P>
      <P>However, a fine will still be imposed for inbound Chinese tourists from Hong
Kong, Macau or China who overstay their visas or go missing, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>It has become common for Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan since the two sides
first launched direct flights in 2008. The number of visitors from China has
been on the rise, since direct flights and flight destinations were expanded in
July this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou gave a directive Tuesday for the establishment a Cabinet-
level task force, headed by Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, to help revive
professional baseball in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president also gave instructions for 2010 to be designated as</P>
      <P>the first year of baseball revival in Taiwan, according to Chao Shou-po,
chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL).</P>
      <P>Ma gave the directives during first-ever national conference on baseball, which
was held to discuss ways of reviving and upgrading the sport that has been
plagued by game-fixing scandals.</P>
      <P>During the conference, Chao said, the president stressed that it is impossible
to solve during a two-hour meeting problems that have accumulated over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>He told the attendees that it is important "to eliminate the sickness" and at
the same time "revitalize the liveliness" of the sport.</P>
      <P>Ma said the relevant government agencies should make greater efforts to
communicate and coordinate among themselves to help tackle the problems
pertaining to irregularities  in the professional baseball league.</P>
      <P>An overall review should be conducted and proposals such as tax-free incentives
for professional  baseball clubs and their sponsors should be studied, the
president said.</P>
      <P>Premier  Wu Den-yih said at the meeting  that it is the government's
responsibility to provide a "clean" environment for professional baseball to
flourish, and he suggested that there should be at least one baseball stadium in
every city and county around the country.</P>
      <P>The conference was convened after some 800 baseball fans took to the streets of
Taipei Sunday demanding that the government do something to rescue the sport in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"President Ma has heard the voices of the demonstrators and he exhorted the CPBL
teams to 'hang in there' and not to give up despite the recent spate of
problems," Chao said.</P>
      <P>Fans of professional baseball clubs that were disbanded because of game fixing
joined the rally on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office to
demand that the government act quickly to fix the problems that they said had
led to frequent cases of game fixing.</P>
      <P>Responding to the protesters' demands, the president invited scholars, officials
of various government agencies, representatives of the professional baseball
clubs and representatives of the demonstrators to attend the national baseball
conference.</P>
      <P>"The executives of all the CPBL clubs are encouraged by the government's move to
revive the sport and to make it a matter of national importance," Chao added.</P>
      <P>The clubs' executives suggested during the meeting that the government give more
teeth to the efforts to crack down on the crime rings that orchestrated the
game-fixing in the professional baseball league.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the global economy recovering, Taiwan's manpower demand by the end of
January next year is expected to increase by 48,000, compare to the end of
October this year, according to the results of a survey published Tuesday by the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>The results of the fourth manpower survey of the year, conducted Oct. 16VNov. 5
and with 3,025 valid samples returned, show that 21.3 percent of the companies
that responded said they will hire more personnel in January 2010, representing
an increase of about 65,200 workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, about 8 percent of the companies surveyed will reduce their manpower,
representing a reduction of about 17,300 workers. That would result in a net
increase of 48,000 workers.</P>
      <P>It will be the highest net increase of manpower for a single season since the
survey was launched in Q3 2007, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>Around 65 percent of the companies will keep their manpower unchanged in
January, the survey results show.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that the manpower demand was gradually warming up
and there seems to be a trend towards more job hirings, said Cheng Wen-yuan,
director of the council's statistics department.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing, retail and support service sectors will see the most
noticeable increase in manpower needs. The highest number of job increase --
some 19,500 -- will come in the manufacturing sector, according to the survey
results.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the electronics components, computer and optical products sectors
are expected to benefit most from the recovery in demand and the rising demand
will generate more hiring needs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Trade policy not priority for Obama administration: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Dec.1   (CNA)
12/01/09  19:11:51
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American  scholars  attending  a Taipei-Washington video conference Tuesday
suggested that the U.S. administration has prioritized global issues,  such as
nuclear proliferation and energy policy, and that trade policy is not at the top
of its agenda.</P>
      <P>The Office of Trade Negotiations in Taipei invited four American scholars to
assess the impact of U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to Asia in mid-November
and to hold dialogue with Vice Economics Minister Francis Kuo-sin Liang and
other trade officials.</P>
      <P>The moderator, Sherman Elliott Katz,who is a senior advisor at the Washington-
based think tank Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, raised the
issues of U.S. trade policy, U.S. reaction towards probable China domination of
the Asian market, leverage in the situation where the U.S. is a debtor and China
is the creditor, China's currency, and the reduction of tensions across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Commenting on President Obama's statement in Tokyo on Nov. 14 that the U.S.
welcomes China's greater role in the world, Larry A. Niksch, a specialist in
Asian Affairs with the Congressional Research Service, said that he does not
think China's growth and expansion of influence would jeopardize Washington-
Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>The U.S. would not react to trade problems with protective measures, he added.</P>
      <P>Referring to the question of whether China's position as the largest foreign
creditor of the U.S. had influenced Obama's approach during his visit to China,
the expert in U.S. security policy said that he did not see Obama pushing China
on currency issues or China's subsidies to national industries.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  the situation in which China is the largest foreigner holder of
U.S. debt "would give China the ability to hurt the U.S. financially and
economically in the longer term," he suggested.</P>
      <P>Josh Kurlantzik,  Council on Foreign Relations  fellow for Southeast Asia, said
that Obama's decision not to meet the Dalai Lama had "overstated the weakness of
his hand."</P>
      <P>However, Grant Aldonas, under secretary of international trade in George W. Bush
administration's Commerce Department (2001-2005), held a different view of the
leverage issue.</P>
      <P>He suggested that while President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and
Director of the White House's National Economic Council Lawrence Summers might
think that as the largest foreign creditor of the U.S., China has leverage, "the
debtor has relatively the same leverage as the creditor."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the statement by some Taiwanese scholars that the Obama
administration has prioritized global issues and is less concerned about China's
relationship with Taiwan, Niksch said that "the Obama administration, like the
Bush administration, is pleased to see the opening of cross-strait policies by
President Ma Ying-jeou and the reduction of tensions."</P>
      <P>Niksch suggested that the improvement in cross-strait relations has overshadowed
cross-strait defense issues, but added that he believes the U.S. will continue
to make selective military sales to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>As to the possibility of a political agreement on unification, Niksch said that
"the U.S. policy is changing to accept that -- as long as it is not a decision
made under coercion from China."</P>
      <P>He also emphasized the U.S. position that any major political move in Taiwan
should be decided by the Taiwanese people, maybe through referendum.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:
Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Prize-winning film sheds light on bureaucratic detachment</P>
      <P>Taiwan's civil servants should be required to see Leon Dai's prize-winning film
"No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti" and report on what they saw as the movie portrays how
bureaucratic detachment could force ordinary citizens to the brink of death.</P>
      <P>The indie film swept the Golden Horse Film Festival last weekend by bagging the
coveted best picture and best director awards.</P>
      <P>It was based on the true story of a ship repair worker's desperate fight for his
daughter's right to education. The girl was born out of wedlock and her birth
was not legally registered with any local household registration agency. As a
result, she could not enter any elementary school.</P>
      <P>The protagonist approached government agencies at various levels but none of
them would extend him a helping hand. He ultimately tried to commit suicide but
fortunately, the attempt was thwarted by police.</P>
      <P>The black and white film reflects a common mind-set of Taiwan's civil servants
who tend to be passive in dealing with their work and try to avoid mistakes
rather than seek innovation or reform and also highlights another practice
commonly seen in Taiwan's officialdom -- passing the buck, as the protagonist is
sent from one agency to another.</P>
      <P>The film further reminds us that we still have a long way to go to build Taiwan
into a mature democracy as the democratic ideals of "government of people, by
people and for people" has not yet taken root in our officials' minds. Economic
Daily News</P>
      <P>Will 'China myth' shatter like Dubai World?</P>
      <P>The financial crisis faced by government-owned conglomerate Dubai World in the
United Arab Emirates should serve as a reminder to China's leaders that
extravagant development projects can collapse overnight.</P>
      <P>Unlike Dubai -- a small desert emirate whose prosperity is a myth built largely
on loans raised by its government -- China has what it takes to be an economic
power -- a huge population and plentiful arable land.</P>
      <P>Moreover, China has little foreign debt and has accumulated a large stash of
foreign exchange reserves after three decades of robust export-driven economic
development.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, these advantages could become disadvantages if the wrong
strategies are pursued. For instance, the huge population has been used as a
source of abundant cheap labor to support China's industrial development, but
its population is aging under its strict "one child" policy. Over the long run,
a large graying population could be a heavy burden for China.</P>
      <P>Rampant corruption and growing arrogance among China's policy makers as seen
through its extravagance in hosting the Olympics and unbridled large-scale
construction projects may also lead to a bleak economic future. China Times:
Opinion poll alone cannot make good governance</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi has betrayed a strong personal style as seen in his proposals
of "promoting grassroots economy" and "using an online survey to explore public
grievances."</P>
      <P>Theses strategies are of some significance from the perspective of reaching out
to people, but if they become the Cabinet's future policy guidelines, they may
fail to touch on the crux of problems.</P>
      <P>For one thing, there are age and rural-urban gaps in the use of the Internet in
Taiwan. Only 4,000 Internet users responded to the Cabinet's "public grievances"
survey. The limited number cannot exactly reflect public reaction to public
policies.</P>
      <P>While high housing price ranks first in the online "public grievances" survey,
it is more of a problem seen in northern Taiwan metropolises.</P>
      <P>With fewer rural residents using the Internet, problems commonly seen in
Taiwan's countryside were not reflected in the survey and problems faced by
foreign spouses were also not mentioned even though they give birth to one out
of every eight babies born in Taiwan nowadays.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the government should be well aware of the causes of public
grievances before conducting any opinion polls. For instance, telephone and
Internet fraud ranks second in the grievance survey. The government should have
known the seriousness of this problem through criminal statistics instead of
survey results.</P>
      <P>Food safety problems ranked ninth in the survey, but it is a problem that the
government should have long taken effective measures to tackle.</P>
      <P>As a government leader, the premier should have foresight and capabilities to
discern problems and ingenuity to address them. Commercial Times: Next Chapter
of Dubainomics</P>
      <P>Concerns over Dubai's debt situation have abated with the rebound of Asian stock
markets. We believe the Dubai financial crisis is unlikely to develop into a
global market disaster because the emirate's rich neighbors can well afford to
bail it out.</P>
      <P>However, the emirate's obituary was written in the aftermath of the financial
crisis as yet another example of hubris. An emirate that cannot repay its
sovereign debts on time simply has no credibility to become a financial center.</P>
      <P>The Dubai development model depended in part on a well of capital secured by oil
and buoyed by the confidence of the emerging market. That confidence led to the
creation of man-made islands and ski slopes in the desert, and some of the
world's tallest buildings. It also led to aggressive foreign investments in a
portfolio that included luxury stores and frivolities.</P>
      <P>The bubble of the portfolio, however, burst in the global financial crisis that
began last year.</P>
      <P>If Dubai wants to rise again, it must work out a new strategy different from its
vision of Arab entrepreneurisalism, easy credit and anything-is-possible
attitude that epitomized the "if you build it they will come" philosophy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan once tried to learn from Dubai's development strategy, but we think it is
more important to learn from the "next chapter of the Dubainomics." United Daily
News Bursting of the Dubai Bubble</P>
      <P>A year or two ago, Dubainomics was a hot topic among fashionable celebrities.
Dubai's Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum was reputed to be a model leader in
the Arab world, while the seven-star Burj-al-Arab Hotel and man-made Palm Island
became new meccas for travelers from around the world.</P>
      <P>However, the Dubai myth, built largely on loans raised by its government, has
exploded with the debt default of its investment arm, Dubai World.</P>
      <P>Dubai's boom-to-bust story reminds us of two lessons. First, national
development should not rely overly on unrealistic dreams. The tiny gulf emirate
in the desert was pursuing goals beyond its reach.</P>
      <P>Second, the global money game is unpredictable. In the past few years, few so-
called investment gurus and analysts bothered to issue any warnings or
precautions on potential risks, even as they passionately recommended Dubai
strategies.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan, the crisis presented a different lesson. Taiwan has the right
conditions to realistically become a regional business  hub,  as it has
pragmatic  and smart entrepreneurs, hard-working people, cultural heritage and a
strategic location. However, it has not achieved that dream because its two
major political camps have been bogged down in a war of attrition as they are
being misled by politicians. Liberty Times Taiwan's democracy at risk</P>
      <P>Taiwanese voters will go to the polls Dec. 5 to elect city mayors and county
magistrates. Although only 17 top local government posts are at stake, the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has been campaigning hard in an effort to get its people
in.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been on several barnstorming tours around the island
to stump for KMT candidates in his capacity as KMT chairman. As the zeal he has
shown in campaigning has gone out of proportion to the positions being sought,
he has ulterior motives.</P>
      <P>Ma hopes his party can score a resounding success in the elections so that he
can use it as a public endorsement of his China-leaning policies.</P>
      <P>A new round of high-level talks across the Taiwan Strait will come hard on the
heels of the elections and the two sides are also scheduled to begin talks on an
economic cooperation framework agreement  (ECFA)  next  January.  We are worried
that  more market-opening deals could be struck in those two meetings.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we urge voters in the coming elections to cast their ballots wisely
to protect Taiwan's young democracy from disappearing overnight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen-Xiamen bridge inappropriate for now: Taiwan's premier</HEADLINE>

      <P>Building a bridge connecting Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Island and the Xiamen port
in China's Fujian Province is not appropriate for now as it is a politically-
sensitive matter, Premier Wu Den-yih was quoted as saying Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsing-chien, chief editor of the Journalist weekly, quoted Wu Den-yih as
making the statement after attending a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
Competitiveness Forum on Kinmen's development as a "free trade city." The
seminar was held in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsing-chien accompanied Wu Den-yih to Kinmen Island on Nov. 26 and conducted
an interview on the same issue with the premier that day.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Hsing-chien, the premier said during last Thursday's interview
that the planned Kinmen-Xiamen Bridge will not be built at present so as to
avoid political implications.</P>
      <P>As the bridge would connect Taiwan's territory with China's soil for the first
time, such a political association should be fended off at present, the premier
was quoted as explaining.</P>
      <P>However, the premier stated in the interview that a projected 4-km bridge
linking the Big Kinmen Island with the Little Kinmen Island will be constructed
by the end of 2010, given that it is a major plank of President Ma Ying-jeou's
presidential  campaign platform.</P>
      <P>Chang Ya-chung, a political science professor of National Taiwan University,
said the government's attempts to skip the proposed Kinmen-Xiamen Bridge
highlighted its "lack of vision."</P>
      <P>Judging from Kinmen's geographic proximity with Xiamen and a close economic
integration between the two sides, Chang said the building of the bridge would
be a boon for people on both Kinmen and Xiamen. He predicted it will be an
unavoidable development.</P>
      <P>Tung Chih-sen, a veteran journalist from Kinmen who has worked a long time for
several major newspapers and a local cable station, urged the central government
to shrug off unnecessary misgivings, because political motivations and funds
should not be factors blocking the construction of the Kinmen-Xiamen Bridge, he
said.</P>
      <P>Amid improved cross-Taiwan Strait ties and due to its proximity to Xiamen,
Kinmen has long hoped to play a leading role in boosting Taiwan-China exchanges
on the tourism, financial and educational fronts.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng has said repeatedly that the county is
willing to act as a guinea pig for the central government's China policy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's deputy economics minister said Monday here that the government will
properly handle issues related to the opening of Taiwan's flat panel industry to
invest in China.</P>
      <P>Huang Jung-chiou made the remarks on the sidelines of the opening of the 2009
Taiwan-US Green Energy &amp; Technology Joint Conference in response to a call
for the opening.</P>
      <P>But Huang did not comment on whether the Ministry of Economic Affairs will reach
an agreement for the opening in 2010 at an inter-ministerial meeting slated for
late-December on review of the timing and scope for opening Taiwan's panel
industry to invest in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's contract manufacturers have very strong production capacity for small-
and-medium size flat panel products and the products have gained a competitive
edge in the global market, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, manufacturers of large size panels have set their sight on the flat
panel television market, with the United States and Japan the two largest
markets in the world. Demand for the products in China has been growing rapidly
recently, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that according to his observation, China is not willing to see the
country overly rely on other countries for panel production, particularly Taiwan
and South Korea. It therefore hopes Taiwan's panel manufacturers will invest in
China.</P>
      <P>"We'll keep a close eye on South Korea's move in China and properly address
issues related to collaboration between Taiwan and China in panel production,"
he indicated.</P>
      <P>Lou Qinjian, vice-minister of China's Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, urged Taiwan to open its panel industry to invest in China during a
meeting in Taipei a few days ago and said that both sides have reached a
consensus on the matter.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou lauded Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a model of
democracy in the Caribbean region as it held a constitutional referendum Nov.
25, the first of its kind to be held by a member of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS).</P>
      <P>During a meeting in Taipei with Hendrick Alexander, speaker of Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines' House of Assembly, Ma noted that the Republic of China and the
Caribbean country have enjoyed diplomatic ties for 28 years and that Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines has helped the ROC' participation in OECS activities,
as well as having promoted Taiwan's international visibility and deepened
Taiwan's friendship with other Caribbean countries.</P>
      <P>Although the ROC Constitution was enacted in 1946 and implemented the next year,
democracy has only developed in the country for the last 20 years or so, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has held four direct presidential elections and has undergone two changes
in ruling parties since 1996 after martial law was ended in 1987, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>The democracy established in Taiwan has won world recognition, he went on,
pointing out that former U.S. President George W. Bush has praised Taiwan as a
beacon of democracy for Asia and the world.</P>
      <P>So far, 24 students from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have studied in

      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) paralyzed a
legislative meeting Tuesday over the controversy concerning the Executive Yuan's
decision to relax restrictions on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>The session, aimed at reviewing amendments to the Food Sanity and Management
Law, was blocked by DPP lawmakers who occupied the podium to prevent the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative caucus from calling a vote to pass relevant law
revisions and raised large posters declaring their demands.</P>
      <P>The meeting was called off by Legislative Vice Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan after
around 10 minutes.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators and their DPP counterparts have been divided over the amendments
to the Food Sanity and Management Law, after Taiwan and the United States inked
a protocol in late October in Washington, D.C. to allow the entry of U.S. bone-
in beef,  ground beef, intestines, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle
younger than 30 months that have not been contaminated with "specific risk
materials (SRMs)" related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>SRMs are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes, trigeminal ganglia,
spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from cattle 30 months
and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small intestine from cattle of
all ages.</P>
      <P>In line with the terms of the protocol, KMT legislators hope to impose strict
administrative inspections to examine the controversial items of imported U.S.
beef products from the point of origin in the United States through to the
downstream retail markets in Taiwan, as well as to ensure that Taiwanese
customers can obtain detailed and swift information about the U.S. beef products
imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the other side, the DPP lawmakers insist on re-opening negotiations with the
United States and banning the controversial parts from entering Taiwan through
legislation, on the grounds that checks through administrative measures are not
enough to fully protect the health of the public.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the matter between the two parties' legislative caucuses have
been stalled for some time due to the differing stances amid grave concern among
Taiwan's consumers over the safety of U.S beef products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of mad cow disease surfaced in
Seattle. The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef
from cattle aged under 30 months, but the ban was reimposed two months later
when a second case was discovered.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the Department of Health agreed to allow beef imports once again, but
limited them to boneless beef from cattle younger than 30 months produced by
certified slaughterhouses and without any SRMs.</P>

      <P>A visiting Chinese banker said Tuesday that preparations for a currency
clearance and settlement system between Taiwan and China are now 80 to 90
percent complete.</P>
      <P>"An agreement on the system will be concluded before the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is signed," said Hu Xiaolian, vice
governor of the People's Bank of China.</P>
      <P>The ECFA issue is expected to be broached during the fourth round of talks
between Taiwan and China later this month in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Hu, who arrived in Taipei Monday for a cross-Taiwan Strait financial seminar,
told reporters after the opening of the forum that preparations for the currency
system have been in progress for quite some time.</P>
      <P>Noting that currency clearance services would be provided by commercial banks of
both sides of the strait, Hu said the preparations include matters such as the
transport of currency, the opening of accounts in the participating banks, and
the compilation of statistics.</P>
      <P>The system would allow for the conversion of Taiwan and China currency in banks
on both sides, which will lower the cost of currency conversion and reduce the
circulation of counterfeit banknotes, thereby encouraging Chinese tourists to
spend more in Taiwan, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top negotiator with China, said at the
seminar that during the fifth round of cross-strait negotiations, Taiwan and
China will conclude an agreement to allow bank ventures in each other's market.</P>
      <P>He said that when he and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin meet in Taiching
later this month, they will put the issue on the agenda for the next round of
talks that is expected to be held in China in the first half of next year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has eased restrictions on visits by overseas Chinese people, making it
easier for Chinese nationals who live in foreign countries or in Hong Kong or
Macau to visit the island, National Immigration Agency (NIA) officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Starting  Tuesday,  Chinese people can come to Taiwan for sightseeing as long as
they have lived in a foreign country or in Hong Kong and Macau for at least one
year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Previous regulations required them to have lived overseas for at least four
years. Overseas Chinese must still have a job in the countries and areas where
they live, or be the spouse or lineal relative of such overseas Chinese, to
apply for a tourist permit to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan only began opening the doors for tourist visits by Chinese people who
live overseas, in Hong Kong or Macau, in 2002.</P>
      <P>Chinese people who meet the requirements can apply to visit Taiwan for tourism
by providing their employment certificates, proofs of family relationship,
identification cards, application forms, travel plans and itineraries.</P>
      <P>The applications can be filed with the agency either by travel agents or by the
applicants themselves, the official added.</P>
      <P>In light of the increased demand for urgent entry permits by Chinese people
wishing to come to Taiwan, the immigration agency has set up a mechanism to
streamline the processing of travel documents of Chinese tourists on a case-by-
case basis in order to increase efficiency, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under the revisions, travel agencies who put down a NT$1 million (US$31,250)
security deposit with the Travel Agent Association of ROC Taiwan for arranging
tours for overseas Chinese to visit Taiwan will not be charged NT$100,000 for
each inbound-Chinese tourist who goes missing because there have been no case of
overstaying or absconding reported since Taiwan opened its doors to overseas
Chinese tourists in 2002, according to the official.</P>
      <P>However, a fine will still be imposed for inbound Chinese tourists from Hong
Kong, Macau or China who overstay their visas or go missing, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>It has become common for Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan since the two sides
first launched direct flights in 2008. The number of visitors from China has
been on the rise, since direct flights and flight destinations were expanded in
July this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou gave a directive Tuesday for the establishment a Cabinet-
level task force, headed by Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, to help revive
professional baseball in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president also gave instructions for 2010 to be designated as</P>
      <P>the first year of baseball revival in Taiwan, according to Chao Shou-po,
chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL).</P>
      <P>Ma gave the directives during first-ever national conference on baseball, which
was held to discuss ways of reviving and upgrading the sport that has been
plagued by game-fixing scandals.</P>
      <P>During the conference, Chao said, the president stressed that it is impossible
to solve during a two-hour meeting problems that have accumulated over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>He told the attendees that it is important "to eliminate the sickness" and at
the same time "revitalize the liveliness" of the sport.</P>
      <P>Ma said the relevant government agencies should make greater efforts to
communicate and coordinate among themselves to help tackle the problems
pertaining to irregularities  in the professional baseball league.</P>
      <P>An overall review should be conducted and proposals such as tax-free incentives
for professional  baseball clubs and their sponsors should be studied, the
president said.</P>
      <P>Premier  Wu Den-yih said at the meeting  that it is the government's
responsibility to provide a "clean" environment for professional baseball to
flourish, and he suggested that there should be at least one baseball stadium in
every city and county around the country.</P>
      <P>The conference was convened after some 800 baseball fans took to the streets of
Taipei Sunday demanding that the government do something to rescue the sport in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"President Ma has heard the voices of the demonstrators and he exhorted the CPBL
teams to 'hang in there' and not to give up despite the recent spate of
problems," Chao said.</P>
      <P>Fans of professional baseball clubs that were disbanded because of game fixing
joined the rally on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office to
demand that the government act quickly to fix the problems that they said had
led to frequent cases of game fixing.</P>
      <P>Responding to the protesters' demands, the president invited scholars, officials
of various government agencies, representatives of the professional baseball
clubs and representatives of the demonstrators to attend the national baseball
conference.</P>
      <P>"The executives of all the CPBL clubs are encouraged by the government's move to
revive the sport and to make it a matter of national importance," Chao added.</P>
      <P>The clubs' executives suggested during the meeting that the government give more
teeth to the efforts to crack down on the crime rings that orchestrated the
game-fixing in the professional baseball league.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the global economy recovering, Taiwan's manpower demand by the end of
January next year is expected to increase by 48,000, compare to the end of
October this year, according to the results of a survey published Tuesday by the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>The results of the fourth manpower survey of the year, conducted Oct. 16VNov. 5
and with 3,025 valid samples returned, show that 21.3 percent of the companies
that responded said they will hire more personnel in January 2010, representing
an increase of about 65,200 workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, about 8 percent of the companies surveyed will reduce their manpower,
representing a reduction of about 17,300 workers. That would result in a net
increase of 48,000 workers.</P>
      <P>It will be the highest net increase of manpower for a single season since the
survey was launched in Q3 2007, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>Around 65 percent of the companies will keep their manpower unchanged in
January, the survey results show.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that the manpower demand was gradually warming up
and there seems to be a trend towards more job hirings, said Cheng Wen-yuan,
director of the council's statistics department.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing, retail and support service sectors will see the most
noticeable increase in manpower needs. The highest number of job increase --
some 19,500 -- will come in the manufacturing sector, according to the survey
results.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the electronics components, computer and optical products sectors
are expected to benefit most from the recovery in demand and the rising demand
will generate more hiring needs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Trade policy not priority for Obama administration: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Dec.1   (CNA)
12/01/09  19:11:51
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American  scholars  attending  a Taipei-Washington video conference Tuesday
suggested that the U.S. administration has prioritized global issues,  such as
nuclear proliferation and energy policy, and that trade policy is not at the top
of its agenda.</P>
      <P>The Office of Trade Negotiations in Taipei invited four American scholars to
assess the impact of U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to Asia in mid-November
and to hold dialogue with Vice Economics Minister Francis Kuo-sin Liang and
other trade officials.</P>
      <P>The moderator, Sherman Elliott Katz,who is a senior advisor at the Washington-
based think tank Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, raised the
issues of U.S. trade policy, U.S. reaction towards probable China domination of
the Asian market, leverage in the situation where the U.S. is a debtor and China
is the creditor, China's currency, and the reduction of tensions across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Commenting on President Obama's statement in Tokyo on Nov. 14 that the U.S.
welcomes China's greater role in the world, Larry A. Niksch, a specialist in
Asian Affairs with the Congressional Research Service, said that he does not
think China's growth and expansion of influence would jeopardize Washington-
Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>The U.S. would not react to trade problems with protective measures, he added.</P>
      <P>Referring to the question of whether China's position as the largest foreign
creditor of the U.S. had influenced Obama's approach during his visit to China,
the expert in U.S. security policy said that he did not see Obama pushing China
on currency issues or China's subsidies to national industries.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  the situation in which China is the largest foreigner holder of
U.S. debt "would give China the ability to hurt the U.S. financially and
economically in the longer term," he suggested.</P>
      <P>Josh Kurlantzik,  Council on Foreign Relations  fellow for Southeast Asia, said
that Obama's decision not to meet the Dalai Lama had "overstated the weakness of
his hand."</P>
      <P>However, Grant Aldonas, under secretary of international trade in George W. Bush
administration's Commerce Department (2001-2005), held a different view of the
leverage issue.</P>
      <P>He suggested that while President Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and
Director of the White House's National Economic Council Lawrence Summers might
think that as the largest foreign creditor of the U.S., China has leverage, "the
debtor has relatively the same leverage as the creditor."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the statement by some Taiwanese scholars that the Obama
administration has prioritized global issues and is less concerned about China's
relationship with Taiwan, Niksch said that "the Obama administration, like the
Bush administration, is pleased to see the opening of cross-strait policies by
President Ma Ying-jeou and the reduction of tensions."</P>
      <P>Niksch suggested that the improvement in cross-strait relations has overshadowed
cross-strait defense issues, but added that he believes the U.S. will continue
to make selective military sales to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>As to the possibility of a political agreement on unification, Niksch said that
"the U.S. policy is changing to accept that -- as long as it is not a decision
made under coercion from China."</P>
      <P>He also emphasized the U.S. position that any major political move in Taiwan
should be decided by the Taiwanese people, maybe through referendum.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:
Apple Daily:</P>
      <P>Prize-winning film sheds light on bureaucratic detachment</P>
      <P>Taiwan's civil servants should be required to see Leon Dai's prize-winning film
"No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti" and report on what they saw as the movie portrays how
bureaucratic detachment could force ordinary citizens to the brink of death.</P>
      <P>The indie film swept the Golden Horse Film Festival last weekend by bagging the
coveted best picture and best director awards.</P>
      <P>It was based on the true story of a ship repair worker's desperate fight for his
daughter's right to education. The girl was born out of wedlock and her birth
was not legally registered with any local household registration agency. As a
result, she could not enter any elementary school.</P>
      <P>The protagonist approached government agencies at various levels but none of
them would extend him a helping hand. He ultimately tried to commit suicide but
fortunately, the attempt was thwarted by police.</P>
      <P>The black and white film reflects a common mind-set of Taiwan's civil servants
who tend to be passive in dealing with their work and try to avoid mistakes
rather than seek innovation or reform and also highlights another practice
commonly seen in Taiwan's officialdom -- passing the buck, as the protagonist is
sent from one agency to another.</P>
      <P>The film further reminds us that we still have a long way to go to build Taiwan
into a mature democracy as the democratic ideals of "government of people, by
people and for people" has not yet taken root in our officials' minds. Economic
Daily News</P>
      <P>Will 'China myth' shatter like Dubai World?</P>
      <P>The financial crisis faced by government-owned conglomerate Dubai World in the
United Arab Emirates should serve as a reminder to China's leaders that
extravagant development projects can collapse overnight.</P>
      <P>Unlike Dubai -- a small desert emirate whose prosperity is a myth built largely
on loans raised by its government -- China has what it takes to be an economic
power -- a huge population and plentiful arable land.</P>
      <P>Moreover, China has little foreign debt and has accumulated a large stash of
foreign exchange reserves after three decades of robust export-driven economic
development.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, these advantages could become disadvantages if the wrong
strategies are pursued. For instance, the huge population has been used as a
source of abundant cheap labor to support China's industrial development, but
its population is aging under its strict "one child" policy. Over the long run,
a large graying population could be a heavy burden for China.</P>
      <P>Rampant corruption and growing arrogance among China's policy makers as seen
through its extravagance in hosting the Olympics and unbridled large-scale
construction projects may also lead to a bleak economic future. China Times:
Opinion poll alone cannot make good governance</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi has betrayed a strong personal style as seen in his proposals
of "promoting grassroots economy" and "using an online survey to explore public
grievances."</P>
      <P>Theses strategies are of some significance from the perspective of reaching out
to people, but if they become the Cabinet's future policy guidelines, they may
fail to touch on the crux of problems.</P>
      <P>For one thing, there are age and rural-urban gaps in the use of the Internet in
Taiwan. Only 4,000 Internet users responded to the Cabinet's "public grievances"
survey. The limited number cannot exactly reflect public reaction to public
policies.</P>
      <P>While high housing price ranks first in the online "public grievances" survey,
it is more of a problem seen in northern Taiwan metropolises.</P>
      <P>With fewer rural residents using the Internet, problems commonly seen in
Taiwan's countryside were not reflected in the survey and problems faced by
foreign spouses were also not mentioned even though they give birth to one out
of every eight babies born in Taiwan nowadays.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the government should be well aware of the causes of public
grievances before conducting any opinion polls. For instance, telephone and
Internet fraud ranks second in the grievance survey. The government should have
known the seriousness of this problem through criminal statistics instead of
survey results.</P>
      <P>Food safety problems ranked ninth in the survey, but it is a problem that the
government should have long taken effective measures to tackle.</P>
      <P>As a government leader, the premier should have foresight and capabilities to
discern problems and ingenuity to address them. Commercial Times: Next Chapter
of Dubainomics</P>
      <P>Concerns over Dubai's debt situation have abated with the rebound of Asian stock
markets. We believe the Dubai financial crisis is unlikely to develop into a
global market disaster because the emirate's rich neighbors can well afford to
bail it out.</P>
      <P>However, the emirate's obituary was written in the aftermath of the financial
crisis as yet another example of hubris. An emirate that cannot repay its
sovereign debts on time simply has no credibility to become a financial center.</P>
      <P>The Dubai development model depended in part on a well of capital secured by oil
and buoyed by the confidence of the emerging market. That confidence led to the
creation of man-made islands and ski slopes in the desert, and some of the
world's tallest buildings. It also led to aggressive foreign investments in a
portfolio that included luxury stores and frivolities.</P>
      <P>The bubble of the portfolio, however, burst in the global financial crisis that
began last year.</P>
      <P>If Dubai wants to rise again, it must work out a new strategy different from its
vision of Arab entrepreneurisalism, easy credit and anything-is-possible
attitude that epitomized the "if you build it they will come" philosophy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan once tried to learn from Dubai's development strategy, but we think it is
more important to learn from the "next chapter of the Dubainomics." United Daily
News Bursting of the Dubai Bubble</P>
      <P>A year or two ago, Dubainomics was a hot topic among fashionable celebrities.
Dubai's Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum was reputed to be a model leader in
the Arab world, while the seven-star Burj-al-Arab Hotel and man-made Palm Island
became new meccas for travelers from around the world.</P>
      <P>However, the Dubai myth, built largely on loans raised by its government, has
exploded with the debt default of its investment arm, Dubai World.</P>
      <P>Dubai's boom-to-bust story reminds us of two lessons. First, national
development should not rely overly on unrealistic dreams. The tiny gulf emirate
in the desert was pursuing goals beyond its reach.</P>
      <P>Second, the global money game is unpredictable. In the past few years, few so-
called investment gurus and analysts bothered to issue any warnings or
precautions on potential risks, even as they passionately recommended Dubai
strategies.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan, the crisis presented a different lesson. Taiwan has the right
conditions to realistically become a regional business  hub,  as it has
pragmatic  and smart entrepreneurs, hard-working people, cultural heritage and a
strategic location. However, it has not achieved that dream because its two
major political camps have been bogged down in a war of attrition as they are
being misled by politicians. Liberty Times Taiwan's democracy at risk</P>
      <P>Taiwanese voters will go to the polls Dec. 5 to elect city mayors and county
magistrates. Although only 17 top local government posts are at stake, the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has been campaigning hard in an effort to get its people
in.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been on several barnstorming tours around the island
to stump for KMT candidates in his capacity as KMT chairman. As the zeal he has
shown in campaigning has gone out of proportion to the positions being sought,
he has ulterior motives.</P>
      <P>Ma hopes his party can score a resounding success in the elections so that he
can use it as a public endorsement of his China-leaning policies.</P>
      <P>A new round of high-level talks across the Taiwan Strait will come hard on the
heels of the elections and the two sides are also scheduled to begin talks on an
economic cooperation framework agreement  (ECFA)  next  January.  We are worried
that  more market-opening deals could be struck in those two meetings.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we urge voters in the coming elections to cast their ballots wisely
to protect Taiwan's young democracy from disappearing overnight.</P>

      <P>Building a bridge connecting Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Island and the Xiamen port
in China's Fujian Province is not appropriate for now as it is a politically-
sensitive matter, Premier Wu Den-yih was quoted as saying Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsing-chien, chief editor of the Journalist weekly, quoted Wu Den-yih as
making the statement after attending a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
Competitiveness Forum on Kinmen's development as a "free trade city." The
seminar was held in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsing-chien accompanied Wu Den-yih to Kinmen Island on Nov. 26 and conducted
an interview on the same issue with the premier that day.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Hsing-chien, the premier said during last Thursday's interview
that the planned Kinmen-Xiamen Bridge will not be built at present so as to
avoid political implications.</P>
      <P>As the bridge would connect Taiwan's territory with China's soil for the first
time, such a political association should be fended off at present, the premier
was quoted as explaining.</P>
      <P>However, the premier stated in the interview that a projected 4-km bridge
linking the Big Kinmen Island with the Little Kinmen Island will be constructed
by the end of 2010, given that it is a major plank of President Ma Ying-jeou's
presidential  campaign platform.</P>
      <P>Chang Ya-chung, a political science professor of National Taiwan University,
said the government's attempts to skip the proposed Kinmen-Xiamen Bridge
highlighted its "lack of vision."</P>
      <P>Judging from Kinmen's geographic proximity with Xiamen and a close economic
integration between the two sides, Chang said the building of the bridge would
be a boon for people on both Kinmen and Xiamen. He predicted it will be an
unavoidable development.</P>
      <P>Tung Chih-sen, a veteran journalist from Kinmen who has worked a long time for
several major newspapers and a local cable station, urged the central government
to shrug off unnecessary misgivings, because political motivations and funds
should not be factors blocking the construction of the Kinmen-Xiamen Bridge, he
said.</P>
      <P>Amid improved cross-Taiwan Strait ties and due to its proximity to Xiamen,
Kinmen has long hoped to play a leading role in boosting Taiwan-China exchanges
on the tourism, financial and educational fronts.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng has said repeatedly that the county is
willing to act as a guinea pig for the central government's China policy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan mulling allowing its flat panel industry to invest in China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's deputy economics minister said Monday here that the government will
properly handle issues related to the opening of Taiwan's flat panel industry to
invest in China.</P>
      <P>Huang Jung-chiou made the remarks on the sidelines of the opening of the 2009
Taiwan-US Green Energy &amp; Technology Joint Conference in response to a call
for the opening.</P>
      <P>But Huang did not comment on whether the Ministry of Economic Affairs will reach
an agreement for the opening in 2010 at an inter-ministerial meeting slated for
late-December on review of the timing and scope for opening Taiwan's panel
industry to invest in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's contract manufacturers have very strong production capacity for small-
and-medium size flat panel products and the products have gained a competitive
edge in the global market, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, manufacturers of large size panels have set their sight on the flat
panel television market, with the United States and Japan the two largest
markets in the world. Demand for the products in China has been growing rapidly
recently, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that according to his observation, China is not willing to see the
country overly rely on other countries for panel production, particularly Taiwan
and South Korea. It therefore hopes Taiwan's panel manufacturers will invest in
China.</P>
      <P>"We'll keep a close eye on South Korea's move in China and properly address
issues related to collaboration between Taiwan and China in panel production,"
he indicated.</P>
      <P>Lou Qinjian, vice-minister of China's Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, urged Taiwan to open its panel industry to invest in China during a
meeting in Taipei a few days ago and said that both sides have reached a
consensus on the matter.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou lauded Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a model of
democracy in the Caribbean region as it held a constitutional referendum Nov.
25, the first of its kind to be held by a member of the Organization of Eastern
Caribbean States (OECS).</P>
      <P>During a meeting in Taipei with Hendrick Alexander, speaker of Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines' House of Assembly, Ma noted that the Republic of China and the
Caribbean country have enjoyed diplomatic ties for 28 years and that Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines has helped the ROC' participation in OECS activities,
as well as having promoted Taiwan's international visibility and deepened
Taiwan's friendship with other Caribbean countries.</P>
      <P>Although the ROC Constitution was enacted in 1946 and implemented the next year,
democracy has only developed in the country for the last 20 years or so, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has held four direct presidential elections and has undergone two changes
in ruling parties since 1996 after martial law was ended in 1987, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>The democracy established in Taiwan has won world recognition, he went on,
pointing out that former U.S. President George W. Bush has praised Taiwan as a
beacon of democracy for Asia and the world.</P>
      <P>So far, 24 students from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have studied in
Taiwan, and in the future, the government will expand its scholarship program to
provide more opportunities for students from its diplomatic allies to study
here, according to Ma.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislative meeting over U.S. beef opening stymied by opposition</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) paralyzed a
legislative meeting Tuesday over the controversy concerning the Executive Yuan's
decision to relax restrictions on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>The session, aimed at reviewing amendments to the Food Sanity and Management
Law, was blocked by DPP lawmakers who occupied the podium to prevent the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative caucus from calling a vote to pass relevant law
revisions and raised large posters declaring their demands.</P>
      <P>The meeting was called off by Legislative Vice Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan after
around 10 minutes.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators and their DPP counterparts have been divided over the amendments
to the Food Sanity and Management Law, after Taiwan and the United States inked
a protocol in late October in Washington, D.C. to allow the entry of U.S. bone-
in beef,  ground beef, intestines, spinal cords and processed beef from cattle
younger than 30 months that have not been contaminated with "specific risk
materials (SRMs)" related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>SRMs are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes, trigeminal ganglia,
spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from cattle 30 months
and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small intestine from cattle of
all ages.</P>
      <P>In line with the terms of the protocol, KMT legislators hope to impose strict
administrative inspections to examine the controversial items of imported U.S.
beef products from the point of origin in the United States through to the
downstream retail markets in Taiwan, as well as to ensure that Taiwanese
customers can obtain detailed and swift information about the U.S. beef products
imported into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the other side, the DPP lawmakers insist on re-opening negotiations with the
United States and banning the controversial parts from entering Taiwan through
legislation, on the grounds that checks through administrative measures are not
enough to fully protect the health of the public.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the matter between the two parties' legislative caucuses have
been stalled for some time due to the differing stances amid grave concern among
Taiwan's consumers over the safety of U.S beef products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first banned U.S. beef in 2003 when a case of mad cow disease surfaced in
Seattle. The ban was lifted in April 2005 to allow imports of U.S. de-boned beef
from cattle aged under 30 months, but the ban was reimposed two months later
when a second case was discovered.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the Department of Health agreed to allow beef imports once again, but
limited them to boneless beef from cattle younger than 30 months produced by
certified slaughterhouses and without any SRMs.</P>

they measured every action and enterprise by heaven. What heaven desired they
would carry out, what heaven abominated they refrained from."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's authorities trying to rid election of phantom voters</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
12/02/09  12:34:29
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With three days to go before Saturday's county magistrate and mayoral elections,
prosecutors have stepped up their efforts to drive out phantom voters,
especially in the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>In the two outlying counties, where the number of voters is small, an election
can be decided by a slim margin. Prosecutors said that was all the more reason
for them to weed out phantom voters - people who take up residence in local
areas four months before the election date for the sole purpose of being
eligible to vote for specific candidates.</P>
      <P>Some of these voters are paid by people who support particular candidates to
become a "voting machine" to sway the election outcome.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors started their crackdown several months ago.</P>
      <P>In last month alone, the authorities mobilized over 200 policemen, searched 20
residences and summoned 117 people for questioning in two waves of crackdown to
check alleged phantom voters, according to the newspaper China Times.</P>
      <P>The reports also cited the prosecutors in saying that the number of the alleged
"phantom population" was 3,215 in Kinmen, nearly double that of the number of
1,613 in the previous local elections four years ago.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities have also found that several hundred of the phantom
voters belonged to the gangster organization "Tian Tao Meng (The Celestial Way)"
from Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>In the past, law enforcement officers would simply leave if the houses they
visited were locked. But this time, the officers did not give up so easily, but
visited the same house for up to four times in half a day, the reports added.</P>
      <P>Seven candidates, the most among all 17 cities and counties where elections will
be held, are vying for the seat of Kinmen magistrate this year. The battle is
therefore fought more fiercely there than in any other place.</P>
      <P>Lee Wo-shih, a candidate nominated by the ruling Kuomintang, even went the
distance to campaign in Taipei city and county, where around 60 percent of more
than 20,000 eligible Kinmen voters now reside.</P>
      <P>The total number of eligible voters in Kinmen is 72,509. Comparatively, the
number of eligible voters in Matsu is only 7,697.</P>
      <P>Efforts to root out phantom voters in Matsu was also intense.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-tsung, chief prosecutor of Lienchiang Prosecutors Office in Matsu,
said that the office began to check the suspected phantom voters beginning in
January and has listed 261 such cases, the China Times reported.</P>
      <P>Reports also said that the prosecutors are also examining the passenger lists of
airliners, ferries as well as the guest lists of hotels and hostels. If
suspected persons travel to Matsu, the prosecutors would question them
immediately.</P>
      <P>With the rampant rumors of phantom voters in Matsu, Lin said his office "is
pulling out all the stops to contain their encroachment to ensure a fair and
just election."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the air carriers announced that they have added more flights to
Kinmen and Matsu starting Friday to meet the needs of those who reside in Taiwan
proper but want to return home to vote.</P>
      <P>A total of 16 flights to the two outlying islands have been added, and they have
been quickly booked with many more people on the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>"We were fully booked on the first day we announced the additional flights," an
official of the Mandarin Airlines said. endditem/cs</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A prominent scholar's incisive criticism of the attitude of students studying
medicine has triggered heated debate, which has led the professor in cognitive
neuroscience to resign from the post as a visiting education evaluator of the
Taiwan Medical Accreditation Council (TMAC).</P>
      <P>Daisy Hung, director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience of National
Central University's College of Science, has tendered her resignation after TMAC
decided not to adopt her evaluation opinions, Ministry of Education (MOE)
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry respects TMAC's decision, the officials added.</P>
      <P>According to TMAC Director Andrew Huang's secretary, the decision was a
consensus among council members, after Hung published an article criticizing
students at National Taiwan University (NTU), the top-notch university in
Taiwan, for "eating instant noodles" and "chewing drumsticks" in class.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the TMAC's decision, central Taiwan's China Medical University
Hospital Vice President Lin Shinn-zong said ignoring Hung's accreditation was
"disrespect for Hung" after the latter spent time and energy to seek improvement
in the quality of higher education.</P>
      <P>As Hung was blamed for disclosing contents of her evaluation which should have
been kept confidential, her article published in the CommonWealth monthly drew
defensive remarks from students at the NTU College of Medicine who organized a
workshop on Nov. 30 to discuss what brought up the criticisms.</P>
      <P>In her article titled "giving way to people who want education, " Hung wrote
that as other universities around the world fight for talented students,
Taiwan's smartest students will not only be late for class, but also eat instant
noodles and chew drumsticks in class, watch TV soap opera series on their
computer, or lie prone on the desk for a long nap.</P>
      <P>The renowned educator and writer in Taiwan denounced the students for wasting
the country's valuable and limited educational resources and their parents'
money.</P>
      <P>At the workshop, however, Fang Yuan, an NTU assistant professor in sociology,
gave a different opinion on students' behavior. She argued that Taiwan's
traditional  "authoritarian"  approach  to education has proved its failure.</P>
      <P>"Students" are the subject of education, she said, explaining that it is
important for there to be interactions between teachers and students. She stated
that every teacher has their different "silent agreement" with students.</P>
      <P>If the teacher feels eating food in class has interfered with other students'
learning, she wonders why the teacher will not act to stop it, Fang said.</P>
      <P>She added that she believes "students' behavior in class is not equivalent to
their learning attitude, nor learning effect."</P>

      <P>Diplomatic missions to Taiwan are keeping an eye on Saturday's local elections
in order to gain a better understanding of local politics and observe the
country's democratic development.</P>
      <P>As the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and major opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) stepped up their campaign efforts in the final countdown to the elections,
many of the foreign representative offices, mostly located in the capital of
Taipei, paid visits to campaign  offices and election  rallies across the island
and experienced first-hand the heat of the race.</P>
      <P>The so called "three-in-one" polls are for the election of mayors and
magistrates, city and county councilors, and township heads.</P>
      <P>Thomas Hodges, spokesman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) -- the de
facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations -- told the
Central News Agency that in the lead-up to Saturday's elections, much like the
lead-up to other major elections in Taiwan, AIT officers visited a number of
different locations throughout Taiwan, including Yunlin, Chiayi and Penghu.</P>
      <P>They met with candidates, officials and campaigners from both major parties, as
well as local journalists and other avid followers of politics, according to
Hodges.</P>
      <P>"Such visits help AIT better understand Taiwan's politics and give AIT officers
a chance to meet with a cross-section of people from Taiwan," said Hodges.</P>
      <P>"AIT takes no sides in the outcome of Taiwan's elections, but understanding the
ins and outs of all aspects of Taiwan's remarkable democratic development helps
AIT keep Washington better informed about political trends, public opinion, and
policy developments in Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Jason Reeve, director of the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei's General
Relations, said that he just arrived in Taipei this summer, so this is his first
time to personally experience the excitement of an election in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The local elections also attracted the attention from democracies in the Middle
East, as the top Israeli envoy to Taiwan said that although as a diplomat, he
will not express any view on internal political affairs, he is following with
great interest the upcoming local elections to observe the democratic
development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I always underline the great esteem of myself and my country to the democratic
and open society of Taiwan, " said Raphael Gamzou, representative of the Israel
Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, director of the DPP's Department of International Affairs, told
the CNA that over the years, the DPP would organize electoral observation
missions for the diplomatic corps to have an in-depth understanding of local
politics and public opinions.</P>
      <P>"These visits are good opportunities for them to have a close observation of
Taiwan's democracy and to gain a different point of view from people in local
constituencies rather than through the media only," said Hsiao.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, these electoral observation missions, which include visits
to campaign offices, interactions with the public and candidates, and the
showcasing of political achievements, are well-received by members of the
diplomatic corps.</P>
      <P>As eight cities and counties -- Taipei City, Taipei County, Taichung City,
Taichung County, Tainan City, Tainan County and Kaohsiung County and Kaohsiung
County -- will not elect new chiefs until late 2010, this year's elections will
be held in only 17 of Taiwan's 25 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>The number of voters eligible to cast their ballots on Saturday totals 7.05
million, according to the Central Election Commission.</P>

      <P>The government has begun work to build Taiwan into a high technology capital-
raising center as part of its efforts to promote the development of the
country's capital market.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Wednesday at a forum on company management that
the Financial Supervisory Commission and other relevant government agencies are
mapping out measures to develop a financial  center  with  what  he  described
as  "Taiwanese characteristics."</P>
      <P>There has been a good industrial and value connection in the up-, mid- and
downstream of Taiwan's high tech industry that can be used by the industry --
one of Taiwan's most internationally competitive -- as a base for the planned
center, said Siew.</P>
      <P>Economic and financial consultants to the government have advised that Taiwan
should take advantage of its edge in the high tech sector to attract foreign
companies to list on Taiwan's stock market.</P>
      <P>Siew stated that as countries around the world attach importance to company
management, strengthening management will not just help the sustainable
development of a company, but will also attract international investors to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a small export-oriented country,  Taiwan faces powerful competitors in the
international market. In that regard,  the government will continue efforts to
help local companies reinforce their management, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Siew is the incumbent chairman of the Cross-Straits Common Market Foundation and
he chaired the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research before being
nominated as a vice presidential candidate in 2007.</P>

      <P>The United Kingdom has become "the hottest" travel destination for Taiwanese,
with the number of tourists having increased by over 30 percent since the U.K.
lifted visa requirements March 3, a Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural
Office (BTCO) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>From March to October, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the U.K. was up by
36.4 percent compared with the same period of last year, according to statistics
published by the Taiwan Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>David Campbell, director of the BTCO, said at a tourism promotion luncheon that
he was very pleased to see so many Taiwanese traveling to the U.K. for
sightseeing, study or business.</P>
      <P>The already close connections between the U.K. and Taiwan and exchanges between
their peoples will continue to grow, as a new air service agreement signed
between the U.K. and Taiwan last month will allow more flights between Taipei
and London in the future, according to Campbell.</P>
      <P>"In the run up to the 2012 London Olympics, I think it will be exciting to visit
the U.K.," said Campbell.</P>
      <P>Jane Dong, a Hong Kong manager for VisitBritain -- the official Web site for
travel in the U.K. -- said her agency welcomes the latest developments and that
she sees great potential in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>More and more Taiwanese tourists are planning holidays to the U.K., including
the Lunar New Year in February, according to Lin Wei-ching, general manager of
Phoenix Travel, one of Taiwan's leading travel agencies.</P>
      <P>"Our U.K.  business  has doubled  since  the visa lifting announcement in March.
Taiwanese tourists can plan their trips to the U.K. more conveniently without
the hassle of applying for visas," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The U.K. visa decision has also been welcomed by Taiwanese businesses, according
to the Taiwan Britain Business Council, which noted that one Taiwanese investor
recently moved its European headquarters to the U.K. after the visa-lifting
announcement because it can call board meetings in the U.K. at any time without
needing to apply for visas, which is crucial when dealing with urgent requests
from customers, attending meetings, exhibitions, or exploring new business
opportunities.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that Taiwan's offer to donate influenza
A(H1N1) vaccine to the World Health Organization (WHO) has helped feature the
country as a "peace creator" and "disseminator of love."</P>
      <P>The government announced last month that it is planning to present 500,000 doses

themselves to imported vaccine manufactured by the Novartis multinational

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's relations with Japan will not be affected by the resignation of the
Japanese representative to Taiwan, an official of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Lyushun said the MOFA respects the
decision Monday by Masaki Saito, head of the Japan Interchange Association (JIA)
in Taipei, to resign for personal reasons.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Japan are equitable and Taiwan could not have
possibly forced the Japanese representative to resign, Shen said.</P>
      <P>"The ministry respects the decision by Saito, the JIA and the Japanese
government," he said.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of recent positive developments in the relations
between Taiwan and Japan, Shen said, among them the opening of a Taiwan office
in Sapporo Tuesday, which was the sixth of its kind and "a major milestone in
bilateral relations."</P>
      <P>Saito's decision will not affect Japan-Taiwan relations, Shen stressed.</P>
      <P>Saito's resignation is widely believed to have been resulted from the
controversy caused by his comment in May that "Taiwan's status remains unclear."</P>
      <P>The remark, made in Chaiyi County at a meeting of the Republic of China
International Relations Association, angered Taiwan and resulted in Saito being
given the cold shoulder.</P>
      <P>He has been quiet over the past several months and has had very little
interaction with Taiwanese officials in charge of relations with Japan.</P>
      <P>Also, during a recent visit to Taiwan by a group of Japanese dietmen, they asked
that Saito be excluded from their meetings with President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Shen reiterated Wednesday that the Republic of China's sovereignty is
"undisputable." When the Republic of China declared war against Japan in 1937,
it abrogated all treaties signed between the two countries after the first Sino-
Japanese war (1894-1895) that resulted in the Qing dynasty ceding Taiwan to
Japan, he added.</P>
      <P>In other responses Wednesday  to Saito's resignation,  the Presidential Office
said that it respects his decision and that of the JIA, while Legislative
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Japan "should have already chosen" a replacement
envoy.</P>
      <P>Even though Saito's replacement may not have specific ties with Taiwan, he or
she should be "a diplomat with strong credibility," he added.</P>
      <P>He also praised Saito's performance over the past year, noting that during that
time the two countries signed a working holiday pact and agreed to open an air
route between Taipei Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport soon.</P>
      <P>The local China Times newspaper suggested  Wednesday  that Yoshinori Katori, a
former spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry who was previously stationed
in Israel and South Korea, would be the most suitable person to take up the
post.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Details on the setting up of footholds by banks in Taiwan and China on the
opposite sides of the Taiwan Strait could be discussed after memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) on financial supervisory cooperation between the two sides
come into effect, Taiwan's chief financial regulator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen told lawmakers at the
Legislative Yuan that the number of footholds and equality issues concerning
setting up operations by Taiwanese and Chinese banks could be negotiated after
the MOUs become effective Jan. 15 next year, but are not suitable for inclusion
on the agenda for talks on a proposed bilateral economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China will develop their own respective standards for their banks to
follow when establishing footholds across the strait, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Local banks that want to set up operations in China will need to be listed as
"good" after factoring in their capital adequacy ratio, non-performing loan
(NPL) ratio and NPL coverage ratio, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China -- Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung -- said a day earlier that issues concerning market access for
financial institutions on either side are expected to be brought up in the fifth
round of talks between himself and China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen
Yunlin.</P>
      <P>However, Chen had a differing view, saying that it is still too early to
speculate on the matter and adding that whether the issues will be put on the
agenda will only be known after their fourth round of talks conclude later in
December.</P>
      <P>Asked about when banks in Taiwan will be allowed to provide Chinese yuan deposit
services, Chen said only that the time will be ripe after the number of Chinese
visitors to Taiwan "reaches a certain level."</P>
      <P>As for a currency settlement system pact between Taiwan and China slated to be
signed before the proposed ECFA is sealed, Chen said that in the initial stage,
banks on both sides will first provide services for the conversion of Taiwanese
and Chinese currency in cash, and then later provide bank account services.</P>
      <P>Chen also said the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. will review an imbalance in
supply and demand in response to lawmakers' speculation that the prices of
Taiwan Depository Receipts (TDR) listed by overseas Taiwanese enterprises on the
local market have been jacked up.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tourism revenues from Chinese visitors far less than expected: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tourism revenues from Chinese visitors over the past months have been far below
the expectations of the Tourism Bureau, with the number of visitors and their
level of spending in Taiwan falling short of the estimates, according to a
survey conducted by the Institute for Business Development (IBD).</P>
      <P>IBD Vice President Tu Tze-chen said at a press briefing Wednesday that based on
the monthly average of between 70,000 and 80,000 arrivals from China, it is
estimated that the number in 2009 will reach 900,000, way below the Tourism
Bureau's forecast of 1.6 million visitors.</P>
      <P>Through IBD interviews with 28 experienced tour guides and the observations of
some IBD researchers who posed as tour guides to collect information on
tourists' consumption behavior, the IBD drafted an analytical report on the
benefits to the tourism sector from Taiwan's opening to Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that, to the disappointment of the travel sector, Chinese
tourists each spend an average NT$35,244 for an eight-day seven-night stay in
Taiwan, which means that revenues from Chinese tourists this year may not reach
the projected NT$30 billion that is based on an estimated average spending of
NT$62,601 per person.</P>
      <P>IBD researcher Lee Chu-yuan pointed out that the average spending of Chinese
tourists was far less than expected, partly because of cut-throat competition
among travel agencies.</P>
      <P>With the itineraries of low-budget tourist groups mostly confined to night
markets and cursory tours of scenic spots such as the Alishan mountain resort
and Sun Moon Lake, Chinese tourists have hardly had the opportunity to
appreciate Taiwan's attractions and culture and therefore might not come again,
Lee added.</P>
      <P>The IBD analysis shows that 70 percent of the Chinese tourists to Taiwan over
the past few months were people from rural areas, over 40 years of age, looking
forward to fulfilling the dream of "going to Taiwan," and expecting intensive
tours to see as many places as possible.</P>
      <P>IBD Vice President Tu suggested that Taiwan's travel sector help Chinese
tourists to develop an appreciation for delicacies like Dintaifung dumplings and
for music stores, coffee shops, wineries and the tea houses of the Eslite
bookstore chain.</P>
      <P>He said that both the government and the travel sector should target white-
collar workers and young people on the Chinese mainland and design theme tours
of special interest to them.</P>
      <P>As many Taiwanese corporations are now preparing to hold year-end parties for
their employees, Tu said, corporations with business establishments in China
should consider inviting their Chinese employees to attend the celebrations in
Taiwan. Such a gesture of company unity can also serve as a type of tourism
promotion, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
12/02/09  18:22:48</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday: United Daily News When will Taiwan end social laceration?</P>
      <P>China characterizes its Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, as a holocaust.
Time Magazine calls the first decade of the 21st Century the "decade from hell"
for the United States.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, perhaps we can call the roughly 10 years from the latter part of
former President Lee Teng-hui's rule to the eight years of the Chen Shui-bian
administration as the "decade of social laceration."</P>
      <P>The three tragedies differ in terms of scale and extent and they happened under
different political systems. The "decade from hell" occurred in a mature
democracy, while the Cultural Revolution took place in an extremely repressive
autocracy and Taiwan's social laceration emerged in the burgeoning stage of its
democratization following decades of martial law.</P>
      <P>The three cases indicate that historical blunders can happen in any political
system and all three were led by Messiah-like political figures who misled their
countries into the abyss because of their own power crises.</P>
      <P>Mao Zedong tried to rescue his own political career by launching the Cultural
Revolution.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the 911 terrorist attacks, George W. Bush won passionate support
with pledges to exact revenge for the terrorist attacks, but his unilateralism
undermined his country's justice and the Wall Street-originated 2008 global
financial crisis further highlighted Bush's disastrous governance.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan,  Lee Teng-hui's  "two states"  theory and Chen Shui-bian's pursuit of
de jure Taiwan independence led to increased tension across the Taiwan Strait
and split local society.</P>
      <P>Both Lee and Chen used to be political stars, but their independence overtures
pushed Taiwan into a war of attrition over the past decade and probably left
irreparable  wounds on Taiwan's political and economic development.</P>
      <P>Today,  China has emerged from the ashes of the Cultural Revolution and has
become an economic powerhouse, while the United States is also striving to get
back on track through policy adjustments.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan is still mired in social confrontation and laceration over
relations with China. Whether Taiwan should sign a free trade pact known as the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is still a topic of hot debate.
None of Taiwan's political bigwigs in either the ruling or opposition camps are
capable of leading Taiwan out of such a divide. Without a leader with broad
vision and broad mind, Taiwan's future is bleak.</P>
      <P>China Times: Dubai crisis offers lessons for national governance</P>
      <P>Iceland, Ireland and Dubai were once praised as successful models for economic
development, but they have been mired in financial chaos since the outbreak of a
global financial crisis last summer.</P>
      <P>The rise and fall of the three states provide good lessons for national
governance and risk management.</P>
      <P>All of the three countries used to be economic backwaters, but their governments
managed to carve out niche markets with efficient governance, updated
legislation and taxation system.</P>
      <P>Their governments  acted quickly and resolutely to attract investments to help
materialize their ambitious goals. In just a decade, Ireland turned itself from
the "beggar of Europe" into the "Celtic tiger, " Iceland developed itself into a
financial hub from a poor fishing country, and Dubai built an economic miracle
on its desert territory.</P>
      <P>However, their prosperity evaporated almost overnight amid the onslaught of a
global financial tsunami. The root cause lies in their lack of a sense of
crisis.</P>
      <P>In the pursuit of rapid growth, they would rather deal with devils while failing
to adopt any risk control measures. They became too dependent on hot money and
foreign investments for their economic development. To make matters worse, their
governments gave up their responsibilities for market supervision too early. In
the end, their property bubble exploded.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, it has something to learn from the three countries' stories. While
its financial service industry has been less affected by the global crisis
because of its relatively limited liberalization, Taiwan has been plagued by a
host of problems, including inefficient governance, relatively high corruption
and policy discontinuity. As a result, it has been unable to carve out new
frontiers for its economy and industries over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Good governance is critical to a country's economic development. Indonesia
provides a good example. The country was in chaos after the 1998 Asian financial
crisis because of its political disarray and official  corruption.  Since Susilo
Bambang  Yudhoyono  assumed the presidency, Indonesia has gradually emerged as
the "next golden brick" or the next economic powerhorse thanks to Yudhoyono's
political and economic reforms and his personal integrity. Liberty Times China
in process of buying out Taiwan</P>
      <P>Over the past half-century, China has failed to take over Taiwan with brute
force. It is now employing a different strategy, using money as its key weapon.</P>
      <P>With its large stash of foreign exchange reserves and the current Kuomintang
(KMT)  administration's  pro-China policy,  China is gradually realizing its
goal.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan has not yet fully opened its doors to Chinese capital,
Chinese companies have nonetheless been entering Taiwan in the guise of
Taiwanese and Hong Kong enterprises.</P>
      <P>Business groups with Chinese capital have bought real estate and money-losing
media outlets. Why would Chinese business groups make such purchases at
unreasonably high prices? They intend to use the media outlets as Chinese
propaganda mouthpieces.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it's no longer a secret in the financial community that China has used
private equity funds to buy into Taiwan's banks and other financial institutions
in collaboration with foreign companies.</P>
      <P>Many ordinary Taiwan people did not pay a great deal of attention to such
developments until China Strategic Holdings and Primus Financial Holdings
recently won a bid to acquire Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., the second-largest
life insurer in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of far greater concern, however, is that once China's banks are allowed to open
branches in Taiwan, they will be able to further nurture support in Taiwan's
business community by buying into local blue-chip companies or by offering low-
interest loans to heavily indebted companies.</P>
      <P>Following its invasion of Taiwan's industrial and financial sectors, China's
ultimate goal is to control the country's politics. After forging close ties
with the ruling Kuomintang, China may now attempt to influence Taiwan's
113-member Legislative Yuan. China spends billions of dollars in military
buildup annually, but would need to pay only a small portion of such money if it
were able to offer financial subsidies to half of Taiwan's legislators.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's people should not remain unconcerned about the fact that China is
engaging in an asymmetrical economic war against Taiwan, fighting with "money
bullets." Apple Daily Imagination more important than knowledge</P>
      <P>A noted cognitive neuroscience scholar's sharp criticism of bad classroom
etiquette among students at National Taiwan University's College of Medicine has
drawn heated debate.</P>
      <P>While some people echo Daisy Hung's views, others disagree with her criticism.</P>
      <P>To be fair, her concern about students' eating and napping in class and their
ignorance of the Chinese classics is not necessary, because imagination is more
important than knowledge.</P>
      <P>We are no strangers to strict restrictions on students' dress, bearing and
length of hair. In the past authoritarian era, schools used to impose rigorous
classroom decorum as part of efforts to nurture obedient citizens. Gone are such
days.</P>
      <P>In the modern-day world, individuals and countries alike compete with their
imagination and ingenuity rather than their acquired knowledge from reciting the
Chinese classics. Without imagination, no-one can be creative. Without
creativity, no-one will have a future.</P>
      <P>Liberal-minded students tend to be averse to following rules and like to
challenge limits. Authoritarians do not like them because they often break hide-
bound social norms or etiquette. However, such a characteristic provides a hot-
house in which the imagination can grow. As a result, many young students are
more lively, imaginative and creative than their older predecessors.</P>
      <P>This is an encouraging trend and therefore, we need not care too much about
their classroom etiquette.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's National Immigration Agency (NIA) promulgated Wednesday a set of rules
defining the scope of activities Chinese tourists  can be involved in,  listing
four forbidden activities for them in Taiwan, including participating in
political rallies.</P>
      <P>According to the NIA, Chinese visitors in Taiwan are prohibited from taking part
in activities harmful to national security, such as participating in political
activities, or attending political talk shows and election campaigns. They are
also forbidden from working in return for pay.</P>
      <P>The rules were announced as Taiwan is seeing an increasing number of Chinese
tourists -- an average of 2,518 a day in the first nine months of this year --
after two sides signed an agreement to boost tourism in 2008 and after direct
flights between Taiwan and mainland China were expanded in July 2009.</P>
      <P>In essence, Chinese tourists in Taiwan must abide by the agreement inked by
Taiwan and China about Chinese people sightseeing in Taiwan Chiu Hsin-ying, a
NIA section chief in charge of inbound and outbound affairs, said.</P>
      <P>Although the government has not allowed Chinese people to come to Taiwan on
their own without joining tour groups, Chinese tourists currently visiting
Taiwan on group tours have free time aside from their tour package itinerary.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with Taiwan's authorities, China-based travel agencies are
required to introduce the rules to their clients before they come to Taiwan,
Chiu said, adding that any Chinese visitor who fails to follow the regulations
will be asked to leave Taiwan. Serious violations will be dealt with by law,
Chiu said.</P>

      <P>Two renowned scientists of Taiwan's leading academic institute Academia Sinica
were recently awarded the 16th Taiwanese-American Foundation (TAF) Awards in
recognition of their outstanding accomplishments in the fields of nanotechnology

      <P>According to an Academia Sinica press statement, Wu Maw-kuen and Chen Chien-jen
together received the TAF Award in science and engineering at an award ceremony
held Nov. 28 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is a distinguished research fellow and director of the Institute  of
Physics  at  Academia  Sinica,  specializes  in superconductivity and magnetism
and is the director of the Taiwan National  Science and Technology  Program for

      <P>Taiwan's women's table tennis team won its first game in the team competition at
the 2009 East Asian Games (EAG) in Hong Kong Wednesday, after the men's table
tennis team and the women's basketball team lost their games that same day.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's women beat South Korea 3-2 in the Group B competition and was set to
face Hong Kong the following day.</P>
      <P>The victory over South Korea was not expected to be easy. Hsu Jung-chan, the
team's head coach, said earlier that South Korea had a strong team and that he
was not optimistic about the first game because three of the Taiwanese players
had begun to suffer cold symptoms.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the men's table tennis team lost to South Korea 1-3 in the
Group B competition.</P>
      <P>Six teams are competing in the women's and men's table tennis competition, with
Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong in the same group.</P>
      <P>The men's loss means that Taiwan will have a tough job becoming one of the top
four teams to make the finals.</P>
      <P>In women's basketball, Taiwan lost to China 61-69 in the preliminary round, a
loss that was attributed in part to the lower average height of the Taiwanese
players -- 10 centimeters shorter than the Chinese team. Taiwan scored only 23
rebounds, less than half of China's 47 rebounds, which sealed their defeat.</P>
      <P>The Fifth East Asian Games, which began that same day, will run through Dec. 13.
Its official opening ceremony will be held Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>Around 2,300 athletes from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, China, Hong
Kong, Macau, Mongolia and Guam will compete in 262 events encompassing 22
sports, making it the largest international multi-sport event ever held in Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese athletes will compete in a record 20 sports, according to Thomas Tsai,
president of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee.</P>
      <P>In the 2005 Macau EAG, Taiwan competed in 17 sports and came home with 12 gold
medals, 34 silvers and 26 bronzes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's National Communications Commission (NCC) on Wednesday delayed a
decision on controversial media company - Next Media's application to operate
television channels on the island.</P>
      <P>Next Media in mid August submitted an application to run five TV channelsVnews,
general information, movie, entertainment and sports.</P>
      <P>But the company's application has raised concerns after it became the target of
vehement protests last week from parents, educators and others for providing
easy-to-access animated video clips of news events, including sexual harassment
and violent crimes.</P>
      <P>Next Media's Web site started an animated news service in mid- November,
enabling readers of its affiliated Apple Daily newspaper to access the obscene
motion graphic news by simply scanning the bar code on the paper with a cell
phone.</P>
      <P>Next Media has since canceled the animated news section after being fined by the
Taipei City Government, which ordered schools and public libraries to cancel
subscriptions of the paper.</P>
      <P>But the media group's TV projects, TV channels for news and general information
in particular, are expected to come under more scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The NCC on Wednesday announced it is requiring the media corporation to present
more details of its operational plans.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, NCC spokesman Chen Cheng-chang revealed last week that Next
Media may not get approval for running TV news and general information channels,
although it is highly likely that the projects for movie, entertainment and
sports channels might be approved by the commission.</P>
      <P>NCC members decided, however, that they have no objections against the movie
channel plan, but they requested more details on how the media group plans to
operate the entertainment and sports channels. The commission will review
details of the three channels as a package.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the NCC has not ruled out the possibility of granting permission
to Next Media to run the three proposed channels, adding that the commission is
only requiring more details to clarify that the TV channels will not apply
similar methods in processing entertainment and sports news as Apple Daily did.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Internet fraud cases is rising rapidly in Taiwan, while telephone
fraud is on the decline, which indicates a shift in the mode of
telecommunications  used by swindlers, Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>From Jan. 1 through Nov. 22 this year, there were 17.32 percent more cases of
Internet fraud than in the same period last year, Jiang noted during an inter-
ministerial meeting held to discuss the possibility  of  cross-Taiwan  Strait
cooperation  to  fight telecommunications crimes.</P>
      <P>However, during the same period, there was a 16.73 percent drop in the number of
telephone fraud cases, he said.</P>
      <P>"There is a need for the authorities to work out measures to tackle the new form
of fraud," the minister said.</P>
      <P>According to Jiang, the decrease in the number of telephone fraud cases is
partly attributable to the launch of the "165" anti-fraud hotline by the
government to educate the public about the ploys used by criminals.</P>
      <P>Also helpful was the signing of a judicial assistance agreement between Taiwan
and China, he said.</P>
      <P>Since the agreement became effective in June this year, the two sides have
worked together to crack seven major criminal cases and arrest 210 suspects,
Jiang said.</P>
      <P>While a task force under the Cabinet has put forth various plans to address
rampant telephone fraud, it is important that these plans be implemented so as
to stop the harassment of the public by criminals, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the results of an online poll conducted Nov. 25-29 by the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, the issue of rampant telephone and
Internet scams was number two on a list of top ten public grievances, after high
housing prices in urban areas.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-based Fubon Financial Holding Co Ltd. on Wednesday declined to confirm a
foreign newswire report that it is among the bidders for Morgan Stanley's  stake
in the Chinese investment bank -- China International Capital Corporation Ltd.
(CICC) -- in a deal that could be worth more than US$1 billion.</P>
      <P>The company's General Manager Gong Tian-xin said he had "no comment, " in
response to local media reporters' queries about the matter, but hinted that the
deal is in progress.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley will sell its entire holdings of 34.3 percent in CICC, the
country's first and most profitable investment bank, seeking between US$1.2
billion and US$1.5 billion, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Other private equity firms that have joined the bidding include Bain Capital,
Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co and TPG,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Gong said that because the Chinese market is so large, Taiwanese banks trying to
break into the market should  focus on core businesses.</P>
      <P>He added that the company's move to increase its stake in China's Xiamen City
Commercial Bank in July is aimed at building on its strength in offering loans
and lines of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises and providing personal
investment advice. The goal is to gradually expand its business in China to
include banking, life and property insurance services, and securities and mutual
funds brokerage, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese banks seeking to venture into the Chinese market should choose the
second most prosperous cities because there are already a number of big foreign
banks in the most booming cities, Gong advised.</P>
      <P>The total assets of Chinese banks are eight times that of Taiwan's, the total
value of China's stock market is about five times that of Taiwan's, and China's
insurance market is about twice the size of Taiwan's, Gong said, citing a report
on the financial markets on the two sides.</P>
      <P>He also said that Fubon Financial Holding Co. would welcome any move by Chinese
banks to buy a stake in the island's second-largest financial services company
by market value.</P>
      <P>CICC,  China's  first joint venture investment  bank,  was established  in
August 1995 as a strategic partnership  among prestigious Chinese and
international financial institutions and corporations. CICC has a registered
capital of US$125 million, according to its Web site.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another report revealed that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China (ICBC), the world's most profitable bank, is in talks to acquire a 20
percent stake in Taiwan's Cathay Financial Holding Co. in a potential deal of
US$3 billion.</P>
      <P>If the deal goes through, it will be the first direct investment by a Chinese
bank in a Taiwan financial group.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial President Chen Tsu-pei declined to comment on the report.</P>
      <P>However, Premier Wu Den-yih, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der and Financial
Supervisory Commission Chairman Sean Chen have all said that the government has
no plans to relax the restrictions on Chinese investment in Taiwan's state-
related banks.</P>
      <P>Chen said that it is currently  illegal to allow Chinese investment in domestic
banks, but that Taiwan and China intend to allow their banks to gain footholds
on the other side in the initial stage of a cross-strait financial agreement.</P>

      <P>Tourism Bureau chief Janice Lai said Wednesday that the estimate of NT$30
billion in tourism revenues this year from Chinese tourists was not a hyper
forecast, but rather a careful calculation based on tourist consumption
behavior.</P>
      <P>Lai stressed the significance of having more Chinese tourist arrivals and
refuted an analytical report by the Institute for Business Development (IBD)
that stated the Tourism Bureau had overestimated the benefits.</P>
      <P>The IBD report released earlier on Wednesday indicates that tourism revenues
from Chinese visitors over the past months have been far below the expectations
of the Tourism Bureau, with the number of visitors and their level of spending
in Taiwan falling short of the estimates.</P>
      <P>Lai challenged the accuracy of the analytical report on grounds that it was
based on IBD interviews with tour guides and the observations of some IBD
researchers who posed as tour guides to collect information.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that it would be difficult for tour guides to obtain a broad
enough picture of the industry to make assessments. Besides, since Chinese
visitors in Taiwan do not always remain with their tour groups as one third of
the time is allowed for free movement, the tour guides might not be fully
informed on the tourists' activities and consumption behavior, she argued.</P>
      <P>The tourism chief said that the bureau's NT$30 billion estimate was based on a
survey conducted last year among 6,000 tourists, 440 of whom were from the
Chinese mainland. The Tourism Bureau has commissioned academic institutes to
conduct the sample survey at the airport every year, she added.</P>
      <P>Lai said there is no need for the Tourism Bureau to exaggerate to the travel
sector the benefits of having more Chinese tourist arrivals, and that tourism
exchanges between Taiwan and China have cultural as well as economic relevance.</P>

      <P>ROC Ambassador to Guatemala Adolfo Sun said the idea of offering training
classes on bamboo growing and high mountain vegetable cultivation to help
improve incomes in remote areas came from his visit in July to Huehuetenango
Province in the west of Guatemala.</P>
      <P>During the visit, he exchanged views with Congressman Mirza Judith Arreaga and

development.</P>
      <P>ROC embassy officials, the Taiwanese mission and a trade service delegation
continued to visit cities in the province to learn about the area's agriculture,

in Huehuetenango on behalf of Taiwan's Beverly and Victor Co. Oct. 30.</P>
      <P>The mission then offered high mountain vegetable cultivation classes in the
province's  Chimatenango vegetable cultivation training center and a bamboo
cultivation and forestation program at its Cuyuta bamboo artifact training

      <P>The United States is organizing a working group to visit Taiwan soon to inspect
Taiwan's passport security measures, as the U.S. is considering whether to offer
visa-free treatment to Taiwanese citizens, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. working group will consult with our government agencies in charge of
passport affairs on possible measures to further enhance passport security,"
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Lyushun said at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, the U.S. working group hopes to learn more about Taiwan's
processing of its passport applications and will request that Taiwan makes it
mandatory for its citizens to apply in person for passports to reduce the
possibility of irregularities.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is giving priority to the goal of securing
visa-free treatment within one year for Taiwan passport holders traveling to the
U.S. and European Union member countries, Shen told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>While the U.S. Department of State and Congress are basically open to the
proposal, he said, the U.S. Homeland Security Department is still reluctant to
give the green light as the specter of the 911 terrorist attacks still remains.</P>
      <P>"We need to make greater efforts to convince them that we have taken effective
steps to plug the loopholes  in the passport processing procedures," Shen said.</P>
      <P>He briefed lawmakers on the U.S. government's policy and stance toward Taiwan,
in the wake of President Barack Obama's recent visit to China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-U.S. relations will continue to move in a positive direction,  following
a recent briefing in Taipei by American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond F.
Burghardt on Obama's visit to China in November, Shen said.</P>
      <P>For one thing, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan will continue, Shen forecast.</P>
      <P>"While the U.S. may defer its decisions on some items, they will remain on the
evaluation list, " Shen said,  adding that the long-stalled talks under the
Taiwan-U.S.  Trade and Investment Framework Agreement will resume early next
year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, the United States will continue to support Taiwan's efforts

Wednesday with the Chunichi Dragons in Japan's Central League for an annual

million yen he was offered in 2009, a Japanese newspaper reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It took the Taiwanese left-handed pitcher only two years to secure a salary of

      <P>Two containers of oranges from Yunlin County headed for Beijing and Xiamen
Wednesday -- marking the first batch of a total of 980 metric tons of the fruit
that China ordered from the central Taiwan County.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin county government officials expressed the hope that Chinese customers
could purchase more of the fruit as its harvest season has just begun and will
run through January. They added that greater efforts will be made to diversify
market outlets in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produced about 254,000 metric tons of oranges every year in a total of
4,125 hectares of land, with half of the fruit being grown in Yunlin -- making
the county the island's largest producer of oranges.</P>

      <P>Taiwan farmers' overproduction of oranges creates a headache for the Cabinet-

      <P>Meanwhile, the COA is set to began purchasing oranges from local farmers next
week to help deal with a foreseen oversupply and stabilize the fruit's price in
retail markets.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said last week that the current market price for
oranges is between NT$7.5 and NT$11 per kilo, and by purchasing them at NT$13.5
per kilo, the government will help in the earnings of farmers.</P>
      <P>Oranges of inferior quality that the COA buys will be used to make organic
fertilizer, and a subsidy program has also been launched to urge farmers to
leave their land fallow, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Farmers agreeing to take part in the program are entitled to a subsidy of
NT$200,000 (US$6,150) for each hectare of land they leave fallow. Last year, 347
hectares of land were made fallow.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the COA plans to purchase 1,870 metric tons of oranges for

      <P>The United States is organizing a working group to visit Taiwan soon to inspect
Taiwan's passport security measures, as the U.S. is considering whether to offer
visa-free treatment to Taiwanese citizens, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. working group will consult with our government agencies in charge of
passport affairs on possible measures to further enhance passport security,"
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Lyushun said at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, the U.S. working group hopes to learn more about Taiwan's
processing of its passport applications and will request that Taiwan makes it
mandatory for its citizens to apply in person for passports to reduce the
possibility of irregularities.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is giving priority to the goal of securing
visa-free treatment within one year for Taiwan passport holders traveling to the
U.S. and European Union member countries, Shen told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>While the U.S. Department of State and Congress are basically open to the
proposal, he said, the U.S. Homeland Security Department is still reluctant to
give the green light as the specter of the 911 terrorist attacks still remains.</P>
      <P>"We need to make greater efforts to convince them that we have taken effective
steps to plug the loopholes  in the passport processing procedures," Shen said.</P>
      <P>He briefed lawmakers on the U.S. government's policy and stance toward Taiwan,
in the wake of President Barack Obama's recent visit to China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-U.S. relations will continue to move in a positive direction,  following

oranges is between NT$7.5 and NT$11 per kilo, and by purchasing them at NT$13.5
per kilo, the government will help in the earnings of farmers.</P>
      <P>Oranges of inferior quality that the COA buys will be used to make organic
fertilizer, and a subsidy program has also been launched to urge farmers to
leave their land fallow, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Farmers agreeing to take part in the program are entitled to a subsidy of
NT$200,000 (US$6,150) for each hectare of land they leave fallow. Last year, 347
hectares of land were made fallow.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the COA plans to purchase 1,870 metric tons of oranges for
shipments to China this season, up from 1,200 metric tons last year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It is time to introduce a water conservation campaign, as drastic climate
changes and environmental degradation are prolonging the drought season in the
Taiwan area, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At an inter-agency meeting, Chu instructed the relevant offices to double their
efforts to raise public awareness of the value of clean water and to highlight
the need for conservation of the resource as shortages could occur at any time.</P>
      <P>Chu gave a directive for the relevant offices to report before mid-December on
the water supply situation in southern Taiwan so that the government can decide
whether there is enough water for the first rice crop at the beginning of 2010,
or if it should advise the plantation of other crops that require less water.</P>
      <P>Similar reports on the water supply situation in northern and central Taiwan
should be presented by mid-January, he said.</P>
      <P>The vice premier also asked that Taiwan Water Corp. report soon on the water-
pumping systems scattered throughout southern Taiwan that can serve as a back-up
in the event of drought or water shortages early next year.</P>
      <P>Chu convened the meeting after Water Resources Agency Director Yang Wei-pu said
Monday that water reserves in reservoirs in southern Taiwan have fallen to
alarming levels as a result of low rainfall and buildups of silt.</P>
      <P>Water consumption in Taiwan is 274 liters per head per day, equivalent to
emptying Sun Moon Lake in 20 days, Yang said, adding that water shortages may
occur from early next year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu Chung-ming, director of the Global Change Research Center at
National Taiwan University, said that although typhoons this year brought
torrential rain to the island, this cannot avert the dry spell mainly because of
excessive water usage and failure to collect the rain water.</P>
      <P>"People from the south had better not to return to their homes for the upcoming
Chinese New Year holiday (which falls in February 2010) , " Liu said in an
interview with the United Daily News, suggesting that water shortages are just
around the corner.</P>
      <P>Quoting a research report compiled recently by his center, Liu said the number
of dry days in the southern city of Tainan have averaged 204 per year in the
past, but this year the number so far is 300.</P>
      <P>"The drought situation is becoming more serious," he said.</P>
      <P>He predicted that eastern Taiwan will have more wet days in years to come, while
central and southern Taiwan will become drier and drier.</P>
      <P>"People in western and southern Taiwan should prepare for droughts as the dry
days could increase by 50 per year in the future," Liu warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers move to revise law to ban animated crime reporting</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
12/03/09  13:28:49

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers, with the support of a civil group, is moving to revise a
series of laws to ban sensational animated news on television, Websites and in
other media.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulated China Times said Thursday that the Social Welfare Committee
and the Environment and Health Committee of the Legislative Yuan began debating
a proposal Wednesday to ban "any detailed description of tools and methods used
to commit crimes and suicides."</P>
      <P>In a response to the recent controversy over animated graphic news published by
the Apple Daily, the proposal will also prohibit "graphic animated news that
includes bloody or obscene images of violence, sex, or horror."</P>
      <P>In order to institute the ban, three acts that govern broadcast and television,
satellite broadcast and television, and children and teenagers welfare, will
have to be revised.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, who sponsored the proposal along with KMT
lawmakers Alex Hrong-tai Fai and Shyu Jong-shyoung, said the use of graphic
images to reconstruct crime stories serves only to reopen the wounds of the
victims and their family members.</P>
      <P>"It tramples on the privacy of the victims, debauches the society and goes
against the morals and ethics of journalism, " Hung was quoted in the China
Times as saying.</P>
      <P>She dismissed the idea of setting up a news rating system, saying it would not
solve the problem. "Action News, " as it is called by Apple Daily, is not at all
news, she added.</P>
      <P>"In order to prevent other media from following the lead of the Apple Daily, an
absolute ban should be imposed," Hung said.</P>
      <P>A similar proposal was submitted by the Children Welfare League, through
Kuomintang lawmakers Shyu Jong-shyoung, Huang Ho Tsai-feng and Lin Hung-chih,
and was also debated at the meeting.</P>
      <P>The Apple Daily's Action News is usually published on its Website and is also
accessible by mobile phone.</P>
      <P>After it copped two fines of NT$500,000 (US$15,547) each in two days, the
newspaper on Nov. 28 issued an apology and restricted access to its Action News.</P>
      <P>The fines were imposed by the Taipei City government on grounds that there were
no restrictions for minors, after the National Communications Commission (NCC)
said it could do nothing about the issue.</P>
      <P>Amid the controversy, the Apple Daily group's plans to set up a a TV company
suffered a setback, as the NCC on Wednesday returned its applications for three
television licenses.</P>
      <P>NCC Spokesman Chen Cheng-Chang was quoted by the China Times as saying that the
Apple Group's "operation proposal," which is part of the application to explain
how the TV programs will be presented, was too vague.</P>
      <P>"We haven't turned down the applications, but the Apple Daily should allay
public concerns by stating in the application how it plans to broadcast its
programs," Chen was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile a private watchdog, the Media Monitoring Alliance, said Wednesday in
its October Report that the Apple Daily is not the only paper that publishes
sensational news accompanied by graphics or pictures that disregard journalistic
principles.</P>
      <P>The alliance said the Apple Daily topped the list with 46 stories, followed by
the United Daily News with four, China Times with three, and Liberty Times with
three.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese fashion designer Johan Ku won the top prize Wednesday in the Avant-
Garde design category of a major fashion design competition in the U.S. for
emerging talent.</P>
      <P>Ku, owner of the Johan Ku Design Studio, won award in the 2009 Gen Art's Styles
International Design Competition with one of his 2004 designs -- a knitted one-
piece wool dress that highlights the delicacy of the yarn and displays creative
patterns.</P>
      <P>Ku, who is currently studying in London, returned to New York to attend the
award ceremony in midtown Manhattan Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>"I'm thrilled to bits, " Ku told the Central News Agency after receiving the
prize.</P>
      <P>The prize would serve as a stepping stone for him to access the global fashion
market, he said, adding that he looks forward to one day having his own brand
and finding the right investment partners.</P>
      <P>The 30-year-old, who graduated from Taiwan's Shu Te University with a first
degree in fashion design and is now in a graduate program at London's Central
Saint Martins School of Art and Design, expressed thanks to many people,
particularly his mother, whom he said "never tried to stop me from pursuing my
interests."</P>
      <P>Wenlan Chia, a renowned Taiwanese fashion designer in New York who was one of
the judges of the competition,  offered  her congratulations to Ku.</P>
      <P>"With his talent and perseverance, Ku is set to make his name in the global
fashion arena," Chia said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Formosan black bears with 'green style' enter stage</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/03/09  14:41:24</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Each of these three represents a unique quality in Taiwan -- an eye-catching
creativity and cultural learning institute, a fashion design house with a global
reputation, and the only local toy company authorized to make stuffed toys for
the Disney Corporation.</P>
      <P>All excel in their respective fields. However, they had not established any
links with each other until this fall, when they decided to do something no-one
has ever done before for the Formosan black bear, an endangered species
indigenous to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a unprecedented effort to promote a green lifestyle and wildlife protection,
Lilin Hsu, the founder and chairman of the Xue Xue Institute, decided to feature
the country's largest land animal as a soft toy and commissioned a young
Taiwanese team to come up with the design, using green materials.</P>
      <P>"In order to express a perspective about loving the Earth and supporting  a
green  lifestyle,  it is necessary  to consider mass-producing something in a
way that a commercial market can accept, " said Hsu, who is also well-known for
her successful management of a Taiwanese department store in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>Hsu noticed the work of the young design team Biaugust Creation Office at an
exhibition, when it introduced its "Nonlife Zoo" series of artworks featuring
species that are facing extinction.</P>
      <P>Searching out suitable materials for her idea, Hsu went to her old friend
Shiatzy Chen, a local fashion designer whose luxury brand was the first
Taiwanese fashion brand to enter the European market and which was also
described by the Asia Wall Street Journal as "the most popular Taiwanese fashion
brand."</P>
      <P>Chen donated four kinds of high quality fabrics to Hsu for the Formosan black
bear soft toys, which are stuffed with ecological polyester staple cotton.</P>
      <P>The limited edition of 800 of the toys, about 30 centimeters tall, are expected
to go on sale in December for NT$600 each.</P>
      <P>"They really look better and more creative than I would have thought, " said
Chen, admitting that her decades-long friendship with Hsu was one of the reasons
she was willing to support this cross-industry cooperation.</P>
      <P>Letting more people know about their green approach and creating a platform for
local young designers to showcase their work made Hsu's decision even more
meaningful, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen said she will not rule out the possibility cooperating with Hsu again if
the toys attract enough attention from the public.</P>
      <P>Hsu's first contact with her other partner in the venture -- leading toy maker
Hwa Harng Toys Co. -- was not as smooth.</P>
      <P>Hwa Harng, a toy company with a history of more than 30 years, is the only local
toy manufacturer authorized to make toys for the Disney Corporation, the
Japanese company that owns the rights to the anime character Doraemon, and a
Taiwanese convenience stores mascot.</P>
      <P>For Hwa Harng, Hsu's order was just too small, and it took Hsu a lot of effort
to persuade the company to accept her custom.</P>
      <P>"From a business point of view, it is not a good deal at all, " said Jim Chang,
sales manager at Hwa Harng, adding that they nevertheless made an exception for
Hsu, manufacturing her toys for no profit.</P>
      <P>Each of the toys will come packaged in a Tyvek paper bag, which is made of
strong polyethylene fiber that can be reused as a backpack or drawstring bag.</P>
      <P>"It is another way of promoting environmental protection, as it is a multiple-
use bag, " said Amy Wu, a Xue Xue manager.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Formosan black bears, Xue Xue will also launch another six
larger stuffed toys -- a Formosan macaque, a giraffe, a chicken, a cow, an
elephant and a deer -- which will be sold along with a cup for NT$1,280 each,
with a production run of 360 for each toy.</P>
      <P>The toys made a shining debut when they first went on show at the Xue Xue
headquarters in October.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, high-ranking officials from Hong Kong Disney decided to take
all of them when they visited Xue Xue and have been in negotiation with Xue Xue
over distribution rights in Hong Kong and China.</P>
      <P>"Strength sometimes comes from a group, " said Hsu, expressing optimism about
cooperating with more partners in the future to promote a green lifestyle.</P>

      <P>Taipei is among the 10 most expensive locations in Asia for international
assignees, after Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagaya, Kobe, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul,
Beijing and Singapore, according to a survey conducted by the consultant ECA
International.</P>
      <P>ECA International released a survey report Wednesday on cost of living in major
cities in the world. Many international corporations use the biannual report as
reference in calculating assignment salaries.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Luanda in Angola remained the most expensive city in
the world for two consecutive years 2008-2009, while four cities in Japan --
Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya and Kobe -- along with Oslo and Stavanger in Norway,
Copenhagen in Demark, and Geneva and Zurich in Switzerland were listed among the
top 10.</P>
      <P>In Asia, with the strong yen outweighing the impact of deflation in the Japanese
capital, Tokyo maintained its position as the most expensive location. The
Korean capital Seoul moved up to seventh place in 2009, while Taipei and
Kaohsiung fell in the rankings this year to 10th and 15th, respectively, as a
result of declining prices.</P>
      <P>Taipei's ranking in the world was 99th, as compared with 78th in 2008, and
Kaohsiung's ranking in 2009 was 138th, dropping from 99th the previous year.</P>
      <P>Although prices have generally remained stable, exchange rate fluctuations have
contributed the most to changes in the cost of living for international
assignees over the past year, according to ECA International.</P>

purchased by assignees in over 390 locations worldwide.</P>

      <P>Officials from St. Vincent and Grenadines (SVG), one of Taiwan's Caribbean
allies, called on companies in Taiwan Thursday to invest in their country and
explore its wide range of business opportunities in areas ranging from
information communications technology (ICT), to renewable energy and tourism.</P>
      <P>The delegation from Invest SVG, a government investment promotion agency, made
the appeal at a seminar in Taipei, saying that SVG could serve as springboard
for Taiwanese companies to tap into the markets of the Caribbean, Latin American
and North America.</P>
      <P>"Don't think of St. Vincent and the Grenadines as your only market, think of the
world as your market and St. Vincent and Grenadines as your access point," said
Cleo Huggins, executive director of Invest SVG.</P>
      <P>Huggins said the delegation's visit is aimed at extending the longstanding
relationship between her country and Taiwan, attracting foreign direct
investment from Taiwan and helping Taiwanese companies explore business
opportunities in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, which she described as having a
"strong, vibrant and growing" investment climate.</P>
      <P>It is an excellent time for Taiwan to capitalize on the investment opportunities
in a wide range of business sectors such as agro-processing,  light
manufacturing,  international  financial services, ICT industries and tourism
development in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, according to Huggins.</P>
      <P>The country has a sound regulatory framework, political and economic stability,
high educational standards and a skilled labor force of 63,000 people, and
offers various attractive incentives from tax exemption to freedom to repatriate
funds and the right to own property, she added.</P>
      <P>Shirla Francis, director of Invest SVG and Permanent Secretary of the Ministry
of Telecommunications of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, said that Taiwan, with
its world reputation for a strong ICT industry, should explore business
opportunities in SVG in areas such as development of computer applications for
both the public and private sectors, mobile phones repairs, computer
programming, management of information systems and IT security and management.</P>
      <P>"ICT is the platform on which sustainable economic development is attainable, as
it acts as an enabler in all sectors of the economy, and SVG recognizes that
partnerships with our friends can help us achieve an sustainable economy,"
Francis said.</P>
      <P>"I hope the businesses in Taiwan will see the opportunities that SVG, as a small
Caribbean island, has to offer. I do warmly invite you to explore some of those
opportunities," she added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and SVG have had unbroken diplomatic ties for 29 years.</P>

will hold a ceremony on Dec. 5 to honor families within its foster care service
for their contribution to sheltering children who are victims of domestic
violence and other forms of abuse.</P>
      <P>"The foster family recognition ceremony will be a time for sharing many stories
of love," the charity said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>Since 1991, World Vision Taiwan has been operating foster care services, on
commission by the Taipei City Department of Social Welfare, to provide safe
temporary homes for thousands of abandoned or abused children.</P>
      <P>World Vision reports show that in 2008, abuse, neglect, and domestic violence
were the main reasons for putting children into foster care.</P>
      <P>Therefore, foster families play an indispensable role in helping to protect
children, World Vision Taiwan said.</P>
      <P>It related the story of Xiao An, a victim of domestic violence who was also
raped in her own home. Xiao An was later moved to a foster home, where she still
felt dirty and often hurt herself, the charity  reported.  However,  her foster
mother has given her unconditional love and has consoled and cared for her in
her darkest hours, it added.</P>
      <P>"My foster family is the sanctuary in my life," Xiao An was quoted as saying.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih instructed the Executive Yuan Thursday to establish a central
command to stem the spread of dengue fever.</P>
      <P>Wu gave a directive for Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang to
head the task force, which will be called the Central Epidemics Command Center
against Dengue Fever.</P>
      <P>The premier gave the directives in the wake of the country's first fatal case of
dengue hemorrhagic fever this year, which occurred in November and amid worries
that the dengue situation has escalated in Taiwan, particularly in the southern
counties of Kaohsiung and Pingtung.</P>
      <P>"It's quite rare for dengue fever to intensify despite the fact that it is
almost winter and low temperatures are not conducive to spread of the disease, "
Wu said during a regular Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>He instructed the DOH to find out why the situation has escalated and to
implement a monitoring system that would enable local governments to deal with
the problem in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>The recent fatality was a 52-year-old woman surnamed Lee from Pingtung City, who
was a polio patient with a history of heart disease and blood clots. She
developed a fever, headache, nausea and vomiting around late November and died
on Nov. 27 of internal bleeding caused by dengue hemorrhagic fever.</P>
      <P>Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection that causes a severe flu- like illness, and
sometimes a potentially lethal complication called dengue hemorrhagic fever.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has reported seven cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and more than 600
cases of regular dengue fever cases so far this year, according to the Centers
for Disease Control.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The mayor of the city that will host the fourth round of negotiations between
Taiwan and China on Dec. 21 questioned Thursday the appropriateness of setting
up a protest zone to accommodate demonstrators during that time.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Thursday it's not a well-conceived plan, and that
its constitutionality is questionable.</P>
      <P>"City Hall has no plans to set up such a zone, " Hu said, in direct opposition
to an announcement made Wednesday by Ma Shao-chang, deputy secretary-general of
the Straits Exchange Foundation, the semi-official body that handles
negotiations with China in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>"I do not know whose idea is it or who is working on such a plan," Hu added.</P>
      <P>According to law, the site of a demonstration should be chosen by the protestors
and is subject to approval by City Hall, Hu said.</P>
      <P>"It is unusual to set up a demonstration zone before anyone has applied for
permission to hold a protest," he added. "Are the authorities willing to violate
the Constitution in order to limit the people's freedom to stage
demonstrations?"</P>
      <P>Ma Shao-chang said Wednesday that the planned protest zone will be able to
accommodate 60,000 people, and is big enough for different groups that might
like to express their opinions during the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Ma did not disclose the exact location of the protest zone, but the United Daily
News said Thursday it would be in a lot across the street from the Windsor Hotel
where the Chinese delegation will be staying.</P>
      <P>The paper said the lot, as well as the hotel, belong to the Pou Chen Group.</P>
      <P>The lot is about 60 meters away from the hotel, well within seeing and hearing
distance, but is beyond striking distance for stone-throwing, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>It will allow for protestors' voices to be heard by the Chinese delegation but
not for any disruptions of the negotiations, the paper cited a source as saying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the city's police chief Hu Mu-yuan said Thursday that people who
intend to hold a protest should first seek permission from the police, a
statement that refuted a media report that protestors may demonstrate freely in
the protest zone.</P>
      <P>"Applications should be filed six days before the demonstration," he said,
citing the Assembly and Parade Act.</P>
      <P>However, he expressed doubts over the suitability of the lot mentioned by the
United Daily News, saying it is too big and that its surface is uneven and
covered with rocks.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-hih said that he will ask the SEF to discuss with the Taichung
city government on issues related to proposed protest zone.</P>
      <P>In order to finalize the details of the negotiations, a Taiwan team led by SEF
Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian will depart for Fuzhou, Fujian Province on Dec. 9
for talks with their Chinese counterparts from the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation for the fourth round of cross-strait negotiations will be
led by ARATS President Chen Yunlin whose visit to Taiwan in November 2008 for
the second round of talks in Taipei was marred by protests.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday: CHINA TIMES: Accurate reporting produces journalistic freedom</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times recently published a front-page photo that it claimed  was  of
a recent  presidential  motorcade  that  had inconvenienced the public.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office responded by saying that the road pictured has no
shoulder and that the motorcade was one of former President Chen Shui-bian's,
not President Ma Ying-jeou's.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the newspaper said defiantly that it had identified the photo as a
composite image and it refused to apologize. We believe this practice is a gross
violation of journalistic ethics. Even though the media cannot guarantee that
all its news stories would be factual, or that the facts would be fully
verified, it has to give the assurance that it is reporting the truth. It should
not publish photos that it knows are not accurate and simply caption them as
composite images.</P>
      <P>We support the response of the subject of the story. The Presidential Office
chose to make a public clarification, but has not threatened any lawsuits.
Instead, it has asked only for an apology.</P>
      <P>The media should uphold journalistic ethics and should not try to create an
environment that will induce government intervention. Media organizations that
report the news accurately are the ones that will enjoy the greatest
journalistic freedom. LIBERTY TIMES:</P>
      <P>Japanese envoy's resignation highlights President Ma's China-leaning nature</P>
      <P>Japan's representative to Taiwan Masaki Saito tendered his resignation recently,
ostensibly for personal reasons, but it is obvious that he resigned because he
could not perform his duties in Taiwan as he was being shunned by the Ma
administration. Saito has been given the cold shoulder by the administration
since he commented in May during a speech that "Taiwan's status remains
uncertain."</P>
      <P>His resignation will remove the thorn in the side of the Ma administration and
will delight China, but the big losers will be the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Japan relinquished its sovereignty over Taiwan and Penghu under the San
Francisco Peace Treaty, but did not transfer the islands to anyone. Under
international law, Taiwan's sovereignty belongs to its people.</P>
      <P>The Chiang Kai-shek army only came to Taiwan to accept the surrender of the
Japanese army after World War II. It moved its seat of government to Taiwan in
1949 after its defeat by the Chinese Communists in a civil war.</P>
      <P>Thus, Taiwan's official name is the Republic of China, although the sovereignty
of Taiwan is totally unrelated to that of the ROC. Saito's statement simply
reflected that fact.</P>
      <P>President Ma advocates the fallacy of "ultimate unification," and it is only
natural that he would resent Saito's views on the issue. APPLE DAILY:
Encouraging crime</P>
      <P>Sixteen years ago, a man killed his girlfriend and dumped her body. He was
sentenced to two years, nine months and 11 days in prison.</P>
      <P>Now, he has killed again. This time, he shot his girlfriend at close range, in
gangland style execution, thinking that he will be given another lenient
sentence.</P>
      <P>If he had been imprisoned long enough for the first murder, he might not have
acted so rashly again.</P>
      <P>He thinks people's lives are cheap, so he killed again.</P>
      <P>We believe there were at least three accomplices in this crime -- the other two
being the judge and the parole officer who showed this man mercy 16 years ago.
UNITED DAILY NEWS: No more using ECFA to tear apart Taiwan</P>
      <P>The most serious problem in Taiwan is division. It is divided on various issues,
ranging from national identity, cross-strait policy to ethnicities. No wonder,
even the disgraced former President Chen Shui-bian during his term quoted the
late U.S. President Abraham Lincoln by saying "A house divided against itself
can not stand."</P>
      <P>A pluralistic society will naturally have different voices, but if there is
constant confrontations and divisions, then it will "not stand." For over two
decades, local politicians have tried to create a wedge among the public.</P>
      <P>It has created a polarized society. Taiwanese versus mainlanders, Love Taiwan
versus not love Taiwan, blue camp versus green camp, southern Taiwan versus
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mow a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement with China has proven to
be a new way to tear apart the nation.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has used the issue to divide
the nation into agricultural cities and counties and those that are not, and
into those who are for the agreement and those who are not.</P>
      <P>The DPP has made the ECFA bashing its major platform. DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-
wen said during a campaign rally that the Ma administration has done nothing
that has helped or benefited the people during the past 18 months.</P>
      <P>She said that the signing of the ECFA will allow Chinese products to enter
Taiwan tariff free, and that the agriculture sector will bear the brunt of it.</P>
      <P>The DPP has endeavored to turn a complex issue into a simplified concept of the
Ma administration's "tilting toward China and selling out Taiwan."</P>
      <P>We think that the DPP only knows how to oppose without coming up with its own
answers to the problems faced by Taiwan. When the ASEAN plus one (China) is put
into effect next month, Taiwan's major industries will immediately face unequal
tariff treatment in China. Does the party know that if these major industries
lose their competitive edge, not only will Taiwan's agricultural sector be
impacted, the entire nation could face a major crisis.</P>
      <P>COMMERCIAL TIMES: Is Taiwan ready to seize the opportunities unleashed by China
in its economic transformation?</P>
      <P>With the closer trade exchanges that are taking place between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, more and more Chinese trade delegations are visiting Taiwan.
Among them was one led by Lou Qinjian, deputy chief of China's Ministry of
Industry and Information Technology.</P>
      <P>Lou said before his departure from Taiwan earlier this week that the two sides
could work on trade opportunities in five sectors -- LCD,  semiconductor,
telecommunications, green energy and cloud computing.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, which enjoys an edge in manufacturing technology in the
telecommunications sector,  it will be an opportunity and a challenge.
Government agencies should also ease the relevant regulations so that Taiwan
will not be marginalized in the fierce market competition.</P>
      <P>But a more important question is whether Taiwan is ready to seize the rare trade
opportunities? ECONOMIC DAILY NEWS: Only one out of 10 public grievances hard to
root out</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih asked the Executive Yuan's Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission to list 15 public grievances and find the top 10 through a
survey.</P>
      <P>The result showed that high housing prices in urban areas top the list.</P>
      <P>The other complaints are rampant telephone or online fraud, difficulty in
landing jobs and the unemployment problem, high consumer prices, drug abuse, too
many traffic tickets and the strict vehicle towing policy, unsafe nurseries,
unclean public toilets, lax food safety inspections, and illegal use of arcades,
roads, or parking lots.</P>
      <P>We believe that it is an incomprehensive approach to choose 10 out of the 15,
and that it is easy for the government to solve the problems if it has the
determination.</P>
      <P>But we believe the real thorny question is drug abuse, which we believe has to
do with the collusion between Taiwan's gangsters and politicians and
businessmen.</P>
      <P>The government has so far adopted an appeasement attitude, and has never come up
with affective measures.</P>
      <P>If the Wu Cabinet can solve the other nine problems, and then pull out all stops
to crack down on the gangsters, then it will be a boon to the nation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is planning to visit Taiwan's diplomatic allies in the
South Pacific region in early 2010 and attend a Taiwan-South Pacific leaders'
summit, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>President Ma was originally scheduled to visit the South Pacific and attend the
leaders' summit in the Solomon Islands in October. The plan, however, was
canceled due to Typhoon Morakot, which walloped southern and eastern Taiwan in
August. The worst typhoon to hit Taiwan in 50 years killed more than 600 people.</P>
      <P>"Climate change will be one of the topics expected to be discussed by President
Ma and his South Pacific counterparts during the summit," said Bau-shuan Ger,
deputy director-general of the MOFA Department of East Asian and Pacific
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Climate change is an important issue for the South Pacific and all Taiwan's six
allies in that region will be represented at the next conference of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change slated to be held in Copenhagen,
Denmark from Dec. 7-18 this year, Ger said.</P>
      <P>Other issues of mutual concern, including agriculture, medical services and
vocational training, are also expected to be on the summit's agenda, Ger said.</P>
      <P>Heads-of-state of all Taiwan's six diplomatic allies in the South Pacific
region, namely the Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Kiribati, Nauru
and Tuvalu, are expected to attend the summit, whose exact date has yet to be
decided, according to Ger.</P>
      <P>The leadership summit will be the third of its kind since Sept. 4, 2006, when it
was first held in Palau, and Taiwan was represented by then President Chen Shui-
bian.</P>
      <P>The upcoming trip will be President Ma's first visit to the South Pacific since
he took office in May 2008. He previously visited the Solomon Islands in 1997 in
his capacity as a professor.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Hon Hai Group has signed a deal to buy U.S. computer giant Dell's
factory in Poland, further expanding its operation territory in Europe, Middle
East and Africa (EMEA).</P>
      <P>Following the transfer, Dell will become a customer of Foxconn, a division of
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., sourcing its desktops, notebooks, servers and
storage systems for EMEA customers from the Lodz factory in central Poland,
according to company announcements.</P>
      <P>In a statement published late Wednesday, Hon Hai said PCE Paragon Solutions
Kft., one of its units, has signed a contract to buy the facility with Dell
Global B.V. and Dell International Holdings VIII B.V..</P>
      <P>Financial details of the transfer were not disclosed and the agreement is
subject to all the usual European Union regulatory approval and closing
procedures. All employees at the Polish facility will keep their jobs and their
positions.</P>
      <P>After the deal is completed, industry analysts expect Hon Hai will be able to
receive more orders from Dell, including the orders for making Dell's notebooks
in 2011, threatening other Taiwanese outsourcing factories for Dell, such as
Lite-On Technology, Pegatron Corp., Wistron Corp., and Quanta Computer.</P>
      <P>Yuanta Securities analyst Chen Feng-feng noted that as the factory in Poland has
been under gross profit margin pressure, the transfer will have limited impact
on Hon Hai's profit in 2010.</P>
      <P>UBS Securities is more optimistic about Hon Hai's performance next year. It
issued a abuyrating on Hon Hai Wednesday, and raised its target price for the
stock in 2010 to NT$184, from the previous target price of NT$144.</P>
      <P>The deal with Dell is the latest acquisition launched by Hon Hai Group, the
world's largest contract electronics maker, after it announced in November that
its affiliate Innolux will merge with Chi Mei Optoelectronics to bid for the
liquid crystal display (LCD) industry's top position, and September's decision
of buying a Sony's LCD TV assembly plant in Mexico.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai shares were at NT$138.5 when the market closed Thursday, up NT$0.5 from
the previous day's close.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih has directed the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) to formulate employment promotion measures with the goal of
creating 99,000 jobs next year, government spokesman Su Jun-pin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu said at a regular Cabinet meeting that as unemployment is a lagging indicator
of the economy, the government should treat boosting employment one of its top
priorities, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Wu said he has therefore asked the country's top economic planning agency in
collaboration with related agencies to map out the 2009 employment promotion
measures with the goal of creating 99,000 jobs, since the 2008-2009 Short-term
Employment Promotion Measures will conclude at the end of this year and about
45,000 temporary jobs offered under the program will end by that time, Su said
after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Considering that about 80 percent of the short-term employees need some
employment services, the premier also asked the Council of Labor Affairs  and
related government  agencies  to strengthen employment consultation and
vocational training services in a bid to reduce unemployment and meet the needs
of employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that related  agencies  should adjust  their employment-boosting
measures in keeping with the central government's policies to stimulate economic
growth and increase employment over the next year.</P>
      <P>For example, they should chart plans for strengthening vocational training to
improve employment in six key emerging industries that are slated for priority
development -- tourism, health care, biotechnology, green energy, cultural and
creative industries, and high-end agriculture, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said that Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu will convene an inter-
ministerial meeting to boost employment during the period around the Lunar New
Year as the local job market would likely still be struggling because the
economy has not shown any signs of a strong rebound.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at the meeting after being briefed by the CEPD on the
current employment situations  and the responding strategies.</P>

      <P>To help minimize the impact of a planned Taiwan-China trade pact on some local
businesses, the Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) will earmark NT$300 million (US$9.23 million) next year to serve
that end, the bureau announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it has managed to come up with NT$100 million in funds to
finance a set of auxiliar measures worked out by the MOEA with an aim to help
some sectors overcome possible negative effects arising from an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China and free trade agreements
(FTAs) with other countries.</P>
      <P>Twelve traditional sectors such as bedding, towel, ceramics and footwear, are
widely believed to be most affected once the ECFA and FTAs take effect.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that it will allocate an additional NT$300 million from April
next year to subsidize the auxiliar measures over the long term, which include
setting up a certification system for locally produced fine-quality goods and
creating an emblem for high-end quality products.</P>
      <P>A task force will also be formed and hold meetings periodically to assess the
best means to help affected sectors in industrial transformation or
competitiveness upgrading, it added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was reported that ECFA-related issues will be discussed in the
fourth round of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations when top negotiators from
Taiwan and China meet later this month in Taichung City, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According  to Ministry of Economic Affairs officials,  the government hopes that
formal ECFA negotiations can start by January 2010, when representatives of the
two sides will exchange lists of products they hope will be covered by an early
harvest program under the trade deal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government hopes the agreement to be signed as soon as possible in the
face of increased economic integration in Asia, evidenced by an "ASEAN plus one"
arrangement which will take effect early next year and by an "ASEAN plus three"
pact by 2013.</P>

      <P>Thirty visually-impaired people peddled on a two-day cycling tour Thursday to
challenge themselves in a celebration of the International Day of Persons with
Disabilities.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Taichung City Society for the Welfare of the Visually
Impaired,  the event  is aimed  at encouraging  the visually-impaired to walk
out into the world and embrace society through cycling.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by one volunteer each, the participants left for a 70 km two-day
bicycling trip Thursday from Taichung City's Guang Fu Elementary School. Their
destination is a leisure farm in Taichung County's Tachia township.</P>
      <P>"Blind people should always keep a healthy mindset and be brave to walk out so
as to gain assistance and care from others," said Liu Ching, chairman of the
Taichung City Society for the Welfare of the Visually Impaired.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Chia-chi, deputy mayor of Taichung City, presented a grant to the
visually-impaired participants and praised their courage in challenging
themselves, as it would help raise public awareness about the welfare of people
with visual disabilities.</P>
      <P>He also vowed to build Taichung City into a barrier-free environment "full of
love."</P>
      <P>Chen Mei-huei, one of the participants in the cycling event, expressed gratitude
to those who have helped her and said that she joined the event not only for
health reasons, but also to expand her circle of friends.</P>
      <P>International Day of Persons with Disabilities, observed on Dec. 3 each year,
was designated by the United Nations in 1992. This year's theme is "Making the
Millennium Development Goals Inclusive: empowerment persons with disabilities
and their communities around the world."</P>
      <P>Noting that of Taiwan's 23 million population, there are over one million people
live with disabilities, Premier Wu Den-yih said at a Cabinet-level meeting
Thursday that the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) should speed up building Taiwan
into a barrier-free island and establish a long-term health care system to look
after the needs of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI,  under the government whitepaper on promotion of the
rights and welfare of persons with disabilities, the agency has mapped out 348
mid-term and long term action plans to cover the needs of physically-challenged
people, including long term health care insurance, vocational training and
employment services.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Ministry of Justice's (MOJ's) review of the two United  Nations
human rights treaties  that cleared  Taiwan's legislative floor this March --
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights -- Wu said all government
agencies should regularly hold seminars on human rights to internalize the ideas
of these two covenants as part of the governments administrative culture and to
help civil servants learn to respect the rights of the people.</P>
      <P>"Human rights can never just be a beautiful word, but rather something that can
be felt by the people," the premier said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou requested the MOJ in July to review and revise laws and
regulations that were not in accordance with the two U.N. human rights
covenants.</P>
      <P>According to the MOJ, a total of 16 government agencies and 219 laws and
regulations have yet to meet the requirements of these two covenants and the
ministry will report to Ma before Dec. 10 Human Rights Day and announce the
revised regulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health authorities urged to re-examine HIV/AIDS therapy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group fighting for the rights of HIV/AIDS patients urged the health
authorities Thursday to re-examine the HIV anti-viral therapy in light of the
treatment's declining efficacy.</P>
      <P>"More than 10 years after highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was
introduced into Taiwan, we have discovered that the panacea might be losing its
magic, " said Yang Hui-chung, a director of the Persons with HIV/AIDS Rights
Advocacy Association of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey conducted by the association among a group of 1,058 HIV-
positive individuals between July 25 and Nov. 20 reveal that 321 of the
respondents  have been provided  with antiretroviral medication.</P>
      <P>Among 163 respondents who have taken the drugs for at least one year, 35, or
21.5 percent, saw their CD4 count register under 350 cells per cubic millimeter
of blood, and in 22 of the patients, or 13.5 percent, HIV remained detectable in
their blood.</P>
      <P>This indicates a failure of the therapy to produce satisfactory results, despite
long-time treatment, Yang said.</P>
      <P>CD4 cells, which help to identify, attack and destroy specific bacteria, fungi
and viruses that affect the body, are a major target for HIV. The CD4 count
decreases with HIV disease progression.</P>
      <P>The CD4 count is used in combination with HIV viral load to determine the
progression and outlook of the disease and to monitor the effectiveness of
treatment.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that one in every four patients who has received HAART has
experienced severe or very severe side effects, while one in six has had his or
her work and living patterns seriously or very seriously affected.</P>
      <P>One HIV-infected man who contracted the virus more than 10 years ago said that
all three categories of antiretroviral drugs currently available in Taiwan are
showing poor results because HIV has become resistant.</P>
      <P>He said that over the years, the drug combinations for his treatment have been
changed more than 10 times and he has had to endure various side effects,
including severe diarrhea.</P>
      <P>He urged the Department of Health (DOH) and the Bureau of National Health
Insurance to speed up the pace of introducing new antiretroviral drugs into
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I want to live. All I ask for is basic life-saving drugs that will allow me to
continue to survive," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang suggested that the DOH advance the timing for the beginning of
therapy for HIV-positive people in order to increase the treatment's efficacy.</P>
      <P>According to guidelines set by the DOH, therapy should be initiated only when an
HIV-infected person registers a CD4 count of under 200 cells per cubic
millimeter of blood.</P>
      <P>But Yang  said  Taiwan  should  follow  the World  Health Organization's
recommendation and provide patients with the therapy earlier, at 350 cells per
cubic millimeter of blood.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, the Taiwan Lourdes Association -- a Catholic organization serving
people living with HIV/AIDS -- called the authorities' attention to the long-
term care for HIV/AIDS patients, as the antiretroviral therapy has helped
prolong the life of these patients.</P>
      <P>Due to their weakened  immune  systems,  many HIV-positive individuals  also
suffer from other chronic diseases  such as hepatitis, hypertension, diabetes,
metabolic arthritis, depression and human papillomavirus infection, the
association noted.</P>
      <P>Official statistics show that as of October, 18,815 HIV/AIDS cases had been
recorded in Taiwan, 15,533 of whom are still surviving.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that he will not intervene, but will fully
support prosecutors in probing vote-buying allegations in relation to the
Saturday's elections for county magistrates and city mayors.</P>
      <P>Ma said as long as there is suspicions of bribery, the prosecution authorities
must investigate, no matter which party or candidate is involved.</P>
      <P>Cracking down on election bribery did not just start now, said Ma, adding that
he also took it seriously when he was the Minister of Justice over 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>However, as bribery cases still exist, Ma said a more aggressive approach on
probing vote-buying allegations should be taken. He hopes that all voters can
cooperate to eliminate unfair elections.</P>
      <P>Among suspected bribery and violence cases reported to prosecutors' offices
throughout the country, 60 suspects having been indicted and 98 taken into
custody as of Dec. 2, according to figures provided by the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said on the same day that he was pleased about the Justice
Ministry's performance on cracking down against suspected bribery cases without
distinction of party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) 's legislative
whip, Wang Sing-nan, said at a press conference that the upcoming election is
the most severe one in terms of vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Wang quoted the media's reports in saying that candidates have been offering
bribes ranging from NT$500 to NT$30,000 per person for voters to support them.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung County, the bribes were reported to be NT$500 per person, and in the
outlying county of Kinmen and Lienchiang, the bribes were reportedly as high as
NT$30,000 per person, Wang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10,000 employees of the state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower)
protested Thursday in front of the Presidential Office, demanding better
retirement welfare and company restructuring.</P>
      <P>The protesters, organized by the company labor union, demanded that the
government compensate retirees for losses incurred due to the enforcement of the
Labor Pension Act in 2005 and allow company retirees to enjoy better pension
terms under the Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>The employees also raised the issue that for many years the government-owned
company's organization has failed to be in line with reality, recruiting many
people as laborers but putting them to work as office clerks. Pension welfare
packages for clerks are much better than those for laborers, according to the
union.</P>
      <P>As a government enterprise, Taipower has a peculiar company organization with
about 70 percent of the employees -- around 19,000 -- enjoying dual capacities
as government functionaries as well as employees of business or industrial
establishments.</P>
      <P>Under the Labor Standards Law, with the enforcement of the National Pension Act
in January 2008, the lump-sum benefits formerly paid out to a retired laborer
upon death, disability or old age has been converted to a monthly annuity at an
income replacement ratio of 1. 55 percent, with old-age benefits available in
principle from age 60 to anyone who has been enrolled in the plan for 15 years.</P>
      <P>Since government functionaries upon retirement are entitled only to a monthly
annuity at an income replacement ratio of 0.65 percent, many Taipower employees
have expected that they will be able to enjoy better terms as retired  laborers.
Employees  of other state enterprises have also made similar petitions.</P>
      <P>The Commission of National Corporations under the Ministry of Economic  Affairs
has convened  meetings with other government agencies, including the Ministry of
Finance and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, to
figure out the financial cost of allowing all 42,000 employees of state
enterprises with dual capacities to be covered as laborers.</P>
      <P>No decision has been made due to objections from the Council of Labor Affairs,
which is concerned about the possibility that the already heavily burdened Labor
Pension Fund would go bankrupt if such provisions were made.</P>

      <P>A civic initiative that calls for a referendum on U.S. beef imports will be
submitted to the Central Election Commission (CEC) next week following the
completion of a first-stage signature drive, an organizer said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A total of 206,880 signatures have already been collected for the initiative,
which demands a re-opening of talks with Washington on U.S. beef imports,
according to Hsieh Tien-jen, chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, which is
leading the movement.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged consumers who have not signed the petition to take part in the
second phase of the signature drive, in which the foundation hopes to collect
1.2 million signatures.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington signed a protocol Oct. 22 under which Taiwan agreed to
lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and certain other beef products, including
ground beef and beef offal, sparking a huge public outcry.</P>
      <P>Civic groups led by the Consumers' Foundation and politicians contend that
allowing the entry of products that are considered at high risk of spreading
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, could endanger the health
of local consumers.</P>
      <P>With their appeals for re-opening Taiwan-U.S. beef talks having been rejected by
the government, the groups decided to push for a referendum to allow the people
a say on the issue.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's referendum law, a referendum proposal must pass two thresholds to
be accepted. In the initial stage, signatures from 0.5 percent, or 86,000, of
the 17.32 million eligible voters in the last presidential election must be
collected, a threshold that has already been met by the civic groups.</P>
      <P>If a referendum screening committee finds that the proposed referendum conforms
to legal guidelines, the referendum's sponsors then need to collect signatures
of endorsement from 5 percent of the voters, or 860,000 signatures, for the
question to be put to a referendum.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih and Emile Shen, Minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs,
joined Taichung Mayor Jason Hu Thursday at the groundbreaking of the Taichung
Metropolitan Opera House on the west side of the city.</P>
      <P>Wu said the opera house, which will accommodate a main auditorium with 2,011

one of the most unique architectural structures in Asia when it is completed at
the end of 2013.</P>

      <P>The Taichung city council approved a revised construction budget plan last year.
The construction cost is estimated at NT$3.57 billion (around US$110 million),
of which NT$1.78 billion will come from the central government and NT$1.79
billion will be raised by the local government.</P>
      <P>Although the city government was planning to adopt an "OT" (operation and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced Thursday a new rule to partially
replace the previous "325" guideline for schools nationwide to follow as part of
the government's efforts to stem cluster infections of influenza A(HIN1) among
students.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, the new "814" rule requires that individual students
who have flu-like symptoms take days off if 80 percent of the students at the
school have been vaccinated and have developed immunity against swine flu.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began a national swine flu immunization program Nov. l, with people
entitled to one free shot in order of priority, starting with typhoon-affected
victims, medical personnel in charge of disease control and prevention, and
pregnant women.</P>
      <P>They were followed by toddlers and preschool children, seriously ill patients,
elementary, junior and senior high school students, individuals in the 19 to 24
age bracket and those over 25 years of age at high risk of cardiopulmonary
disease.</P>
      <P>Next to be vaccinated were healthy people in the 25-49 age bracket and those
between 50 and 64 years of age.</P>
      <P>Based on the "325" guidelines published Aug. 18 by the Central Epidemics Command
Center under the Cabinet-level Department of Health, classes at kindergartens,
primary schools and junior and senior high schools, as well as cram schools and
day-care centers, must be closed for five days to prevent cluster infections if
any two students in the same class are diagnosed with H1N1 within a period of
three days.</P>
      <P>The MOE made the change on the grounds that the antibody against the virus will
develop 14 days after vaccination against the HIN1 virus, ministry officials
said.</P>
      <P>Schools covered by the "814" rule will no longer be subject to the "325"
guidelines.</P>
      <P>Following an inspection of an elementary school in Taipei County later Thursday,
Education Minister Wu Ching-chi said the spread of influenza A(HIN1) has slowed
at schools around the country after the government's immunization program kicked
in Nov. 1, with elementary, junior and senior high school students getting shots
from Nov. 16-30.</P>
      <P>Wu said the number of class closures had dropped in the last week, a sign
indicating that swine flu infections have been brought under control after the
peak infection season in November.</P>
      <P>As of that day, the number of classes closed had fallen to 1,046, down from
1,925 Nov. 27, which accounted for 2 percent of the country's total classes.</P>
      <P>Taipei County in northern Taiwan has been the administrative area most affected,
having closed up to 25 percent of the county's total classes.</P>

      <P>Taipei city health officials said Thursday that deaths from cardiovascular
disease (CVD) in Taiwan's capital increased last year compared to the 1999
figure.</P>
      <P>The officials said that every two hours and 27 minutes, a person died from CVD
in 2008, compared to the 1999 figure of three hours and two minutes.</P>
      <P>The officials said CVD claimed 3,587 lives in the city last year, which made it
the number two cause of death, while cancer still topped the list.</P>
      <P>The fatality rate for heart disease was the highest among all the forms of CVD
for both men and women, the officials added.</P>
      <P>More men than women died from heart disease in 2008, as heart disease death
rates per 100,000 people were 100.3 for males and 54. 4 for females,  which
were up 46.9 percent  and 35.9 percent, respectively, from 1999.</P>
      <P>The CVD death rate for people under the age of 24 increased 90.8 percent from
1999, while the heart disease death rate for this age group was more than double
-- rising 218 percent compared to 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the CVD death rate for the 45-64 age group and for the age group
above 65 were both lower than a decade ago. However, the age group above 65
still recorded the highest number of deaths.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that CVD is closely related to age and obesity, with smokers
and patients with the "three-highs" -- high blood pressure, high blood sugar and
high blood lipoid -- most at risk.</P>
      <P>They suggested that people over 40 should get the health department's free blood
screening tests and enroll on its quit smoking programs.</P>
      <P>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , CVD is the number one cause
of death globally. More people die annually from it than from any other cause
and an estimated 17.1 million people died from CVD in 2004, representing 29
percent of all global deaths.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should allow the flat panel display industry to invest in China to avoid
it losing its importance in the Chinese market in the wake of South Korea's LG
Display Co. Ltd. establishing a joint venture Nov. 16 to build its 8.5th-
generation liquid crystal display (LCD) panel production line in China, a local
private think tank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Following the lifting of a South Korean ban on flat panel investment in China,
China is expected to introduce a spate of protectionist measures to protect the
joint venture, including new barriers to investment,  high tariffs,  and a
minimum initial investment, said Yang Sheng-fan, deputy director of the Topology
Research Institute (TRI).</P>
      <P>Jointly constructed by Guangzhou Development District and LG Display, the new
LCD panel plant will start construction in 2010 and is expected to go into
production in 2012.</P>
      <P>Once the new LCD panel project is completed, Taiwan's panel makers could lose
its advantage in terms of cost competitiveness in the Chinese market, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The government should come up with complementary measures as it makes plans for
local panel makers to break into the market, in order to help them sustain their
competitive edge in the industry, Yang said.</P>
      <P>For example,  the industry  should keep its research  and development centers in
the country and establish 10th-generation and 11th- generation panel production
lines in Taiwan to ensure that the country's industry is in line with the global
trend and has the capability and technology to develop next-generation products
such as organic light-emitting diodes and flexible display devices.</P>
      <P>TRI analyst Corwin Lee predicted that before 2020 the global panel industry will
continue to face an oversupply, causing a slump in prices.</P>
      <P>Under the scenario, products made by Japan and South Korea are expected to hold
a certain portion of the market share due to brand loyalty, so Taiwan's panel
makers, in the face of weak domestic consumption and failure to develop their
brand names should therefore seek cooperation with Chinese manufacturers to
explore the vast Chinese market, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Should Taiwan's panel industry not be able to invest in China, exports of panel
products could take a beating that could create a domino effect across the
broader industry, including low production capacity utilization, lack of cost
competitiveness in the Chinese market and a failure to build next-generation
panel production factories, Lee predicted.</P>
      <P>TRI projected that following South Korea's panel industry policy liberalization
policy  and the establishment  of the proposed 8.5th-generation panel production
plant in China, panel manufacturers in the two countries are expected to be
running at over 90 percent capacity utilization by 2015.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's panel makers are not allowed to invest in China, they will only be
running at 70 percent capacity utilization by that time, the institute forecast.</P>

      <P>A mission led by Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou arrived in
Washington, D.C. Wednesday to explore business opportunities in the U.S. private
and government sectors.</P>
      <P>"The aim of the visit is to forge business opportunities for the photovoltaic
and electric motor industries of the two countries, " Hwang said, adding that
they will visit the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce
while in the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>This is the first time in many years that a high-ranking MOEA official has
visited the United States.</P>
      <P>The delegation includes Industrial Technology Research Institute President
Johnsee Lee, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials and representatives  from
Taiwan's  leading  lithium-ion  battery manufacturers E-One Moli Energy Corp.,
Amita Technologies Inc. Ltd. and Simplo Technology Co., Ltd., as well as
electric motor engine manufacturer Fukuta Electric and Machinery Co.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, Taiwan is strong in these two fields and some American
companies, such as Tesla Roadster and GM, are keen to expand two-way
collaboration with their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Many of Tesla Roadster's motors, batteries and control modules are provided by
Taiwanese companies, he noted.</P>
      <P>The delegates also attended the annual meeting of the Republic of China-United

the U.S. automobile industry.</P>
      <P>Wang Chung-yu, vice chairman of the Republic of China-United States of America
Council, called on the U.S. to resume bilateral talks with Taiwan on a trade and
investment framework agreement to further expand business opportunities between
the two countries, especially at a time when Taiwan and China are preparing to
ink an economic cooperation framework agreement -- a pact similar to a free
trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Cooperation between Taiwan and the United States should be a win-win situation

      <P>A civic initiative that calls for a referendum on U.S. beef imports will be
submitted to the Central Election Commission (CEC) next week following the
completion of a first-stage signature drive, an organizer said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A total of 206,880 signatures have already been collected for the initiative,
which demands a re-opening of talks with Washington on U.S. beef imports,
according to Hsieh Tien-jen, chairman of the Consumers' Foundation, which is
leading the movement.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged consumers who have not signed the petition to take part in the
second phase of the signature drive, in which the foundation hopes to collect
1.2 million signatures.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington signed a protocol Oct. 22 under which Taiwan agreed to
lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and certain other beef products, including
ground beef and beef offal, sparking a huge public outcry.</P>
      <P>Civic groups led by the Consumers' Foundation and politicians contend that
allowing the entry of products that are considered at high risk of spreading
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, could endanger the health
of local consumers.</P>
      <P>With their appeals for re-opening Taiwan-U.S. beef talks having been rejected by
the government, the groups decided to push for a referendum to allow the people
a say on the issue.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's referendum law, a referendum proposal must pass two thresholds to
be accepted. In the initial stage, signatures from 0.5 percent, or 86,000, of
the 17.32 million eligible voters in the last presidential election must be
collected, a threshold that has already been met by the civic groups.</P>
      <P>If a referendum screening committee finds that the proposed referendum conforms
to legal guidelines, the referendum's sponsors then need to collect signatures
of endorsement from 5 percent of the voters, or 860,000 signatures, for the
question to be put to a referendum.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih and Emile Shen, Minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs,
joined Taichung Mayor Jason Hu Thursday at the groundbreaking of the Taichung
Metropolitan Opera House on the west side of the city.</P>
      <P>Wu said the opera house, which will accommodate a main auditorium with 2,011
seats, a theater with 800 seats and a smaller theater with 200 seats, will be
one of the most unique architectural structures in Asia when it is completed at
the end of 2013.</P>
      <P>Japanese architect Toyo Ito, who won the contract after a contest for the
project in 2005, said at the groundbreaking ceremony that he would bring
together the best resources to build one of the best metropolitan opera houses
in the world.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city council approved a revised construction budget plan last year.
The construction cost is estimated at NT$3.57 billion (around US$110 million),
of which NT$1.78 billion will come from the central government and NT$1.79
billion will be raised by the local government.</P>
      <P>Although the city government was planning to adopt an "OT" (operation and
transfer) model, inviting private businesses to run the opera house and transfer
the operations to the government after a certain number of years, the seven open
bids held over the past four years failed to attract private investors. Some of
the bids were aborted and some had no contenders at all.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced Thursday a new rule to partially
replace the previous "325" guideline for schools nationwide to follow as part of
the government's efforts to stem cluster infections of influenza A(HIN1) among
students.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, the new "814" rule requires that individual students
who have flu-like symptoms take days off if 80 percent of the students at the
school have been vaccinated and have developed immunity against swine flu.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began a national swine flu immunization program Nov. l, with people
entitled to one free shot in order of priority, starting with typhoon-affected
victims, medical personnel in charge of disease control and prevention, and
pregnant women.</P>
      <P>They were followed by toddlers and preschool children, seriously ill patients,
elementary, junior and senior high school students, individuals in the 19 to 24
age bracket and those over 25 years of age at high risk of cardiopulmonary
disease.</P>
      <P>Next to be vaccinated were healthy people in the 25-49 age bracket and those
between 50 and 64 years of age.</P>
      <P>Based on the "325" guidelines published Aug. 18 by the Central Epidemics Command
Center under the Cabinet-level Department of Health, classes at kindergartens,
primary schools and junior and senior high schools, as well as cram schools and
day-care centers, must be closed for five days to prevent cluster infections if
any two students in the same class are diagnosed with H1N1 within a period of
three days.</P>
      <P>The MOE made the change on the grounds that the antibody against the virus will
develop 14 days after vaccination against the HIN1 virus, ministry officials
said.</P>
      <P>Schools covered by the "814" rule will no longer be subject to the "325"
guidelines.</P>
      <P>Following an inspection of an elementary school in Taipei County later Thursday,
Education Minister Wu Ching-chi said the spread of influenza A(HIN1) has slowed
at schools around the country after the government's immunization program kicked
in Nov. 1, with elementary, junior and senior high school students getting shots
from Nov. 16-30.</P>
      <P>Wu said the number of class closures had dropped in the last week, a sign
indicating that swine flu infections have been brought under control after the
peak infection season in November.</P>
      <P>As of that day, the number of classes closed had fallen to 1,046, down from
1,925 Nov. 27, which accounted for 2 percent of the country's total classes.</P>
      <P>Taipei County in northern Taiwan has been the administrative area most affected,
having closed up to 25 percent of the county's total classes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei city health officials said Thursday that deaths from cardiovascular
disease (CVD) in Taiwan's capital increased last year compared to the 1999
figure.</P>
      <P>The officials said that every two hours and 27 minutes, a person died from CVD
in 2008, compared to the 1999 figure of three hours and two minutes.</P>
      <P>The officials said CVD claimed 3,587 lives in the city last year, which made it
the number two cause of death, while cancer still topped the list.</P>
      <P>The fatality rate for heart disease was the highest among all the forms of CVD
for both men and women, the officials added.</P>
      <P>More men than women died from heart disease in 2008, as heart disease death
rates per 100,000 people were 100.3 for males and 54. 4 for females,  which
were up 46.9 percent  and 35.9 percent, respectively, from 1999.</P>
      <P>The CVD death rate for people under the age of 24 increased 90.8 percent from
1999, while the heart disease death rate for this age group was more than double
-- rising 218 percent compared to 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the CVD death rate for the 45-64 age group and for the age group
above 65 were both lower than a decade ago. However, the age group above 65
still recorded the highest number of deaths.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that CVD is closely related to age and obesity, with smokers
and patients with the "three-highs" -- high blood pressure, high blood sugar and
high blood lipoid -- most at risk.</P>
      <P>They suggested that people over 40 should get the health department's free blood
screening tests and enroll on its quit smoking programs.</P>
      <P>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , CVD is the number one cause
of death globally. More people die annually from it than from any other cause
and an estimated 17.1 million people died from CVD in 2004, representing 29
percent of all global deaths.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Think tank calls for panel industry investment in China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should allow the flat panel display industry to invest in China to avoid
it losing its importance in the Chinese market in the wake of South Korea's LG
Display Co. Ltd. establishing a joint venture Nov. 16 to build its 8.5th-
generation liquid crystal display (LCD) panel production line in China, a local
private think tank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Following the lifting of a South Korean ban on flat panel investment in China,
China is expected to introduce a spate of protectionist measures to protect the
joint venture, including new barriers to investment,  high tariffs,  and a
minimum initial investment, said Yang Sheng-fan, deputy director of the Topology
Research Institute (TRI).</P>
      <P>Jointly constructed by Guangzhou Development District and LG Display, the new
LCD panel plant will start construction in 2010 and is expected to go into
production in 2012.</P>
      <P>Once the new LCD panel project is completed, Taiwan's panel makers could lose
its advantage in terms of cost competitiveness in the Chinese market, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The government should come up with complementary measures as it makes plans for
local panel makers to break into the market, in order to help them sustain their
competitive edge in the industry, Yang said.</P>
      <P>For example,  the industry  should keep its research  and development centers in
the country and establish 10th-generation and 11th- generation panel production
lines in Taiwan to ensure that the country's industry is in line with the global
trend and has the capability and technology to develop next-generation products
such as organic light-emitting diodes and flexible display devices.</P>
      <P>TRI analyst Corwin Lee predicted that before 2020 the global panel industry will
continue to face an oversupply, causing a slump in prices.</P>
      <P>Under the scenario, products made by Japan and South Korea are expected to hold
a certain portion of the market share due to brand loyalty, so Taiwan's panel
makers, in the face of weak domestic consumption and failure to develop their
brand names should therefore seek cooperation with Chinese manufacturers to
explore the vast Chinese market, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Should Taiwan's panel industry not be able to invest in China, exports of panel
products could take a beating that could create a domino effect across the
broader industry, including low production capacity utilization, lack of cost
competitiveness in the Chinese market and a failure to build next-generation
panel production factories, Lee predicted.</P>
      <P>TRI projected that following South Korea's panel industry policy liberalization
policy  and the establishment  of the proposed 8.5th-generation panel production
plant in China, panel manufacturers in the two countries are expected to be
running at over 90 percent capacity utilization by 2015.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's panel makers are not allowed to invest in China, they will only be
running at 70 percent capacity utilization by that time, the institute forecast.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior announced revisions Wednesday to the Regulations
Governing the Approval of People of the Mainland Area Visiting Taiwan for
purposes of Tourism, hoping to close a loophole and prevent Chinese from using
tourism as a disguise to enter Taiwan for other purposes.</P>
      <P>A ministry spokesman said that those suspected of planning to overstay or
conduct other activities in Taiwan will be denied entry.</P>
      <P>Although the government has relaxed restrictions on Chinese visitors to Taiwan
since last July, pre-trip examination of identity is required and Chinese
tourists must apply in groups, each group comprising no fewer than five persons.</P>
      <P>Several overstay cases have been reported and some Chinese visitors have been
found to have conducted activities other than sight-seeing while in Taiwan,
according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry has allowed more convenience for Chinese tourists and
travel agents by cancelling the regulation that any changes of tour itineraries
must be reported to the authorities immediately.</P>
      <P>Many travel agents had raised the issue that weather and traffic conditions can
cause inevitable changes in tour itineraries and that the immediate reporting
requirement had burdened not only the tour guides but also related
administrative offices.</P>
      <P>The revised regulations will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval, the

      <P>Next to be vaccinated were healthy people in the 25-49 age bracket and those
between 50 and 64 years of age.</P>
      <P>Based on the "325" guidelines published Aug. 18 by the Central Epidemics Command
Center under the Cabinet-level Department of Health, classes at kindergartens,
primary schools and junior and senior high schools, as well as cram schools and
day-care centers, must be closed for five days to prevent cluster infections if
any two students in the same class are diagnosed with H1N1 within a period of
three days.</P>
      <P>The MOE made the change on the grounds that the antibody against the virus will
develop 14 days after vaccination against the HIN1 virus, ministry officials
said.</P>
      <P>Schools covered by the "814" rule will no longer be subject to the "325"
guidelines.</P>
      <P>Following an inspection of an elementary school in Taipei County later Thursday,
Education Minister Wu Ching-chi said the spread of influenza A(HIN1) has slowed
at schools around the country after the government's immunization program kicked
in Nov. 1, with elementary, junior and senior high school students getting shots
from Nov. 16-30.</P>
      <P>Wu said the number of class closures had dropped in the last week, a sign
indicating that swine flu infections have been brought under control after the
peak infection season in November.</P>
      <P>As of that day, the number of classes closed had fallen to 1,046, down from
1,925 Nov. 27, which accounted for 2 percent of the country's total classes.</P>
      <P>Taipei County in northern Taiwan has been the administrative area most affected,
having closed up to 25 percent of the county's total classes.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior announced revisions Wednesday to the Regulations
Governing the Approval of People of the Mainland Area Visiting Taiwan for
purposes of Tourism, hoping to close a loophole and prevent Chinese from using
tourism as a disguise to enter Taiwan for other purposes.</P>
      <P>A ministry spokesman said that those suspected of planning to overstay or
conduct other activities in Taiwan will be denied entry.</P>
      <P>Although the government has relaxed restrictions on Chinese visitors to Taiwan
since last July, pre-trip examination of identity is required and Chinese
tourists must apply in groups, each group comprising no fewer than five persons.</P>
      <P>Several overstay cases have been reported and some Chinese visitors have been
found to have conducted activities other than sight-seeing while in Taiwan,
according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry has allowed more convenience for Chinese tourists and
travel agents by cancelling the regulation that any changes of tour itineraries
must be reported to the authorities immediately.</P>
      <P>Many travel agents had raised the issue that weather and traffic conditions can
cause inevitable changes in tour itineraries and that the immediate reporting
requirement had burdened not only the tour guides but also related
administrative offices.</P>
      <P>The revised regulations will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval, the
spokesman said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Think tank calls for panel industry investment in China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should allow the flat panel display industry to invest in China to avoid
it losing its importance in the Chinese market in the wake of South Korea's LG
Display Co. Ltd. establishing a joint venture Nov. 16 to build its 8.5th-
generation liquid crystal display (LCD) panel production line in China, a local
private think tank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Following the lifting of a South Korean ban on flat panel investment in China,
China is expected to introduce a spate of protectionist measures to protect the
joint venture, including new barriers to investment,  high tariffs,  and a
minimum initial investment, said Yang Sheng-fan, deputy director of the Topology
Research Institute (TRI).</P>
      <P>Jointly constructed by Guangzhou Development District and LG Display, the new
LCD panel plant will start construction in 2010 and is expected to go into
production in 2012.</P>
      <P>Once the new LCD panel project is completed, Taiwan's panel makers could lose
its advantage in terms of cost competitiveness in the Chinese market, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The government should come up with complementary measures as it makes plans for
local panel makers to break into the market, in order to help them sustain their
competitive edge in the industry, Yang said.</P>
      <P>For example,  the industry  should keep its research  and development centers in
the country and establish 10th-generation and 11th- generation panel production
lines in Taiwan to ensure that the country's industry is in line with the global
trend and has the capability and technology to develop next-generation products
such as organic light-emitting diodes and flexible display devices.</P>
      <P>TRI analyst Corwin Lee predicted that before 2020 the global panel industry will
continue to face an oversupply, causing a slump in prices.</P>
      <P>Under the scenario, products made by Japan and South Korea are expected to hold
a certain portion of the market share due to brand loyalty, so Taiwan's panel
makers, in the face of weak domestic consumption and failure to develop their
brand names should therefore seek cooperation with Chinese manufacturers to
explore the vast Chinese market, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Should Taiwan's panel industry not be able to invest in China, exports of panel
products could take a beating that could create a domino effect across the
broader industry, including low production capacity utilization, lack of cost
competitiveness in the Chinese market and a failure to build next-generation
panel production factories, Lee predicted.</P>
      <P>TRI projected that following South Korea's panel industry policy liberalization
policy  and the establishment  of the proposed 8.5th-generation panel production
plant in China, panel manufacturers in the two countries are expected to be
running at over 90 percent capacity utilization by 2015.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's panel makers are not allowed to invest in China, they will only be
running at 70 percent capacity utilization by that time, the institute forecast.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei city health officials said Thursday that deaths from cardiovascular
disease (CVD) in Taiwan's capital increased last year compared to the 1999
figure.</P>
      <P>The officials said that every two hours and 27 minutes, a person died from CVD
in 2008, compared to the 1999 figure of three hours and two minutes.</P>
      <P>The officials said CVD claimed 3,587 lives in the city last year, which made it
the number two cause of death, while cancer still topped the list.</P>
      <P>The fatality rate for heart disease was the highest among all the forms of CVD
for both men and women, the officials added.</P>
      <P>More men than women died from heart disease in 2008, as heart disease death
rates per 100,000 people were 100.3 for males and 54. 4 for females,  which
were up 46.9 percent  and 35.9 percent, respectively, from 1999.</P>
      <P>The CVD death rate for people under the age of 24 increased 90.8 percent from
1999, while the heart disease death rate for this age group was more than double
-- rising 218 percent compared to 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the CVD death rate for the 45-64 age group and for the age group
above 65 were both lower than a decade ago. However, the age group above 65
still recorded the highest number of deaths.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that CVD is closely related to age and obesity, with smokers
and patients with the "three-highs" -- high blood pressure, high blood sugar and
high blood lipoid -- most at risk.</P>
      <P>They suggested that people over 40 should get the health department's free blood
screening tests and enroll on its quit smoking programs.</P>
      <P>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , CVD is the number one cause
of death globally. More people die annually from it than from any other cause
and an estimated 17.1 million people died from CVD in 2004, representing 29
percent of all global deaths.</P>

      <P>A mission led by Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou arrived in
Washington, D.C. Wednesday to explore business opportunities in the U.S. private
and government sectors.</P>
      <P>"The aim of the visit is to forge business opportunities for the photovoltaic
and electric motor industries of the two countries, " Hwang said, adding that
they will visit the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce
while in the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>This is the first time in many years that a high-ranking MOEA official has
visited the United States.</P>
      <P>The delegation includes Industrial Technology Research Institute President
Johnsee Lee, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials and representatives  from
Taiwan's  leading  lithium-ion  battery manufacturers E-One Moli Energy Corp.,
Amita Technologies Inc. Ltd. and Simplo Technology Co., Ltd., as well as
electric motor engine manufacturer Fukuta Electric and Machinery Co.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, Taiwan is strong in these two fields and some American
companies, such as Tesla Roadster and GM, are keen to expand two-way
collaboration with their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Many of Tesla Roadster's motors, batteries and control modules are provided by
Taiwanese companies, he noted.</P>
      <P>The delegates also attended the annual meeting of the Republic of China-United
States of America Business Council Nov. 30 and visited Detroit, the center of
the U.S. automobile industry.</P>
      <P>Wang Chung-yu, vice chairman of the Republic of China-United States of America
Council, called on the U.S. to resume bilateral talks with Taiwan on a trade and
investment framework agreement to further expand business opportunities between
the two countries, especially at a time when Taiwan and China are preparing to
ink an economic cooperation framework agreement -- a pact similar to a free
trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Cooperation between Taiwan and the United States should be a win-win situation
for both countries and would help Taiwanese firms expand into the U.S. market,
while U.S. companies would be able to seize more business and investment
opportunities through partnerships with Taiwan-based enterprises, Wang said.</P>

      <P>The top Canadian envoy to Taiwan called Thursday for more economic and
investment activities between Taiwan and Canada, saying that both Taipei and
Ottawa can serve as each other's access points to a bigger market in North
America and Asia, respectively.</P>
      <P>"We think that Canada needs to be part of your strategy as you face the
challenges of an exceedingly and increasingly complex international commerce
environment, " said Scott Fraser, executive director of the Canadian Trade
Office in Taipei (CTOT).</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a countdown event in the lead-up to the 2010 Winter
Olympic Games scheduled to kick off in Vancouver Feb. 12, saying that the games
provide Canada with a great opportunity to reach out to global business leaders
and remind them why Canada is one of the best places in the world to invest, to
innovate, to work and to compete.</P>
      <P>According to Fraser, by investing in Canada, Taiwanese companies can strengthen
their operations, penetrate new markets, acquire new technologies,  resources
and skills  and can pursue  business opportunities in Canada to serve all of the
North American market and beyond.</P>
      <P>"I should also say that we are working to convince Canadian companies that
Taiwan is a great platform from which to pursue opportunities within Asia,
including the Chinese mainland, " said Fraser.</P>
      <P>Canada and Taiwan face similar challenges and have developed similar strategies,
according  to Fraser,  as both depend on international commerce for economic
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Taiwan and Canada can work together through investment and through
collaboration on innovation to meet the challenges of a globalized marketplace,
he added.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the theme of the Winter Olympics, Wang Jen-tang, chairman and
CEO of Acer, said at the event that as the worldwide Olympic sponsor from
2009-2012, Acer has launched a series of events and efforts in preparation for
the games.</P>
      <P>"The pursuit of excellence has brought Acer and the Olympic Games together,"
Wang said.</P>
      <P>As the second-largest computer manufacturer in the world, Wang said, Acer will

      <P>A 41-year-old woman in her 38th week of pregnancy underwent emergency surgery to
have her dead unborn baby removed Thursday, seven days after she was vaccinated
against influenza A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>It was Taiwan's first case of miscarriage suspected to have resulted from the
immunization.</P>
      <P>Some experts, however, said after an emergency meeting convened by the Central
Epidemics Command Center (CECC) to discuss the incident that there was
insufficient information to determine that the vaccine against the novel flu
strain was the culprit and that an investigation had been launched.</P>
      <P>Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director Chou Jih-haw said the woman
received the vaccine Nov. 27 and that doctors found that her baby had no
heartbeat Dec. 2 during a regular checkup.</P>
      <P>The woman, a resident of Taipei City, had suffered two previous miscarriages,
Chou pointed out, telling reporters that they were at the moment not aware
whether she had been ill before the latest miscarriage or whether the baby had
some kind of genetic deficiency.</P>
      <P>No cases of vaccination-caused miscarriage have been reported from overseas so
far, Chou added.</P>
      <P>He noted that 11,847 pregnant women in Taiwan have received the vaccine since
the government launched a national immunization program Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>The most serious side effect of which the CDC has been informed was a rash, Chou
added. He also noted that seven pregnant local women have been hospitalized with
A(H1N1) infection since the outbreak began, two of whom have died.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the latest incident might deter some other pregnant women from
receiving the inoculation, Chou said that after assessing the infection risk,

      <P>An album featuring music made by a drum ensemble from Tainan City in southern
Taiwan has been nominated for a Grammy award in the traditional world music
category, corporate sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>The album,  titled "Island of Drums" was recorded by the Tainan-based Ten Drum
Art Percussion Group and produced by the Taipei-based Wind Music International
Corp. It was nominated in Los Angeles Thursday with four other contenders from
India, Scotland, Africa and Latin America for a Grammy, the world's biggest
music award ceremony, which will take place in January.</P>
      <P>Ten Drum Art's nomination marks the first time in 16 years that an album
produced by a Taiwanese company has been nominated. The last one -- Taiwan's
first Grammy nomination -- was an album produced by another Taipei-based music
company featuring Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera in
1993.</P>
      <P>The nominees for the 52nd Grammy Awards were selected in a vote by 3,600 members
of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States for
outstanding achievements in the music industry.</P>
      <P>Wind Music International Corp. is one of the three Taiwanese members of the
academy, according to Yu Su-ying, head of Wind Music's business planning
department.</P>
      <P>Ten Drum Art founder Hsieh Shih, who began drumming at the age of 3 and who
composed all five pieces on the album, expressed elation over the nomination.</P>
      <P>Of the five, "The Gate of Taiwan, " a 20-minute piece featuring traditional
Chinese drums of all sizes along with suona -- a traditional Chinese reed
instrument -- and dulcimers, tells the epic story of how Koxinga made landfall
on the coast of Tainan's Luermen in the 17th Century, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that growing up at a Taoist temple run by his father meant that he
was familiar with the sound of drumbeats since birth.</P>
      <P>"I was ordered to beat the drum for a ritual one day when I was 3 as the drum
player was absent that day," he recalled.</P>
      <P>As a 16-year-old high school student, he went on, he saw a performance by
renowned Chinese percussionist Yan Xuemin and was enthralled.</P>
      <P>"I was suddenly enlightened that playing drums was not merely folklore but could
be a form of performance art that could earn high respect, " he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh founded his own ensemble, the Ten Drum Art Percussion Group, in 2000,
naming the company Ten Drum Art because his given name translates as Ten, while
the character for the numeral 10 can also mean "energy from all directions."</P>
      <P>The group's performances involve not only complex drumming but also the postures
of the players, he continued, adding that to perfect their performances, the
players jog for 5 km every day, besides drumming at least 4,000 beats and
laboring on farmland.</P>
      <P>Hsieh described the Grammy nomination as a turning point in his career. "My goal
is to build Tainan into the homeland of drumming and Taiwan into the island of
drums," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu visited the Chinese Professional Baseball League
Friday to receive a briefing on the league's corruption problems.</P>
      <P>Chu, who was asked by President Ma Ying-jeou to head an ad hoc government team
to chart plans to restore the image of professional baseball, was briefed by the
league's chairman, Chao shou-po.</P>
      <P>He also consulted with the managers of the four baseball clubs that make up the
league over ways to solve the problems facing the sport.</P>
      <P>Chu was charged with the task at a national baseball conference called by Ma
Dec. 1 at the request of about 800 fans who took to the streets of Taipei Nov.
29 to demand that the government take action to boost the professional baseball
league.</P>
      <P>The league suffered a blow after several of its players were probed Oct. 26 for
throwing games and many of them confessed to fixing-games in return for payments
from underground bookmakers.</P>
      <P>It was the fourth time the league had become embroiled in game-throwing
scandals, angering and disappointing many fans.</P>
      <P>Noting that baseball is Taiwan's most popular spectator sport, the government
promised to help revive its tarnished image. However, it failed to act upon its
words, prompting the Nov. 29 protest.</P>
      <P>The protesters' calls were not shared by all baseball lovers, however. One
sports commentator said in a letter to the editor of the China Times Wednesday
that baseball clubs are not worth the government's efforts to save them.</P>
      <P>Branding the clubs as being concerned only with their vested interests, the
writer said they care only about how to protect their own interests.</P>
      <P>But baseball clubs are not to be equated to the sport itself, and it is the

commentator.</P>
      <P>He dismissed the national baseball conference as useless because it produced
nothing but empty words and said that if the league and its four clubs do not
quit playing for a while and carry out thorough reforms, they will not win back
their fans and give themselves a new lease on life.</P>

      <P>A delegation of Canadian aborigines is visiting Taiwan to promote exchanges and
understanding of the indigenous cultures of Taiwan and Canada, the Canadian
Trade Office in Taipei (CTOT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>A conference on research into Canada's Metis tribe that was co-hosted by the
CTOT, National Donghua University (NDHU) and the Cabinet-level Council of
Indigenous Peoples (CIP) , opened that same day in the eastern city of Hualien.</P>
      <P>The conference discussed cultural preservation and other issues involving  the
identity  and the rights  of the Metis,  with participation by two special
guests from Canada -- Clement Chartier, president of Canada's Metis National
Council and Frank Tough, a professor of Native Studies of the University of
Alberta, according to the CTOT.</P>
      <P>The Metis people are descended from intermarriages between Cree, Ojibway,
Algonquin, Saulteaux, Menominee, Mi'kmaq, Maliseet and Europeans, mainly French.
It is estimated that there are 350,000 to 400,000 Metis people in Canada,
comprising about 1 percent of the country's population.</P>
      <P>"This conference will offer a new opportunity for academics and policy makers to
explore Canada-Taiwan aboriginal relations, as well as provide conference
participants with a deeper understanding of one of Canada's three officially
recognized aboriginal peoples, " said Scott Fraser, executive director of CTOT.</P>
      <P>Fraser also presented awards to the 2009 Canadian Studies winners -- Chou Jou-
juo of National Chung Cheng University and professors Wu Tsung-chiung, Hsu Hui-
yen, Jolan Hsieh and Sun Chia-sui, all of Donghua University.</P>
      <P>Since 1991, the Canadian Studies Program, which provides funding to conduct
Canada-related research, has had more than 100 award recipients from around
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih Cheng-feng, dean of NDHU's College of Indigenous Studies, said Taiwan's
Pingpu -- indigenous people living on Taiwan's plains -- share similarities with
the Metis people and he expressed hope that the conference will open a new
window of exchanges in aboriginal studies between Taiwan and Canada.</P>
      <P>Chartier and Tough were scheduled to visit Pingpu communities in both Kaohsiung
and Tainan counties in an effort to better understand the contemporary  Pingpu
experience as it relates to cultural preservation, according to the CTOT.</P>
      <P>According to the CIP, there are more than 490,000 indigenous people in Taiwan,
about 2 percent of the country's population.</P>
      <P>Currently, 14 tribes have been recognized by the government -- the Amis, Atayal,
Paiwan, Bunun, Puyuma, Rukai, Tsou, Saisiyat, Yami, Thao, Kavalan, Truku,
Sakizaya and Sediq, each with their own distinct language, cultural features,

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou presided over a ceremony in the eastern township of Yuli
Friday to mark the start of a railway electrification project on a line that
connects the two eastern counties of Hualien and Taitung.</P>
      <P>"Residents of eastern Taiwan have long hoped for this electrified railway
system," Ma said at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>He said he had traveled twice on the eastern Hualien-Taitung railway, which
still uses diesel-powered locomotives.</P>
      <P>"I felt sorry for the eastern residents and ashamed on behalf of the government
that the Hualien-Taitung railway network remained outdated while freeways and
high-speed railways have been in operation in western Taiwan for years," he
said.</P>
      <P>The electrification of the Hualien-Taitung  railway over a distance of 155
kilometers is scheduled to be completed by 2012. The electrified system will
mean that trains on the line will be able to travel at speeds of up to 130
kilometers per hour compared to the current 110 kph. Travel time between Hualien
Railway Station and Taitung Railway Station will be reduced by 35 minutes.</P>
      <P>The areas close to the 29 stations along the way will also be developed as
tourism attractions, according to the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president said that the railway between Taitung County and the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) is gratified to see that
economic relations between Taiwan and China have improved significantly over the
past year and that Taiwan's government has acted on a number of the group's
suggestions on cross-strait trade and other economic issues.</P>
      <P>In the latest issue of its monthly publication, Topics, AmCham offered an
assessment of the status of issues raised by the group in its Taiwan White Paper
released in June, covering areas such as banking,  chemical  manufacturing,
infrastructure,  insurance, intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, retail,
transportation and taxation.</P>
      <P>"AmCham is gratified that the government has continued to take the White Paper
recommendations extremely seriously and has made progress in a number of areas,
" Chamber President Andrea Wu was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to further close interaction with government agencies in hopes
that even more issues can be resolved before the next edition of the White Paper
is ready for publication," she added.</P>
      <P>Wu cited three areas in particular requiring further government attention to
enhance Taiwan's investment competitiveness, including reconsideration of the
"unrealistically aggressive" schedule set for reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions and the elimination of the requirement that foreign employees of non-
tech companies have two years of work experience.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan should expedite environmental impact approval for important pending
projects, including proposed new power plants to guarantee an adequate supply of
electricity in the coming decade and the Kuokuang petrochemical complex to
assure sufficient future supplies of downstream feedstocks, Wu added.</P>
      <P>According to the article, the most significant progress seen this year is the
improvement  in the cross-Taiwan  Strait economic relationship.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  and China  have already  concluded  memorandum  of understandings that
will pave the way for the mutual opening of markets in the three financial
sectors of banking, insurance, and securities, and the two are preparing to
begin negotiations on an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>These steps,  which follow previous initiatives  to expand cross-strait direct
flights and promote tourism from China, are in line with the position taken for
many years in the White Paper that Taiwan needs to take advantage of its
geographical proximity and cultural and linguistic connections with China to tap
into the opportunities offered by the world's fastest-growing economy, the
AmCham said.</P>
      <P>A sampling of other White Paper issues that received positive action in the past
half year include an easing of the regulatory reporting process in banking, an
amendment to the Insurance Law, and plans to institute more stringent laws on
protecting intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Since it was first published in 1996, the AmCham White Paper has served to set
the basic annual agenda for the chamber's meetings with government agencies on a
wide spectrum of economic and business issues.</P>

      <P>A group of travel agency operators from Beijing have arrived in Taiwan to tour
aboriginal villages and assess their potential as attractions for Beijing
sightseers.</P>
      <P>The 36-member group, led by Beijing Tourism Bureau Director An Jinming, paid a
call on aboriginal Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei Friday to discuss the possibility
of arranging tours to aboriginal villages and other rural spots around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin welcomed the Beijing travel agents, saying that their visit will pave
the way for the first group of Chinese visitors to tour rural Taiwan early next
year.</P>
      <P>"Such tours will definitely help boost the sagging economies of the indigenous
communities," she said.</P>
      <P>She said the delegation's current tour of Taiwan is the result of a visit by her
and a 100-member Taiwanese aboriginal group to Beijing in August, during which
she and Beijing Mayor Guo Jinlong discussed the possibility of launching
sightseeing tours to indigenous communities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his part, An said his delegation hopes to get a broader picture of rural
life in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I hope we can gain a better understanding of Taiwan's minorities and their
communities so that we can advise travel agencies on the possibility of tours to
aboriginal villages," An said.</P>
      <P>The Beijing tourism official said that since Taiwan lifted its restrictions last
year to allow visits by larger numbers of Chinese sightseers, "tourism between
the two sides has gone beyond pure leisure to a cultural experience."</P>
      <P>Over the past year, about 100,000 Beijing residents have visited Taiwan in 544
tour groups, while some 130,000 Taiwanese people have visited Beijing for
tourism purposes, he noted.</P>
      <P>An said his group is also looking to explore the concept of homestay tourism in
Taiwan, and noted that this has become an increasingly popular trend in the
greater Beijing area in recent years. There are about 20,000 households in 344
villages in the greater Beijing area that offer homestays, he said.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, the Beijing group will visit Fusing Village in the northern
county of Taoyuan, which is the home to the Atayal people; Atayal Taiaan
township in the northern county of Miaoli; and Sun Moon Lake in central Taiwan,
which is the home to the aboriginal tribe of Sao.</P>
      <P>They also plan to visit Sandimen township in the southern county of Pingtung,
home to the Rukai people; Jhihben township in the eastern county of Taitung, and
the Taroko National Park area in the eastern county of Hualien, which is home to
the Amis and other aboriginal groups.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Hakka Television Station stood out at the 14th Asia Television Awards
(ATA) ceremony in Singapore Thursday by winning the Best Drama Series and Best
Single Drama categories.</P>
      <P>Entering the competition for the first time to compete with programs of many
world-renowned television networks such as Discovery and National Geographic
Channel Asia, Hakka TV earned nominations in four categories and won awards for
Best Drama Series and Best Single Drama, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Best Drama Series award was given to Hakka TV's "1895 in Formosa, " which
depicts an epic love story about the Hakka people's fight against Japanese
occupation that year and recounts the Hakka militia's resistance against
Japanese troops.</P>
      <P>Hakka TV Vice Director Tang Sheng-jung and Wen Sheng-hao, the lead actor in 1895
in Formosa, accepted the award on behalf of the television station and the
series' other actors.</P>
      <P>The Best Single Drama award went to Hakka TV's "Love in the Season of Osmanthus,
" a black comedy in which three unsuccessful middle-age men try to rob a bank
security van.</P>
      <P>Hakka TV Director  Hsu Chin-yun  said the station  spends considerable effort on
the cast, plot and production of good-quality dramas, which serve as the best
tool to promote Hakka culture because drama is the closest thing to people's
lives.</P>
      <P>"I'm very gratified that our hard work has been well received by everybody. We
will continue to produce more high quality programs, " said Hsu.</P>
      <P>Also nominated for the ATA's most prestigious  "Cable and Satellite Channel of
the Year" award, Hakka TV lost in the category to Discovery Channel.</P>
      <P>Public Television Service Foundation,  another Taiwanese TV channel, went home
empty-handed after garnering nominations in five categories: Best Documentary
Programme, Best Natural History or Wildlife Programme or Documentary-Drama,
Best Single Drama or Telemovie Programme, Best Reality Programme, and Best

      <P>Other winners at the awards ceremony included Anjali Rao, host of CNN
International's "Talk Asia." Rao was named the Best Current Affairs Presenter
for her interview with Taiwan President  Ma Ying-jeou.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:
Liberty Times Taiwanese voters should cast ballots with eyes wide open</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been on barnstorming trips around the country in
recent weeks to stump for Kuomintang (KMT) candidates running in the Dec. 5
mayoral and magistrate elections in his capacity as party chairman.</P>
      <P>He has urged voters to give the KMT a mandate to control local governments,
claiming that this will allow his administration's policies to be implemented
efficiently.</P>
      <P>"When central and local governments are in the hands of the same party, Taiwan's
progress will take off, " Ma has said repeatedly on the campaign trail.</P>
      <P>Last year, Ma used a similar campaign slogan to help his party score a landslide
victory in the legislative elections. However, he has not delivered on his
promise of good governance now that the KMT controls both the executive and
legislative arms of the government.</P>
      <P>Over the past one-plus year, the people of Taiwan have lived in hardship, with
many people out of work or seeing their salaries fall to levels of 30 years ago.
All this has resulted from the Ma administration's incompetence and its adoption
of a China-tilting policy.</P>
      <P>We must remind voters of the wrongness of Ma's equation that a vote for the KMT
in the upcoming local elections is a vote for Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>In a mature democracy, progress does not rely on central and local government
being controlled by the same party. According to the division of power clauses
set forth in the Constitution, central and local governments should act in
concert even if their chiefs belong to different political parties.</P>
      <P>Judging from Ma's recent campaign speeches, we can see that he remains
unrepentant about the damage his China-leaning policy has done to Taiwan's
economy and sovereign status.</P>
      <P>We hope voters will use their ballots to teach Ma a lesson. Otherwise, his
administration's plans to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement with
China, recognize academic accreditation from Chinese tertiary education
institutes and open Taiwan's universities to Chinese students could soon become
realities, by which time Taiwan's future will be doomed.</P>
      <P>For the sake of Taiwan and for our own sakes and those of generations to come,
voters should cast their ballots with their eyes wide open. Apple Daily Only
creative minds can stand out</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fashion designer Johan Ku has won the top prize in the avant-garde
category of the 2009 Gen Art's Styles International Design Competition in New
York.</P>
      <P>It's an extraordinary achievement for an up-and-coming talent to snatch the
coveted crown in one of the world's most prestigious fashion design contests. It
is no less glamourous than a pianist winning the annual Chopin piano contest.</P>
      <P>Ku's prize-winning work does not epitomize any single Chinese, Asian or Western
fashion style. It is a very complex, sophisticated creation that is full of
imagination and mirrors Ku's strong personal flair.</P>
      <P>As the professional fashion world takes attire as a media for dialogue with
others and oneself, it is no easy feat for a young designer to emerge in the
extremely competitive New York fashion arena where talent is in abundant supply.</P>
      <P>Ku's victory in the New York contest proves his ingenuity. It also affirms the
trend that creative prodigies will stand out. Taiwan's education system has
traditionally focused more on requiring students to recite classics or knowledge
rather than to encourage them to develop imagination. That's why Taiwan has
lagged in scientific and technological development and represents a crisis in
our education system. United Daily News Tribal smoke sign metaphor</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  in Hsinchu County set a commendable precedent recently with a
ruling that confirmed the right of Atayal tribal people living in mountainous
Jianshih Township to collect traffic fees from those who travel through their
Smangus village.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors cited two U.N.-sponsored international conventions signed into law
by President Ma Ying-jeou earlier this year to support their ruling in favor of
the Smangus tribal people.</P>
      <P>Their  ruling  only  highlights  the  central  government's insufficient
attention to the spirit of the two international conventions, reflected in a
recent protest outside the Executive Yuan over what they called the slow
progress in rebuilding their Typhoon Morakot-devastated villages.</P>
      <P>Some demonstrators protested the government's failure to respond to their wish
to live in family style temporary shelters instead of living in military
barracks, where they have been housed for more than three months.</P>
      <P>Others voiced their discontent with the government's plan to build permanent
housing units on a piece of state-owned land away from their original villages.
They demanded more say in how to rebuild their homes and tribal villages.</P>
      <P>The central government should take a cue from the Hsinchu prosecutors' ruling
and show more respect for indigenous people's views in planning post-disaster
reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>Patience and time are needed in helping displaced aborigines relocate to an
environment similar to their original homes to sustain their tribal history and
culture. China Times Director's tears highlight local film industry's plight</P>
      <P>Movie director Leon Dai shed tears at the Golden Horse Film Festival award
presentation ceremony after his indie family drama won four awards, including
the coveted best picture and best director awards.</P>
      <P>His tears shed light on the destitution faced by Taiwan's filmmakers and movie
professionals.</P>
      <P>With a limited budget of NT$6 million, which is less than the cost of shooting
single scenes in some blockbuster commercial films, Dai had to personally write
the script for his film "I Can't Live Without You" in addition to directing and
editing it.</P>
      <P>The government  has tried to improve the local filmmaking environment but has
failed to work out effective strategies. Given its own financial straits, it can
only offer prize money or subsidies to filmmakers who have won accolades in
international or domestic competitions.</P>
      <P>But government support alone cannot ensure the success of a film. Local
filmmakers, including directors, may also have to adjust their attitudes,
treating filmmaking as more than just an expression of their personal artistic
ideals.</P>
      <P>They need to produce films that can move the hearts and minds of moviegoers and
should promote their films through commercial market channels. The government
and filmmaking professionals should work hand-in-hand to create a positive or
benign industrial cycle to make filmmaking a profitable enterprise. Commercial
Times Improving civil service culture an urgent task</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih's controversial directive for civil servants to come up with
an action plan to improve ordinary people's lives only reveals how urgently the
country needs to improve the culture of the country's civil service.</P>
      <P>Administrative agencies have proposed more than 200 plans in a short period of
time. While those plans covered nearly all aspects of people's everyday lives,
Wu concluded, none of them were productive or hit the crux of problems facing
the country.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon epitomizes Taiwan's civil service culture. Civil servants tend to
be perfunctory and pandering in dealing with work and have been lax in
monitoring, supervision and evaluation.</P>
      <P>If such an attitude is not improved, the government's policy planning and
quality of implementation will never get better, at the expense of our country's
overall development. Economic Daily News All-out efforts needed to correct
distorted economic structure</P>
      <P>In the wake of the global financial crisis, major countries around  the global
will definitely  adjust  their development strategies. Taiwan will be no
exception.</P>
      <P>To keep abreast of future global development tendencies, we should study
possible changes in the global economy in the years ahead. Moreover, we should
better understand major distortions in Taiwan's economic development over the
past decade to serve as a basis for improvement.</P>
      <P>First of all,  we should discontinue  heavy dependence on export-oriented and
trade surplus-fueled economic expansion. Such reliance has only resulted in
unbalanced economic development.</P>
      <P>The overemphasis on a few industries that heavily rely on exports should be
adjusted, and the trend of export industries' heavy reliance on imports of parts
and components also needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Last but not least, more energy should be devoted to the development of the
service sector, whose development has lagged behind.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) both revved up their campaign efforts Friday, the last day before the
three-in-one local elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Chan Chuen-po expressed optimism over the party's chances of
taking 11 of the 17 city and county seats up for grabs in the elections.
However, the other six seats are more "difficult," he said, listing Hsinchu,
Yilan and Chiayi counties as the "most unpredictable."</P>
      <P>The 17 areas are Hsinchu, Chiayi and Keelung cities and Hsinchu, Miaoli,
Changhua, Nantou, Yunlin, Chiayi, Hualien, Yilan, Taitung, Kinmen, Lienchiang
(Matsu), Penghu, Pingtung and Taoyuan counties.</P>
      <P>At present, the KMT holds 14 of the 17 seats, while the DPP controls the other
three in Chiayi, Yunlin and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>Chan said the KMT's "difficulties" spring from three main factors, the first
being that three of the county magistrate seats are currently in the hands of
the DPP.</P>
      <P>The second is that the KMT's nomination process for the three counties it holds
was rocky and there has been little coalescence since, Chan said, citing the
situation in Hsinchu and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>The third factor is that Yilan County is traditionally a DPP stronghold, he
added.</P>
      <P>In line  with President  Ma Ying-jeou's  "get-out-the-vote" campaign, Chan urged
voters to go to the polls Saturday, and predicted that the turnout rate will be
between 67 percent and 68 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma, who is also chairman of the KMT, stayed on the campaign
trail Friday, attending a ceremony in Hualien County in the morning to mark the
start of an electrification project for the eastern railway system.</P>
      <P>He later went on to Taitung, then to Yilan County and finally to Hsinchu County
where he was expected to speak at big rally later in the evening.</P>
      <P>His slipping popularity is one of the factors that the opposition DPP has been
playing on and it has also been attacking what it calls his "China-leaning"
policies, especially his plan to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP is expected to retain control of the three counties it now holds and
make a big push to take back Yilan County from the KMT.</P>
      <P>On Friday, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen stumped for Chang Hwa-kuan and Peng Shao-
chin, the party's magisterial candidates in Chiayi and Hsinchu counties,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Later in the day she traveled to Yilan County to attend a night rally for the
DPP candidate there, Lin Tsong-shyan.</P>
      <P>This will be the first major election since President Ma took office in May 2008
and it is seen by many as a mid-term test of his administration.</P>
      <P>In addition to electing city mayors and county magistrates Saturday, voters will
also cast ballots for city and county councilors and township chiefs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Wenshan-Neihu line of the Taipei MRT system was shut down for 57 minutes
Friday afternoon due to network abnormalities, the latest in a series of
breakdowns experienced by the line since its launch eight months ago.</P>
      <P>Services on the line were resumed at 4: 37 p.m. after the problem was fixed.</P>
      <P>Tan Kuo-kuang, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei City government, explained
that the incident was caused by an unstable network converter at the Zhongxiao
Fuxing station.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,520 passengers on 23 trains were affected, all of whom were
evacuated within 15 minutes after the shutdown and provided with free bus
services instead, Tan said.</P>
      <P>The shutdown came just three days after the city government announced that the
reliability of the Wenshan-Neihu line reached 99 percent during the September-
November period, following completion of system upgrades at the end of August.</P>
      <P>The latest incident followed a collision Nov. 26 between two trains that were
approaching the Neihu depot for routine maintenance.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp., which operates the MRT system, has claimed that
the collision was the result of inadequate platform length.</P>
      <P>When questioned by an investigation panel set up by the Taipei City Council
Friday, however, an official from the city's Department of Rapid Transit Systems
(DORTS) rejected such a claim.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Yao-wei, director of the DORTS's East District Project Office,
the length of the platform should not be a problem because the train carriages
are supposed to be detached in the depot, not on the platform.</P>

      <P>The four millionth tourist to Taiwan this year is expected to arrive on
Saturday, the first time that tourist arrivals to this country will surpass the
four million mark, the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The lucky visitor will receive a debit card with a cash value of NT$400,000
(US$12,353) for exclusive use in Taiwan during his or her visit, bureau
officials said. He or she will also receive many other gifts.</P>
      <P>To attract more tourists to Taiwan, the Tourism Bureau launched the incentive
offer this year as part of an ambitious program to increase the number of
visitors.</P>
      <P>Focusing on the high-tech and manufacturing sectors in the past, Taiwan has long
neglected promoting the tourism sector. But in recent years, it has recognized
that its abundance of scenic natural beauty -- including majestic mountains and
beautiful coastlines -- as well as cultural assets, are resources it can use to
develop the tourism industry and boost economic growth.</P>
      <P>The one millionth, two millionth and three millionth visitors received debit
cards earlier this year, but with a lower value.</P>
      <P>Last year, more than 3.84 million visitors traveled to Taiwan, according to
official figures.</P>
      <P>To further promote tourism, the bureau, in conjunction with the Northeast Coast
and Guanyinshan National Scenic Area Administration and Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, is staging two photo exhibitions at the airport's
terminal from Dec. 4 until Feb. 28, 2010.</P>
      <P>One exhibition features women dressed in bridal gowns posing at beautiful spots
along Taiwan's northeast coast, which has long been a popular destination among
Taiwan's newly weds to take wedding photos.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top economic planner said Friday that it hopes that all health care
institutions will use electronic medical records within five years.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported that 95
percent of public and private hospitals and 56 percent of clinics use e-medical
records at present.</P>
      <P>A council official said that the government will work with the private sector to
realize the goal of "instituting e-medical records, digitalization of images and
examination reports, and the capacity to exchange medical images between
hospitals within five years. "</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that to upgrade health care quality, many nations have actively
engaged in medical reforms, including the United States, which will spend
US$19.2 billion between 2009 and 2012 on medical reforms, and China, which will
invest 850 billion yuan.</P>
      <P>Medical care is one of the six emerging industries that Taiwan is promoting, and
the e-medical records will be one of the priorities in the sector, the CEPD
said.</P>
      <P>Once the e-medical records system is adopted by all health care institutions,
patients will be able to get their medical records anywhere in the country
simply by providing their National Health Insurance IC cards.</P>
      <P>The medical records to be digitalized include medical examination reports,
scans such as computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans, blood test results and prescription records.</P>
      <P>The plan aims to shorten waiting times of patients at clinics, help patients
avoid unneeded duplication of medical tests and prescriptions,  and prevent  the
unnecessary  waste of medical resources.</P>

      <P>Though there appears to be little chance the European Union (EU) will soon begin
talks with Taiwan on a free trade agreement (FTA), the government will continue
to let the EU know its willingness to negotiate such a deal, Minister of
Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih said he expressed Taiwan's interest in discussing an FTA to Ewa Bjorling,
minister of trade of Sweden, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency,
when he met with her at a recent trade ministers' meeting of the World Trade
Organization (WT0) in Geneva, Switzerland, from Nov. 30-Dec. 2.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, however, Bjorling told him that it is not very possible that
the EU would start such talks with Taiwan at present as it is busy negotiating
several cooperation ventures with some regional organizations, including the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council.</P>
      <P>Shih insisted, however, that "we will continue to express our eagerness in this
regard."</P>
      <P>European Chamber of Commerce Taipei Chairman Philippe Pellegrin said in late
October that reaching an agreement between Taiwan and the EU on trade is a
pressing issue and much needed to advance two-way economic cooperation as well
as create job and investment opportunities for both parties.</P>
      <P>According to Pellegrin, the EU's GDP would increase by 2 billion euros, while
Taiwan's economy would expand by 3.8 billion euros if the EU and Taiwan were to
sign an FTA.</P>

      <P>Global warming is increasing the likelihood of climate extremes and could lead
to severe droughts in Taiwan in winter and spring as the frequency of small
rainfalls diminishes, according to data released Friday by a local scientist.</P>
      <P>The world has been experiencing more downpours and fewer drizzles in recent
years because of climate change, and the amount of precipitation brought by
typhoons is double that of 45 years ago, said Liu Shaw-chen, director of the
Research Center for Environmental Changes at the Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting held to discuss the prospects of the upcoming United
Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 slated for Dec. 7-18 in Copenhagen, Liu
said that with every one degree Celsius increase in the global temperature, the
chances of heavy rains in Taiwan rise by 140 percent, while the chances of
drizzles drop by 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The frequency of drizzles has already fallen,  with small rainfalls occurring
only 35 days a year in Taiwan today, compared with 70 days 45 years ago, he
said.</P>
      <P>That's a worrying trend, Liu said, because drizzles are the main source of fresh
water in spring and winter, and their decrease could lead to severe drought
during these two seasons.</P>
      <P>During the summer, however, the frequency of floods caused by heavy rains is
expected to record a rapid increase in the 21st century, Liu warned.</P>
      <P>The scientist also presented data showing that Taiwan's average surface air
temperature in the 20th century rose 1.1 degrees Celsius -- nearly double the
increase in the global average -- due mainly to global warming and the heat
island effect.</P>
      <P>The average global temperature rose 0.6 degrees Celsius during the century, and
Liu estimated that the temperature increase in the 21st century will be three to
six times higher, ranging between 1.8 degrees and 4 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>To help stop global warming, countries around the world should conserve energy
and work to develop alternative energy sources, such as solar power, wind power,
biomass energy and even nuclear power, he said.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:
Liberty Times Taiwanese voters should cast ballots with eyes wide open</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been on barnstorming trips around the country in
recent weeks to stump for Kuomintang (KMT) candidates running in the Dec. 5
mayoral and magistrate elections in his capacity as party chairman.</P>
      <P>He has urged voters to give the KMT a mandate to control local governments,
claiming that this will allow his administration's policies to be implemented
efficiently.</P>
      <P>"When central and local governments are in the hands of the same party, Taiwan's
progress will take off, " Ma has said repeatedly on the campaign trail.</P>
      <P>Last year, Ma used a similar campaign slogan to help his party score a landslide
victory in the legislative elections. However, he has not delivered on his
promise of good governance now that the KMT controls both the executive and
legislative arms of the government.</P>
      <P>Over the past one-plus year, the people of Taiwan have lived in hardship, with
many people out of work or seeing their salaries fall to levels of 30 years ago.
All this has resulted from the Ma administration's incompetence and its adoption
of a China-tilting policy.</P>
      <P>We must remind voters of the wrongness of Ma's equation that a vote for the KMT
in the upcoming local elections is a vote for Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>In a mature democracy, progress does not rely on central and local government
being controlled by the same party. According to the division of power clauses
set forth in the Constitution, central and local governments should act in
concert even if their chiefs belong to different political parties.</P>
      <P>Judging from Ma's recent campaign speeches, we can see that he remains
unrepentant about the damage his China-leaning policy has done to Taiwan's
economy and sovereign status.</P>
      <P>We hope voters will use their ballots to teach Ma a lesson. Otherwise, his
administration's plans to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement with
China, recognize academic accreditation from Chinese tertiary education
institutes and open Taiwan's universities to Chinese students could soon become
realities, by which time Taiwan's future will be doomed.</P>
      <P>For the sake of Taiwan and for our own sakes and those of generations to come,
voters should cast their ballots with their eyes wide open. Apple Daily Only
creative minds can stand out</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fashion designer Johan Ku has won the top prize in the avant-garde
category of the 2009 Gen Art's Styles International Design Competition in New
York.</P>
      <P>It's an extraordinary achievement for an up-and-coming talent to snatch the
coveted crown in one of the world's most prestigious fashion design contests. It
is no less glamourous than a pianist winning the annual Chopin piano contest.</P>
      <P>Ku's prize-winning work does not epitomize any single Chinese, Asian or Western
fashion style. It is a very complex, sophisticated creation that is full of
imagination and mirrors Ku's strong personal flair.</P>
      <P>As the professional fashion world takes attire as a media for dialogue with
others and oneself, it is no easy feat for a young designer to emerge in the
extremely competitive New York fashion arena where talent is in abundant supply.</P>
      <P>Ku's victory in the New York contest proves his ingenuity. It also affirms the
trend that creative prodigies will stand out. Taiwan's education system has
traditionally focused more on requiring students to recite classics or knowledge
rather than to encourage them to develop imagination. That's why Taiwan has
lagged in scientific and technological development and represents a crisis in
our education system. United Daily News Tribal smoke sign metaphor</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  in Hsinchu County set a commendable precedent recently with a
ruling that confirmed the right of Atayal tribal people living in mountainous
Jianshih Township to collect traffic fees from those who travel through their
Smangus village.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors cited two U.N.-sponsored international conventions signed into law
by President Ma Ying-jeou earlier this year to support their ruling in favor of
the Smangus tribal people.</P>
      <P>Their  ruling  only  highlights  the  central  government's insufficient
attention to the spirit of the two international conventions, reflected in a
recent protest outside the Executive Yuan over what they called the slow
progress in rebuilding their Typhoon Morakot-devastated villages.</P>
      <P>Some demonstrators protested the government's failure to respond to their wish
to live in family style temporary shelters instead of living in military
barracks, where they have been housed for more than three months.</P>
      <P>Others voiced their discontent with the government's plan to build permanent
housing units on a piece of state-owned land away from their original villages.
They demanded more say in how to rebuild their homes and tribal villages.</P>
      <P>The central government should take a cue from the Hsinchu prosecutors' ruling
and show more respect for indigenous people's views in planning post-disaster
reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>Patience and time are needed in helping displaced aborigines relocate to an
environment similar to their original homes to sustain their tribal history and
culture. China Times Director's tears highlight local film industry's plight</P>
      <P>Movie director Leon Dai shed tears at the Golden Horse Film Festival award
presentation ceremony after his indie family drama won four awards, including
the coveted best picture and best director awards.</P>
      <P>His tears shed light on the destitution faced by Taiwan's filmmakers and movie
professionals.</P>
      <P>With a limited budget of NT$6 million, which is less than the cost of shooting
single scenes in some blockbuster commercial films, Dai had to personally write
the script for his film "I Can't Live Without You" in addition to directing and
editing it.</P>
      <P>The government  has tried to improve the local filmmaking environment but has
failed to work out effective strategies. Given its own financial straits, it can
only offer prize money or subsidies to filmmakers who have won accolades in
international or domestic competitions.</P>
      <P>But government support alone cannot ensure the success of a film. Local
filmmakers, including directors, may also have to adjust their attitudes,
treating filmmaking as more than just an expression of their personal artistic
ideals.</P>
      <P>They need to produce films that can move the hearts and minds of moviegoers and
should promote their films through commercial market channels. The government
and filmmaking professionals should work hand-in-hand to create a positive or
benign industrial cycle to make filmmaking a profitable enterprise. Commercial
Times Improving civil service culture an urgent task</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih's controversial directive for civil servants to come up with
an action plan to improve ordinary people's lives only reveals how urgently the
country needs to improve the culture of the country's civil service.</P>
      <P>Administrative agencies have proposed more than 200 plans in a short period of
time. While those plans covered nearly all aspects of people's everyday lives,
Wu concluded, none of them were productive or hit the crux of problems facing
the country.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon epitomizes Taiwan's civil service culture. Civil servants tend to
be perfunctory and pandering in dealing with work and have been lax in
monitoring, supervision and evaluation.</P>
      <P>If such an attitude is not improved, the government's policy planning and
quality of implementation will never get better, at the expense of our country's
overall development. Economic Daily News All-out efforts needed to correct
distorted economic structure</P>
      <P>In the wake of the global financial crisis, major countries around  the global
will definitely  adjust  their development strategies. Taiwan will be no
exception.</P>
      <P>To keep abreast of future global development tendencies, we should study
possible changes in the global economy in the years ahead. Moreover, we should
better understand major distortions in Taiwan's economic development over the
past decade to serve as a basis for improvement.</P>
      <P>First of all,  we should discontinue  heavy dependence on export-oriented and
trade surplus-fueled economic expansion. Such reliance has only resulted in
unbalanced economic development.</P>
      <P>The overemphasis on a few industries that heavily rely on exports should be
adjusted, and the trend of export industries' heavy reliance on imports of parts
and components also needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Last but not least, more energy should be devoted to the development of the
service sector, whose development has lagged behind.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) both revved up their campaign efforts Friday, the last day before the
three-in-one local elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Chan Chuen-po expressed optimism over the party's chances of
taking 11 of the 17 city and county seats up for grabs in the elections.
However, the other six seats are more "difficult," he said, listing Hsinchu,
Yilan and Chiayi counties as the "most unpredictable."</P>
      <P>The 17 areas are Hsinchu, Chiayi and Keelung cities and Hsinchu, Miaoli,
Changhua, Nantou, Yunlin, Chiayi, Hualien, Yilan, Taitung, Kinmen, Lienchiang
(Matsu), Penghu, Pingtung and Taoyuan counties.</P>
      <P>At present, the KMT holds 14 of the 17 seats, while the DPP controls the other
three in Chiayi, Yunlin and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>Chan said the KMT's "difficulties" spring from three main factors, the first
being that three of the county magistrate seats are currently in the hands of
the DPP.</P>
      <P>The second is that the KMT's nomination process for the three counties it holds
was rocky and there has been little coalescence since, Chan said, citing the
situation in Hsinchu and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>The third factor is that Yilan County is traditionally a DPP stronghold, he
added.</P>
      <P>In line  with President  Ma Ying-jeou's  "get-out-the-vote" campaign, Chan urged
voters to go to the polls Saturday, and predicted that the turnout rate will be
between 67 percent and 68 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Ma, who is also chairman of the KMT, stayed on the campaign
trail Friday, attending a ceremony in Hualien County in the morning to mark the
start of an electrification project for the eastern railway system.</P>
      <P>He later went on to Taitung, then to Yilan County and finally to Hsinchu County
where he was expected to speak at big rally later in the evening.</P>
      <P>His slipping popularity is one of the factors that the opposition DPP has been
playing on and it has also been attacking what it calls his "China-leaning"
policies, especially his plan to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP is expected to retain control of the three counties it now holds and
make a big push to take back Yilan County from the KMT.</P>
      <P>On Friday, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen stumped for Chang Hwa-kuan and Peng Shao-
chin, the party's magisterial candidates in Chiayi and Hsinchu counties,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Later in the day she traveled to Yilan County to attend a night rally for the
DPP candidate there, Lin Tsong-shyan.</P>
      <P>This will be the first major election since President Ma took office in May 2008
and it is seen by many as a mid-term test of his administration.</P>
      <P>In addition to electing city mayors and county magistrates Saturday, voters will
also cast ballots for city and county councilors and township chiefs.</P>

      <P>The Wenshan-Neihu line of the Taipei MRT system was shut down for 57 minutes
Friday afternoon due to network abnormalities, the latest in a series of
breakdowns experienced by the line since its launch eight months ago.</P>
      <P>Services on the line were resumed at 4: 37 p.m. after the problem was fixed.</P>
      <P>Tan Kuo-kuang, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei City government, explained
that the incident was caused by an unstable network converter at the Zhongxiao
Fuxing station.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,520 passengers on 23 trains were affected, all of whom were
evacuated within 15 minutes after the shutdown and provided with free bus
services instead, Tan said.</P>
      <P>The shutdown came just three days after the city government announced that the
reliability of the Wenshan-Neihu line reached 99 percent during the September-
November period, following completion of system upgrades at the end of August.</P>
      <P>The latest incident followed a collision Nov. 26 between two trains that were
approaching the Neihu depot for routine maintenance.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp., which operates the MRT system, has claimed that
the collision was the result of inadequate platform length.</P>
      <P>When questioned by an investigation panel set up by the Taipei City Council
Friday, however, an official from the city's Department of Rapid Transit Systems
(DORTS) rejected such a claim.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Yao-wei, director of the DORTS's East District Project Office,
the length of the platform should not be a problem because the train carriages
are supposed to be detached in the depot, not on the platform.</P>

      <P>The four millionth tourist to Taiwan this year is expected to arrive on
Saturday, the first time that tourist arrivals to this country will surpass the
four million mark, the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The lucky visitor will receive a debit card with a cash value of NT$400,000
(US$12,353) for exclusive use in Taiwan during his or her visit, bureau
officials said. He or she will also receive many other gifts.</P>
      <P>To attract more tourists to Taiwan, the Tourism Bureau launched the incentive
offer this year as part of an ambitious program to increase the number of
visitors.</P>
      <P>Focusing on the high-tech and manufacturing sectors in the past, Taiwan has long
neglected promoting the tourism sector. But in recent years, it has recognized
that its abundance of scenic natural beauty -- including majestic mountains and
beautiful coastlines -- as well as cultural assets, are resources it can use to
develop the tourism industry and boost economic growth.</P>
      <P>The one millionth, two millionth and three millionth visitors received debit
cards earlier this year, but with a lower value.</P>
      <P>Last year, more than 3.84 million visitors traveled to Taiwan, according to
official figures.</P>
      <P>To further promote tourism, the bureau, in conjunction with the Northeast Coast
and Guanyinshan National Scenic Area Administration and Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, is staging two photo exhibitions at the airport's
terminal from Dec. 4 until Feb. 28, 2010.</P>
      <P>One exhibition features women dressed in bridal gowns posing at beautiful spots
along Taiwan's northeast coast, which has long been a popular destination among
Taiwan's newly weds to take wedding photos.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top economic planner said Friday that it hopes that all health care
institutions will use electronic medical records within five years.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported that 95
percent of public and private hospitals and 56 percent of clinics use e-medical
records at present.</P>
      <P>A council official said that the government will work with the private sector to
realize the goal of "instituting e-medical records, digitalization of images and
examination reports, and the capacity to exchange medical images between
hospitals within five years. "</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that to upgrade health care quality, many nations have actively
engaged in medical reforms, including the United States, which will spend
US$19.2 billion between 2009 and 2012 on medical reforms, and China, which will
invest 850 billion yuan.</P>
      <P>Medical care is one of the six emerging industries that Taiwan is promoting, and
the e-medical records will be one of the priorities in the sector, the CEPD
said.</P>
      <P>Once the e-medical records system is adopted by all health care institutions,
patients will be able to get their medical records anywhere in the country
simply by providing their National Health Insurance IC cards.</P>
      <P>The medical records to be digitalized include medical examination reports,
scans such as computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scans, blood test results and prescription records.</P>
      <P>The plan aims to shorten waiting times of patients at clinics, help patients
avoid unneeded duplication of medical tests and prescriptions,  and prevent  the
unnecessary  waste of medical resources.</P>

      <P>Though there appears to be little chance the European Union (EU) will soon begin
talks with Taiwan on a free trade agreement (FTA), the government will continue
to let the EU know its willingness to negotiate such a deal, Minister of
Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih said he expressed Taiwan's interest in discussing an FTA to Ewa Bjorling,
minister of trade of Sweden, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency,
when he met with her at a recent trade ministers' meeting of the World Trade
Organization (WT0) in Geneva, Switzerland, from Nov. 30-Dec. 2.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, however, Bjorling told him that it is not very possible that
the EU would start such talks with Taiwan at present as it is busy negotiating
several cooperation ventures with some regional organizations, including the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council.</P>
      <P>Shih insisted, however, that "we will continue to express our eagerness in this
regard."</P>
      <P>European Chamber of Commerce Taipei Chairman Philippe Pellegrin said in late

      <P>Global warming is increasing the likelihood of climate extremes and could lead
to severe droughts in Taiwan in winter and spring as the frequency of small
rainfalls diminishes, according to data released Friday by a local scientist.</P>
      <P>The world has been experiencing more downpours and fewer drizzles in recent
years because of climate change, and the amount of precipitation brought by
typhoons is double that of 45 years ago, said Liu Shaw-chen, director of the
Research Center for Environmental Changes at the Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting held to discuss the prospects of the upcoming United
Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 slated for Dec. 7-18 in Copenhagen, Liu
said that with every one degree Celsius increase in the global temperature, the
chances of heavy rains in Taiwan rise by 140 percent, while the chances of
drizzles drop by 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The frequency of drizzles has already fallen,  with small rainfalls occurring
only 35 days a year in Taiwan today, compared with 70 days 45 years ago, he
said.</P>
      <P>That's a worrying trend, Liu said, because drizzles are the main source of fresh
water in spring and winter, and their decrease could lead to severe drought
during these two seasons.</P>
      <P>During the summer, however, the frequency of floods caused by heavy rains is
expected to record a rapid increase in the 21st century, Liu warned.</P>
      <P>The scientist also presented data showing that Taiwan's average surface air
temperature in the 20th century rose 1.1 degrees Celsius -- nearly double the
increase in the global average -- due mainly to global warming and the heat
island effect.</P>
      <P>The average global temperature rose 0.6 degrees Celsius during the century, and
Liu estimated that the temperature increase in the 21st century will be three to
six times higher, ranging between 1.8 degrees and 4 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>To help stop global warming, countries around the world should conserve energy
and work to develop alternative energy sources, such as solar power, wind power,
biomass energy and even nuclear power, he said.</P>

      <P>Fang Kuang-wei, 104 Job Bank's public relations manager, said one year after the
global financial crisis,  Taiwan's white-collar employees now sense a higher
degree of gratitude toward "those co-workers who have helped them in the
office."</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 47 percent of Taiwan's office workers prefer to
express their appreciation verbally, ahead of 31 percent who opt for "concrete
action to show their appreciation" and 23 percent who choose to "fully perform
their duties" as the best way to display their thankfulness.</P>
      <P>The poll was carried out over the Internet from Nov. 30-Dec. 1, collecting 1,529
valid responses. It has a margin of error of 2.51 percentage points.</P>

      <P>Though there appears to be little chance the European Union (EU) will soon begin
talks with Taiwan on a free trade agreement (FTA), the government will continue
to let the EU know its willingness to negotiate such a deal, Minister of
Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih said he expressed Taiwan's interest in discussing an FTA to Ewa Bjorling,
minister of trade of Sweden, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency,
when he met with her at a recent trade ministers' meeting of the World Trade
Organization (WT0) in Geneva, Switzerland, from Nov. 30-Dec. 2.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, however, Bjorling told him that it is not very possible that
the EU would start such talks with Taiwan at present as it is busy negotiating
several cooperation ventures with some regional organizations, including the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council.</P>
      <P>Shih insisted, however, that "we will continue to express our eagerness in this
regard."</P>
      <P>European Chamber of Commerce Taipei Chairman Philippe Pellegrin said in late
October that reaching an agreement between Taiwan and the EU on trade is a
pressing issue and much needed to advance two-way economic cooperation as well
as create job and investment opportunities for both parties.</P>
      <P>According to Pellegrin, the EU's GDP would increase by 2 billion euros, while
Taiwan's economy would expand by 3.8 billion euros if the EU and Taiwan were to
sign an FTA.</P>

      <P>Global warming is increasing the likelihood of climate extremes and could lead
to severe droughts in Taiwan in winter and spring as the frequency of small
rainfalls diminishes, according to data released Friday by a local scientist.</P>
      <P>The world has been experiencing more downpours and fewer drizzles in recent
years because of climate change, and the amount of precipitation brought by
typhoons is double that of 45 years ago, said Liu Shaw-chen, director of the
Research Center for Environmental Changes at the Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting held to discuss the prospects of the upcoming United
Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 slated for Dec. 7-18 in Copenhagen, Liu
said that with every one degree Celsius increase in the global temperature, the
chances of heavy rains in Taiwan rise by 140 percent, while the chances of
drizzles drop by 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The frequency of drizzles has already fallen,  with small rainfalls occurring
only 35 days a year in Taiwan today, compared with 70 days 45 years ago, he
said.</P>
      <P>That's a worrying trend, Liu said, because drizzles are the main source of fresh
water in spring and winter, and their decrease could lead to severe drought
during these two seasons.</P>
      <P>During the summer, however, the frequency of floods caused by heavy rains is
expected to record a rapid increase in the 21st century, Liu warned.</P>
      <P>The scientist also presented data showing that Taiwan's average surface air
temperature in the 20th century rose 1.1 degrees Celsius -- nearly double the
increase in the global average -- due mainly to global warming and the heat
island effect.</P>
      <P>The average global temperature rose 0.6 degrees Celsius during the century, and
Liu estimated that the temperature increase in the 21st century will be three to
six times higher, ranging between 1.8 degrees and 4 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>To help stop global warming, countries around the world should conserve energy
and work to develop alternative energy sources, such as solar power, wind power,
biomass energy and even nuclear power, he said.</P>

      <P>A projected world trade exhibition and convention center in southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung City is slated to begin operations in 2014 at the latest on the back
of an increased budget, a government official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Sheng-chung, vice minister of economic affairs, divulged the timetable when
he was asked, after giving a speech at the southern branch of the Executive
Yuan, why Kaohsiung, the largest city in southern Taiwan, still lacks a world-
class venue to hold exhibitions and conferences.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government is determined to promote the tourism, medical
care, logistics services, cultural innovation and exhibition sectors to upgrade
and transform Taiwan's economy, Lin noted that the service industry is
increasingly playing a prominent role in Taiwan's economy, contributing 73
percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product in 2008.</P>
      <P>Wang Chang-hua, head of the Kaohsiung office of the Bureau of Foreign Trade
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said the budget for building the planned
Kaohsiung world trade center has been increased to NT$3.68 billion (US$113.2
million) to cope with rising prices of construction materials, up from the
previous NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>Construction of the facility on a 4.5-hectare piece of land belonging to CPC
Corporation, Taiwan, near the Kaohsiung Software Park is scheduled to be

      <P>Seventeen of Taiwan's 25 counties and cities will have a new magistrate or mayor
as well as township chiefs or councilors on Saturday, with voters casting their
ballots between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. in the once-every-four years local elections.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Election Commission (CEC), a total of 54 candidates are
running in the county magistrate and city mayor elections, 18 of whom have been
nominated by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), 14 by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and one by the Hakka Party. The rest of the candidates
are running as independents.</P>
      <P>A total of 935 candidates are vying for 592 seats up for grabs in city and
county councils around the country, while 470 people are fighting for 211
township chief posts, the CEC said.</P>
      <P>The number of eligible voters in county magistrate and city mayoral elections
totals 7.05 million, while some 7.04 million people are eligible to vote in the
elections for city and county councilors and 6.23 million for the township chief
elections, it added.</P>
      <P>There are 6,384 polling stations and a total of 81,926 people to manage the
stations.</P>
      <P>Estimating that 60-65 percent of the eligible voters will go to polls and the
vote-counting is expected to be completed after 10 p.m., the CEC reminded
eligible voters to bring their identification cards, personal seals and voting
notifications to the ballot stations and advised those who develop cold systems
to wear face masks when going to vote.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih and Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, who cast their votes early
in the morning in their hometowns of Nantou County and Taoyuan County,
respectively, called on eligible voters to go to polls.</P>
      <P>"I hope that the election process will be very fair, equitable and transparent

      <P>The biggest of Saturday's battles is expected to be fought over the Kinmen
magistrate position, as seven people are running for the post.</P>
      <P>According to the Kinmen Airport authorities, eligible voters seemed to be
flocking back for the elections, as a total of 43 flights from Taiwan to Kinmen
on Friday were nearly all full, with an estimated 4,000 people arriving in the
county that same day.</P>
      <P>As eight cities and counties -- Taipei City, Taipei County, Taichung City,
Taichung County, Tainan City, Tainan County, Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County
-- will not elect new chiefs until late 2010, this year's elections will be held

      <P>Taiwan's exports are expected to have grown for the first time in more than a
year in November, after declining for 13 consecutive months, the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The November figures for export volume are scheduled to be released on Dec. 7.</P>
      <P>In October, export volume was valued at US$19.82 billion, the highest level
recorded over the past year since the outbreak of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>While the amount of exports in October still marked a contraction of 4.7 percent
compared with the same month last year, it nevertheless was the first single-
digit decline recorded so far this year.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-chen, chief of the MOF's Department of Statistics, said that as the
decline in exports has continued to narrow, November is a crucial month to watch
to see if Taiwan's exports have successfully emerged from the downturn.</P>
      <P>Driven by seasonal demand and a recovery, albeit small in Taiwan's major export
markets including the United States, Europe and Japan, the country's exports are
expected to further increase to US$20 billion in November, Lin said.</P>
      <P>She added that the exports could even post a positive year-on-year growth --
probably by double digits -- in November.</P>
      <P>The growth is likely to significantly expand in December, she predicted.</P>

      <P>All three candidates running for township chief in Guangfu township, eastern
Taiwan's Hualien County, have been detained on charges of buying votes, as
Taiwan's local elections in 17 of its 25 counties and cities kicked off
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Hualien District Court ordered earlier in the day the detention of Huang
Jung-cheng, the incumbent township chief, after prosecutors presented evidence
that alleged Huang was involved in vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Huang became the third candidate in the the township chief election who was
detained on a charge of vote-buying, after his two competitors Chen Wen-kuang
and Lin Yuan-juei were arrested each on a similar charge a few days ago.</P>
      <P>Officials in charge of elections in the county known for its scenic landscape
said that although all of the candidates have been detained, the election will
still continue.</P>
      <P>No matter who is elected, the winner can still be sworn in as the new township
chief and serve as township chief until he is found guilty, the officials said.</P>
      <P>All of the three defendants have insisted on their innocence.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who has been called a "Teflon-man" for his reputation
for fighting corruption in politics, has vowed to crack down on bribery in this
election.</P>
      <P>Amid Ma's vows,  the Ministry of Justice made public its statistics that showed
as of Friday, district prosecutors around the country had indicted 76 people for
vote-buying, 23 of whom were KMT members.</P>
      <P>A total of 150 people have been detained during the MOJ's move to keep
Saturday's elections clean, including 30 KMT members, 14 members of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party and 23 people who have no party

      <P>Some of the defendants and detained are candidates while others are the family
members or assistants of candidates, MOJ officials stated.</P>
      <P>Saturday's elections will produce new county magistrates and mayors, city and

Motse's lesson of the day: "When the administration of the ruler answers to the

disapprovals of the people. When there is such an understanding, the good will
be discovered and rewarded and the bad will be discovered and punished, and the
country will surely attain order."</TEXT>

      <P>As the economic recovery has brought a lot of orders to Taiwan's high-tech
companies, the real estate market in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu areaVthe island's
high-tech manufacturing base -- is expected to benefit most, with both housing
prices and trading volumes to set a record by the end of the year, according to
real estate brokerages.</P>
      <P>The local real estate agency U-trust said since high-tech businesses began
booming in the first quarter, home purchases and sales in Hsinchu have reached
7,600 in Q3, up from 7,500 in Q2, which was a 24 percent rise from the previous
quarter.</P>
      <P>Liu Pin-yao, a spokesman of the real estate agency, said he expected the housing
trade volume in the technology-based area for the year to not only exceed last
year's volume, but also reach an all-time high.</P>
      <P>Liu said the housing prices in Jhubei City, a transportation center of Hsinchu
County, reached NT$135,000 (US$4,192) per ping (3.305 square meters) in Q2,
nearly the same as last year's high of NT$136,000.</P>
      <P>The rising year-end bonuses offered by the high-tech companies will help
increase homebuying in Hsinchu by the end of the year, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the real estate market in Hsinchu's neighbor Taoyuan City, also
enjoyed growth. The city's newly-developed area around Taoyuan County Arts Park,
which will be completed by the end of this year, and the Nankan area, both saw a
growth rate of 40 percent for the prices of commercial property in the past two
years, he added.</P>
      <P>Property prices are also expected to rise in major cities in Taiwan, including
Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung. Many of the buyers are believed to be
speculators who are eying Taiwan markets as good places to invest in property.</P>
      <P>They expect the markets to grow after Taiwan signs the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China. Some of the buyers or
potential buyers are big domestic and overseas investors of properties which
have started to look for luxury mansions as investment targets in recent months.</P>
      <P>Greg Yeh, chief consultant at Evertrust Rehouse, said they have received many
queries about luxury mansions recently and just closed a deal worth over NT$100
million.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that based on the experience of Hong Kong's real estate prices, which
rose sharply after Hong Kong signed the closer economic partnership arrangement
(CEPA) with China in 2003, Taiwan's market prospects are also good.</P>
      <P>However, unlike Hong Kong, Taiwan is a democracy and the ruling party
Kuomintang, with an eye on keeping the presidency in the 2012 presidential
election, is eager to appease public dissatisfaction over the high prices of
property, which make it difficult for young couples, single people, or even
couples in their 40s or older to afford to buy their own property. Many are
living with their parents or parents-in-law.</P>
      <P>A recent  survey  conducted  by the government  found the unaffordable property
prices to be a major complaint of Taiwanese people,  prompting Premier Wu Den-
yih to announce the central government will make plans to build affordable
housing near subway lines.</P>

      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) said Saturday that no major violation has
been reported so far on election day, as over 7 million eligible voters are
scheduled to cast their ballots to elect new city mayors, county magistrates,
local councilors, as well as township heads.</P>
      <P>Teng Tien-yu, secretary-general of the CEC, said that the overall election
process went smoothly, with only a few minor violations.</P>
      <P>According to National Police Agency, as of 12:35 p.m., a total of 11 violations
involving 14 people had been reported, including five ballots that were torn up,
two taken out of the polling station, one person illegally displaying his
ballot, and another case involving the arrest of a wanted criminal when he went
to vote.</P>
      <P>Also, four people were arrested for alleged vote buying in Miaoli County, the
NPA said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the election committee in Hualien County reported another mild
violation in which a voter's cell phone went off while he was casting his
ballots. The voter was subject to a fine of at least NT$30,000 (US$ 931), as the
Public Officials Election and Recall Law stipulates that voters shall not take
mobile phones and cameras to polling stations and any violator shall be punished
with a fine from NT$30,000 to NT$300,000.</P>
      <P>As to a report to the authorities in Hsinchu County Friday night that some
councilor ballots were found by individuals before the election day, the Hsinchu
County election committee issued a press release Saturday saying that no ballots
were missing after a careful inventory was conducted, but the district
prosecutors are still investigating the report.</P>
      <P>Many of the party heavyweights had also performed their election duties,
including Premier Wu Den-yih, who went to vote in his hometown Nantou County
Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>"The people are above all else. We have to respect the decision made by their
sacred ballots, " said the premier, who expressed hope of seeing a fair,
equitable and transparent election.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Wu Poh-hsiung, honorary chairman of the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT), appeared to be trying to maintain a low-profile by not going to the
polling station with his son Wu Chih-yang, who is running for the magistrate
position in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The KMT honorary chairman spoke only through his party members that he was not
in any position to speak publicly on the elections given that he no longer holds
any public office in the government or the party.</P>
      <P>Seventeen of Taiwan's 25 counties and cities around Taiwan will have their
maigistrate or mayor, as well as township chiefs or councilors on Saturday, with
voters casting their ballots between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. in the once-every-four
years local elections.</P>
      <P>As eight cities and counties -- Taipei City, Taipei County, Taichung City,
Taichung County, Tainan City, Tainan County, Kaohsiung Cit and Kaohsiung County
-- will not elect new chiefs until late 2010, this year's elections will be held
in only 17 of Taiwan's 25 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Election Commission (CEC), the number of eligible
voters in county magistrate and city mayoral elections totals 7.05 million, with
some 7.04 million people eligible to vote in the elections for city and county
councilors and 6.23 million in the township chief elections.</P>
      <P>Estimating that 60-65 percent of the eligible voters will go to polls, the CEC
said the vote-counting is expected to be completed after 10 p.m.</P>

      <P>If the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) could garner more votes in this year's
local elections compared to the election in 2005, it would mean that Chairwoman
Tsai Ying-wen's reformatory approach to running the opposition party has won
voters' support, DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Should the DPP win more than the 38.2 percent of the votes which it grabbed
four years ago, such an outcome would mean that voters are supportive of the
reformatory approach adopted by Chairwoman Tsai Ying-wen," the DPP spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>But Tsai Ying-wen will definitely assume the responsibility if the DPP grabs
fewer seats than four years ago, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The DPP currently controls Yunlin, Chiayi and Pingtung counties, and hopes to
take back the magistrate of Ilan, where it stands a good chance of defeating the
KMT incumbents. The opposition party has estimated that it will win in Ilan
County by a narrow margin.</P>
      <P>The elections of city mayors and county magistrates, as well as local councilors
and township chief kicked off Saturday at 8: 00 a.m. The polls closed at 5: 00
p.m., with results expected after 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>It was estimated that 60-65 percent of some seven million eligible voters went
to the polls scattered across 17 cities and counties.</P>

      <P>Roger Yonchien Tsien, a 2008 Nobel laureate in chemistry, will arrive in Taiwan
next week for a four-day visit during which he will discuss his discoveries, the
organizer said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-American chemist is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech titled
"Painting cell signals with a palette of fluorescent proteins" at Academia
Sinica on Friday, and another titled "building molecules to image and help treat
cancer and inflammatory disease" at the National Taiwan University Dec. 14,
according to a statement released by the Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Currently  a professor  of the Chemistry  and Biochemistry Department at the
University of California, San Diego, Tsien won the Nobel Prize with two other
scientists, Martin Chalfie and Osamu Shimomura,  for their discovery and
development  of the green fluorescent protein (GFP).</P>
      <P>Among the co-winners, Tsien made unprecedented contributions to the general
understanding of how GFP fluoresces, and extended the color palette beyond
green, allowing researchers to give various proteins and cells different colors.</P>
      <P>The discovery of GFP has led to its widespread use as a tagging tool in
bioscience research. By using DNA technology, researchers can now use GFP as a
fluorescent marker to help better observe the movements, positions and
interactions of tagged proteins.</P>

      <P>An injured dwarf sperm whale stranded on a beach close to a military harbor in
Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, was rescued and taken to a dolphin and whale
rescue center Saturday.</P>
      <P>The whale, which is over 2.5 meters long and weighs over 400 kilograms, ran
aground on the beach after suffering what appeared to be shark-bite wounds, said
Wang Chien-ping, a professor at the Tainan-based National Cheng Kung
University's Marine Biology and Cetacean Research Center who helped in the
rescue.</P>
      <P>Wang said after checking on the whale, he spotted three wounds on its back,
which imply it might have been attacked by sharks.</P>
      <P>Judging from its size, it is a "grandfather" whale, Wang said, adding that he
believes the whale was left behind by its companions after becoming injured.</P>
      <P>The Marine Corps Command received a report of the stranded whale on the Zuoying
Taosiyuan beach earlier in the day. It then contacted Wang for his assistance,
according to Marine officers.</P>
      <P>If the whale is taken back to sea in its current condition, it may not be able
to survive, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Dwarf sperm whales are the smallest of all whales. Normally, it grows up to 2.7
meters in length and 250 kilograms in weight -- making it smaller than the
bigger dolphins.</P>
      <P>The species makes slow, deliberate movements with little splashes or blows and
will usually lie motionless when at the sea's surface. Consequently it can be
observed only in very calm seas.</P>

      <P>The last piece of work the 19th century Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh painted
while he was in an asylum was unveiled in Taipei Saturday in the final countdown
to the special three-month exhibition scheduled to open here on Dec. 11.</P>
      <P>The painting "Country Road in Provence by Night, " also known as "Road with
Cypress and Star, " was unboxed Saturday in Taipei. It is the last piece van
Gogh created during his stay at the asylum in Saint Remy, Provence. The Dutch
master had said that the painting would be the last time he painted stars.</P>
      <P>"The painting represents van Gogh's view on the universe. People can feel the
energy in the painter's life when they appreciate the painting," Evert  van
Straaten,  director  of  the Netherlands-based Kroller-Muller Museum, said about
the piece, which is the museum's crown jewel.</P>
      <P>The museum, which has the second-largest van Gogh collection in the world,
loaned most of 98 van Gogh paintings that will be on display, to the National
Museum of History for the exhibition in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Van Straaten is in Taiwan to attend an opening ceremony on Dec. 10,
demonstrating the importance he attaches to the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Van Straaten said the exhibition, which has one quarter of the Kroller-Muller
Museum collection on van Gogh's oil paintings and some of his sketches in the
early stage, will provide art enthusiasts a more comprehensive picture of the
Dutch artist's creations.</P>
      <P>According to van Straaten, it was very difficult for his museum to collect van
Gogh's work, as the Dutch painter had requested his family not to let his
paintings get in the hands of other people.</P>
      <P>Museum founder Helene Kroller-Muller had traveled across Europe and used all
kinds of means to collect van Gogh's paintings through exchanges or trading with
other painters' works, Straaten said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Van Gogh: The Flaming Soul, " is scheduled to run from
Dec. 11 to March 28 at the National Museum of History, featuring 98 of van
Gogh's works -- 77 drawings and 21 oil paintings.</P>
      <P>One painting in the exhibit -- Vase with Flower and Thistles -- is on loan from
Japan's Pola Museum of Art.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Yung-chuan, director of the National Museum of History, the
van Gogh exhibit has a record insurance amount of NT$25 billion (US$776
million).</P>

      <P>The new liquid crystal display (LCD) giant Chimei Innolux Corp., which will be
created by the merger of Innolux Display Corp and Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO),
may face over capacity problems once the merger goes into effect, Topology
Research Institute (TRI) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Corwin Lee, an analyst at the Taipei-based TRI, said while the computer-monitor
maker Innolux still needs to produce large quantities of monitors, some of its
clients who are competitors of its merger partner, may cancel their orders after
the merger.</P>
      <P>Therefore Chimei Innolux would find it difficult to digest all its capacity at
its production lines of monitors and notebook panels, according to the analyst.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Chi Mei Innolux may need to seek more external orders to solve its
over capacity problems.</P>
      <P>In terms of the fifth and sixth generation production lines, Chi Mei owns two
fifth, one 5.5th and one sixth generation lines; Innolux has one fifth
generation line, while its sixth generation production line will not enter mass
production stage until next year, according to industry sources.</P>
      <P>The merger, which was announced last month, is expected to be completed by
March.</P>
      <P>After the merger, Chi Mei Innolux will overtake AU Optronics Corp. as Taiwan's
biggest maker of LCD panels by capacity, and will rank among the world's three
biggest LCD producers. Korea's Samsung Electronics and LG Display currently lead
the industry.</P>
      <P>With Chi Mei now occupying the largest market share of China' s LCD TV panels,
this will also help absorb the new Chimei Innolux's capacity at its fifth and
sixth generation production lines, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Innolux, which leads the world in shipments of flat- panel computer monitors, is
an affiliate of Hon Hai Group, the world's largest contract electronics maker.
Its merger with Chi Mei was seen as another acquisition move by Hon Hai to
further expand the scope of its operations.</P>
      <P>With Chi Mei holding the number one market share of China's LCD TVs, industry
experts predicted that Hon Hai, by merging with Chi Mei, wants to grab a big
market share of China's LCD TV sets assembly business.</P>
      <P>In addition, TRI's Lee noted that the merger may also lead to some local talents
hopping to China's LCD companies.</P>

      <P>The number of tourists to Taiwan hit a record high Saturday, as the country
welcomed its 4 millionth visitor, a woman from Japan, according to the Tourism
Bureau.</P>
      <P>The 62-year-old  Suzuyo  Goto  arrived  at Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport
Saturday along with two friends for a six-day sightseeing trip.</P>
      <P>After learning that she was the 4 millionth visitor, Goto could hardly contain
her surprise and excitement, saying that after recovering from a serious illness
in February, she decided to take a trip with her friends.</P>
      <P>As part of an incentive program to encourage more tourists to visit Taiwan, the
Tourism Bureau awarded Goto a debit card valued at NT$400,000 (US$12, 419) to be
spent exclusively in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 1 millionth, 2 millionth and 3 millionth visitors also received similar
debit cards, but with lower values, when they arrived earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Goto also received a commemorative certificate and souvenirs presented by David
W. J. Hsieh, deputy director-general of the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>Despite the economic downturn, the number of tourists to Taiwan has grown this
year, according to the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>"The number of tourists to Taiwan has significantly outnumbered last year's
(3.85 million) . The original target was 4.1 million visitors (this year) and
now we estimate that it could be more than 4.2 million," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau has set a target of attracting 4.5 million tourists for 2010,
he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which has previously placed little focus on developing its tourism
industry, has recognized in recent years that its abundance in natural scenic
beauty and cultural assets can be used to encourage more tourists to come here
and develop the tourism industry as a boost to the economy.</P>
      <P>After the launch of the "Tour Taiwan Years 2008-2009" program that kicked off
Feb. 15, 2008, the government invested NT$1 billion to boost foreign tourist
arrivals.</P>
      <P>Much of the growth in overseas tourists is due to mainland Chinese tourists, who
were allowed to come to Taiwan in large numbers for the first time last year.
Expanded direct flights between Taiwan and mainland China this year also led to
more Chinese tourists coming here.</P>
      <P>Goto and her friends are scheduled to visit the National Palace Museum in Taipei
and sightsee in other cities, such as Hualien, Taichung and Kaohsiung.</P>

      <P>Award-winning Taiwanese fashion designer, Johan Ku, said that he may create his
own brand under his name in the future, while revealing a plan to fly home to
Taiwan for a short visit in mid-December to hold a presentation of his works.</P>
      <P>Ku, owner of the Johan Ku Design Studio, recently won the top prize in the
Avant-Garde design category of the 2009 Gen Art's Styles International Design
Competition, with one of his 2004 designs -- a knitted one-piece wool dress that
highlights the delicacy of the yarn and displays creative patterns.</P>
      <P>The 30-year-old attended the award ceremony in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday.
He will fly back to London, where he is studying art, on Saturday to continue
studying at the Central Saint Martins School of Art and Design.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the Central News Agency before leaving for the U.K., Ku said he
wants to show Taiwanese people 10 pieces of works he created in recent years, to
tell them how he creates "sculpture-like" knitwear, Ku said.</P>
      <P>As the media has attributed Ku's victory in the New York contest to his
ingenuity, Ku encouraged other Taiwanese fashion talents to be creative and
confident in their works.</P>
      <P>"So long as the works are creative, and so creative that they can conquer the
international community, they will definitely be given applause generously by
the community," he said.</P>
      <P>While encouraging local designers to eye the global markets, the award winner
suggested the Taiwanese government offer more support to those in the cultural
and creative industries.</P>
      <P>There should be a set of incentive measures to assist talented people in

    <HEADLINE>Old camphor tree near university saved by students from removal</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An old camphor tree over 70 years old in Taipei City was saved by a group of
students of the National Taiwan University and nearby residents Saturday when a
land developer was about to clear it from a piece of land in order to start the
construction of an apartment building.</P>
      <P>The old camphor tree is among a line of old trees along Hsuchow Road that sits
on a piece of land which a land developer has acquired for the construction of a
big apartment building.</P>
      <P>The land developer held a briefing in May, explaining it wanted to remove the
tree and transplant it elsewhere.</P>
      <P>However, residents in the neighborhood and faculty and students of the
university insisted that removal of the old camphor tree would spoil the "green
tunnel" formed by old trees along the road where the tree is located.</P>
      <P>Several protests have been held over the past few months whenever the developer
sends in workers to remove the tree, whose ownership is ambiguous.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-shen, secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan, said Saturday that
trees should be considered public properties. The land developer, however, has
argued that as owner of the land, the company is entitled to decide whether to
remove the tree.</P>
      <P>The land developer complained that the construction project has been delayed for
months and caused serious losses to the company. It is hoping that the city
authorities will make a decision over the tree transplantation proposal as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>For now, the old camphor tree is saved because under the city bylaw, before the
Bureau of Public Works issues an approval to the land developer, it cannot be
touched, and the land developer has not received a written permission from the
bureau stating it can remove the tree, according to Pan.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Taipei City Government has put into enforcement the
Taipei City Tree Protection Bylaw since April 2003, many old trees in the
metropolitan area have been uprooted, with some transplanted, in recent years by
land developers.</P>
      <P>Under the tree protection bylaw, old trees aged over 50 years and big trees with
the girth exceeding 15 meters or the height reaching 15 meters are under
protection.</P>
      <P>To root up a protected tree for whatever purposes needs the approval of the city
government's Bureau of Public Works. Usually the authorities would approve the
cases when proper arrangements for transplantation are made.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Kuomingtang (KMT) party lost the Ilan County magistrate race to
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in local elections Saturday,
with the KMT candidate, incumbent Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua, vowing to shoulder the
responsibilities of losing the ruling party's control of a key county.</P>
      <P>Final vote counts showed that the DPP's candidate Lin Tsong-shyan defeated Lu by
more than 20,925 votes. Lin grossed 54.26 percent of the more than 245,000 votes
cast in the race, while the KMT's Lu won 45.74 percent of the votes.</P>
      <P>Lin's victory Saturday ends the relatively brief rule by the KMT over the
largely agricultural  county.  Before Lu was elected magistrate of Ilan in 2005,
the county went through 24 years, or six terms, of non-partisan and DPP rule.</P>
      <P>Ilan was the most fiercely fought battleground in Saturday's elections of
magistrates, mayors, city and county councillors, and township chiefs in 17 of
Taiwan's 25 counties and cities.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou rallied for his party's candidate in Ilan on the eve of
the election. Also attending the campaign rally was Premier Wu Den-yi and
Speaker of the Legislative Yuan Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>The DPP had also fully mobilized its forces, with party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen,
former Premier (2002-2005) and Ilan county magistrate (1989-1997) Yu Shyi-kun,
and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu supporting party nominee Lin at his campaign rally
on the eve of the election.</P>
      <P>While the KMT was hoping to safeguard the region, DPP politicians had emphasized
the importance of regaining control of a key county in northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai stressed the significance of winning back Ilan County for
the opposition party.</P>
      <P>"Ilan signifies as the first domino piece to incur a political transition, and
the battle in Ilan is the first struggle for DPP's revival," Tsai said Friday
evening at Lin's campaign rally.</P>
      <P>The DPP had controlled Taiwan's presidency for eight years from 2000 to 2008.
Not only did the opposition party lose the presidency, but it also suffered
significant losses in the legislative elections in 2007.</P>
      <P>Lin, 47, a native of Ilan County, has served as chief of Lotung Township in Ilan
since 2001. With his administrative experience at the Ilan City mayor's office
and impressive performance as township chief , he won the DPP nomination for the
magistrate race.</P>
      <P>Lin spoke of the legacy of former magistrate Chen Ting-nan (1981-1989) and
promised to preserve the natural resources and to make Ilan County the most
beautiful community on the island.</P>
      <P>The administration of the two-term magistrate Chen was frequentl referred to as
a model at Lin's campaign rallies. Chen died on Nov. 5, 2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Newly-elected Hualien magistrate vows to build expressway</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
12/05/09  22:33:47
(By C. T. Liu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fu Kun-chi, the victorious independent candidate for the magistrate seat in
eastern Taiwan's Hualien County vowed Saturday to build an expressway for
Hualien residents, who have long  endured  transportation  inconvenience  due
to  backward infrastructure in the remote county.</P>
      <P>Fu made the pledge at his campaign headquarters after declaring victory in the
race, which was part of the elections for city mayors, county magistrates as
well as city and county councilors and township chiefs held in 17 out of
Taiwan's 25 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Fu's election as Hualien county magistrate marked the first-ever defeat of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in the magistrate posts in the eastern Taiwan county --
a traditional KMT stronghold which has long enjoyed firm backing from more than
70 percent of the local people.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has made little progress in Hualien
County in previous elections and did not nominate any candidate to run in the
race.</P>
      <P>Fu, who was expelled by the KMT for insisting on standing for the top post in
the Hualien county government without the party's nomination, garnered 56.37
percent of the votes, or 85,532 votes.</P>
      <P>Despite competition from Chang Chih-ming, another independent candidate backed
by incumbent Hualien County Magistrate  Hsieh Shen-shan, Fu still took a
remarkable lead over KMT hopeful Tu Li-hua, who seized 38,603 votes in the
contest.</P>
      <P>Observers attributed Fu's election success to his long-term management at the
grass-roots level and his close links with local opinion leaders and township
chiefs, who have formed a strong network of support for Fu in past legislative
elections and Saturday's local race.</P>
      <P>Fu has been a legislator three times and is still serving his third tenure.</P>
      <P>He stressed after winning the race that he will definitely construct a safe
expressway for Hualien people so they can travel easily between major cities in
Taiwan, where many of them work, and their hometowns in Hualien.</P>
      <P>Fu said the issue will be his top priority after he assumes office, because
Hualien residents are not inferior citizens, meaning they deserve to have
convenient transportation like other residents in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fu is appealing a six-and-a-half-year sentence for violating securities trading
regulations, and this is the reason why the KMT, under the slogan of President
Ma Ying-jeou's  call for clean governance, opted for Tu despite Fu's widespread
popularity in Hualien County.</P>

      <P>Cai Chien-hsing, the defeated candidate of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in the election for county magistrate held in Taiwan's outlying
archipelago Penghu, demanded a recount after losing the race Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the final election results made public by the Central Election
Commission, Wang Chien-fa, the incumbent Penghu county magistrate and hopeful of
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), grabbed 22,664 votes in the election, edging out
Cai with a slim margin of 595 votes.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Cai refused to concede defeat and said he lost
the race to Wang by only 420 votes.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that there are more than 1,000 invalid ballots, saying that
raises suspicions about the voting process.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wang said he has asked the Penghu District Court to seal
all the ballot boxes for a vote recount on the grounds that justice must be
served.</P>
      <P>The court has not indicated whether it will agree to Wang's demand.</P>
      <P>Penghu Island is located southwest of Kaohsiung County and some 100,000 people
have their households registered there despite the fact that the number of
permanent residents is only around 60,000. Many Penghu people work in other
parts of Taiwan, but continue to maintain their household registration in
Penghu.</P>
      <P>The election in Penghu was part of elections held in 17 counties and cities in
Taiwan for magistrates, mayors, city and county councillors as well as township
chiefs. The local level elections are held once every four years.</P>

the 2009 East Asian Games men's basketball tournament after defeating Mongolia
132-94 at the games in Hong Kong Saturday, qualifying for the semifinals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT to carry out thorough review of election results: Ma</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's President and Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that the
ruling party will carry out a " thorough" review of its performance in the just
concluded local elections, in which the opposition party gained control of one
more county.</P>
      <P>The KMT managed to maintain a majority -- 12 seats -- in elections of county
magistrates and city mayors, but lost the magistracy of Ilan country in the
northeastern Taiwan to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and of
Hualien County in eastern Taiwan to independent Fu Kun-chi, who was formerly a
KMT member.</P>
      <P>The corruption-tainted Fu's party membership was evoked after he insisted on
running in the election in defiance of the party's decision.</P>
      <P>The DPP won four seats in the elections, one more than it won in the previous
election four years ago. It also gained 45.32 percent of the votes cast, which
was up from the 38 percent in the last election.</P>
      <P>The KMT won 47.87 percent of all votes cast in the elections.</P>
      <P>"The relatively unsatisfactory results for the KMT in terms of the number of
county and city administrators and ratio of votes won have been deeply related
to the environment unfavorable to the ruling party, and we will conduct a
thorough review," Ma told a news conference at the KMT headquarters in Taipei
City, after the results were released.</P>
      <P>"We should be grateful since the voters still gave the party the chance to
continue its rule of 12 counties or cities up for grabs even in the face of the
economic downturn and high unemployment," Ma said, adding that his party will
"honestly face the message of warning sent by the elections and seek to
reenergize the economy so as to ensure a better tomorrow for the people."</P>
      <P>He said the KMT will stick to the principle of "clean politics" in nominating
candidates for future elections even though it lost control of Hualien county to
party maverick Fu.</P>
      <P>Fu is appealing his eight and a half years sentence on charges of violating
securities trading regulations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruing Kuomintang (KMT) won an overwhelming victory in elections of
county and city councilors as well as township chiefs Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ruling party secured 289 of the 592 seats up for grabs in the elections of
councilors in 17 of the 25 counties and cities in the country.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), gained control of 128
townships, followed by the minor Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) which won three
seats, and the People First Party (PFP) and the Labor Party, which won one seat
each. The remaining 170 seats went to independents.</P>
      <P>The ratios of votes won in the councilor elections were: the KMT, 43.94 percent;
the DPP, 24.41 percent; the TSU, 0.62 percent; the PFP, 0.13 percent, while the
independents won 30.76 percent of the votes cast.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT kept its dominance in township administrator offices by
wining 121 seats out of the 211 seats contested, while the DPP took control of
34 townships. The remaining 56 township offices were captured by independents.</P>
      <P>The ratios of votes won by the KMT in the township elections stood at 48.81
percent; for the DPP, 20.04 percent; and independents, 30.87 percent.</P>
      <P>The ruling party managed to win 12 seats in the county and city magistrate and
mayors elections, but lost the magistrate offices in Ilan in northeastern Taiwan
to the DPP and Hualien in eastern Taiwan to an independent.</P>
      <P>Elections for eight other Taiwan counties and cities -- the city and county of
Taipei, the city and county of Taichung, the city and county of Tainan, and the
city and county of Kaohsiung -- will be held in late 2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Time for KMT to improve administrative efficiency: business sector</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
12/06/09  15:41:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local business leader said Sunday in the wake of hotly contested  local
elections in which the ruling Kuomintang gave a less-than-stellar performance
that it is time for the administration to conduct soul-searching and come up
with plans to improve its administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>Chang Ping-chao, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, said the KMT
should probe the reasons why it has lost popularity in some cities and counties,
and give serious thought as to how to further improve efficiency.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT won the mayoral or magistrate seats in 12 out of 17 cities and
counties in Saturday's elections, it lost two of its former magistrate seats and
the party's nominees only grossed 47.88 percent of the 4,466,403 ballots cast.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, meanwhile, won 1,982,914 of the
votes cast, or 45.32 percent, a much higher ratio in comparison with the 41.95
percent it won in the last local elections four years ago.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the local elections had nothing to do with the KMT
administration's overall economic policy and cross-Taiwan Strait policy, with
the latter enjoying an approval rating of over 60 percent.</P>
      <P>He attributed the KMT's loss of support in some cities and counties mainly to
the impact and implications of the global economic meltdown and the high
unemployment rate since late 2008, as well as the massive destruction caused by
Typhoon Morakot in southern and eastern Taiwan earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Tsai Lien-sheng, secretary-general of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries, said Taiwan has begun to bottom out from the economic
meltdown and is now set to rebound.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT administration steers firmly, its approval ratings will rebound
soon," Tsai predicted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Dah Chang Securities spokesman said the KMT's defeat in Yilan and
Hualien counties will temporarily impact the performance of the Taiwan bourse,
forecasting that the TAIEX index will lose ground for two days or even only one
day when the market re-opens Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman explained that the election results unfolded as generally
expected, while the market is now rich in funds and the global financial shock
caused by Dubai's debt worries last week seems to have passed.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-tung, a manager with Capital Investment Trust, said investors stayed on
the sidelines in the week before the elections and also predicted that if the
election results adversely impact the TAIEX, the fluctuation will only be
temporary.</P>
      <P>"The market will return to its fundamentals in one week, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, John Brebeck, a fund expert with Yuanta Securities, said he does not
see the local election results having any negative impact on the KMT
administration's ability to steer the nation.</P>
      <P>"Whenever the TAIEX index falls is a good time to buy, " Brebeck said, adding
that the local stock market will turn bullish from now until the first quarter
of 2010. (By Lin Ye-fong, Lawrence Chiu, Yu-Pin Tien, Carol Yeh and Deborah Kuo)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet will remain under pressure to tackle unemployment and many
other issues after the ruling party took only 12 of the 17 mayor and magistrate
seats up for grabs in Saturday's local elections, political analysts said a day
after polling.</P>
      <P>Although the Kuomintang  (KMT)  secured a majority in the elections,  it lost
the magistrate  seat of Yilan County  in northeastern Taiwan to the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and that of Hualien County in eastern Taiwan
to independent Fu Kun-chi, who was expelled by the KMT for insisting in vying
for the seat against party wishes.</P>
      <P>The KMT won 47.88 percent of the votes cast, lower than the 50.96 percent it won
in the last mayor and magistrate elections of 23 counties and cities in 2005.</P>
      <P>The DPP won four seats, one more than it won in the elections four years ago. It
also gained 45.32 percent of the vote, up from the 38 percent it won in the last
election.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also KMT chairman, admitted at a post-election
press conference Saturday that the outcome of the elections was not "ideal" for
his administration and that the party's decline in local government seats and
vote share was a "warning" that the KMT will have to address.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Sunday that the administration  is expected to face
increasing challenges in boosting employment and reviving the economy, as well
as in carrying out post-Typhoon Morakot reconstruction work and dealing with a
looming water shortage in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma promised Nov. 15 at a ground-breaking ceremony for a permanent housing park
in Kaohsiung County to accommodate typhoon victims that the first batch of 600
houses is scheduled for completion at the end of January next year.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is therefore racing against time to complete the construction
project in line with Ma's promise, according to the analysts.</P>
      <P>With the water stored in reservoirs in southern Taiwan and the Gaoping River
being lower than past annual averages, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu convened an
inter-ministerial meeting Dec. 2 to review water supplies in all areas of the
country and develop response measures.</P>
      <P>A consensus was reached during the meeting that before the flood season between
next May and November, the government should ensure that water for public
consumption and industrial use in Taiwan is not seriously affected.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency said at the meeting that measures to stop irrigation
and planting in parts of the south might be unavoidable, with the affected areas
slated to be announced in late December.</P>
      <P>Another major challenge for the government is addressing the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said earlier in the month that as unemployment is an
indicator of a lagging economy, the government is treating boosting employment
as one of its top priorities.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is therefore working to map out employment promotion measures with
the goal of creating 99,000 jobs, since 2008-2009 short-term employment
promotion measures will conclude at the end of this year and about 45,000 people
working temporary jobs offered under the program will find themselves out of
work at that time.</P>
      <P>The other important task for the government will be continuing its preventive
measures for influenza A(H1N1) . The Department of Health will have provided 120
million doses of free H1N1 vaccine for local use before the lunar new year, the
analysts said.</P>
      <P>Other tests for the government will be the security measures it puts in place
for China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, who will visit Taiwan for
the next round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks later this month in Taichung City,
as well as issues related to signing a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, the analysts added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu will also be under pressure to implement a plan to improve
citizens' lives that is part of a concept of "grassroots economy" he floated
since becoming premier two months ago, according to the analysts.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese fashion designer Johan Ku, whose winning of a top prize in the 2009
Gen Art's Styles International Design Competition has gone viral, is planning to
return to Taiwan this month for a solo show of his designs.</P>
      <P>Ku told CNA Saturday that he plans to show the Taiwanese people 10 works he has
created in recent years to show them how he creates his "sculpture-like"
knitwear.</P>
      <P>"Nothing is final yet, but I hope the presentation can take place at Eslite
Books' Dunnan Store in eastern Taipei City," Ku said during a dinner hosted in
his honor by Taiwan's representative in New York, Kao Chen-chun.</P>
      <P>Ku, owner of the Johan Ku Design Studio, recently won the top prize in the
avant-garde design category of the 2009 Gen Art's Styles International Design
Competition, a major fashion design competition in the United States for
emerging talent.</P>
      <P>He won the prestigious prize with one of his 2004 designs -- a knitted series
that highlights the versatility of yarn and displays creative patterns.</P>
      <P>The 30-year-old  attended an award ceremony in New York's Manhattan Dec. 2
before flying Saturday back to London where he is pursuing postgraduate art
studies at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design.</P>
      <P>During the dinner, Ku recounted how he managed to complete his undergraduate and
postgraduate studies in fashion design at two universities in Taiwan after
graduating from vocational high school, and how he stuck to his guns to pursue
what he really wanted.</P>
      <P>Ku also noted how impressed he was by the help given in Europe and the United
States to young designers and said Taiwan should also provide assistance to
young people seeking to make their mark in the creative industry.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has no lack of creative talent willing to work hard, " Ku noted.</P>
      <P>Regarding his planned presentation in Taipei, set to take place in mid-December,
Ku expressed hope that entrepreneurs will want to buy his works, which will
allow him to raise funds to continue creating more fashion or to establish his
own brand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP gets election boost but more challenges ahead</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
12/06/09  17:14:30
(By Sophia Yeh, Wen Kui-hsiang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) received a major boost when it
retained three of its magistrate seats and retook the significant Yilan County
in Saturday's local elections.</P>
      <P>Even though the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) won 12 out of the 17 mayor and
magistrate seats up for grabs, its support base was weakened in several
localities. The ratio of votes won by the KMT this time was lower than the 50.96
percent it won in the last elections of 23 magistrates and mayors in 2005.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the DPP's Yilan victory, along with the retention of its other
three seats and the major gains it made in the KMT's traditional strongholds of
Penghu and Taitung, were seen by the party as affirmation of the leadership of
DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who took over the party helm in May 2008 at a time
when the party was in disarray  in the wake of the snowballing  corruption
scandal surrounding former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the DPP also saw its share of the vote increased from the
41.95 percent it won four years ago to 45.32 percent, compared with the KMT's
47.88 percent, this could mean that the party is now out of the shadow of the
disgraced ex-president, according to DPP sources.</P>
      <P>Tsai has successfully stemmed the party's slipping popularity, but her real
challenge will be a DPP chair election next May, municipality elections in late
2010 and even the party's strategy for the 2012 presidential election, a party
official said.</P>
      <P>With Saturday's "minor victory, " the party official said, more people will be
interested in joining the race in the municipality elections set for next year.</P>
      <P>Even before Saturday's elections, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu and Kaohsiung
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing had reportedly been bickering, as both are known to
be interested in running in the 2010 election, when the city and county will be
merged into a single municipality.</P>
      <P>Tsai mediated between the two prior to Saturday's election, requesting them to
"put party unity on the pedestal," but their fight for the candidacy is expected
to start again.</P>
      <P>The usually low-key Tsai was obviously happy late Saturday about the party's
performance, saying that she was "gratified about the growth, but the outcome
has not changed the basic structure of the electorate."</P>
      <P>She described  the elections  as "the  people  casting  a no-confidence vote
against the performance over the past 18 months of the President Ma Ying-jeou
administration."</P>
      <P>She attributed the KMT setback to its "wrong policy," saying that the Ma
administration's rapid China-tilt policy has led to uneasiness among the people.</P>
      <P>Another reason, she went on, is the Ma administration's poor efficiency and
ability.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that the retaking of Yilan shows that the DPP has "regained the
trust of the voters."</P>
      <P>In other localities, even thought DPP candidates did not win, the ballots they

    <HEADLINE>KMT's election setback makes political talks more difficult</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
12/06/09  18:40:19
(By Huang Chi-kuan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The less-than-ideal showing of Taiwan's ruling party in the weekend mayor and
magistrate elections has made it even more difficult for the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to begin talks on sensitive political issues, a Chinese scholar
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Zhang Duncai, deputy director of Xiamen University's Taiwan Research Institute
in southeastern China's Fujian Province, said the just-concluded local elections
in Taiwan could be characterized as a setback for the Kuomintang (KMT) and a
gain for the pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, the KMT administration, while unlikely to retrench its
cross-strait engagement policy, is also not likely to promote bilateral
relations at a pace as fast as in the past one-and-a-half years," Zhang forecast
in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>Zhang said he expects cross-strait  economic  and cultural exchanges  to
continue  in the wake  of the elections,  with institutionalized  engagements
between  the  two quasi-official intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits -- proceeding without interruption and the communication  platform
between the KMT and the Communist Party of China remaining on track.</P>
      <P>However, he also predicted that Taiwan's government will become more reluctant
to promote any cross-strait programs that might eclipse or undermine  President
Ma Ying-jeou's  administrative achievements or the KMT's power base.</P>
      <P>"Political issues, in particular, will be least likely to be brought to the
negotiating table in the foreseeable future, " Zhang said.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's elections, the KMT captured 12 out of the 17 mayor and magistrate
seats up for grabs, while the DPP took four seats and the remaining seat went to
an independent.</P>
      <P>Zhang analyzed that in terms of numbers, the KMT only suffered a small loss of
two seats -- one to a DPP challenger and the other to a KMT maverick  who ran as
an independent  without the party's endorsement -- while the DPP only scored a
minor gain by winning one more seat than it garnered in the previous elections
held four years ago.</P>
      <P>However, in terms of the vote share, the KMT's loss could be branded as a major
defeat, as it grossed only 47.88 percent of the total, far less than the 51.8
percent share it won in the 2005 election, Zhang said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, he went on, the DPP scored a significant gain, securing a record
45.32 percent share.</P>
      <P>Zhang also said that the results indicate that Ma's political star is fading.</P>
      <P>"One of the indicators was Fu Kun-chi's defeat of the KMT candidate in the
Hualien magistrate election by an enormous margin, " Zhang analyzed.</P>
      <P>Fu was expelled from the KMT after insisting on running for the eastern county's
magistrate  post in defiance  of the party's nomination policy.</P>
      <P>Another proof of Ma's declining star power was seen in incumbent Yilan
Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua's loss of his reelection bid to his DPP challenger  Lin
Tsong-shyan.  Ma traveled  extensively  in the northeastern county in the run-up
to the election to stump for Lu in his capacity as KMT chairman, but to no
avail.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, it is still far too early to write a political obituary for Ma, as
shown in KMT nominee Chiu Ching-chun's success in winning the Hsinchu magistrate
post, Zhang noted.</P>
      <P>Chiu fought a tight race against two strong challengers -- one from the DPP and
the other from Hsinchu County Council Speaker Chang Pi-chin who ran as an
independent. Without Ma's strong backing, many analysts said, Chiu might not
have emerged as the final victor.</P>
      <P>"Generally speaking, the results show that supporters of the KMT-led blue camp
have used their ballots to teach Ma a lesson on the one hand, but they also
affirm his determination to promote clean politics. Under Ma's leadership, the
KMT has rejected nominating politicians involved in corruption allegations to
run for public posts," said Zhang.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's elections, the KMT also saw its leads in two of its traditional
strongholds -- Taitung County and the offshore county of Penghu -- greatly
reduced.</P>
      <P>"The KMT should take a cue from this, as more challenging elections for
municipality chiefs will take place next year, " Zhang said.</P>
      <P>The latest elections only covered about 40 percent of Taiwan's population, while
the municipality chief elections slated for 2010 will involve 60 percent of
Taiwan's urban residents.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that the setback in Saturday's elections might not be bad for
the KMT, as it could remind the party of the challenges that lie ahead," Zhang
said.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that Ma's leadership will not encounter any serious challenges
from within the KMT ranks following the latest setback and that he will continue
to lead his party on a path of reform.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's opposition camp, Zhang said DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's
leadership mandate has been greatly shored up with the party's better-than-
expected showing.</P>
      <P>The solid performance will help boost the party's morale, which has been at a
low ebb following its 2008 presidential election drubbing and the exposure of a
spate of corruption scandals involving former President Chen Shui-bian, Zhang
noted, adding that this might allow Tsai to win another term in the coming
year's party chair election.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the DPP is unlikely to adjust or review its pro-
independence policy or its snubbing of engagement with China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Buddhist nun raises over 70 poor children single-handed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Buddhist nun has taken in more than 70 orphans and displaced children, raised
them and allowed them to go to school over the past 11 years, because she cannot
bear to see poor children suffer.</P>
      <P>Zhenrong has managed to establish an orphanage in Wujie township of the eastern
county of Yilan despite only meagre savings, laboring to make ends meet by
producing and selling dried Chinese radish, and spinning "like a Tibetan prayer
wheel" as she ferries the kids to and from school.</P>
      <P>It all began from one day in 1998 when she saw two boys dressed in rags in Yilan
County's Suao, wandering near a river. She approached them and found out that
the boys, aged 6 and 7, had to scavenge for food as their father was a jobless
alcoholic and their mother had left for good.</P>
      <P>She took  the boys in and allowed  them to live at her mini-monastery named
after Samantabhadra, who symbolizes truth and reality and is one of the four
major buddhas in Chinese Buddhism.</P>
      <P>"There is a sad story behind every child I have taken in, " she said.</P>
      <P>The youngsters were originally displaced or abandoned because their parents had
either died, had separated or had been incarcerated for drug or alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>"Some babies were sent here after being born out of wedlock to teenage girls,"
she continued.</P>
      <P>"It grieves me that none of the abandoned babies' parents have ever visited
since," she added.</P>
      <P>With savings to the tune of NT$4 million, she took out a loan of over NT$8
million from a bank the next year to buy an abandoned resort in Wujie, where she
set up her orphanage enabling her to take in more disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>Burdened by her financial constraints -- it was costing her at least NT$70,000
per month to run the home and a further NT$80,000 per month to pay off her
mortgage, Zhenrong began curing Chinese radish, making it a staple of the home's
dining table.</P>
      <P>Surprisingly, her dried radish turned out to be a major source of income for the
home after a restaurant franchise operator from Taipei visited the orphanage and
offered to buy her home-cured produce.</P>
      <P>Zhenrong also raised funds by running a recycling plant and by soliciting
donations from Buddhism devotees.</P>
      <P>She told CNA that she finds her life of hardship and toil quite rewarding when
she sees "her" children receiving education, becoming socially conditioned and
coming out of their shells after an early childhood of poverty, dressed in
filthy rags and uncomfortable even making eye contact with other people.</P>
      <P>"Their wardrobe now is basic but clean, " Zhenrong noted.</P>
      <P>She said she runs the home based on Buddhist teaching that "people should help
other people get rid of all their pain even if doing so sacrifices their own
comfort and happiness."</P>
      <P>Zhenrong feels good about what she has been striving to do, firmly convinced one
more child saved and educated means Taiwan society will have one less juvenile
delinquent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Seven legislative by-elections to be held around Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>By-elections for seven legislative seats made vacant following the invalidation
of two legislators' election wins and the election of five others in Saturday's
mayor and magistrate elections will be held in seven counties around the
country.</P>
      <P>Three of the lawmakers will leave the legislature to take up their local
government positions: John Wu of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), who was elected
Taoyuan magistrate; the KMT's Chiu Ching-chun, who became Hsinchu magistrate;
and Fu Kung-chi, an independent who was elected Hualien magistrate.</P>
      <P>In addition, the KMT's Huang Chien-ting and Chang Hwa-kuan of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, who were elected Taitung magistrate and Chiayi
magistrate, respectively, had already resigned their legislative seats prior to
running in the local elections.</P>
      <P>Two other by-elections will be held Jan. 9 in Taoyuan and Taichung counties to
fill the seats left vacant by former KMT legislators Chiang Lien-fu and Liao
Cheng-ching, both of whom had their election status annulled over vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The KMT has nominated Taoyuan County Environmental Protection chief Chen Li-ling
and Taiping Mayor Yu Wen-chin to run in the legislative by-elections in Taoyuan
and Taichung counties, while nominating Taitung Magistrate Kuang Li-chen to run
in that county's legislative by-election, set for the same day.</P>
      <P>The  remaining  by-elections  will  be  held  at a later, yet-to-be-announced
date.</P>
      <P>DPP Policy Committee Chief Executive Ker Chien-ming said Sunday that the party
had yet to begin a formal nomination process for the by-elections.</P>
      <P>However, DPP Legislator Huang Wei-cher expressed optimism over the party's
chances of taking the seats at stake in Taoyuan and Chiayi counties.</P>
      <P>The DPP at present have 27 seats in the legislature following the party's
victory in the Yunlin legislative by-election earlier in the year and the loss
of one seat after Chang's resignation.</P>
      <P>If the party can take the two additional seats as it anticipates, it will have
29 seats, more than the crucial threshold of one-fourth of the 113-seat
legislature, which Huang said would allow the DPP to initiate  presidential
recall motions,  request  constitutional interpretations and carry out its
function of checks and balances against the majority KMT.</P>
      <P>Liao Da-chi, director of the Institute of Political Science at National Sun Yat-
sen University, said the seats left vacant after the local elections expose
serious problems with the talent acquisition systems employed by both the KMT
and the DPP, as both parties were so lacking in viable candidates  they were
reduced to mobilizing legislators to run for local chief posts.</P>
      <P>Saying that legislative by-elections are held too frequently, Liao said that in
addition to the seven vacant seats, three legislative by-elections were held in
Miaoli, Yunlin and Taoyuan counties after the departure of KMT lawmakers Lee
E-tin and Chang Sho-wen, as well as Lin Cheng-er, an aboriginal legislator from
the People First Party, whose elections were also annulled because of election-
related bribery.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of Saturday's local elections have solidified the leadership of
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, the
participants in a seminar said Sunday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said in the seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
Thinktank that the ballots garnered by the DPP were on par with its historic
high and that Tsai, who took over the helm of the battered party in May 2008
after scandal surrounding former President Chen Shui-bian, has established her
authority.</P>
      <P>"Her personal popularity is now higher than the party's and her leadership will
be cemented," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Kuan also said that Saturday's results show that President Ma Ying-jeou has
"flunked his mid-term test."</P>
      <P>"The people wanted to use their ballots to express hope that the Kuomintang
(KMT) will change," Kuan said, adding that she thinks the KMT will now be
plunged into a dilemma of whether to change or not.</P>
      <P>She cited as examples the fact that the public wants the government to restart
its negotiations over the easing of U.S. beef imports, the postponement of a
visit to Taiwan by China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin -- president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- and a referendum on a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement with China.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, an associate professor of Soochow University, said the voters
have helped the floundering DPP back to its feet and as long as it keeps the
momentum, it will be the basis of a good restart.</P>
      <P>But Saturday's local elections should not be "overinterpreted" as an indicator
of the results of the 2012 legislative and presidential elections, he said.</P>
      <P>Lo said Ma, who doubles as KMT chairman, will face challenges from within his
party and his government and his basis to engage in talks with other countries
will also be impacted.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, a convener of the Taiwan ThinkTank, said that the people have
helped the DPP back to its feet, but he added that if it reverts back to its old
path, it will not be able to maintain the momentum needed for victory in the
municipality elections in 2010 and the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The KMT won 12 out of the 17 mayor and magistrate seats up for grabs, but its
support base was weakened in several localities. The ratio of votes won by the
KMT this time was lower than the 50.96 percent it won in the last elections of
23 magistrates and mayors in 2005.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the DPP recovered Yilan, retained its other three seats in
Yunlin, Chiayi and Pingtung counties and made substantial gains in the KMT's
traditional strongholds of Penghu and Taitung.</P>
      <P>The DPP also saw its share of the vote increased from the 41. 95 percent it won
four years ago to 45.32 percent, compared with the KMT's 47.88 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has always had ears for public opinion in formulating policy on
the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, a senior official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Public opinion has been a major guideline in the formulation and implementation
of our cross-strait policies and action programs, " said Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts and coordinates Taiwan's policy toward China, has
invariably respected public opinion in dealing with cross-strait  affairs  and
has been  subjected  to legislative supervision in policy implementation, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Whenever we carry out cross-strait policy, national interests have consistently
been our top concern," Liu noted.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as Kuomintang
(KMT) chairman, said the previous day after his party suffered a setback in
mayoral and magistrate elections that his administration is willing to listen to
public opinion about the government's concrete cross-strait policies and to make
necessary adjustments or improvements.</P>
      <P>"While the MAC cannot explain in detail some policy issues at the moment, it has
always referred to public opinion when drafting its policy proposals and work
agenda," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The KMT's less-than-ideal showing in Saturday's elections has prompted some
politicians from the pro-independence opposition camp to demand  that  the Ma
administration  adjust  its allegedly China-leaning cross-strait policies, such
as signing a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China.</P>
      <P>Citing  the results  of a public opinion  survey the MAC commissioned  National
Chengchi University  to conduct in late September, Liu said 60 percent of the
respondents to the poll threw their support behind the fourth round of high-
level cross-strait talks scheduled to be held in central Taiwan's Taichung City
later this month.</P>
      <P>"The figure indicates that local people generally support the policy of
engagement with China," Liu explained.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 55 percent of the respondents said they favor the
signing of the ECFA, a cross-strait version of the free trade agreements signed
among major countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 44.7 percent said they thought the present pace of opening to cross-
strait exchanges in various fields is optimal, compared to 33 percent who said
the pace is too fast and 12 percent who said it is too slow.</P>
      <P>As most of the 17 cities and counties in which the three-in-one local elections
were held are either known as Taiwan's main food-producing areas or as home to
traditional labor-intensive industries, the opposition pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) stronger-than-expected showing might have
an adverse impact on cross-strait exchanges and the signing of the ECFA,
according to some analysts.</P>
      <P>Kao Hui, a professor at the Kinmen Institute of Science and Technology, said
that at the very least, the DPP will have more weight or more say in the
direction of future cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"I think DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, a former MAC head, will become more
critical of the KMT's cross-strait policy as a result of her party's electoral
gains," Kao said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Five municipality elections seen as next major battle</HEADLINE>

12/06/09  20:57:43
(By Garfie Lee and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The curtain for Saturday's local elections has just fallen, but the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) is already eying the next major battle -- the five municipality
elections set to take place in late 2010.</P>
      <P>The five municipalities will be Taipei City, New Taipei City (an upgrade of what
is presently Taipei County) , Taichung (a merger of Taichung city and county) ,
Tainan (a merger of Tainan city and county) and Kaohsiung (a merger of Kaohsiung
city and county).</P>
      <P>Although a high-ranking KMT official said Sunday that it is not yet time to talk
about naming specific candidates, he said the urgent task will be to review the
nominating mechanism.</P>
      <P>"If we nominate the right people, we will have already won half the battle," he
said.</P>
      <P>The KMT has set the tone for the five municipality elections as "the latter half
of a beachhead battle for the presidential election in 2012," according to the
official.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the party's performance in Saturday's elections was less than
ideal and said the problem lies in the nomination process, especially because
bitter competition at the primary stage often results in discord and splits
within the party.</P>
      <P>He said the party "has yet to seriously think about the question of nominating
specific persons," but added that the party will choose candidates who will be
in line with President Ma Ying-jeou's ideals of reform and who will avoid
internal fighting and will maintain party harmony.</P>
      <P>He said New Taipei City will be an "uncertain" area, noting that before Chou
Hsi-wei was elected Taipei magistrate in 2005, it was dominated for a long time
by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Even if Chou enjoys the advantage of being an incumbent it might not be easy for
him to fight his DPP rival, the official went on, citing the example of Yilan
County, which the KMT had taken great pains to retain only to see KMT incumbent
Lu Kuo-hua lose to his DPP rival in the traditional stronghold of the DPP, where
it had dominated for 24 years before Lu took over in 2005.</P>
      <P>The KMT has to name a "strong and popular" candidate in New Taipei City, he
said, noting that it has the largest population of any of the country's
administrative areas, -- 3,869,879 as of November 2009 -- and adding that "if
the KMT loses it in the election, the consequences will be grave."</P>
      <P>Chou, who has made known his intention to seek re-election despite faring poorly
in past public opinion polls, said the KMT should hold the primary early in a
"democratic" spirit, and "not to resort to internal coordination to decide who
should run."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP's morale was boosted in Saturday's elections, and two of its
heavyweights were asked Sunday if they will run in the municipality elections.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who has been tapped as a strong contender in Taipei
City, said that "whether it is the municipality elections in 2010,  or the 2012
legislative  and presidential elections, the party will have to adopt a well-
considered overview."</P>
      <P>"The party will have to discuss its plans and strategies before making a final
decision," she said.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin of the KMT,, who has already said he will be seeking
re-election, welcomed Sunday "any strong contenders in the race."</P>
      <P>Former Premier and ex-Taipei Magistrate Su Tseng-chang, believed to be a strong
contender in New Taipei City, said Sunday that "the "DPP's nomination mechanism
and the public opinion of every municipality should be respected."</P>
      <P>Also that day, the United Evening News said that Taichung Mayor Jason Hu is
still a favorite nomination choice for the KMT in Taichung.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu could be a good pawn for the party -- he could
either run in New Taipei City or be sent to the stronghold of the DPP, Tainan,
given that Chu's father-in-law Kao Yu-jen is a politician from Tainan and his
uncle-in-law, Kao Su-po, is a legislator from there, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, Mayor Chen Chu of the DPP, who is keen to throw her hat into the
ring in the 2010 election, said that respecting the party's nomination mechanism
and public opinion will be the best approach.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing has also expressed interest in running in
the southern municipality, which is likely to put him at loggerheads with Chen.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's ruing Kuomintang (KMT) won an overwhelming victory in elections of
county and city councilors as well as township chiefs Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ruling party secured 289 of the 592 seats up for grabs in the elections of
councilors in 17 of the 25 counties and cities in the country.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), gained control of 128
townships, followed by the minor Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) which won three
seats, and the People First Party (PFP) and the Labor Party, which won one seat
each. The remaining 170 seats went to independents.</P>
      <P>The ratios of votes won in the councilor elections were: the KMT, 43.94 percent;
the DPP, 24.41 percent; the TSU, 0.62 percent; the PFP, 0.13 percent, while the
independents won 30.76 percent of the votes cast.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT kept its dominance in township administrator offices by
wining 121 seats out of the 211 seats contested, while the DPP took control of
34 townships. The remaining 56 township offices were captured by independents.</P>
      <P>The ratios of votes won by the KMT in the township elections stood at 48.81
percent; for the DPP, 20.04 percent; and independents, 30.87 percent.</P>
      <P>The ruling party managed to win 12 seats in the county and city magistrate and
mayors elections, but lost the magistrate offices in Ilan in northeastern Taiwan
to the DPP and Hualien in eastern Taiwan to an independent.</P>
      <P>Elections for eight other Taiwan counties and cities -- the city and county of
Taipei, the city and county of Taichung, the city and county of Tainan, and the
city and county of Kaohsiung -- will be held in late 2010.</P>
      <P>Also on Saturday, KMT candidate Ma Wen-chun won the legislative by-election in
Nantou County in central Taiwan. The post was vacated when Premier Wu Den-yih

    <HEADLINE>Time for KMT to improve administrative efficiency: business sector</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
12/06/09  15:41:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local business leader said Sunday in the wake of hotly contested  local
elections in which the ruling Kuomintang gave a less-than-stellar performance
that it is time for the administration to conduct soul-searching and come up
with plans to improve its administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>Chang Ping-chao, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, said the KMT
should probe the reasons why it has lost popularity in some cities and counties,
and give serious thought as to how to further improve efficiency.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT won the mayoral or magistrate seats in 12 out of 17 cities and
counties in Saturday's elections, it lost two of its former magistrate seats and
the party's nominees only grossed 47.88 percent of the 4,466,403 ballots cast.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, meanwhile, won 1,982,914 of the
votes cast, or 45.32 percent, a much higher ratio in comparison with the 41.95
percent it won in the last local elections four years ago.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the local elections had nothing to do with the KMT
administration's overall economic policy and cross-Taiwan Strait policy, with
the latter enjoying an approval rating of over 60 percent.</P>
      <P>He attributed the KMT's loss of support in some cities and counties mainly to
the impact and implications of the global economic meltdown and the high
unemployment rate since late 2008, as well as the massive destruction caused by
Typhoon Morakot in southern and eastern Taiwan earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Tsai Lien-sheng, secretary-general of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries, said Taiwan has begun to bottom out from the economic
meltdown and is now set to rebound.</P>
      <P>"If the KMT administration steers firmly, its approval ratings will rebound
soon," Tsai predicted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Dah Chang Securities spokesman said the KMT's defeat in Yilan and
Hualien counties will temporarily impact the performance of the Taiwan bourse,
forecasting that the TAIEX index will lose ground for two days or even only one
day when the market re-opens Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman explained that the election results unfolded as generally
expected, while the market is now rich in funds and the global financial shock
caused by Dubai's debt worries last week seems to have passed.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-tung, a manager with Capital Investment Trust, said investors stayed on
the sidelines in the week before the elections and also predicted that if the
election results adversely impact the TAIEX, the fluctuation will only be
temporary.</P>
      <P>"The market will return to its fundamentals in one week, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, John Brebeck, a fund expert with Yuanta Securities, said he does not
see the local election results having any negative impact on the KMT
administration's ability to steer the nation.</P>
      <P>"Whenever the TAIEX index falls is a good time to buy, " Brebeck said, adding
that the local stock market will turn bullish from now until the first quarter
of 2010. (By Lin Ye-fong, Lawrence Chiu, Yu-Pin Tien, Carol Yeh and Deborah Kuo)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet will remain under pressure to tackle unemployment and many
other issues after the ruling party took only 12 of the 17 mayor and magistrate
seats up for grabs in Saturday's local elections, political analysts said a day
after polling.</P>
      <P>Although the Kuomintang  (KMT)  secured a majority in the elections,  it lost
the magistrate  seat of Yilan County  in northeastern Taiwan to the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and that of Hualien County in eastern Taiwan
to independent Fu Kun-chi, who was expelled by the KMT for insisting in vying
for the seat against party wishes.</P>
      <P>The KMT won 47.88 percent of the votes cast, lower than the 50.96 percent it won
in the last mayor and magistrate elections of 23 counties and cities in 2005.</P>
      <P>The DPP won four seats, one more than it won in the elections four years ago. It
also gained 45.32 percent of the vote, up from the 38 percent it won in the last
election.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also KMT chairman, admitted at a post-election
press conference Saturday that the outcome of the elections was not "ideal" for
his administration and that the party's decline in local government seats and
vote share was a "warning" that the KMT will have to address.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Sunday that the administration  is expected to face
increasing challenges in boosting employment and reviving the economy, as well
as in carrying out post-Typhoon Morakot reconstruction work and dealing with a
looming water shortage in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma promised Nov. 15 at a ground-breaking ceremony for a permanent housing park
in Kaohsiung County to accommodate typhoon victims that the first batch of 600
houses is scheduled for completion at the end of January next year.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is therefore racing against time to complete the construction
project in line with Ma's promise, according to the analysts.</P>
      <P>With the water stored in reservoirs in southern Taiwan and the Gaoping River
being lower than past annual averages, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu convened an
inter-ministerial meeting Dec. 2 to review water supplies in all areas of the
country and develop response measures.</P>
      <P>A consensus was reached during the meeting that before the flood season between
next May and November, the government should ensure that water for public
consumption and industrial use in Taiwan is not seriously affected.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency said at the meeting that measures to stop irrigation
and planting in parts of the south might be unavoidable, with the affected areas
slated to be announced in late December.</P>
      <P>Another major challenge for the government is addressing the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said earlier in the month that as unemployment is an
indicator of a lagging economy, the government is treating boosting employment
as one of its top priorities.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is therefore working to map out employment promotion measures with
the goal of creating 99,000 jobs, since 2008-2009 short-term employment
promotion measures will conclude at the end of this year and about 45,000 people
working temporary jobs offered under the program will find themselves out of
work at that time.</P>
      <P>The other important task for the government will be continuing its preventive
measures for influenza A(H1N1) . The Department of Health will have provided 120
million doses of free H1N1 vaccine for local use before the lunar new year, the
analysts said.</P>
      <P>Other tests for the government will be the security measures it puts in place
for China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, who will visit Taiwan for
the next round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks later this month in Taichung City,
as well as issues related to signing a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, the analysts added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu will also be under pressure to implement a plan to improve
citizens' lives that is part of a concept of "grassroots economy" he floated
since becoming premier two months ago, according to the analysts.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese fashion designer Johan Ku, whose winning of a top prize in the 2009
Gen Art's Styles International Design Competition has gone viral, is planning to
return to Taiwan this month for a solo show of his designs.</P>
      <P>Ku told CNA Saturday that he plans to show the Taiwanese people 10 works he has
created in recent years to show them how he creates his "sculpture-like"
knitwear.</P>
      <P>"Nothing is final yet, but I hope the presentation can take place at Eslite
Books' Dunnan Store in eastern Taipei City," Ku said during a dinner hosted in
his honor by Taiwan's representative in New York, Kao Chen-chun.</P>
      <P>Ku, owner of the Johan Ku Design Studio, recently won the top prize in the
avant-garde design category of the 2009 Gen Art's Styles International Design
Competition, a major fashion design competition in the United States for
emerging talent.</P>
      <P>He won the prestigious prize with one of his 2004 designs -- a knitted series
that highlights the versatility of yarn and displays creative patterns.</P>
      <P>The 30-year-old  attended an award ceremony in New York's Manhattan Dec. 2
before flying Saturday back to London where he is pursuing postgraduate art
studies at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design.</P>
      <P>During the dinner, Ku recounted how he managed to complete his undergraduate and
postgraduate studies in fashion design at two universities in Taiwan after
graduating from vocational high school, and how he stuck to his guns to pursue
what he really wanted.</P>
      <P>Ku also noted how impressed he was by the help given in Europe and the United
States to young designers and said Taiwan should also provide assistance to
young people seeking to make their mark in the creative industry.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has no lack of creative talent willing to work hard, " Ku noted.</P>
      <P>Regarding his planned presentation in Taipei, set to take place in mid-December,
Ku expressed hope that entrepreneurs will want to buy his works, which will
allow him to raise funds to continue creating more fashion or to establish his
own brand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP gets election boost but more challenges ahead</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
12/06/09  17:14:30
(By Sophia Yeh, Wen Kui-hsiang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) received a major boost when it
retained three of its magistrate seats and retook the significant Yilan County
in Saturday's local elections.</P>
      <P>Even though the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) won 12 out of the 17 mayor and
magistrate seats up for grabs, its support base was weakened in several
localities. The ratio of votes won by the KMT this time was lower than the 50.96
percent it won in the last elections of 23 magistrates and mayors in 2005.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the DPP's Yilan victory, along with the retention of its other
three seats and the major gains it made in the KMT's traditional strongholds of
Penghu and Taitung, were seen by the party as affirmation of the leadership of
DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who took over the party helm in May 2008 at a time
when the party was in disarray  in the wake of the snowballing  corruption
scandal surrounding former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the DPP also saw its share of the vote increased from the
41.95 percent it won four years ago to 45.32 percent, compared with the KMT's
47.88 percent, this could mean that the party is now out of the shadow of the
disgraced ex-president, according to DPP sources.</P>
      <P>Tsai has successfully stemmed the party's slipping popularity, but her real
challenge will be a DPP chair election next May, municipality elections in late
2010 and even the party's strategy for the 2012 presidential election, a party
official said.</P>
      <P>With Saturday's "minor victory, " the party official said, more people will be
interested in joining the race in the municipality elections set for next year.</P>
      <P>Even before Saturday's elections, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu and Kaohsiung
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing had reportedly been bickering, as both are known to
be interested in running in the 2010 election, when the city and county will be
merged into a single municipality.</P>
      <P>Tsai mediated between the two prior to Saturday's election, requesting them to
"put party unity on the pedestal," but their fight for the candidacy is expected
to start again.</P>
      <P>The usually low-key Tsai was obviously happy late Saturday about the party's
performance, saying that she was "gratified about the growth, but the outcome
has not changed the basic structure of the electorate."</P>
      <P>She described  the elections  as "the  people  casting  a no-confidence vote
against the performance over the past 18 months of the President Ma Ying-jeou
administration."</P>
      <P>She attributed the KMT setback to its "wrong policy," saying that the Ma
administration's rapid China-tilt policy has led to uneasiness among the people.</P>
      <P>Another reason, she went on, is the Ma administration's poor efficiency and
ability.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that the retaking of Yilan shows that the DPP has "regained the
trust of the voters."</P>
      <P>In other localities, even thought DPP candidates did not win, the ballots they
garnered were often not far behind those of their KMT rivals, which was a
"tremendous boost" to the party, she added.</P>
      <P>She said the challenge for the party now is not to beat the KMT but to become
the "best and the most trustworthy" party in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said the party has already begun work to formulate a "10-year policy
guideline" to chart the party's blueprint for the nation's development over the
next decade.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT's election setback makes political talks more difficult</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
12/06/09  18:40:19

    <TEXT>
      <P>The less-than-ideal showing of Taiwan's ruling party in the weekend mayor and
magistrate elections has made it even more difficult for the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to begin talks on sensitive political issues, a Chinese scholar
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Zhang Duncai, deputy director of Xiamen University's Taiwan Research Institute
in southeastern China's Fujian Province, said the just-concluded local elections
in Taiwan could be characterized as a setback for the Kuomintang (KMT) and a
gain for the pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, the KMT administration, while unlikely to retrench its
cross-strait engagement policy, is also not likely to promote bilateral
relations at a pace as fast as in the past one-and-a-half years," Zhang forecast
in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>Zhang said he expects cross-strait  economic  and cultural exchanges  to
continue  in the wake  of the elections,  with institutionalized  engagements
between  the  two quasi-official intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits -- proceeding without interruption and the communication  platform
between the KMT and the Communist Party of China remaining on track.</P>
      <P>However, he also predicted that Taiwan's government will become more reluctant
to promote any cross-strait programs that might eclipse or undermine  President
Ma Ying-jeou's  administrative achievements or the KMT's power base.</P>
      <P>"Political issues, in particular, will be least likely to be brought to the
negotiating table in the foreseeable future, " Zhang said.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's elections, the KMT captured 12 out of the 17 mayor and magistrate
seats up for grabs, while the DPP took four seats and the remaining seat went to
an independent.</P>
      <P>Zhang analyzed that in terms of numbers, the KMT only suffered a small loss of
two seats -- one to a DPP challenger and the other to a KMT maverick  who ran as
an independent  without the party's endorsement -- while the DPP only scored a
minor gain by winning one more seat than it garnered in the previous elections
held four years ago.</P>
      <P>However, in terms of the vote share, the KMT's loss could be branded as a major
defeat, as it grossed only 47.88 percent of the total, far less than the 51.8
percent share it won in the 2005 election, Zhang said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, he went on, the DPP scored a significant gain, securing a record
45.32 percent share.</P>
      <P>Zhang also said that the results indicate that Ma's political star is fading.</P>
      <P>"One of the indicators was Fu Kun-chi's defeat of the KMT candidate in the
Hualien magistrate election by an enormous margin, " Zhang analyzed.</P>
      <P>Fu was expelled from the KMT after insisting on running for the eastern county's
magistrate  post in defiance  of the party's nomination policy.</P>
      <P>Another proof of Ma's declining star power was seen in incumbent Yilan
Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua's loss of his reelection bid to his DPP challenger  Lin
Tsong-shyan.  Ma traveled  extensively  in the northeastern county in the run-up
to the election to stump for Lu in his capacity as KMT chairman, but to no
avail.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, it is still far too early to write a political obituary for Ma, as
shown in KMT nominee Chiu Ching-chun's success in winning the Hsinchu magistrate
post, Zhang noted.</P>
      <P>Chiu fought a tight race against two strong challengers -- one from the DPP and
the other from Hsinchu County Council Speaker Chang Pi-chin who ran as an
independent. Without Ma's strong backing, many analysts said, Chiu might not
have emerged as the final victor.</P>
      <P>"Generally speaking, the results show that supporters of the KMT-led blue camp
have used their ballots to teach Ma a lesson on the one hand, but they also
affirm his determination to promote clean politics. Under Ma's leadership, the
KMT has rejected nominating politicians involved in corruption allegations to
run for public posts," said Zhang.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's elections, the KMT also saw its leads in two of its traditional
strongholds -- Taitung County and the offshore county of Penghu -- greatly
reduced.</P>
      <P>"The KMT should take a cue from this, as more challenging elections for
municipality chiefs will take place next year, " Zhang said.</P>
      <P>The latest elections only covered about 40 percent of Taiwan's population, while
the municipality chief elections slated for 2010 will involve 60 percent of
Taiwan's urban residents.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that the setback in Saturday's elections might not be bad for
the KMT, as it could remind the party of the challenges that lie ahead," Zhang
said.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that Ma's leadership will not encounter any serious challenges
from within the KMT ranks following the latest setback and that he will continue
to lead his party on a path of reform.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's opposition camp, Zhang said DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's
leadership mandate has been greatly shored up with the party's better-than-
expected showing.</P>
      <P>The solid performance will help boost the party's morale, which has been at a
low ebb following its 2008 presidential election drubbing and the exposure of a
spate of corruption scandals involving former President Chen Shui-bian, Zhang
noted, adding that this might allow Tsai to win another term in the coming
year's party chair election.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the DPP is unlikely to adjust or review its pro-
independence policy or its snubbing of engagement with China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Buddhist nun raises over 70 poor children single-handed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Buddhist nun has taken in more than 70 orphans and displaced children, raised
them and allowed them to go to school over the past 11 years, because she cannot
bear to see poor children suffer.</P>
      <P>Zhenrong has managed to establish an orphanage in Wujie township of the eastern
county of Yilan despite only meagre savings, laboring to make ends meet by
producing and selling dried Chinese radish, and spinning "like a Tibetan prayer
wheel" as she ferries the kids to and from school.</P>
      <P>It all began from one day in 1998 when she saw two boys dressed in rags in Yilan
County's Suao, wandering near a river. She approached them and found out that
the boys, aged 6 and 7, had to scavenge for food as their father was a jobless
alcoholic and their mother had left for good.</P>
      <P>She took  the boys in and allowed  them to live at her mini-monastery named
after Samantabhadra, who symbolizes truth and reality and is one of the four
major buddhas in Chinese Buddhism.</P>
      <P>"There is a sad story behind every child I have taken in, " she said.</P>
      <P>The youngsters were originally displaced or abandoned because their parents had
either died, had separated or had been incarcerated for drug or alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>"Some babies were sent here after being born out of wedlock to teenage girls,"
she continued.</P>
      <P>"It grieves me that none of the abandoned babies' parents have ever visited
since," she added.</P>
      <P>With savings to the tune of NT$4 million, she took out a loan of over NT$8
million from a bank the next year to buy an abandoned resort in Wujie, where she
set up her orphanage enabling her to take in more disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>Burdened by her financial constraints -- it was costing her at least NT$70,000
per month to run the home and a further NT$80,000 per month to pay off her
mortgage, Zhenrong began curing Chinese radish, making it a staple of the home's
dining table.</P>
      <P>Surprisingly, her dried radish turned out to be a major source of income for the
home after a restaurant franchise operator from Taipei visited the orphanage and
offered to buy her home-cured produce.</P>
      <P>Zhenrong also raised funds by running a recycling plant and by soliciting
donations from Buddhism devotees.</P>
      <P>She told CNA that she finds her life of hardship and toil quite rewarding when
she sees "her" children receiving education, becoming socially conditioned and
coming out of their shells after an early childhood of poverty, dressed in
filthy rags and uncomfortable even making eye contact with other people.</P>
      <P>"Their wardrobe now is basic but clean, " Zhenrong noted.</P>
      <P>She said she runs the home based on Buddhist teaching that "people should help
other people get rid of all their pain even if doing so sacrifices their own
comfort and happiness."</P>
      <P>Zhenrong feels good about what she has been striving to do, firmly convinced one
more child saved and educated means Taiwan society will have one less juvenile
delinquent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Seven legislative by-elections to be held around Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>By-elections for seven legislative seats made vacant following the invalidation
of two legislators' election wins and the election of five others in Saturday's
mayor and magistrate elections will be held in seven counties around the
country.</P>
      <P>Three of the lawmakers will leave the legislature to take up their local
government positions: John Wu of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), who was elected
Taoyuan magistrate; the KMT's Chiu Ching-chun, who became Hsinchu magistrate;
and Fu Kung-chi, an independent who was elected Hualien magistrate.</P>
      <P>In addition, the KMT's Huang Chien-ting and Chang Hwa-kuan of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, who were elected Taitung magistrate and Chiayi
magistrate, respectively, had already resigned their legislative seats prior to
running in the local elections.</P>
      <P>Two other by-elections will be held Jan. 9 in Taoyuan and Taichung counties to
fill the seats left vacant by former KMT legislators Chiang Lien-fu and Liao
Cheng-ching, both of whom had their election status annulled over vote-buying.</P>
      <P>The KMT has nominated Taoyuan County Environmental Protection chief Chen Li-ling
and Taiping Mayor Yu Wen-chin to run in the legislative by-elections in Taoyuan
and Taichung counties, while nominating Taitung Magistrate Kuang Li-chen to run
in that county's legislative by-election, set for the same day.</P>
      <P>The  remaining  by-elections  will  be  held  at a later, yet-to-be-announced
date.</P>
      <P>DPP Policy Committee Chief Executive Ker Chien-ming said Sunday that the party
had yet to begin a formal nomination process for the by-elections.</P>
      <P>However, DPP Legislator Huang Wei-cher expressed optimism over the party's
chances of taking the seats at stake in Taoyuan and Chiayi counties.</P>
      <P>The DPP at present have 27 seats in the legislature following the party's
victory in the Yunlin legislative by-election earlier in the year and the loss
of one seat after Chang's resignation.</P>
      <P>If the party can take the two additional seats as it anticipates, it will have
29 seats, more than the crucial threshold of one-fourth of the 113-seat
legislature, which Huang said would allow the DPP to initiate  presidential
recall motions,  request  constitutional interpretations and carry out its
function of checks and balances against the majority KMT.</P>
      <P>Liao Da-chi, director of the Institute of Political Science at National Sun Yat-
sen University, said the seats left vacant after the local elections expose
serious problems with the talent acquisition systems employed by both the KMT
and the DPP, as both parties were so lacking in viable candidates  they were
reduced to mobilizing legislators to run for local chief posts.</P>
      <P>Saying that legislative by-elections are held too frequently, Liao said that in
addition to the seven vacant seats, three legislative by-elections were held in
Miaoli, Yunlin and Taoyuan counties after the departure of KMT lawmakers Lee
E-tin and Chang Sho-wen, as well as Lin Cheng-er, an aboriginal legislator from
the People First Party, whose elections were also annulled because of election-
related bribery.</P>

      <P>People aged 25 or older who are considered at high risk for complications from
influenza A (H1N1) will be offered H1N1 vaccine free of charge from Monday, the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>People in the age groups with underlying health conditions that include
diabetes, asthma, chronic cardiopulmonary disease, kidney disease, liver
disease, cardiopulmonary disease and severe obesity should get vaccinated as
soon as possible, CDC Deputy-Director Chou Jih-haw said.</P>
      <P>Severe obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of greater than 35 kg/m2,
according to Chou.</P>
      <P>He noted that individuals with hypertension have not been listed in the high
risk group so they will be given the vaccine only until Dec. 12, when the
vaccine will become available to the general public.</P>
      <P>More than 2.51 million people have been inoculated against H1N1 since the CDC
began offering the vaccine nearly one month ago, of whom, 1.17 million are
students at junior and senior high schools.</P>
      <P>However, only 5,000 university students have received a shot, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The CDC plans to get 7.5 million people vaccinated by the end of this year --
about 25 percent of the population -- in order to generate a herd immunity

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of Saturday's local elections have solidified the leadership of
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, the
participants in a seminar said Sunday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said in the seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
Thinktank that the ballots garnered by the DPP were on par with its historic
high and that Tsai, who took over the helm of the battered party in May 2008
after scandal surrounding former President Chen Shui-bian, has established her
authority.</P>
      <P>"Her personal popularity is now higher than the party's and her leadership will
be cemented," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Kuan also said that Saturday's results show that President Ma Ying-jeou has
"flunked his mid-term test."</P>
      <P>"The people wanted to use their ballots to express hope that the Kuomintang
(KMT) will change," Kuan said, adding that she thinks the KMT will now be
plunged into a dilemma of whether to change or not.</P>
      <P>She cited as examples the fact that the public wants the government to restart
its negotiations over the easing of U.S. beef imports, the postponement of a
visit to Taiwan by China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin -- president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- and a referendum on a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement with China.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, an associate professor of Soochow University, said the voters
have helped the floundering DPP back to its feet and as long as it keeps the
momentum, it will be the basis of a good restart.</P>
      <P>But Saturday's local elections should not be "overinterpreted" as an indicator
of the results of the 2012 legislative and presidential elections, he said.</P>
      <P>Lo said Ma, who doubles as KMT chairman, will face challenges from within his
party and his government and his basis to engage in talks with other countries
will also be impacted.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, a convener of the Taiwan ThinkTank, said that the people have
helped the DPP back to its feet, but he added that if it reverts back to its old
path, it will not be able to maintain the momentum needed for victory in the
municipality elections in 2010 and the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The KMT won 12 out of the 17 mayor and magistrate seats up for grabs, but its
support base was weakened in several localities. The ratio of votes won by the
KMT this time was lower than the 50.96 percent it won in the last elections of
23 magistrates and mayors in 2005.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the DPP recovered Yilan, retained its other three seats in
Yunlin, Chiayi and Pingtung counties and made substantial gains in the KMT's
traditional strongholds of Penghu and Taitung.</P>
      <P>The DPP also saw its share of the vote increased from the 41. 95 percent it won
four years ago to 45.32 percent, compared with the KMT's 47.88 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet will listen to public opinion when drafting China policy</HEADLINE>

12/06/09  20:43:21

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has always had ears for public opinion in formulating policy on
the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, a senior official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Public opinion has been a major guideline in the formulation and implementation
of our cross-strait policies and action programs, " said Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts and coordinates Taiwan's policy toward China, has
invariably respected public opinion in dealing with cross-strait  affairs  and
has been  subjected  to legislative supervision in policy implementation, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Whenever we carry out cross-strait policy, national interests have consistently
been our top concern," Liu noted.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as Kuomintang
(KMT) chairman, said the previous day after his party suffered a setback in
mayoral and magistrate elections that his administration is willing to listen to
public opinion about the government's concrete cross-strait policies and to make
necessary adjustments or improvements.</P>
      <P>"While the MAC cannot explain in detail some policy issues at the moment, it has
always referred to public opinion when drafting its policy proposals and work
agenda," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The KMT's less-than-ideal showing in Saturday's elections has prompted some
politicians from the pro-independence opposition camp to demand  that  the Ma
administration  adjust  its allegedly China-leaning cross-strait policies, such
as signing a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China.</P>
      <P>Citing  the results  of a public opinion  survey the MAC commissioned  National
Chengchi University  to conduct in late September, Liu said 60 percent of the
respondents to the poll threw their support behind the fourth round of high-
level cross-strait talks scheduled to be held in central Taiwan's Taichung City
later this month.</P>
      <P>"The figure indicates that local people generally support the policy of
engagement with China," Liu explained.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 55 percent of the respondents said they favor the
signing of the ECFA, a cross-strait version of the free trade agreements signed
among major countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 44.7 percent said they thought the present pace of opening to cross-
strait exchanges in various fields is optimal, compared to 33 percent who said
the pace is too fast and 12 percent who said it is too slow.</P>
      <P>As most of the 17 cities and counties in which the three-in-one local elections
were held are either known as Taiwan's main food-producing areas or as home to
traditional labor-intensive industries, the opposition pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) stronger-than-expected showing might have
an adverse impact on cross-strait exchanges and the signing of the ECFA,
according to some analysts.</P>
      <P>Kao Hui, a professor at the Kinmen Institute of Science and Technology, said
that at the very least, the DPP will have more weight or more say in the
direction of future cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"I think DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, a former MAC head, will become more
critical of the KMT's cross-strait policy as a result of her party's electoral
gains," Kao said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Five municipality elections seen as next major battle</HEADLINE>

12/06/09  20:57:43
(By Garfie Lee and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The curtain for Saturday's local elections has just fallen, but the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) is already eying the next major battle -- the five municipality
elections set to take place in late 2010.</P>
      <P>The five municipalities will be Taipei City, New Taipei City (an upgrade of what
is presently Taipei County) , Taichung (a merger of Taichung city and county) ,
Tainan (a merger of Tainan city and county) and Kaohsiung (a merger of Kaohsiung
city and county).</P>
      <P>Although a high-ranking KMT official said Sunday that it is not yet time to talk
about naming specific candidates, he said the urgent task will be to review the
nominating mechanism.</P>
      <P>"If we nominate the right people, we will have already won half the battle," he
said.</P>
      <P>The KMT has set the tone for the five municipality elections as "the latter half
of a beachhead battle for the presidential election in 2012," according to the
official.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the party's performance in Saturday's elections was less than
ideal and said the problem lies in the nomination process, especially because
bitter competition at the primary stage often results in discord and splits
within the party.</P>
      <P>He said the party "has yet to seriously think about the question of nominating
specific persons," but added that the party will choose candidates who will be
in line with President Ma Ying-jeou's ideals of reform and who will avoid
internal fighting and will maintain party harmony.</P>
      <P>He said New Taipei City will be an "uncertain" area, noting that before Chou
Hsi-wei was elected Taipei magistrate in 2005, it was dominated for a long time
by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Even if Chou enjoys the advantage of being an incumbent it might not be easy for
him to fight his DPP rival, the official went on, citing the example of Yilan
County, which the KMT had taken great pains to retain only to see KMT incumbent
Lu Kuo-hua lose to his DPP rival in the traditional stronghold of the DPP, where
it had dominated for 24 years before Lu took over in 2005.</P>
      <P>The KMT has to name a "strong and popular" candidate in New Taipei City, he
said, noting that it has the largest population of any of the country's
administrative areas, -- 3,869,879 as of November 2009 -- and adding that "if
the KMT loses it in the election, the consequences will be grave."</P>
      <P>Chou, who has made known his intention to seek re-election despite faring poorly
in past public opinion polls, said the KMT should hold the primary early in a
"democratic" spirit, and "not to resort to internal coordination to decide who
should run."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP's morale was boosted in Saturday's elections, and two of its
heavyweights were asked Sunday if they will run in the municipality elections.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who has been tapped as a strong contender in Taipei
City, said that "whether it is the municipality elections in 2010,  or the 2012
legislative  and presidential elections, the party will have to adopt a well-
considered overview."</P>
      <P>"The party will have to discuss its plans and strategies before making a final
decision," she said.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin of the KMT,, who has already said he will be seeking
re-election, welcomed Sunday "any strong contenders in the race."</P>
      <P>Former Premier and ex-Taipei Magistrate Su Tseng-chang, believed to be a strong
contender in New Taipei City, said Sunday that "the "DPP's nomination mechanism
and the public opinion of every municipality should be respected."</P>
      <P>Also that day, the United Evening News said that Taichung Mayor Jason Hu is
still a favorite nomination choice for the KMT in Taichung.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu could be a good pawn for the party -- he could
either run in New Taipei City or be sent to the stronghold of the DPP, Tainan,
given that Chu's father-in-law Kao Yu-jen is a politician from Tainan and his
uncle-in-law, Kao Su-po, is a legislator from there, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, Mayor Chen Chu of the DPP, who is keen to throw her hat into the
ring in the 2010 election, said that respecting the party's nomination mechanism
and public opinion will be the best approach.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing has also expressed interest in running in
the southern municipality, which is likely to put him at loggerheads with Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has asked for an election review report as soon as
possible in the wake of the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) lackluster performance
in Saturday's local elections, party officials reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that many within the party are worried that the KMT's solid
support base in many areas is showing signs of erosion, which they think does
not bode well for the municipality elections next year.</P>
      <P>President Ma, in his capacity as the KMT chairman, attaches great importance to
such views and has asked the KMT Central Standing Committee to submit an
election review report on Wednesday, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the KMT setback in Saturday's poll to several factors, including
public discontent with the Ma administration, a flawed party nomination process,
and the KMT candidates' failure to motivate voters.</P>
      <P>"The KMT's support base has been seriously eroded, " a party official said.</P>
      <P>The KMT managed to retain 12 of the 17 mayor and magistrate seats that were up
for grabs in Saturday's poll, but its level of support in several localities
fell sharply, sending its overall average down to 47.88 percent compared to
50.96 percent in the last local election in 2005.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the DPP recovered Yilan, retained its three seats in Yunlin,
Chiayi and Pingtung counties and made substantial gains in the KMT's traditional
strongholds of Penghu and Taitung.</P>
      <P>The DPP also increased its share of the vote from 41.95 percent four years ago
to 45.32 percent.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Sunday that the setback has sent a timely warning
to the KMT, forcing it to make a thorough review.</P>
      <P>He also said that the KMT should heed the gravitation of independent voters
toward the traditionally pro-independence DPP, and advised that the strength of
DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and her party should not be underestimated.</P>
      <P>Elections for heads of five municipalities -- Taipei City, New Taipei City (an
upgrade of what is presently Taipei County), Taichung (a merger of Taichung City
and County) , Tainan (a merger of Tainan City and County) and Kaohsiung (a
merger of Kaohsiung City and County) -- will be held in late 2010.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China may soon open a new front in their efforts to cement bilateral
ties, as talks on cooperation on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be
in the works, Environmental Protection Administration  (EPA)  Minister Stephen
Shu-hung Shen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that environmental protection officials from Taiwan and China have
started planning joint measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, Shen said
the officials from both sides may meet after the Copenhagen Climate Conference
for a forum on environment protection or to discuss CDM collaboration.</P>
      <P>"The Copenhagen Climate Conference is one of the most important meetings this
century," Shen said.</P>
      <P>It is not only reviewing progress achieved under the Kyoto Protocol, its
discussions would have important impact on future trends for global industrial
development, he noted.</P>
      <P>The CDM is an arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol that allows industrialized
countries with a greenhouse gas reduction commitment to invest in ventures that
reduce emissions in developing countries as an alternative to more expensive
emissions cuts in their own countries.</P>
      <P>According to news reports from China, as of the end of October, the Chinese
government had approved 2,232 CMD projects, 663 of which have been successfully
registered with the CDM Executive Board of the United Nations -- the highest
number of CDM registered projects for a single country worldwide.</P>
      <P>It is envisioned that the 663 projects will help cut greenhouse gas emissions in
China by 190 million tons per year, constituting 58 percent of the total
emissions reduction projected for registered CDM projects globally, according to
a Chinese official.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can borrow from China's experience in CDM development and in turn use
the CDM cooperation to create a win-win situation for both sides," Shen said.</P>
      <P>However, local environment conservation activists have expressed diverse views
on CO2 reduction options.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-sheng, a spokesman for the Green Party Taiwan, posited that Taiwan
should consider cutting greenhouse gas emissions at the source, rather than from
cap-and-trade efforts, which he said address only end-product problems.</P>
      <P>"The best and fastest solution is to impose an energy tax and a carbon tax," Pan
suggested.</P>
      <P>Kao Cheng-yen, an environmentalist and a professor at National Taiwan
University, criticized the government's approach of pushing for measures to curb
greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan, on one hand, while turning a blind eye to
the expansion of heavy-polluting industries, on the other.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of a proposal to build an eighth naphtha cracking plant in
Taiwan, Kao said even if all the factories in Taiwan strive to reduce their CO2
emissions, their efforts will be in vain  once the proposed  Guokuang
Petrochemical  Co.  becomes operational.</P>
      <P>Since the Legislative Yuan has already passed an act governing the development
of renewable energies, the administration should capitalize on that policy, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>"The government should learn from Germany and Japan and purchase alternative
energy produced by the private sector," Kao said.</P>

      <P>There will be a "minor" Cabinet reshuffle sometime around Dec. 20, and two-term
mayors and magistrates who have performed well will be invited to join the
Cabinet when their tenures expire after that date, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Monday.</P>
      <P>However, they will not necessarily be asked to serve as ministers, or ministers
without portfolio, but rather may be assigned to head state-owned enterprises,
he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Hsinchu's two-term mayor, Lin Junq-tzer, is one of those being
considered  for a seat in the Cabinet.  Lin has consistently been at the top of
the rankings in surveys on the performance of mayors and magistrates in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle has been at the forefront of discussions
since the ruling  Kuomintang's  less-than-ideal performance in the just-
concluded local elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT managed to hold on to 12 of the 17 mayor and magistrate seats that were
up for grabs in Saturday's poll, but lost a significant seat in Yilan County and
saw its solid support base eroded in several localities.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's environmental chief called Monday for the Legislative Yuan to pass a
greenhouse gas control act as soon as possible to serve as a legal basis for
facilitating efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen
said the legislation of a greenhouse gas emissions control act will enable the
government to push for a supply chain carbon inventory, directly accelerating
the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the country's industrial sector.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, supply chain carbon inventory has been used on an
experimental trial basis in Taiwan by several private companies, including
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) , China Airlines, Kuo-Kuang
Motor Transport and the Taipei 101 building.</P>
      <P>He also said that since the Legislative Yuan has already passed an act governing
the development  of renewable  energy,  the administration should capitalize on
that policy.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
borrow from Germany's experience in purchasing alternative energy produced by
the private sector as a means to bolster the development of renewable energy.</P>
      <P>Shen made the remarks during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan in which the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions was the centerpiece and which coincided
with a meeting under the U.N.  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
that opened in the Danish capital of Copenhagen that same day.</P>
      <P>He said EPA officials will seize the opportunity of the UNFCCC meeting to lobby
for support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the world group, including
observer status.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will also set a timetable and goals to gradually cut carbon dioxide
emissions," he said.</P>
      <P>With the assistance  of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development
Bureau, TSMC became in June the first company in Taiwan to lead its suppliers in
successfully completing and registering a carbon inventory.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih denied Monday that there is a need to change government
policy toward China, despite the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's)  poorer-than-
expected performance in Saturday's local elections.</P>
      <P>The ruling party, which controlled 14 out of the 17 counties and cities involved
in the elections prior to Saturday's polling, managed to hang on to 12 of them.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government's policy is the result of comprehensive thinking, long
discussion and broad consultation, and has not been formulated in haste.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China, the government will go ahead with it as planned, as it will serve
Taiwan's interests and benefit the public, he added.</P>
      <P>However, the premier said, the government's policy toward China should still
meet three requirements -- the country's needs, public support and legislative
supervision.</P>
      <P>The government will not push any policy that fails to meet any of those
requirements, Wu went on.</P>
      <P>Noting that the proposed ECFA enjoys a support rate of 50 percent to 56 percent
among the public according to the latest poll results, Wu said he hopes to boost
this figure to 60 percent, while bringing opposition down to below 20 percent.</P>
      <P>"We are working hard on this," the premier said, adding that good policy should
be carried out at the right time and should be fully understood by the people,
which he admitted is something the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has
not managed effectively.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, some people in central and southern Taiwan believe
mistakenly that the Ma administration has opened Taiwan to many Chinese
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>In fact, among the 1,415 items of Chinese agricultural products allowed to be
imported into Taiwan, 479 items were approved by the previous KMT
administration, with the other 936 approved by the Democratic Progressive Party
when it was in power.</P>
      <P>"However, President Ma's administration has not approved any items thus far,"
the premier pointed out.</P>

      <P>Taiwan government will work to revive the sport of baseball in Taiwan from the
grassroots level, the country's sports chief said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Efforts will be made first to promote the baseball sport and consolidate its
existence and development from the grassroots level," said Vice Premier Eric
Liluan Chu after attending the first working meeting of a Cabinet-level task
force formed last week under instructions by President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Noting that currently there are 795 little league, youth and junior baseball
teams nationwide, Chu said the government will work to increase the number of
such teams.</P>
      <P>"I hope the number will double in four years," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling also said after the
meeting that the Ministry of Education will be responsible for promoting the
sport, while the Sports Affairs Council will be responsible for training talent
or star players.</P>
      <P>Besides government efforts, she said, corporate sponsorship will also be
solicited to further accelerate the development of baseball in Taiwan, from the
grassroots level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  she said,  the number of baseball  coaches at elementary, junior and
senior high schools will also be increased, while qualification and appraisal of
such coaches will be an issue that will be of equal importance.</P>
      <P>The baseball-revival task force was established last week after President Ma
called a first-ever national conference on baseball on Dec. 1 -- a meeting held
to discuss ways of reviving and upgrading the sport that has been plagued by
game-fixing scandals.</P>
      <P>The conference was convened after some 800 baseball fans took to the streets of
Taipei on Nov. 29 demanding that the government do something to rescue the sport
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first working meeting of the task force held Monday also brought together
officials from the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of the Interior, the
Taipei-based Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) and the Chinese Taipei

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang reiterated Monday that the proposed
cross-Taiwan Strait economic pact will not allow imports of Chinese labor or
agricultural products, and agreed with a legislator's suggestion that a
television debate can be held to better inform the public about related issues.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, at a legislative committee meeting Monday, said
that the ECFA lacks public support mainly because the economics ministry has not
put enough effort into promoting the advantages of the pact and he suggested
that a TV debate might be a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>His comments were made against the backdrop of the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's)
worse-than-expected showing in Saturday's local elections, which has been
attributed in part to the government's cross-strait  policies,  including  its
pursuit of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, many people in the agricultural counties still are not
convinced that the ECFA will not lead to an opening of Taiwan's market to
Chinese workers and agricultural products, even though his ministry has given
that assurance many times.</P>
      <P>Some underground radio shows are also misleading people about the ECFA, he said,
adding that a TV debate "can be planned" to discuss the issue, as Lai suggested.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's three-in-one local elections, the KMT took 12 of the 17 mayor and
magistrate seats that were at stake, gaining 47.88 percent of the votes cast.
This was a weaker performance than in 2005, when it won 50.96 percent of the
vote in the mayor and magistrate elections in 23 counties and cities.</P>
      <P>Some analysts noted that most of the 17 cities and counties in which the
elections were held this year are either known as Taiwan's main food-producing
areas or as home to traditional labor-intensive industries.</P>
      <P>The opposition pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) therefore put
up a strong performance in those areas, a development that might have an adverse
impact on cross-strait exchanges and the signing of an ECFA, the analysts said.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to hold a workshop in Taipei for the

body's decision-making arm, the World Health Assembly.</P>
      <P>Chiou Shu-ti, director-general of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the
Department of Health (DOH), told a news conference Monday that the WHO Winter
School in Taiwan -- Quality Management-Implementation of Health Promotion in
Hospital and Health Services -- will be held Dec. 9-10</P>
      <P>She said the workshop, sponsored by the WHO Collaborating Center for Evidence-
Based Health Promotion in Hospitals and Health Services, based in the Danish
capital of Copenhagen,  will discuss the development strategy for health-
promoting hospitals, the management of health-promoting services quality and
cases of health care.</P>
      <P>Citing DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang, she said health promotion deserves more
attention as it will help the country's loss-making national health insurance
program.</P>
      <P>"By promoting health, we can prevent many serious illnesses, cut down expenses
for surgery and save money for the program, " said Chiou.</P>
      <P>Dr. Hanne Tonnesen, CEO of the International Health-Promoting Hospital
Secretariat, said at the news conference that the more efforts a hospital puts
into health promotion, the fewer beds it will need.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DOH pointed out in a press release that the idea of health
promotion by hospitals is to incorporate health promotion concepts into daily
life to cut the cost of medical care.</P>
      <P>The department  also noted that Taiwan boasts the world's fourth-largest
health-promoting  hospital  network,  with  55 health-promoting hospitals

lift on the first transaction day after the elections, it would hover between
7,500 and 8,000 before edging upward to challenge the 8,000-point mark.</P>
      <P>The analysts also expressed optimism over the market prospects because the

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that a proposed trade pact with China will
not be discussed in the upcoming cross-strait meeting, although both sides will
discuss the progress of the trade pact after the meeting.</P>
      <P>He said the trade pact, officially known as the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) , will be signed in an "open and transparent" environment.</P>
      <P>His words came against the backdrop of the KMT's setback in the just-concluded
weekend local elections, which some had interpreted as the result of public
discontent with the performance of the Ma administration and conspicuously among
them, concerns over his proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Ma said that before the signing of the pact, the government will report to the
Legislative Yuan to fully inform the legislature about its contents.</P>
      <P>After the signing, the pact will also be sent to the legislature for review, he
added.</P>
      <P>He noted that there are a lot of discussions and misgivings about the impacts on
Taiwan after signing the ECFA. There are concerns the trade pact would flood
Taiwan with cheaper Chinese products, cause job losses and make Taiwan too
dependent on China.</P>
      <P>As such, the government will "let the public learn more about the pact in a
relatively transparent  environment.  If it is not transparent enough, then the
public will have misunderstandings and hamper its passage," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In fact, Ma noted that the government has since March sponsored hundreds of
presentations to explain the trade pact, which is intended to promote a normal
cross-strait trade relations, avoid the island being marginalized in regional
trade,  and enhance the globalisation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He stressed that all government policies will promote Taiwan's interests,
safeguard its sovereignty and benefit the people.</P>
      <P>"The government will uphold such principles and attach great importance to
reciprocity and dignity in cross-strait consultations," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the fourth and the latest round of meeting between Chiang Pin-
kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, and Chen Yunlin, president of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, will mainly focus on
four issues.</P>
      <P>The four issues are fishery cooperation, avoidance of double taxation,
examination and certification  of standards and the inspection and quarantine of
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Ma said the four issues will be very technical, and he has asked relevant
government agencies to publish them if possible.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example the recent signing of a memorandum of understanding on
cooperation in financial supervision between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
saying that it was posted on the website after the signing.</P>
      <P>He said that the MOU was signed in a manner of "dignity and reciprocity, " and
there is no question of "dwarfing or sovereignty being compromised."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has listed a variety of products in the light emitting diode
(LED) , photonics, flat-screen monitor and vehicle telematics industries as
priority items in efforts to establish a common standardization system to be
used on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen Jay-san, director-general of the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and
Inspection under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , said in an interview
with CNA Sunday that getting such a system adopted by the two sides of the
strait is expected to help Taiwanese producers secure a position in China's vast
market.</P>
      <P>The four selected industries  are all sectors with strong international
competitiveness, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen is Taiwan's  top negotiator  in talks with China on cross-strait standard
tests and certification cooperation. The two sides are expected to sign an
agreement on the issue in the upcoming meeting between Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and his Chinese
counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, slated for Dec. 21 in Taichung City,
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Because of the different standards for 3C products adopted on either side of the
strait, Taiwan was unable to sell its big-screen digital television sets to
China, causing local companies to miss out on the surge in demand there during
the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Once an agreement on standard test and certification cooperation is forged, the
bureau and its Chinese counterpart can begin follow-up contact and coordination
on regular and technical matters, including Chinese authorization for Taiwan to
conduct standard checks on local factories producing digital TVs for sale in
China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the accord will cover the five categories of standards, metrology,
test  cooperation,  verification  and  certification cooperation, aimed mainly
at boosting industrial competitiveness, as well as consumer product safety, a
category that is designed to protect consumer health and which will allow Taiwan
to screen food safety directly at source.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as Taiwan and China are both active in the promotion of cooperation
in the LED and wireless broadband communication industries, Taiwan's Industrial
Technology Research Institute and the Beijing-based National Lighting Test
Center are expected to reach an agreement that allows mutual recognition of LED
tests by the end of the month, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The trade opportunities are "amazingly big," as China is carrying out a national
project to replace incandescent streetlamps in major cities with LED bulbs, said
Wu Ming-chi, an MOEA official responsible for industrial technology affairs.</P>
      <P>The project means there will be demand for at least 2 million LED streetlamps
every year in China, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Given the vast Chinese market, having the two sides share common industrial
standards will put Taiwanese businesses in the best position to take a market
share in China, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese divided on who lost, who won elections: newspaper surveys</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
12/07/09  20:18:45</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opinion surveys have found that Taiwanese people are divided on how to
characterize the just-concluded weekend local elections in Taiwan, which saw the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party winning most of the seats and a higher percentage
of votes, but the opposition claiming success because it gained the largest
percentage of votes it has ever gotten in local elections.</P>
      <P>The elections for mayors and county chiefs, city and county councilors, and
township heads was widely interpreted by the media and analysts as a setback for
the ruling party and President Ma Ying-jeou and a boost for the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Respondents to opinion surveys conducted by two major local newspapers, however,
offered mixed interpretations of the results.</P>
      <P>While 44 percent of the respondents to the local daily newspaper United Daily
News' (UDN) survey said the opposition party won the election, only 39 percent
of those interviewed by another newspaper, the China Times, gave a similar
conclusion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some 19 percent of the respondents in the UDN survey said they
thought the KMT and the DPP finished neck-to-neck, while 9 percent said that the
DPP had lost.</P>
      <P>The UDN survey also showed that the "fading" public appeal of President Ma Ying-
jeou, from the ruling party, is one of the three reasons behind his party the
KMT's less-than-ideal performance in the elections.</P>
      <P>The poll showed Ma's approval rating has slipped one point to 33 percent since
former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan stepped down on Sept. 7 to shoulder
responsibility for the government's delayed response to Typhoon Morakot, which
struck Taiwan in August, killing more than 600 people.</P>
      <P>When Ma was inaugurated on May 20, 2008, his approval rating was at 66 percent.
It had dropped to a low of 34 percent by the end of his first year in office.</P>
      <P>Asked what they thought was responsible for the KMT's losses, 46 percent  of the
respondents  in the  UDN  survey  said  the administration's poor performance,
and 44 percent said its policies, such as its pursuit of an economic cooperation
framework agreement with China and its lifting of a ban on certain U.S. beef
products.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the  UDN survey  found  that  the rate  of dissatisfaction with
the president's performance has risen from 45 percent two months ago to 49
percent in the wake of Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the approval rating of DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen has shot
up to 43 percent from 27 percent on May 18 when she led a protest march against
Ma's administration, according to UDN survey.</P>
      <P>The UDN survey had collected 1,066 valid samples from adults and the margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The respondents were randomly
selected throughout Taiwan through the telephone directory.</P>
      <P>The China Times survey had surveyed 711 adults and the margin of error was plus
or minus 3.7 percentage points. It was also conducted through telephone
interviews and the respondents were randomly selected.</P>
      <P>Saturday's election showed the KMT winning 12 of the 17 counties and cities in
which elections were held, but only 47.88 percent of the votes cast, lower than
the 50.96 percent it won in the last local elections four years ago.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the DPP won 45.32 percent of the votes cast, higher than the
41.95 percent it won in 2005. It also gained one more county, up from the three
it already controlled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Election results are a warning for Taiwan's President Ma: analysts</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>- Taiwan's just-ended weekend local elections are in fact a warning for Taiwan's
President Ma Ying-jeou and the ruling Kuomintang ahead of even more crucial
elections late next year and the presidential race in 2012, analysts said.</P>
      <P>"Voters were in fact issuing a strict warning" to Ma, whose approval rating has
dropped to an alert level since the Typhoon Morakot disaster, Hu Chu-ching, an
associate professor of politics at Tunghai University, wrote in an opinion piece
in the United Daily News' Monday edition.</P>
      <P>"The Ma Ying-jeou phenomenon that prevailed for four years came to an end with
the local elections, " Hu said.</P>
      <P>The UDN's Hu noted that some "deep-blue" voters who had been firm supporters of
Ma and his clean image had turned their backs on the KMT in the elections. The
party should therefore seek to strengthen its alliances with its other lighter-
blue parties, Hu suggested.</P>
      <P>He reminded the KMT-led blue camp that the 2010 elections for heads of Taiwan's
eight largest cities and counties will involve 60 percent of Taiwan's
population, most of whom are urban residents, and will be the true test of the
KMT administration. The just-concluded local elections held in 17 of Taiwan's 25
counties and cities covered only about 40 percent of the population, he noted.</P>
      <P>For the opposition DPP, the election results show that the party has finally
emerged from the shadow of the scandal-ridden former President Chen Shui-bian,
according to another scholar writing in the paper.</P>
      <P>The results of Saturday elections are not only a lesson for Ma and the KMT, but
also show that independent voters have veered toward the DPP and its policies,
said Chen Chao-chien, an assistant professor in the department  of public
affairs at Ming Chuan University.</P>
      <P>The DPP must present a clear picture of its policies and win back the people's
trust if it wants to beach the "blue whale" (KMT) in next year's elections, Chen
suggested.</P>
      <P>The scholar expressed the view that although the DPP's chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen,
nicknamed "Shiao Ying" (petite Ying) ,  " has consolidated her leadership of the
DPP with its substantial gains in Saturday's local elections, she will face
challenges from an emerging "anti-Ying" alliance.</P>
      <P>The 53-year-old Tsai took up leadership of the party at a time when it was
struggling to deal with the fallout from a slew of corruption scandals that had
engulfed its former leader, former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's elections, the KMT won the majority of mayoral and magistrate
seats, but gained only 47.88 percent of the votes cast. In the last local
elections in 2005, the KMT took a higher percentage - 50.96 percent - of the
votes. The party also lost two major seats in Yilan and Hualien counties that it
had held for the past four years.</P>
      <P>In this election, the DPP won 45.32 percent of the total number of votes cast --
which was a significant gain from the 41.95 percent it won four years ago.</P>
      <P>The 2005 elections, however, were for magistrates and mayors in 23 counties and
cities, instead of this year's 17.</P>
      <P>The turnout rate in this year's election was 63.34 percent, compared to 66.22
percent in the 2005 poll.</P>

      <P>State-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) , Taiwan's only power distributor, will
come close to breaking even in 2009 after a difficult 2008 but expects to post a
stiff loss next year based on an anticipated rise in crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>The company is set to post a small loss of NT$1 billion (US$3.09 million) this
year,  Taipower Chairman Edward Chen said at a legislative hearing Monday, far
below the record high NT$101.35 billion pre-tax loss and NT$75.6 billion net
loss it reported in 2008.</P>
      <P>Chen warned, however, that the recovering global economy could push demand for
crude oil up and drive oil prices -- and the utility's costs -- higher next
year, hurting profitability.</P>
      <P>Taipower is forecasting a net loss of NT$26.7 billion in 2010, based on
projected total revenues of NT$507.3 billion and expenses of NT$534 billion,
Chen said, but he cautioned that if oil prices rise more than expected, the loss
will be higher.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taipower's estimates are based on an average price of US$73
per barrel in 2010 for West Texas intermediate crude, more than US$5 lower than
the price forecast by the U.S. Department of Energy.</P>
      <P>Taipower relies on imported oil, coal and natural gas for nearly 75 percent of
its power generation, and with the cost of electricity in Taiwan kept at
relatively low levels, the company is vulnerable to spikes in energy prices.</P>
      <P>It posted an NT$23.1 billion net loss in 2007 as raw material costs began moving
higher before registering a record loss last year.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou may be fined NT$500,000 after the examination committee
of the Yilan County Election Commission resolved Monday that Ma had violated the
Public Officials Election and Recall Act while addressing a campaign rally in
Yilan on Nov. 25.</P>
      <P>The election commission will meet Tuesday to decide whether or not to abide by
the examination committee's finding and fine the president for citing a media
pre-election survey at the rally.</P>
      <P>Acting in his capacity as Kuomintang (KMT) chairman, Ma was campaigning for
incumbent county magistrate Lu Kuo-hwa ahead of the Dec. 5 county chief election
when he told the crowd that Lu had taken the lead in a local poll.</P>
      <P>According to Article 53 of the election law,  parties or individuals are
prohibited from publishing, reporting, disseminating, citing or commenting on
any polling materials with regard to relevant candidates or the election itself
during a period of 10 days before election day.</P>
      <P>The Yilan Election Commission sent a letter to KMT headquarters, demanding an
explanation  of the remarks after initiating  an investigation on Nov. 26.</P>
      <P>While Ma promptly apologized through KMT Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po at a
press conference, the KMT on Dec. 4 submitted a statement to the commission,
elaborating on the incident.</P>
      <P>Only one of the 25 members of the examination committee was absent from Monday's
deliberations, and 21 of those attending the meeting judged that Ma had violated
the regulations.</P>
      <P>While such a violation could lead to a fine of between NT$500,000 and NT$5
million, the committee suggested a fine of NT$500,000 because Ma was only a
campaign assistant.</P>
      <P>At the Nov. 26 press conference, KMT Secretary-General Chan stressed that the
party chairman and the party would respect the ruling of the Yilan County
Election Commission, though Ma is entitled to appeal its decision.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Monday:
Apple Daily Next Year's Battle</P>
      <P>The prelude to the battles for five municipality mayoral posts that will be up
for grabs next year will start soon.</P>
      <P>The just-concluded  local elections  have helped opposition Democratic
Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen consolidate her leadership within the
party, but she will soon face tough challenges as infighting over next year's
poll will be far more serious.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang is expected to be more unified for the five municipality
mayoral races, as its politicians should have learned lessons from Saturday's
poll in which the party suffered a setback because of splits in some districts.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the DPP performed better than expected because it was more unified
than the KMT. However, infighting over next year's battles has already emerged
within the DPP ranks. If the party leadership fails to properly address this
problem, the DPP might lose one of the two seats it now holds.</P>
      <P>As next year's elections will involve important urban areas and 60 percent of
Taiwan's population, it would deal a real blow to President Ma Ying-jeou's
leadership if the DPP manages to win three of the five seats up for grabs.
Whether or this scenario will play out depends on the KMT's administrative
record and the DPP's ability to avoid becoming giddy-headed over its small gains
in Saturday's elections. Commercial Times Forward-looking critical to Taiwan's
future</P>
      <P>The hotly contested three-in-one local elections have drawn to an end. Although
they were routine grassroots elections, the public made a statement in the polls
that should not be overlooked.</P>
      <P>The electoral results show that Taiwan's voters have become more mature as they
used their ballots to teach the ruling Kuomintang a lesson for its lackluster
administrative performance.</P>
      <P>The elections, however, were mainly the prelude to next year's battles for five
municipality mayoral posts whose results will have a far more direct impact on
the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>We earnestly hope both the KMT and the opposition Demoncratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will come up with forward-looking policy initiatives in the run-up to the
municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's future lies in whether the two parties can move from a zero-sum
confrontation to benign competition. As the country's top leader, President Ma
Ying-jeou is obligated to present strategies that will enable Taiwan to take on
challenges  arising  from globalization, China's rise as a new economic
powerhouse, and the integration of ASEAN member states and China, Japan and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's main opposition force, the DPP, while advocating the importance of
preserving Taiwan's sovereignty, should also tell voters how Taiwan can avoid
being marginalized in the current wave of regional integration and globalization
and sustain its growth.</P>
      <P>If both parties drag their feet on zero-sum games, Taiwan's window of
opportunity may eventually close. At that point, gaining power in Taiwan will be
meaningless. China Times Diploma recognition marks start of transforming
demagogy</P>
      <P>Public response to the Ministry of Education's recent decision to recognize
academic credentials issued by 41 top-notch universities in China has been
generally positive.</P>
      <P>The longstanding ban on recognizing Chinese university diplomas is only part of
Taiwan's demagogic political culture and we hope the education  ministry's
latest move will mark the beginning of transforming closed-minded ways of
thinking as reflected in populist rhetoric.</P>
      <P>As demagogy is a strategy for gaining political power by appealing to the
prejudices, emotions, fears and expectations of the public with impassioned
rhetoric and propaganda, a demagogic society could  become  inward-looking,
xenophobic,  isolationist  and retrogressive in the long run.</P>
      <P>Over the years, demagogic overtures have often weighed in on the government's
policy making. As a result, state-owned enterprises and academic research
institutions dare not offer high pay to recruit outstanding foreign talents to
infuse ingenuity into their ranks because they are afraid of demagogic
criticism.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan wants to continue playing a significant role in the world arena, it
must change closed-minded demagogic mentality and embrace talented people with
open arms.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's refusal to recognize China's academic accreditation has denied itself a
source of emerging talent. We hope the government will address this issue
because the loss of talented people is one of the toughest challenges facing
Taiwan today. Economic Daily News KMT's election setback comes at right time</P>
      <P>Saturday's election setback could not have come at a better time for the ruling
Kuomintang as it has brought an opportunity for Taiwan to be better off in the
future.</P>
      <P>It sent a clear message to the KMT: voters are dissatisfied with the Ma Ying-
jeou administration's performance over the past 18 months.</P>
      <P>Ma has failed to deliver on its promise to reform the economy. The global
economic map has undergone a reshuffle in the wake of the global financial
crisis but the Ma administration has not come up with any macroeconomic
development strategies, instead indulging itself in trival issues about the
"grassroots economy."</P>
      <P>We hope the latest election setback will serve as a wake-up call for the Ma
administration and look forward to a broad road map that will lead to Taiwan's
overall economic restructuring and sustainable growth.</P>
      <P>We also hope that the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's election gains
will not be overblown as a public backlash against the KMT administration's
policy toward increased engagement with China or its plan to sign a cross-strait
economic cooperation framework agreement.</P>
      <P>Ma's presidential campaign platform to repair ties with China has the support of
nearly 60 percent of voters, and the approach should not be changed simply
because of a modest election setback.</P>

that "all cultural creativity has a price" and free cultural creativity from the
constraints of rigid budget law.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang Nai-shin of the ruling Kuomintang proposed that government
expenditures on creative services or assets with an economic utility of more
than two years should be listed as a capital expense rather than as a current
expense under budget law.</P>
      <P>At present, expenditures reported as current expenses leave little room for
services such as "design" that are not tangible or cannot be easily assessed.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuan Bi-ling of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party expressed
her appreciation for Chiang's ideas.</P>
      <P>"Cultural activities should carry a price" said Kuan, who served as Kaohsiung
City's cultural chief before becoming a lawmaker.</P>
      <P>She cited one project where she coordinated the budget of a wall made with
artistic tiles in Taipei County in which the government would only calculate the
cost of the project based on the price of tiles, but the builder insisted on a
higher price because he had paid high design fees to an artist.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the committee also decided to divide cultural creative industries
into 15 sectors -- visual arts, music and performing arts, cultural asset
applications and exhibition and performing facilities, artifacts, movie,
broadcast and television, publication, advertising, product  design,  visual
communication  design,  brand design, architectural design, digital content,
creative life, popular music and cultural content.</P>
      <P>The version proposed  by the Council for Cultural Affairs originally divided the
industry into four categories: arts, media, design and digital content.</P>
      <P>The committee also considered a proposed artistic coupon for elementary and
junior high school students and agreed to include the proposal in a tax
incentive program for overall consideration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>198 suspects detained for vote-buying during local elections</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice reported Monday that 198 suspects were detained on
charges of buying votes at the conclusion of the Dec. 5 elections for mayors and
county chiefs, county councilors and township chiefs.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Ministry of Justice indicated that in recent weeks,
judicial authorities around the island received 4,380 reports of suspected vote-
buying. While 2,413 cases were accepted and investigated, only 56 suspects have
been indicted to date.</P>
      <P>Judging that cash has been the most effective incentive in luring voters,
judicial authorities concentrated their efforts during these elections on trying
to seize the large sums distributed to brokers to buy votes.</P>
      <P>As of the eve of election day, prosecutors offices around the country had seized
over NT$12 million, of which nearly 40 percent was attributed to candidates for
the county council in Miaoli County in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In May 2009, the Ministry of Justice announced revised guidelines for vote-
buying investigations and the performance evaluation of prosecutors' offices.</P>
      <P>The guidelines required vote-buying investigations to be resolved within nine
months after an election and district prosecutors to initiate legal proceedings
against those found buying their way into public office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bank of Taiwan plans financial building in Shanghai</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Dec. 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairwoman of the state-owned Bank of Taiwan (BOT) said Monday that the bank
will not rule out the possibility of financing a Taiwanese financial building in
Shanghai that will not only be used as its Shanghai branch office but could also
be leased to other Taiwanese banks.</P>
      <P>According to Susan Chang, who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a
financial seminar in the Chinese city, a BOT application for setting up a
representative office in China has already been approved by Shanghai's banking
regulatory body and is awaiting Beijing's approval.</P>
      <P>Chang said that during her visit, she will look for possible locations for
setting up a BOT branch there.</P>
      <P>BOT, established in 1946, used to have a Shanghai branch office on the Bund in
the late 1940's, and Chang said the bank has contacted the office's present
owner -- China Merchants Bank -- to see if BOT can buy it back.</P>
      <P>"We just want to check it out. We may not be able to afford it if the price is
too high," said Chang.</P>
      <P>She said the bank is waiting for the next round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks,
which are expected to offer a clue about whether it will be able to set up a
branch office rather than just a representative office.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that at present, Taiwanese banks need to have a representative
office in China that has been established for at least two years before it can
be upgraded to a branch. However, if there is a breakthrough during the talks on
a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, it is
likely that they will be permitted to directly set up branches.</P>
      <P>In addition, she also said the ECFA could allow Taiwanese banks to conduct
business in Chinese yuan, which is what Taiwanese businessmen there need most.</P>
      <P>The representative offices of Taiwanese banks in China are not allowed to offer
banking services and are limited to marketing and research.</P>
      <P>Several of them, however, are planning to open branches in China following the
signing last month of a long-anticipated financial memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with China under which Taiwan and China have agreed to allow greater
access to each other's financial markets. The MOU lays the groundwork for moves
that will allow the establishment of bank branches in each other's territories,
with future agreements expected to allow investment in each other's banks.</P>

      <P>Just two days after her party exceeded expectations in local elections,
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Monday that it was still too early to talk about potential candidates for the
special municipality elections next year.</P>
      <P>The 53-year-old Tsai, who took over the helm of the battered party in May 2008
after it was drubbed earlier in the year in legislative and presidential
elections,  has been tapped as a potential candidate for Taipei City mayor.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the party will have to specify its strategies and objectives for next
year's municipality elections, but she hoped DPP members would stop naming
potential candidates for now.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey by the local daily the United Daily News,
Tsai's approval rating has shot up to 43 percent from 27 percent on May 18 when
she led a protest march against Ma's administration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former premier and ex-Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang,
believed to be a strong contender in race for chief of New Taipei City (the new
name for an upgraded Taipei County) , said Sunday that "the DPP's nomination
mechanism and the public opinion of every municipality should be respected."</P>
      <P>Su served as Taipei County magistrate from 1997-2004.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Wang Sing-nan said Monday that Tsai and Su are the ideal DPP
candidates to run in next year's Taipei City and New Taipei City races.</P>
      <P>Before Chou Hsi-wei of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) was elected Taipei County
magistrate in 2005, the county had been governed by the DPP since 1989. Chou has
already said he will seek re-election.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu of the KMT has also been mentioned by the media as
a possible contender in New Taipei City. Chu refused to comment but said his
priority now is to do his job well in the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin of the KMT, who also intends to seek re-election next
year, said Monday that Tsai would be an opponent worthy of respect.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu of the KMT told Hong Kong media Monday that he will
consider seeking re-election in Taichung City next year.</P>
      <P>Hu said during his visit in Hong Kong that he will not consider running in an
election outside Taichung City, and he stressed that he is very healthy and can
visit many places in the world, according to Hong Kong media reports.</P>
      <P>As for Kaohsiung municipality, Mayor Chen Chu of the DPP said it is too early to
name the candidates but indicated that she would respect the party's nomination
mechanism and public opinion.</P>
      <P>Elections for the heads of five municipalities -- Taipei City, New Taipei City,
Taichung (a merger of Taichung City and County) , Tainan (a merger of Tainan
City and County) and Kaohsiung (a merger of Kaohsiung City and County) -- will

      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade posted year-on-year growth in both exports and imports in
November for the first time since September 2008, the latest indication that
global and local trade are on the rebound.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports amounted to US$17.9 billion in November while exports reached
US$20.02 billion, both figures the highest for a single month in more than a
year, according to Ministry of Finance (MOF) statistics released Monday.</P>
      <P>Overall exports grew at a 19.4 percent annual clip in November, with optical
products posting the highest growth of any single product category at 80.2
percent, said Lin Li-chen, director of the MOF's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>"Among optical products,  display  panels saw the steepest increase, indicating
that the panel industry has bottomed out of the recession, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>In terms of imports, inbound shipments of electronic parts and components surged
to their highest level since April 2008 and machinery imports were at their
highest since May 2008, indicating that the export-driven electronics industry
has regained momentum and domestic investment has also rebounded.</P>
      <P>Compared with October,  November's exports increased US$200 million, with
shipments to the United States and ASEAN member states posting the largest
gains, followed by China and Hong Kong, Europe and Japan, in that order.</P>
      <P>In annual terms, November's exports increased US$3.25 billion from the year-
earlier level, with shipments to China and Hong Kong increasing the most,
followed by the six major ASEAN states.</P>
      <P>Sales to China and Hong Kong, which have increased steadily for three
consecutive months, grew 47.8 percent in November from a year earlier, thanks to
substantial increases in exports of electronics and optical products.</P>
      <P>In November, only exports to the United States and Japan posted negative year-
on-year growth, contracting 5.8 percent and 6.5 percent year-on-year,
respectively, while shipments to other major markets, including China/Hong Kong,
Europe and ASEAN, all posted gains.</P>
      <P>Lin said exports to the U.S. and Japan are both expected to register year-on-
year increases in December.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lin predicted that both imports and exports will see significant year-
on-year growth in December.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of 2009, Taiwan exported US$183.64 billion worth of
goods, down 24.1 percent from the year earlier level.</P>
      <P>"The contraction was the worst in our history," Lin said, adding that even if
December posts a substantial growth, the annual decline will not fall below 20
percent.</P>
      <P>Still, she said, Taiwan only lags behind China and South Korea in terms of
exports, while performing better than most other Asian and Western countries,
including the United States, Britain, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan had a US$27.36 billion foreign trade surplus for the first 11
months of the year, a record high for the period.</P>

      <P>Artistic and cultural creativity will be fairly valued in government projects if
a draft act to develop cultural  creative industries  that is being considered
by a legislative committee becomes law in the future.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the legislature's Education and Culture Committee reached a consensus
on some clauses in the various proposed versions of the draft act, including on

      <P>Sales to China and Hong Kong, which have increased steadily for three
consecutive months, grew 47.8 percent in November from a year earlier, thanks to
substantial increases in exports of electronics and optical products.</P>
      <P>In November, only exports to the United States and Japan posted negative year-
on-year growth, contracting 5.8 percent and 6.5 percent year-on-year,
respectively, while shipments to other major markets, including China/Hong Kong,
Europe and ASEAN, all posted gains.</P>
      <P>Lin said exports to the U.S. and Japan are both expected to register year-on-
year increases in December.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lin predicted that both imports and exports will see significant year-
on-year growth in December.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of 2009, Taiwan exported US$183.64 billion worth of
goods, down 24.1 percent from the year earlier level.</P>
      <P>"The contraction was the worst in our history," Lin said, adding that even if
December posts a substantial growth, the annual decline will not fall below 20
percent.</P>
      <P>Still, she said, Taiwan only lags behind China and South Korea in terms of
exports, while performing better than most other Asian and Western countries,
including the United States, Britain, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan had a US$27.36 billion foreign trade surplus for the first 11

      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade posted year-on-year growth in both exports and imports in
November for the first time since September 2008, the latest indication that
global and local trade are on the rebound.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports amounted to US$17.9 billion in November while exports reached
US$20.02 billion, both figures the highest for a single month in more than a
year, according to Ministry of Finance (MOF) statistics released Monday.</P>
      <P>Overall exports grew at a 19.4 percent annual clip in November, with optical
products posting the highest growth of any single product category at 80.2
percent, said Lin Li-chen, director of the MOF's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>"Among optical products,  display  panels saw the steepest increase, indicating
that the panel industry has bottomed out of the recession, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>In terms of imports, inbound shipments of electronic parts and components surged
to their highest level since April 2008 and machinery imports were at their
highest since May 2008, indicating that the export-driven electronics industry
has regained momentum and domestic investment has also rebounded.</P>
      <P>Compared with October,  November's exports increased US$200 million, with
shipments to the United States and ASEAN member states posting the largest
gains, followed by China and Hong Kong, Europe and Japan, in that order.</P>
      <P>In annual terms, November's exports increased US$3.25 billion from the year-

      <P>Just two days after her party exceeded expectations in local elections,
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Monday that it was still too early to talk about potential candidates for the
special municipality elections next year.</P>
      <P>The 53-year-old Tsai, who took over the helm of the battered party in May 2008
after it was drubbed earlier in the year in legislative and presidential
elections,  has been tapped as a potential candidate for Taipei City mayor.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the party will have to specify its strategies and objectives for next
year's municipality elections, but she hoped DPP members would stop naming
potential candidates for now.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey by the local daily the United Daily News,
Tsai's approval rating has shot up to 43 percent from 27 percent on May 18 when
she led a protest march against Ma's administration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former premier and ex-Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang,
believed to be a strong contender in race for chief of New Taipei City (the new
name for an upgraded Taipei County) , said Sunday that "the DPP's nomination
mechanism and the public opinion of every municipality should be respected."</P>
      <P>Su served as Taipei County magistrate from 1997-2004.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Wang Sing-nan said Monday that Tsai and Su are the ideal DPP
candidates to run in next year's Taipei City and New Taipei City races.</P>
      <P>Before Chou Hsi-wei of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) was elected Taipei County
magistrate in 2005, the county had been governed by the DPP since 1989. Chou has
already said he will seek re-election.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu of the KMT has also been mentioned by the media as
a possible contender in New Taipei City. Chu refused to comment but said his
priority now is to do his job well in the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin of the KMT, who also intends to seek re-election next
year, said Monday that Tsai would be an opponent worthy of respect.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu of the KMT told Hong Kong media Monday that he will
consider seeking re-election in Taichung City next year.</P>
      <P>Hu said during his visit in Hong Kong that he will not consider running in an
election outside Taichung City, and he stressed that he is very healthy and can
visit many places in the world, according to Hong Kong media reports.</P>
      <P>As for Kaohsiung municipality, Mayor Chen Chu of the DPP said it is too early to
name the candidates but indicated that she would respect the party's nomination
mechanism and public opinion.</P>
      <P>Elections for the heads of five municipalities -- Taipei City, New Taipei City,
Taichung (a merger of Taichung City and County) , Tainan (a merger of Tainan
City and County) and Kaohsiung (a merger of Kaohsiung City and County) -- will
be held in late 2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bank of Taiwan plans financial building in Shanghai</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Dec. 7 (CNA)
12/08/09  09:21:45
(By Min-kun Chang and Fanny Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairwoman of the state-owned Bank of Taiwan (BOT) said Monday that the bank
will not rule out the possibility of financing a Taiwanese financial building in
Shanghai that will not only be used as its Shanghai branch office but could also
be leased to other Taiwanese banks.</P>
      <P>According to Susan Chang, who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a
financial seminar in the Chinese city, a BOT application for setting up a
representative office in China has already been approved by Shanghai's banking
regulatory body and is awaiting Beijing's approval.</P>
      <P>Chang said that during her visit, she will look for possible locations for
setting up a BOT branch there.</P>
      <P>BOT, established in 1946, used to have a Shanghai branch office on the Bund in
the late 1940's, and Chang said the bank has contacted the office's present
owner -- China Merchants Bank -- to see if BOT can buy it back.</P>
      <P>"We just want to check it out. We may not be able to afford it if the price is
too high," said Chang.</P>
      <P>She said the bank is waiting for the next round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks,
which are expected to offer a clue about whether it will be able to set up a
branch office rather than just a representative office.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that at present, Taiwanese banks need to have a representative
office in China that has been established for at least two years before it can
be upgraded to a branch. However, if there is a breakthrough during the talks on
a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, it is
likely that they will be permitted to directly set up branches.</P>
      <P>In addition, she also said the ECFA could allow Taiwanese banks to conduct
business in Chinese yuan, which is what Taiwanese businessmen there need most.</P>
      <P>The representative offices of Taiwanese banks in China are not allowed to offer
banking services and are limited to marketing and research.</P>
      <P>Several of them, however, are planning to open branches in China following the
signing last month of a long-anticipated financial memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with China under which Taiwan and China have agreed to allow greater
access to each other's financial markets. The MOU lays the groundwork for moves
that will allow the establishment of bank branches in each other's territories,
with future agreements expected to allow investment in each other's banks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>198 suspects detained for vote-buying during local elections</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice reported Monday that 198 suspects were detained on
charges of buying votes at the conclusion of the Dec. 5 elections for mayors and
county chiefs, county councilors and township chiefs.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Ministry of Justice indicated that in recent weeks,
judicial authorities around the island received 4,380 reports of suspected vote-
buying. While 2,413 cases were accepted and investigated, only 56 suspects have
been indicted to date.</P>
      <P>Judging that cash has been the most effective incentive in luring voters,
judicial authorities concentrated their efforts during these elections on trying
to seize the large sums distributed to brokers to buy votes.</P>
      <P>As of the eve of election day, prosecutors offices around the country had seized
over NT$12 million, of which nearly 40 percent was attributed to candidates for
the county council in Miaoli County in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In May 2009, the Ministry of Justice announced revised guidelines for vote-
buying investigations and the performance evaluation of prosecutors' offices.</P>
      <P>The guidelines required vote-buying investigations to be resolved within nine
months after an election and district prosecutors to initiate legal proceedings
against those found buying their way into public office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Artistic and cultural creativity will be fairly valued in government projects if
a draft act to develop cultural  creative industries  that is being considered
by a legislative committee becomes law in the future.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the legislature's Education and Culture Committee reached a consensus
on some clauses in the various proposed versions of the draft act, including on
one that would enable the government to pay more for cultural creativity.</P>
      <P>The committee's lawmakers agreed that the government should promote the concept
that "all cultural creativity has a price" and free cultural creativity from the
constraints of rigid budget law.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang Nai-shin of the ruling Kuomintang proposed that government
expenditures on creative services or assets with an economic utility of more
than two years should be listed as a capital expense rather than as a current
expense under budget law.</P>
      <P>At present, expenditures reported as current expenses leave little room for
services such as "design" that are not tangible or cannot be easily assessed.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuan Bi-ling of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party expressed
her appreciation for Chiang's ideas.</P>
      <P>"Cultural activities should carry a price" said Kuan, who served as Kaohsiung
City's cultural chief before becoming a lawmaker.</P>
      <P>She cited one project where she coordinated the budget of a wall made with
artistic tiles in Taipei County in which the government would only calculate the
cost of the project based on the price of tiles, but the builder insisted on a
higher price because he had paid high design fees to an artist.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the committee also decided to divide cultural creative industries
into 15 sectors -- visual arts, music and performing arts, cultural asset
applications and exhibition and performing facilities, artifacts, movie,
broadcast and television, publication, advertising, product  design,  visual
communication  design,  brand design, architectural design, digital content,
creative life, popular music and cultural content.</P>
      <P>The version proposed  by the Council for Cultural Affairs originally divided the
industry into four categories: arts, media, design and digital content.</P>
      <P>The committee also considered a proposed artistic coupon for elementary and
junior high school students and agreed to include the proposal in a tax
incentive program for overall consideration.</P>

      <P>With the conclusion of Saturday's local elections, the attention has now turned
to the next major battleground -- the election of heads of five special
municipalities -- which account for 60 percent of the nation's population.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on who will represent the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to
run in Taipei:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's remarks that "I will be ready, when
the party needs me to be ready" was considered an indication that she is willing
to enter the race for Taipei mayor. However,  she urged party members not to
designate candidates recklessly on Monday, because she has never said that she
will run. She said that the DPP should set up an overall goal before choosing
candidates. It is too early to discuss this issue now.</P>
      <P>DPP Lawmakers Yeh Yi-jin and Lai Ching-te called for moving up party primaries
to March next year to choose party candidates. They said that the longer the
time the primaries take, the shorter the time the candidates will be left with
before the races, while it takes more time to prepare for municipalities
elections, and belated primaries will cause fierce splits within the party.
(Dec. 8, 2009)</P>
      <P>China Times: Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said on Monday that the election of the
mayor of Taipei City, which is the capital of the country, is politically
significant. He is preparing to seek a second term on the ruling KMT ticket next
year.</P>
      <P>Learning that he could face DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen in that race, Hau said
Tsai is a scholar with experience in serving in the Cabinet and has succeeded in
transforming the DPP; she would be a respected rival. (Dec. 8, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News: The DPP garnered a record high of 45 percent of the votes in
the just-concluded local elections which enabled it not only to achieve an
excellent performance in the races for chiefs in cities and counties, but also
to increase the number of townships it controls. The party grabbed 11 townships
in Pingtung County, 6 townships in Yunlin County, and eight townships in Chiayi
County.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan County, which is the Kuomintang's stronghold, the DPP won the
townships of Guishan and Guanyin. Yuchih Township in Nantou County also saw its
first DPP chief. (Dec. 8, 2009)</P>

Dec.  5 could affect the government's cross-strait policies, President Ma
stressed Monday that no negotiations on the proposed ECFA will be held during
the upcoming meeting between Chiang Pin-kung,  chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), later this month.</P>
      <P>The ECFA-related discussions and signing of the agreement will be conducted in a
"relatively transparent" environment to allow the people to gain knowledge of
its contents, Ma pledged. (Dec. 8, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang promised Monday at the Legislative
Yuan that he is willing to have an open debate on television with those who are
against the proposed ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>It would be the first time that the government holds a public debate on TV to
promote its major policies if the Ministry of Economic Affairs hosts the TV
debate. (Dec. 8, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma has promised that the legislature will be completely informed of
the proposed ECFA's content before it is signed and that the agreement will be
delivered to the Legislative Yuan for approval after it is signed.</P>
      <P>Doubting President Ma can really sense many people's anxiety and worry over the
ECFA's formation, opposition Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-
wen said on the ECFA dispute, a national referendum is the society's most-needed
form of public monitoring on the issue. (Dec. 8, 2009)</P>

      <P>Health authorities reported Tuesday that a 53-year-old woman with underlying
health conditions has died from influenza A(H1N1), the 33rd person in Taiwan to
die from the virus.</P>
      <P>The patient, a resident of Taipei County, had suffered from heart disease,
diabetes and high blood pressure, according to the Central Epidemics Command
Center (CECC).</P>
      <P>"Eighty-five percent of those people who died of H1N1 flu had been patients of
chronic diseases, " said Chou Jih-haw, deputy director-general of the Centers
for Disease Control.</P>
      <P>The total number of H1NI flu infection cases since the outbreak began had
reached 766 as of Monday, of which 33 had resulted in death, according to the
CECC.</P>
      <P>Most of these cases had recovered and been discharged, the CECC said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as of Monday, 479 classes in 325 schools around the country remained
closed because of H1N1 infections  among the students. The number of affected
classes accounts for 0.32 percent of the total, according to the CECC.</P>
      <P>The center attributed the decline in the number of class closures mainly to an
across-the-board vaccination program launched on Nov. 16 to all students in the
country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Key Taiwan hi-tech companies get carbon footprint certificates</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five major companies representing the supply chain spectrum of Taiwan's high-
technology industry have all obtained carbon footprint certificates from
authoritative organizations from home and abroad for their latest products.</P>
      <P>Their efforts, recognized recently by the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers Association (TEEMA) , were aimed at keeping up with the global
trend of protecting the environment and securing greater market potential for
their products, said TEEMA Chairman Arthur Yu-cheng Chiao.</P>
      <P>The five  technological  giants  were Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC) , United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) , Chi Mei
Optoelectronics (CMO) ,  Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) and ASUSTeK
Computer (ASUS).</P>
      <P>They were awarded with TEEMA's low-carbon labels in November after they obtained
carbon footprint  certificates  for their low-carbon products from professional
verification organizations, including DNV in Norway,  the Swiss group SGS,  and
Taiwan's Environment and Development Foundation.</P>
      <P>"Supply chain carbon footprint management  is a key issue concerning the
development of Taiwan's high-technology industry in the future," Chiao said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's electrical and electronic sector churned out US$216.6 billion worth of
products in 2008, representing 48.84 percent of the country's entire industrial
output, Chiao quoted TEEMA tallies as indicating.</P>
      <P>Of that total, US$118.7 billion worth of products went to exports, comprising
46.7 percent of Taiwan's total export trade that year.</P>
      <P>"It's crucial that Taiwanese manufacturers start managing their products' carbon
footprint, " Chiao said, pointing out that reducing carbon dioxide emissions has
become an increasingly pressing issue of global importance.</P>
      <P>In a few years, he added, Taiwan's consumer electronics products bound for North
America and Europe will not only have to be competitive in terms of pricing,
they also must be competitive in terms of carbon footprint reduction.</P>
      <P>Hsu Fang-ming, a TSMC official in charge of industrial safety, environmental
protection and public health, noted that from 2014, Walmart, the largest retail
chain store in the United States, will demand that all products on shelves carry
green labels.</P>
      <P>Officials  from the Cabinet-level  Environmental  Protection Administration
(EPA) said that from 2012, EU member countries will monitor and control carbon
dioxide emissions from all aircrafts departing from and landing in airports in
the European Union, adding that Taiwanese airline carriers should keep that in
mind and make preparations in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TSMC and several other Taiwanese companies in other industrial and
business sectors, including China Airlines, Kuo-Kuang Motor Transport and the
Taipei 101 building, have engaged in supply chain carbon inventory on an
experimental basis as part of the efforts to accelerate the reduction of carbon
dioxide emissions, according to the EPA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of low-income households in Taiwan hit a record high of 102,759
households or 249,834 people in September, which represents an increase of 13.5
percent and 14.9 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior, which released the statistics, attributed the
increases to the global financial crisis. It said the economic downturn has
driven up the unemployment rate, which then prompted the government to lower
Taiwan's threshold for poverty.</P>
      <P>By administrative districts, Taipei City led the pack with 16,047 households and
39,501 people considered low income, followed by Taipei County with 12,758
households and 31,368 people, and Kaohsiung City with 9,219 households and
21,968 people.</P>
      <P>The cities ranked in the same order during the same period last year, according
to the ministry.</P>
      <P>In terms of the percentage of people in the cities or counties considered low
income, Taitung County tops the list at 4.48 percent, followed by Penghu County
at 3.58 percent and Hualien County at 2.37 percent.</P>
      <P>On the other end of the scale, Taichung County had the lowest percentage of low
income people at 0.58 percent, followed by Tainan and Chiayi counties at 0.59
percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Social Assistance Act defines low-income households as those whose
total income divided by the number of individual members in the household is
lower than the minimum cost of living.</P>
      <P>The minimum cost of living is defined in Taiwan by the central and municipal
authorities as 60 percent of the most recent average monthly consumption
expenditure per capita, calculated by the central Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>By this criteria, Taipei had the highest minimum cost of living in 2009 at
NT$14,558 (US$451) per month. That figure indicates the 35,501 people who are
considered low income in Taipei survive on around US$15 a day.</P>
      <P>Other cities fared worst than Taipei. Kaohsiung City's poor survived on only
NT$11, 309 a month, Taipei County's on NT$10,792, and the other counties in
Taiwan on NT$9,829.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu counties have the lowest minimum cost of living at NT$7,400 a
month.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-hsia, director-general of the ministry's Department of Social Affairs,
cited the relatively higher cost of living in Taipei City as the reason for the
city having the largest population of low income people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA must be negotiated with China: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must negotiate the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China in order to avoid marginalization of local industries in the
Asia-Pacific region, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Without the agreement, many exports from Taiwan to mainland China will be
subject to an import tariff of 9 percent on average, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, after China joins the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
in 2010, most of its imports from the other member countries will be tariff-
free, he added.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, "will Taiwanese industries remain in Taiwan or will
manufacturers open more factories in Taiwan? " Wu asked.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's industries may not even have time to deliberate, he warned.</P>
      <P>The ECFA will open a new path for most of the industries in Taiwan and will
exempt them from high tariffs, he said at a breakfast meeting hosted by the
Taipei-based Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>"The government is now racing against time" because Taiwan will lose out if it
hesitates over the agreement, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Responding  to media questions  on whether he thought the government's China-
leaning policies were the major factors that contributed to the ruling party's
losses in the Dec. 5 local elections, Wu said that the facts of the government's
cross-Taiwan Strait policies were distorted in many cities and counties during
the election campaign.</P>
      <P>For example, it was rumored that once the ECFA is signed, many Taiwanese workers
will lose their jobs due to imports of cheap Chinese labor, and the market for
local agricultural products will suffer when Taiwan lifts it restrictions on
such goods from the mainland.</P>
      <P>However,  Wu noted,  it was not President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration that
gave permission for the importation of the 1,415 Chinese agricultural products
that are currently allowed.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that President Ma will not move to lift the restrictions on the
more than 800 Chinese products that are banned from entering Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government will make greater efforts to explain the proposed ECFA to the
public, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan may raise the wages of the Chinese crewmen employed on Taiwanese fishing
boats before the fourth round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks to secure China's
help in streamlining the system used to hire such workers, a fishing official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The anonymous official from the Fisheries Agency said the decision may be taken
Dec. 9 when Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation
meets Chinese officials in Fuzhou, southern China, to finalize the details of
the fourth round of talks between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The negotiations will be conducted by Taiwan's top negotiator Chiang Pin-kung
and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin in Taichung City Dec. 21-24.</P>
      <P>Fisheries Agency chief James Sha, who will take part in the preparatory meeting
along with Kao, is expected to broach the issue with Chinese officials, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan could propose to raise the monthly wage of Chinese crewmen from the
current NT$12,000 (US$372) to NT$14,000 per month but would not raise it as high
as Taiwan's minimum wage of NT$17,280, which could blunt the competitiveness of
the Chinese workers.</P>
      <P>The possible monthly salary of NT$14,000 would be higher than the NT$12,000
typically paid to Indonesian crewmen and NT$13,000 to Filipino seamen, the
official said.</P>
      <P>There are 4,669 Chinese working on Taiwan's offshore fishing boats compared to
4,485 from other foreign countries, and 12,000 to 13,000 Chinese on Taiwan's
deep sea fishing vessels, accounting for 40 percent to 45 percent of foreign
workers on those ships.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has asked for Chinese cooperation in streamlining the system used to
employ Chinese nationals on Taiwanese fishing boats, but in exchange for setting
up the system, China asked that Taiwan sweeten the wages paid to its nationals.</P>
      <P>Under the revamped system, Taiwan fishing boat owners would be able to recruit
seamen  through  Chinese  fishermen  dispatch associations set up by state-run
companies rather than through brokers, as is the case today.</P>
      <P>The associations in turn would be required to keep and provide information on
potential laborers, including their ID card numbers, photos, and proof of
seaworthiness and training, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Kao and his delegation will also work out an agreement with Chinese officials on
institutionalizing the inspection and quarantine mechanism for agricultural
products, according to a source close to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The source said Taiwan wants to set up an official channel of communication with
China on the issue through which each side may access the official
interpretations of related regulations of the other side and get official
answers to related questions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan may also ask Chinese authorities to expand their standards on pesticide
residues during the meeting.</P>
      <P>China has standards on 161 agricultural chemicals, only a quarter of the 657
chemicals for which Taiwan has set norms. Substances not covered by the
standards are banned altogether, which severely limits the exports of Taiwanese
products to China despite their high quality, the source said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Next year's municipality elections a political watershed: DPP chair</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
12/08/09  16:07:40

    <TEXT>
      <P>While the local elections last Saturday may have boosted the morale of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , the real watershed for both the
DPP and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will be the 2010 municipality elections,
said DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We can only say that this year, the DPP has managed to find a foothold, improve
its strength and morale, and rekindle the passion of its supporters," Tsai said
at a foreign press briefing.</P>
      <P>"The real political watershed for the DPP and the KMT will come next year," she
added.</P>
      <P>Tsai was referring to the elections in 2010 for the heads of five municipalities
-- Taipei City, New Taipei City (an upgrade of what is presently Taipei County)
, Taichung (a merger of Taichung City and County), Tainan (a merger of Tainan
City and County) and Kaohsiung (a merger of Kaohsiung City and County).</P>
      <P>The results of the Dec. 5 local elections in 17 of Taiwan's 25 counties and
cities were generally seen by the public and analysts as a victory for the DPP
and a setback for the KMT.</P>
      <P>Even though the KMT won 12 of the 17 mayor and magistrate seats that were up for
grabs, its support base was weakened in several localities. This time, the KMT
won 47.88 percent of the vote, less than the 50.96 percent it gained in the
previous local elections for 23 magistrates and mayors in 2005.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the DPP's victory in Yilan, its retention of three other seats,
and its inroads into the KMT's traditional strongholds of Penghu and Taitung,
were seen as an affirmation of Tsai's leadership.</P>
      <P>Tsai took over the party helm in May 2008 at a time when the DPP was in disarray
because of a series of snowballing corruption scandals surrounding former
President Chen-shui bian.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the DPP may be rising from the ashes, but it is still no match
for the KMT at the moment.</P>
      <P>However, that the results of last Saturday's elections have opened the
possibility of the DPP regaining power, a senario that had previously seemed
impossible, she added.</P>
      <P>"I believe people would now start thinking that the DPP is capable of getting
its act together and regaining the support of the Taiwan people," Tsai said.
"The DPP could return to power in 2016, if not in 2012."</P>
      <P>Tsai attributed her party's strong showing to what she called the government's
poor performance and the DPP's election strategy that she said was focused on
specific public issues.</P>
      <P>The public can tell the difference between important matters and the personal
charm of political stars, she added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether she will run for presidency in 2012, Tsai said it is too early to
talk about that, as her party will first focus on next year's municipality
elections.</P>
      <P>"Since the DPP no longer has political stars like former President Chen Shui-
bian, candidates must be chosen based on party consensus, " Tsai said. "In light
of Taiwan's fast-changing political environment, no one can give a definite
answer to questions like that now."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top trade official has challenged critics of a proposed trade pact with
China to debate the issue in a public forum.</P>
      <P>"I am willing to face anyone who is interested in or skeptical about the planned
economic cooperation framework agreement in a public debate, " Huang Chih-peng,
director general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, the leading trade negotiator with
China said Taiwan is suffering a "rain of fists" in the international arena,
which gives it no option but to seek such an agreement with China.</P>
      <P>"I am worried sick about Taiwan's future, " said Huang, who insists Taiwan will
be hurt economically when the free trade zone set up by Association of Southeast
Asian Nation (ASEAN) countries and China takes effect on Jan. 1 next year.</P>
      <P>Its situation will further deteriorate when Japan and South Korea are
incorporated into the bloc sometime before 2018, the official said.</P>
      <P>Huang said he was willing to square off with critics in a public debate a day
after Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang said his ministry was mulling the
possibility of staging televised debates on the issue.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) will organize 25 public forums to brief business and industrial
groups as well as the general public around the island on the issue before
February of next year, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The trade official acknowledged that while the agreement will benefit the
country in general, the government is concerned about the potential negative
impact the deal could have on some sectors of the economy, and he said those
consequences should be clearly explained publicly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Tsai Hsung-hsiung, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, told a business group Tuesday that formal negotiations with China
on the proposed agreement will begin early next year.</P>
      <P>The administration's plan to conclude a framework agreement with China has been
extremely controversial, with critics contending that such a deal with China
would undermine the country's sovereignty.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will use his own money to pay a NT$500,000 fine that was
imposed by the Yilan County Election Commission Tuesday for remarks he made at a
campaign rally that violated election law, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) sources said.</P>
      <P>Ma was fined after the commission accepted the findings of its examination
committee, which resolved Monday that Ma had violated the Public Officials
Election  and Recall Act by citing a media pre-election survey while addressing
a campaign rally in Yilan on Nov. 25.</P>
      <P>Acting in his capacity as KMT chairman, Ma was campaigning for incumbent county
magistrate Lu Kuo-hwa ahead of the Dec. 5 county chief election when he told the
crowd that Lu had taken the lead in a local poll.</P>
      <P>According to Article 53 of the election law,  parties or individuals are
prohibited from publishing, reporting, disseminating, citing or commenting on
any polling materials with regard to relevant candidates or the election itself
during a period of 10 days before election day.</P>
      <P>"Chairman Ma will respect the ruling to be handed down by the Yilan County
Election Commission and will pay for the fine with his own money, " said Lee
Chien-jung, director of the KMT Cultural and Communication Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Ma said that he cited the poll unwittingly during the rally
and that he felt sorry about his absent-mindedness.</P>
      <P>"I made the mistake. The buck stops here," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po said that the party should foot
the bill for the fine since Ma was speaking during a "rolling meeting of the KMT
Central Standing Committee."</P>
      <P>Chan guessed, however, that Ma would opt to pay the fine out of his own pocket
based on his past actions.</P>
      <P>While such a violation could have led to a fine of between NT$500,000 and NT$5
million, the Yilan County Election Commission's examination committee suggested
a fine of NT$500,000 Monday based on the argument that Ma was only a campaign
assistant.</P>

      <P>A greenhouse for orchid seedlings established with the assistance of a Taiwanese
technical mission was inaugurated in St. Lucia Monday.</P>
      <P>The new facility, located on a 2,500-square meter site, is the largest orchid
greenhouse in the Caribbean, said Republic of China (Taiwan) Ambassador to St.
Lucia Tom T.C. Chou.</P>
      <P>Chou presided over the inauguration ceremony along with St. Lucian officials

      <P>The greenhouse, he noted, is expected to raise hundreds of thousands of orchid
seedlings every year and help St. Lucia supply not only its domestic market but
the entire Caribbean with fresh orchids year round.</P>
      <P>Joseph highlighted the ROC embassy's constant efforts to promote cooperation
between the two countries, and said St. Lucia looks forward to becoming the
Caribbean kingdom of orchids.</P>
      <P>He  also  praised  it  for  introducing  the  concept  of tourism-oriented farms
to St. Lucia, which will both help local farmers increase their incomes and
boost tourism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan resumed its diplomatic ties in 2007 with the island-nation in the eastern
Caribbean after relations were severed 10 years earlier when St. Lucia switched
its diplomatic recognition to Beijing.</P>

      <P>The Taichung City government denied on Tuesday reports that it has advised
businesses to suspend operations during the talks between Taiwan and China that
will take place later this month in the city.</P>
      <P>According to Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi, although police are planning
to set up a restricted zone covering a 50-meter radius from the venue to
facilitate security, all businesses and schools located in the area will operate
as usual.</P>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between  the chief cross-strait negotiators --
Taipei-based  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
President Chen Yunlin -- is likely to be held at the Windsor Hotel Taichung.</P>
      <P>With pro-independence groups led by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
having announced their plans to hold protests during the event, the Chinese-
language Liberty Times reported Tuesday that in anticipation of possible
disorder and riots, the city's police have advised businesses located near the
venue to suspend operations to ensure their security.</P>
      <P>Yu Hui-mao, deputy director-general of the Taichung City Police Bureau,
clarified that police have informed local businesses of possible situations that
could occur but has not asked them to suspend operations.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Zhonggang Road, where the Windsor Hotel is located, is one of
the city's busiest roads, Yu said the police are responsible for adopting proper
measures to protect the rights of road users and local residents.</P>
      <P>It is also the police department's responsibility to provide the public with the
necessary information to help them better prepare for possible scenarios, he
said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao, meanwhile, said the city government welcomes any protests that are legal,
peaceful and non-violent.</P>
      <P>However, if there are any disruptions of public order, the city government will
take the necessary steps against lawbreakers, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Groups submit signatures for referendum on U.S. beef imports</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Civic groups submitted a total of 130,459 signatures to the Central Election
Commission (CEC) Tuesday in an effort to initiate a referendum on the
importation of U.S. beef products.</P>
      <P>To date, more than 200,000 signatures have been collected in the campaign, which
is aimed at achieving a reopening of talks between Taipei and Washington on U.S.
beef imports, according to Hsieh Tien-jen, chairman of the Consumers' Foundation
that is leading the drive.</P>
      <P>The 130,459 signatures that have been submitted to the CEC by far exceed the
requirement of the first threshold for a referendum initiative, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The first step in the process requires at least 86,000 signatures -- 0.5 percent
of the country's 17.32 million registered voters in the last presidential
election.</P>
      <P>"The remaining 70,000 signatures will be kept for the second stage," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's referendum law, once a screening committee finds that the
proposed referendum conforms to the legal guidelines, the next step for the
referendum's sponsors would be to obtain the endorsement of at least 5 percent
of the electorate -- in this case 860,000 signatures.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh denied that his foundation and other civic groups are being
used by the opposition parties to pressure the government on the beef issue.</P>
      <P>"There was no political maneuvering  behind the referendum initiative, " he
stressed, pointing out that many of the signatures are from cities and counties
held by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Chiayi's KMT Mayor Huang Hui-min mailed over 1,000
signatures to the foundation, he said.</P>
      <P>CEC Secretary-General Teng Tien-you said the commission will determine by Dec.
11 whether the referendum initiative meets the terms of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The commission will then submit the proposal to the Executive Yuan Referendum
Screening Committee for confirmation, Teng added.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington signed a protocol Oct. 22 under which Taiwan agreed to
lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and certain other beef products, including
ground beef and beef offal.</P>
      <P>However, civic groups led by the Consumers' Foundation and politicians, have
contended that the importation of high-risk beef products  could  put consumers
at risk of bovine  spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>With their appeals for re-opening Taiwan-U.S. beef talks having been rejected by
the administration, the groups have decided to push for a referendum.</P>
      <P>In related news, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng lashed out at the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators Tuesday over their
continued boycott of legislative sessions to screen amendments to the laws
governing Taiwan's beef imports.</P>
      <P>"It's highly inappropriate to stall the legislative process with boycotts that
started before the Dec. 5 local elections," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang called on the opposition lawmakers "not to overdo it" and instead to help
restore order in the legislature.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen expressed
reservations Tuesday on the possibility of meeting China's top negotiator during
his visit to Taiwan later this month but said the DPP has long hoped to open
communications with Chinese civic groups.</P>
      <P>"Whether or not to meet with Chen Yunlin should depend on whether there is
meaning in such a meeting, " Tsai said at a press briefing with members of
foreign media in Taiwan, referring to the president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"The cross-Taiwan Strait meetings have become a formality rather than focusing
on substantive issues. It would take further discussion whether the DPP wants to
have such contact with China," she added.</P>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between Chen and Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), are scheduled to take place in
central Taiwan's Taichung City in late December.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are expected to ink four agreements on fishing crew cooperation,
agricultural quarantine inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and
certification, and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>They will also exchange initial views on the proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are Taiwan and China's respective intermediary bodies
responsible for two-way exchanges in the absence of official ties between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Despite her reservations over meeting with Chen, Tsai said the DPP is more than
willing to open dialogue with the people and civic groups in China.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has no objection to or hostility toward China. We would like to treat
them as we treat others. The exchanges are more difficult given the fact that
China has ambitions on Taiwan, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the DPP will stage a large scale protest against Chen's visit like
last year, Tsai said there will be one big gathering to voice disagreement  with
President Ma Ying-jeou's cross-strait policies, which she described as "no
transparency, no communication and no proper adjustment plan."</P>
      <P>She said, however, that after gaining confidence and a morale boost from last
Saturday's local elections,  the DPP and its supporters would have "more room
for rationality, so we will have a different attitude toward the Chen-Chiang
meeting this year than last year."</P>
      <P>She said a more detailed plan on the protest would be announced at Wednesday's
party committee meeting.</P>
      <P>During Chen's first visit to Taipei last November, he was stranded in a hotel
for several hours after attending a dinner hosted in his honor by Taiwan's
ruling Kuomintang, because pro-independence and anti-China protesters blocked
the hotel's exits.</P>
      <P>A total of 149 police officers were injured by protesters while trying to ensure
the safety of Chen and his entourage.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) chairman and CEO Morris Chang
said Tuesday that while the global economy is recovering, Taiwanese companies
still face the challenges of a stronger Taiwan dollar, higher raw material
prices and stricter control of carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the founder of the world's largest contract chipmaker, the
outlook for the semiconductor industry in 2010 is relatively good, but new
challenges also loom as Taiwan's and the global economy slowly rebound.</P>
      <P>With the U.S. dollar seemingly set to weaken over the long term, Taiwan's
currency is likely to appreciate,  a situation Chang described as "worrying"
while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a breakfast meeting held by the
Taipei-based Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce (CNAIC).</P>
      <P>Chang said the second challenge will come from raw material prices, and
especially oil prices, which are expected to move up slowly again.</P>
      <P>The third challenge will be dealing with stricter rules to control carbon
emissions after the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen,
a situation Chang said would inevitably increase corporate costs.</P>
      <P>Chang said the first two challenges -- an appreciating currency and higher
commodity prices -- would be medium-term problems while dealing with carbon
emissions and developing alternative energy sources would be a medium- to long-
term problem.</P>
      <P>"People who give no thought to far-flung problems soon find suffering nearby, "
said Chang quoting Confucius to explain that his company has also been thinking
seriously about these problems.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar has appreciated against the U.S. dollar this year, rising
NT$2.9 from its 22-year low of NT$35.174 against the greenback on March 2 to
NT$32.280 on Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of the world's most export-dependent economies, and the rising
Taiwan dollar has hurt the country's exports and squeezed the profitability of
export-oriented companies.</P>

      <P>Wu Nai-jen, secretary-general of the opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party
(DPP)  tendered  his resignation Tuesday, just days after the DPP exceeded
expectations in last Saturday's local elections.</P>
      <P>Wu, who returned to the post eight months ago when Tsai asked him to help with
the campaign for the Dec. 5 local elections, said that he was both physically
and mentally exhausted after the election battle.</P>
      <P>"I agreed to come back from retirement and work for the DPP for the last time
because I couldn't bear to see the situation the DPP was in at that time," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the DPP needs to give the younger generation a chance to
perform, and he has confidence in them judging from how well young candidates
did in last Saturday's local elections in which the DPP retained three county
magistrate seats and took Yilan County back from the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>At a breakfast meeting held by DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen Tuesday morning to

      <P>Tsai told the Central News Agency that Wu's resignation has sent her into deep

      <P>Some 200 students from Taipei Medical University (TMU) held a march Tuesday in
downtown Taipei, calling for the public's attention to AIDS-related human rights
issues.</P>
      <P>The students, including some from the United States, Haiti, Finland, Japan and
Kenya, chanted slogans as they marched from their university, past the Taipei
101 Tower and back to their campus.</P>
      <P>The march was held in recognition of Dec. 10 International Human Rights Day and
Dec. 1 World AIDS Day.</P>
      <P>Lin I-lun, head of TMU's foreign student association, said the major purpose of
the activity was to heighten public awareness of AIDS prevention and help
promote the concept of a global village and a non-discriminatory co-existence of
all peoples.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-shou, director of the TMU's foreign affairs department, said the
university is keen to see students develop an interest in international affairs

      <P>The TMU, as part of its efforts to help deal with the spread of AIDS in Africa,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:
UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>President Ma should ask himself why he lost one million votes</P>
      <P>The Ma administration fared poorly in Saturday's local elections. In comparison
to the 2008 presidential election, the KMT obtained one million fewer votes in
the 17 cities and counties where the polls were held on December 5.</P>
      <P>After that setback, Ma said he would review his policies, a statement that has
been interpreted  by some as signaling an "adjustment" of his cross-strait
policy. But if he does that, he would be making a big mistake.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has painted the election outcome as
a "vote of no-confidence" against the Ma administration. But the polls were
local elections that were held mainly in agricultural areas and offshore
counties. Although the 17 cities and counties are spread over 70 percent of the
country, their total population accounts for only 40 percent of the national
figure.</P>
      <P>We think Ma's slipping popularity is due mainly to a lasse faire attitude within
the administration, which has allowed public doubts to fester over his ability
to govern. This situation arose from a spate of incidents, which included
controversies in the military and security agencies, and a proliferation of
rumors.</P>
      <P>The improvement in cross-strait relations should be to Ma's credit, but his
officials lack the communications skills, the will and the guts to defend his
policies, therefore, the administration's image is one of poor performance,
especially after the DPP's repeated criticisms and smears. CHINA TIMES: KMT can
only regain people's hearts by addressing setback squarely</P>
      <P>The just-concluded elections sent a warning to the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and
helped the floundering Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) back to its feet.</P>
      <P>President Ma said that both he and the KMT need to conduct a review, but the
question is to review what. If they are willing to admit that they did poorly,
they should also find out "what went wrong."</P>
      <P>In fact, since the free fall of Ma's immense popularity in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot in August, his decision-making style has been called into serious
question.</P>
      <P>The government has seemed to have its hands tied on some policies that it should
have promoted actively because of fears of public opposition. On other
controversial issues, such as the easing of U.S. beef imports, it made the
decision behind closed doors.</P>
      <P>It is not unexpected that Ma would plunge himself in such a miserable plight.
The criticism of Ma as being "arrogant" has been demonstrated by this decision-
making style.</P>
      <P>The voters have sent a warning signal to the Ma administration, but they have
left some leeway to make adjustments and revisions. President should seize the
opportunity to learn his lesson. ECONOMIC DAILY NEWS: The KMT loses all because
of Ma Ying-jeou</P>
      <P>Although the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) managed to keep 12 out of 17 seats up for
grabs in Saturday's mayoral and magistrate election, the number of votes it
received fell dramatically compared to the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In a lot of cities and counties, the KMT candidates even faced serious
challenges from their lesser-known and hastily nominated rivals from the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The DPP candidates therefore targeted their attacks at President Ma and his
major policy initiatives. President Ma also embarked on a hectic campaign for
KMT candidates.</P>
      <P>After the election results were in, all fingers, irrespective of their party
affiliation, have pointed at Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma cited the global financial crisis and high unemployment as factors not
favorable to the KMT, but his biggest shortcoming identified by critics has been
his failure to concede defeat and to shoulder its responsibility.</P>
      <P>We believe that Ma should not shirk his responsibility: the flawed nomination
mechanism and the poorly organized campaigning all contributed to the lackluster
showing.</P>
      <P>We think an economic downturn provides an able leader an opportunity to govern
the country. But for more than one year, Ma has failed to come up with
substantive measures to stimulate the economy.</P>
      <P>Lastly, although Ma is known for his integrity, he has not been known for good
governance and use of able men.</P>
      <P>The most gratifying news after the elections is that he has finally decided to
curtail his hectic itinerary for the time being to reflect quietly on his next
step. LIBERTY TIMES: Does Ma want people to suffer as a result of his misguided
policies?</P>
      <P>Taiwan voters taught President Ma Ying-jeou a lesson in the Dec. 5 local
elections.</P>
      <P>Most people in Taiwan and international media agreed that Ma has encountered the
most serious setback in his political career.</P>
      <P>We believe his policy direction and governing ability have been disapproved by
the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>But Ma has deliberately tried to ignore that message and has tried to blame his
party's less-than-ideal showing in the elections on the global economic
downturn. We are worried that he would continue on his present course and lead
Taiwan to destruction in the remaining two years of his term.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that the failure of the Ma administration is due to two major
reasons: the record high unemployment rate that resulted from the economic
downturn and his China-leaning policies.</P>
      <P>Based on his remarks after the elections, it is obvious that Ma is not going to
change his China-leaning course. However, we think that he should abandon that
direction in order to avoid being dealt a more serious blow in future elections.
APPLE DAILY: Stumping vs. anti-stumping</P>
      <P>Miaoli Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung and Legislator Chiu Yi of the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) blasted central government officials Monday for failing to stump for KMT
candidates in the just-concluded local elections.</P>
      <P>They asked rhetorically whether the officials would have had the chance to serve
in the central government if they had not campaigned hard in the 2008
legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>But Premier Wu Den-yih and Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah responded by saying
that officials should maintain administrative neutrality and stick to carrying
out their own duties, which they said are the best way to stump for KMT
candidates.</P>
      <P>Both Wu and Jiang have a point. The duty of the Interior Ministry and the
Justice Ministry is to crack down on vote-buying and maintain order during
elections. If the ministers go on stage to canvass support from voters, they
will give the impression of being both players and umpires.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the officials have no election experience and in the fever-pitch of
campaign rallies, are apt to make gaffes that could invite invective instead of
support. They are therefore better off not appearing on any campaign tours.</P>

      <P>The production  value of Taiwan's semiconductor sector is expected to post a
17.8 percent growth in 2010 as the sector continues to recover from the global
recession, the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) forecast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With the sector having begun to see a recovery in the second quarter of 2009,
the contraction in output has been narrowing and is projected to stand at 8.1
percent for the whole year, according to Tan Yu-hua, a research manager at the
ITRI's Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center (IEK).</P>
      <P>The figure is lower than the projected decline of 11.5 percent in the global
market, Tan said in a seminar on the prospects for the high tech sector in 2010
that was held by the ITRI and the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The sector's global value is expected to increase 12.2 percent next year,
bringing it back to the level of 2008, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuan-hua, an industry analyst at IEK, predicted that the production value of
Taiwan's IC design industry, which is projected to increase 3.1 percent in 2009,
will further expand by 16.4 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the global status of the country's IC design industry has been
rising in recent years, with Taiwanese firms accounting for 18.4 percent of the
world's 20 largest IC designers in 2008, up from 14.1 percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>The rise of the low-price market, the demand for green energy and new
applications within the medical care sector will pose both challenges and
opportunities for Taiwan's IC design industry, he went on.</P>
      <P>To expand the market for its IC products, Taiwan should seek to cooperate with
China in adopting a set of shared standards for mobile telecommunications,
digital radio, wireless networking, automobile electronics and medical
electronics, Lee said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will hold 17 seminars around Taiwan Dec. 10-23
to explain the government's plan to recognize Chinese universities and open
local tertiary education institutes to Chinese college students amid concern in
some quarters that doing so could jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty and job
market.</P>
      <P>Liao Kao-shien,  director  of the MOE's  Higher  Education Department, said the
ministry decided to explain the two issues to the public face to face in the
seminars, with the first one to kick off in Kaohsiung City and the last one to
be held in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>According to Liao,  the ministry is planning to gradually recognize diplomas
issued by over 100 elite Chinese universities in three stages -- 41 top Chinese
universities in the first stage, 55 in the second stage and an as-yet undecided
number in the third stage. Police and military higher education institutes will
be excluded.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the MOE is projecting to make the policy retroactive to
1997, but will continue to heed public opinions in this regard, as there are
strong local fears that the measure might affect the local job market.</P>
      <P>The MOE has initially decided that Chinese graduates must leave Taiwan within a
month of completing their studies and will not be permitted to find work in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In terms of the maximum number of Chinese students allowed to pursue higher and
advanced studies in Taiwan, the MOE said that the number will be around 1
percent of the total number of every year's freshman intake -- about 2,000 per
year. Each university will be authorized to have a maximum 2 percent of Chinese
students enrolled at any one time.</P>
      <P>The MOE plans to allow Chinese graduate students to pursue master's courses at
public universities, while private universities will be permitted to enroll
undergraduates.</P>
      <P>Because of the ferry services established between the Taiwanese islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and two ports in China's Fujian Province, the quota of Chinese
students opting to study at colleges or universities on the two outlying islands
might be larger, depending on the applications from each school, Liao said.</P>
      <P>In principle, Chinese college or graduate students will be permitted to stay in
Taiwan proper for up to two years, with exceptions to be studied on a case-by-
case basis, he added.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, Chinese students will not be entitled to work, while their
visas will be issued in accordance with the rules governing foreign or overseas
Chinese students.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will open its market further to Chinese capital, following three
principles, namely going "from restricted to loosened, step by step, and
expanding after certain results have been achieved",  Chen Jui-lung,  chairman
of the Taipei-based Sinocon Industrial Standards Foundation and a former
economics minister, said in Beijing Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the opening of a forum on cross-strait cooperation that
was jointly sponsored by the foundation and the Beijing- based Association of
Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Chen told the attendees that Taiwan manufacturers played an important role in
the supply of key components to China's electrical appliance industry during
China's implementation of a nationwide household appliance renovation project
earlier this year. The measure was introduced during the world financial crisis
with the aim of boosting  China's  economy  through the expansion  of domestic
consumption.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the financial sectors on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
are expected to enter a new stage of cooperation with the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between their monetary supervisory agencies.</P>
      <P>With the inking of the proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA), Taiwan's monetary sector would be able to access the mainland
Chinese market, and industries on both sides would benefit from cross-strait
monetary cooperation, he added.</P>
      <P>As to the entry of Chinese capital into the Taiwan market, Chen said that Taiwan
plans to open its market to Chinese capital under the guidelines of going "from
restricted to loosened, step by step, and expanding after certain results have
been achieved".</P>
      <P>As of the end of October, Taiwan had opened 64 categories of manufacturing
industries, 117 categories of service industries, and 11 categories of public
construction projects to Chinese investment. Meanwhile, 15 Chinese investment
applications had been approved by Taiwan authorities up to that time.</P>
      <P>Chen said that investors in Taiwan can enjoy the advantages of expertise in
innovation and global marketing.  In the future, businesses on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait would be able to advance their cooperation in areas such as
research and development, building brand names, reciprocal investments and
shared marketing channels, according to Chen.</P>

      <P>Local businesses and workers are split on the possible impact of the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) on Taiwan's economy, with
workers tending to be more pessimistic than businesses, according to the results
of two surveys released Tuesday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>The surveys by 104 Job Bank found that 38.2 percent of the business owners that
responded think the agreement will bring "more opportunities than threats, "
while 34.5 percent believe there will be "more threats than opportunities."</P>
      <P>Among the workers surveyed, however, 44.4 percent said the pact will bring "more
threats than opportunities, " compared with 29.9 percent who think the opposite.</P>
      <P>Approximately 30 percent of the business owners believe the signing of the ECFA
will stimulate young people in Taiwan and China into enhancing  their
competitiveness,  boost Taiwan's economic development, attract foreign
investment and strengthen cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 85 percent of them said they are confident in their ability
to face the challenges.</P>
      <P>Although 56.6 percent of the workers surveyed said the ECFA can help promote
Taiwan's economic development, 62.7 percent expressed concern that the agreement
will lead to the dumping of cheap Chinese products in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another 58.7 percent said there could be a decrease in jobs and approximately 40
percent expressed fear of transfer of local capital and technologies to China
and of a larger exodus of Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,988 workers was conducted Nov. 10-15, with a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The survey of 629 businesses was carried out Nov. 10-16 and had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.91 percentage points.</P>

      <P>The date of the official launch of amphibious vehicle tours in the southern city
of Kaohsiung has been put back to March 2, 2010, a city official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The postponement has been made to allow more time for test runs of the vehicle
to ensure passenger safety, according to Wang Kwo-tsai, director-general of the
city's Transportation Bureau.</P>
      <P>The city government had originally planned to begin test runs in early December
and to officially launch the service in January.</P>
      <P>Under a new plan worked out by the city government, the first phase of the test
runs will begin Dec. 20 and continue through Jan. 21, during which water tours
will be provided to social welfare and tour groups interested in trying the
service, Wang said.</P>
      <P>In the second phase, which will run from Jan. 22 to Feb. 28, free tickets will
be offered to tourists staying in Kaohsiung hotels, he went on.</P>
      <P>The tours will start and finish at the Hanshin Arena shopping mall so that
passengers can also go shopping, he added.</P>
      <P>The 60-minute tours will allow passengers to sightsee on land and water,
including a cruise on scenic Lotus Lake and a ride around the surrounding area.
There will be six tours per day for a maximum of 30 passengers per tour.</P>
      <P>Ticket prices will be NT$300 for adults and NT$150 for children.</P>

      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) has set up a special "civic forum" corner on
its official Web site www.npa.gov.tw, on which members of the public are
encouraged to leave comments about the police and their work, a spokesman for

      <P>A recent survey conducted by the Ministry of the Interior indicates that among
the 10 biggest complaints of the general public, several are related to public
safety and police work, rampant telephone and Internet scams, the high number of
traffic tickets issued and illegal occupation of public pathways.</P>
      <P>The NPA is also hopeful that the public will also post stories about good deeds
done by policemen in addition to using the site as a space to voice their
complaints, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also reminded the public that the forum is different from the 110
police service phone number and that reports of suspected criminal activities
should be made by calling 110 rather than by posting on the Web site.</P>

      <P>Taiwan took three silver medals in taekwondo at the 2009 East Asian Games in
Hong Kong Tuesday, the final day of the taekwondo events.</P>
      <P>Chuan Chia-chia, in the women's 72 kg category, won silver after being edged out
by her South Korean rival for the gold in a close fight that ended 4-5, while
Sun Ai-chi, in the women's over 72 kg category, also took silver in a 4-5 defeat
to her South Korean challenger.</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-chieh won silver the men's over 84 kg category after being defeated 5-6
by a South Korean opponent.</P>
      <P>The three silvers added to the medal tally of the Chinese Taipei team brought
the total to two gold medals, nine silvers and five bronzes in taekwondo as of

single gold medal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan won its first gold of the Sunday when taekwondo athlete Hsu Chia-lin,

      <P>Ma himself chaired Tuesday's meeting, during which party members reviewed  the

      <P>Some 200 students from Taipei Medical University (TMU) held a march Tuesday in
downtown Taipei, calling for the public's attention to AIDS-related human rights
issues.</P>
      <P>The students, including some from the United States, Haiti, Finland, Japan and
Kenya, chanted slogans as they marched from their university, past the Taipei
101 Tower and back to their campus.</P>
      <P>The march was held in recognition of Dec. 10 International Human Rights Day and
Dec. 1 World AIDS Day.</P>
      <P>Lin I-lun, head of TMU's foreign student association, said the major purpose of
the activity was to heighten public awareness of AIDS prevention and help
promote the concept of a global village and a non-discriminatory co-existence of
all peoples.</P>

12/08/09  20:02:33</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Tuesday:
UNITED DAILY NEWS:</P>
      <P>President Ma should ask himself why he lost one million votes</P>
      <P>The Ma administration fared poorly in Saturday's local elections. In comparison
to the 2008 presidential election, the KMT obtained one million fewer votes in
the 17 cities and counties where the polls were held on December 5.</P>
      <P>After that setback, Ma said he would review his policies, a statement that has
been interpreted  by some as signaling an "adjustment" of his cross-strait
policy. But if he does that, he would be making a big mistake.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has painted the election outcome as
a "vote of no-confidence" against the Ma administration. But the polls were
local elections that were held mainly in agricultural areas and offshore
counties. Although the 17 cities and counties are spread over 70 percent of the
country, their total population accounts for only 40 percent of the national
figure.</P>
      <P>We think Ma's slipping popularity is due mainly to a lasse faire attitude within
the administration, which has allowed public doubts to fester over his ability
to govern. This situation arose from a spate of incidents, which included
controversies in the military and security agencies, and a proliferation of
rumors.</P>
      <P>The improvement in cross-strait relations should be to Ma's credit, but his
officials lack the communications skills, the will and the guts to defend his
policies, therefore, the administration's image is one of poor performance,
especially after the DPP's repeated criticisms and smears. CHINA TIMES: KMT can
only regain people's hearts by addressing setback squarely</P>
      <P>The just-concluded elections sent a warning to the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and
helped the floundering Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) back to its feet.</P>
      <P>President Ma said that both he and the KMT need to conduct a review, but the
question is to review what. If they are willing to admit that they did poorly,
they should also find out "what went wrong."</P>
      <P>In fact, since the free fall of Ma's immense popularity in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot in August, his decision-making style has been called into serious
question.</P>
      <P>The government has seemed to have its hands tied on some policies that it should
have promoted actively because of fears of public opposition. On other
controversial issues, such as the easing of U.S. beef imports, it made the
decision behind closed doors.</P>
      <P>It is not unexpected that Ma would plunge himself in such a miserable plight.
The criticism of Ma as being "arrogant" has been demonstrated by this decision-
making style.</P>
      <P>The voters have sent a warning signal to the Ma administration, but they have
left some leeway to make adjustments and revisions. President should seize the
opportunity to learn his lesson. ECONOMIC DAILY NEWS: The KMT loses all because
of Ma Ying-jeou</P>
      <P>Although the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) managed to keep 12 out of 17 seats up for
grabs in Saturday's mayoral and magistrate election, the number of votes it
received fell dramatically compared to the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In a lot of cities and counties, the KMT candidates even faced serious
challenges from their lesser-known and hastily nominated rivals from the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The DPP candidates therefore targeted their attacks at President Ma and his
major policy initiatives. President Ma also embarked on a hectic campaign for
KMT candidates.</P>
      <P>After the election results were in, all fingers, irrespective of their party
affiliation, have pointed at Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma cited the global financial crisis and high unemployment as factors not
favorable to the KMT, but his biggest shortcoming identified by critics has been
his failure to concede defeat and to shoulder its responsibility.</P>
      <P>We believe that Ma should not shirk his responsibility: the flawed nomination
mechanism and the poorly organized campaigning all contributed to the lackluster
showing.</P>
      <P>We think an economic downturn provides an able leader an opportunity to govern
the country. But for more than one year, Ma has failed to come up with
substantive measures to stimulate the economy.</P>
      <P>Lastly, although Ma is known for his integrity, he has not been known for good
governance and use of able men.</P>
      <P>The most gratifying news after the elections is that he has finally decided to
curtail his hectic itinerary for the time being to reflect quietly on his next
step. LIBERTY TIMES: Does Ma want people to suffer as a result of his misguided
policies?</P>
      <P>Taiwan voters taught President Ma Ying-jeou a lesson in the Dec. 5 local
elections.</P>
      <P>Most people in Taiwan and international media agreed that Ma has encountered the
most serious setback in his political career.</P>
      <P>We believe his policy direction and governing ability have been disapproved by
the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>But Ma has deliberately tried to ignore that message and has tried to blame his
party's less-than-ideal showing in the elections on the global economic
downturn. We are worried that he would continue on his present course and lead
Taiwan to destruction in the remaining two years of his term.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that the failure of the Ma administration is due to two major
reasons: the record high unemployment rate that resulted from the economic
downturn and his China-leaning policies.</P>
      <P>Based on his remarks after the elections, it is obvious that Ma is not going to
change his China-leaning course. However, we think that he should abandon that
direction in order to avoid being dealt a more serious blow in future elections.
APPLE DAILY: Stumping vs. anti-stumping</P>
      <P>Miaoli Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung and Legislator Chiu Yi of the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) blasted central government officials Monday for failing to stump for KMT
candidates in the just-concluded local elections.</P>
      <P>They asked rhetorically whether the officials would have had the chance to serve
in the central government if they had not campaigned hard in the 2008
legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>But Premier Wu Den-yih and Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah responded by saying
that officials should maintain administrative neutrality and stick to carrying
out their own duties, which they said are the best way to stump for KMT
candidates.</P>
      <P>Both Wu and Jiang have a point. The duty of the Interior Ministry and the
Justice Ministry is to crack down on vote-buying and maintain order during
elections. If the ministers go on stage to canvass support from voters, they
will give the impression of being both players and umpires.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the officials have no election experience and in the fever-pitch of
campaign rallies, are apt to make gaffes that could invite invective instead of
support. They are therefore better off not appearing on any campaign tours.</P>

      <P>The production  value of Taiwan's semiconductor sector is expected to post a
17.8 percent growth in 2010 as the sector continues to recover from the global
recession, the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) forecast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With the sector having begun to see a recovery in the second quarter of 2009,
the contraction in output has been narrowing and is projected to stand at 8.1
percent for the whole year, according to Tan Yu-hua, a research manager at the
ITRI's Industrial Economics and Knowledge Center (IEK).</P>
      <P>The figure is lower than the projected decline of 11.5 percent in the global
market, Tan said in a seminar on the prospects for the high tech sector in 2010
that was held by the ITRI and the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The sector's global value is expected to increase 12.2 percent next year,
bringing it back to the level of 2008, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuan-hua, an industry analyst at IEK, predicted that the production value of
Taiwan's IC design industry, which is projected to increase 3.1 percent in 2009,
will further expand by 16.4 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the global status of the country's IC design industry has been
rising in recent years, with Taiwanese firms accounting for 18.4 percent of the
world's 20 largest IC designers in 2008, up from 14.1 percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>The rise of the low-price market, the demand for green energy and new
applications within the medical care sector will pose both challenges and
opportunities for Taiwan's IC design industry, he went on.</P>
      <P>To expand the market for its IC products, Taiwan should seek to cooperate with
China in adopting a set of shared standards for mobile telecommunications,
digital radio, wireless networking, automobile electronics and medical
electronics, Lee said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will hold 17 seminars around Taiwan Dec. 10-23
to explain the government's plan to recognize Chinese universities and open
local tertiary education institutes to Chinese college students amid concern in
some quarters that doing so could jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty and job
market.</P>
      <P>Liao Kao-shien,  director  of the MOE's  Higher  Education Department, said the
ministry decided to explain the two issues to the public face to face in the
seminars, with the first one to kick off in Kaohsiung City and the last one to
be held in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>According to Liao,  the ministry is planning to gradually recognize diplomas
issued by over 100 elite Chinese universities in three stages -- 41 top Chinese
universities in the first stage, 55 in the second stage and an as-yet undecided
number in the third stage. Police and military higher education institutes will
be excluded.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the MOE is projecting to make the policy retroactive to
1997, but will continue to heed public opinions in this regard, as there are
strong local fears that the measure might affect the local job market.</P>
      <P>The MOE has initially decided that Chinese graduates must leave Taiwan within a
month of completing their studies and will not be permitted to find work in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In terms of the maximum number of Chinese students allowed to pursue higher and
advanced studies in Taiwan, the MOE said that the number will be around 1
percent of the total number of every year's freshman intake -- about 2,000 per
year. Each university will be authorized to have a maximum 2 percent of Chinese
students enrolled at any one time.</P>
      <P>The MOE plans to allow Chinese graduate students to pursue master's courses at
public universities, while private universities will be permitted to enroll
undergraduates.</P>
      <P>Because of the ferry services established between the Taiwanese islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and two ports in China's Fujian Province, the quota of Chinese
students opting to study at colleges or universities on the two outlying islands
might be larger, depending on the applications from each school, Liao said.</P>
      <P>In principle, Chinese college or graduate students will be permitted to stay in
Taiwan proper for up to two years, with exceptions to be studied on a case-by-
case basis, he added.</P>
      <P>While in Taiwan, Chinese students will not be entitled to work, while their
visas will be issued in accordance with the rules governing foreign or overseas
Chinese students.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will open its market further to Chinese capital, following three
principles, namely going "from restricted to loosened, step by step, and
expanding after certain results have been achieved",  Chen Jui-lung,  chairman
of the Taipei-based Sinocon Industrial Standards Foundation and a former
economics minister, said in Beijing Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the opening of a forum on cross-strait cooperation that
was jointly sponsored by the foundation and the Beijing- based Association of
Economy and Trade Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Chen told the attendees that Taiwan manufacturers played an important role in
the supply of key components to China's electrical appliance industry during
China's implementation of a nationwide household appliance renovation project
earlier this year. The measure was introduced during the world financial crisis
with the aim of boosting  China's  economy  through the expansion  of domestic
consumption.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the financial sectors on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
are expected to enter a new stage of cooperation with the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between their monetary supervisory agencies.</P>
      <P>With the inking of the proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA), Taiwan's monetary sector would be able to access the mainland
Chinese market, and industries on both sides would benefit from cross-strait
monetary cooperation, he added.</P>
      <P>As to the entry of Chinese capital into the Taiwan market, Chen said that Taiwan
plans to open its market to Chinese capital under the guidelines of going "from
restricted to loosened, step by step, and expanding after certain results have
been achieved".</P>
      <P>As of the end of October, Taiwan had opened 64 categories of manufacturing
industries, 117 categories of service industries, and 11 categories of public
construction projects to Chinese investment. Meanwhile, 15 Chinese investment
applications had been approved by Taiwan authorities up to that time.</P>
      <P>Chen said that investors in Taiwan can enjoy the advantages of expertise in
innovation and global marketing.  In the future, businesses on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait would be able to advance their cooperation in areas such as
research and development, building brand names, reciprocal investments and
shared marketing channels, according to Chen.</P>

      <P>Local businesses and workers are split on the possible impact of the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) on Taiwan's economy, with
workers tending to be more pessimistic than businesses, according to the results
of two surveys released Tuesday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>The surveys by 104 Job Bank found that 38.2 percent of the business owners that
responded think the agreement will bring "more opportunities than threats, "
while 34.5 percent believe there will be "more threats than opportunities."</P>
      <P>Among the workers surveyed, however, 44.4 percent said the pact will bring "more
threats than opportunities, " compared with 29.9 percent who think the opposite.</P>
      <P>Approximately 30 percent of the business owners believe the signing of the ECFA
will stimulate young people in Taiwan and China into enhancing  their
competitiveness,  boost Taiwan's economic development, attract foreign
investment and strengthen cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 85 percent of them said they are confident in their ability
to face the challenges.</P>
      <P>Although 56.6 percent of the workers surveyed said the ECFA can help promote
Taiwan's economic development, 62.7 percent expressed concern that the agreement
will lead to the dumping of cheap Chinese products in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another 58.7 percent said there could be a decrease in jobs and approximately 40
percent expressed fear of transfer of local capital and technologies to China
and of a larger exodus of Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,988 workers was conducted Nov. 10-15, with a margin of error of
plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The survey of 629 businesses was carried out Nov. 10-16 and had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.91 percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's reaction to the new U.S. policy on regulating greenhouse gas emissions
is generally positive. While Taiwan is likely to follow suit in controlling
sources of air pollution, it may also exercise caution in order to mitigate
impact to the industry.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports about this issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>With the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifying six greenhouse gases
-- carbon dioxide along with methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons,
perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexaflouride -- as public health threats under the
U.S. Clean Air Act., a Taiwan official said the government is very likely to
follow suit, taking measures to restrict emissions of the six air pollution
sources.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Yen-ju, director-general of the Environmental Protection Administration's
(EPA) Department of Air Quality Protection and Noise Control, said Tuesday that
the government's first move would likely include the six greenhouse gases in the
regulations on air pollution control concerning pollutant gas emissions by motor
vehicles. (Dec. 9, 2009)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Director General Tu Tzi-chun of the Industrial Development Bureau said Tuesday
that there is no need for Taiwan to be the world's "role model" in the reduction
of greenhouse gas emissions, or the world's guinea pig.</P>
      <P>Although the agencies in charge of industrial development affairs support  the

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day -- News digest of local media: beef controversy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/09/09  11:19:52
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversy surrounding Taiwan's relaxation on U.S. beef imports has again
come to the fore following the end of last Saturday's local elections, with
civic groups submitting signatures to the Central Election Commission calling
for a national referendum on whether to re-negotiate U.S. beef trade terms.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest development
of the controversy:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The usually good-natured Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng became angry Tuesday
after the legislature was paralyzed again due to a boycott by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over U.S. beef disputes.</P>
      <P>Wang said in a tough tone that the DPP's besieging of the speaker's podium "is
very, very inappropriate" and that it "should stop where it should."</P>
      <P>"The DPP seems to want to do what it likes to do, which is utterly senseless,"
he said. (Dec. 9, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily:</P>
      <P>Civic groups submitted signatures  to the Central Election Commission Tuesday in
its effort to initiate a national referendum on restarting beef talks with the
United States.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the move of the civic groups, the Department of Health Minister
Yaung Chih-liang said he will respect the people exercising their civic rights
and if the referendum passes, the department will act according to the law.
(Dec. 9, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>If the outcome of Saturday's local elections is the first no-confidence vote on
the Ma administration, then the signatures sent to the Central Election
Commission to initiate a national referendum on opposing U.S. beef imports is
obviously the second no-confidence vote on the Ma administration.</P>
      <P>The Dec. 5 elections were a rivalry between the ruling and the opposition
parties. But the call for a restart of talks with the U.S. will be a big policy
debate that transcends party rivalry and is a more significant event. (Dec. 9,

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese volunteer finds fulfillment in helping Karen refugees</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/09/09  12:19:15
(with reporting by S. C. Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The quietly flowing Moei River, which forms part of the border between Thailand
and Myanmar, can be seen as a metaphor for the silent anguish of the Karen
refugees in Thailand who fled human rights abuses, violence and desperate
economic conditions in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>For more than 60 years, Myanmar's largest ethnic group, the Karen, has been
seeking greater autonomy in their homeland, which is also known as Burma -- a
quest that has fueled one of the longest running internal conflicts in the
world.</P>
      <P>Karen refugees began crossing into Thailand in 1984 and the Thai military
started setting up refugee camps along the border about 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>In most of their accounts to the United Nations, the refugees speak of direct
attacks  by the Myanmar army,  forced labor, enslavement, and destruction of
their homes and crops.</P>
      <P>There are now around 140,000 Myanmar refugees in Thailand, living in nine fenced
camps along the border between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The largest camp is Mae La, which sits on a hill about 60 kilometers north of
the border town of Mae Sot.</P>
      <P>Sam Lai, 36, often sits on this hill pondering the future of the camp's 43,000
refugees, especially the children.</P>
      <P>Lai is a volunteer with the non-governmental Taipei Overseas Peace Service
(TOPS) , and the only one from the organization who is stationed in Mae Sot,
where he has worked for seven years in collaboration with local and
international organizations.</P>
      <P>"It is deplorable that the Karen refugees are now stateless, have lost their
freedom and have no legal identity or protection within Thailand," Lai said.
"It is hard for people outside to imagine what life is like within the highly
restricted refugee camps."</P>
      <P>Since 1996,  TOPS has been administering  humanitarian and educational programs
at Karen refugee camps and in Myanmar migrant communities in remote Thai
villages.</P>
      <P>"What we do is to help the refugees improve their lives, and in particular, we
seek to help the children avoid the harrowing experiences of their parents," Lai
said.</P>
      <P>The children's education is an issue of great concern, according to Lai. At Mae
La alone, TOPS runs more than 20 day-care centers as 38 percent of the Karen
children there are of kindergarten age.</P>
      <P>"Most children who are growing up in refugee camps do not have the slightest
idea of what constitutes a normal life," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Every week, Lai visits each of the camps in Mae Sot, driving seven to eight
hours along the rugged mountain roads. He often spends the night at one of the
camps to better assess the needs of the refugees.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes I do get tired and frustrated, but I have discovered that my
discomforts are nothing compared to the suffering of the displaced Karen
refugees whose dreams of going home might never be realized," he said.</P>
      <P>A major part of TOPS mission in Thailand is to help run schools for migrant
Karen children in remote Thai villages. The schools built on the hillsides are
open-sided thatched huts made of bamboo, but according to Lai, they are five-
star havens to the Karen children who long to learn.</P>
      <P>These crude structures collapse easily during the rainy season from May to
November. This year, some of them have not been rebuilt because of tighter
financing since the global economic crisis broke, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Despite the challenges, Lai and others like him do their best to bring 21st
century education to the refugee children.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese Chang Lee-an has been engaged in this effort since 2005 when he and
Lai first met in Thailand. Chang, then a student in the Department of
Information and Computer Engineering at Chung Yuan Christian University in
Taiwan, began to collect computer equipment after he returned to Taiwan that
year from his summer break.</P>
      <P>He went back to Thailand in the summer of 2006 with the equipment to teach Karen
children at Mae Sot camps how to use computers. Taking his efforts one step
further, Chang established the Youth E-Service, Taiwan in January 2007 to foster
youth voluntarism.</P>
      <P>"It is good that Taiwan's college students are willing to do volunteer work
during the summer and winter breaks, " Lai said. This allows them to gain useful
hands-on experience and gives them an opportunity to better understand the rest
of the world."</P>
      <P>The program is also aimed at fostering interaction among youth through the
development of digital learning, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, it takes many years of devoted work to make any significant
difference.</P>
      <P>"Humanitarian  assistance is a long-term commitment and it requires professional
knowledge, patience and a deep understanding of the problems. But Taiwanese tend
to be more keen on short-term work," he said.</P>
      <P>One of exceptions is Lin Liang-shu who has been volunteering at Karen refugee
camps along the Thai-Myanmar border for many years. Lin first became involved in
the work 20 years ago, when she was 25.</P>
      <P>She has now made Mae Sot her home and, along with friends in the area, has set
up the "Tak Border Child Association Foundation" to help refugee children.</P>
      <P>For volunteers like Lin and Lai, it is not only about helping others, but also
about self-discovery and development.</P>
      <P>Lai said that through his interaction with the Karen refugees, he has learned to
shed prejudices, to share his thoughts and emotions openly, and to find strength
even in the most desperate situations.</P>
      <P>"This work has also helped me to know myself better and to find ways of serving
my own homeland, " he said. "I've discovered my own weak points, most of which
derived from the easy life I had when I was growing up."</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, after seven years of service in the camps, Lai has decided to quit
his work with TOPS by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>He thinks that the search for life's meaning is a matter of giving one's self a
chance to explore, and that happiness means choosing the thing that one wants
most to do.</P>
      <P>"I would like to slow down and reexamine  my life,  but humanitarian concerns --
particularly the future of Karen refugee children -- will remain a lifelong
passion of mine," he said. Enditem/ pc</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-ASEAN free trade deal always a possibility, says scholar</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The stable development of Taiwan's economic ties with China is good news for the
region and could make it easier for Taiwan and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) to sign a free trade agreement (FTA), an Indonesian
scholar said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Dewi Fortuna Anwar,  the program and research director at Indonesian think tank
The Habibie Center, said she hoped improved China-ASEAN  and China-Taiwan
relations  would  ease Beijing's sensitivity toward stronger economic relations
between Taiwan and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Anwar would not comment directly on the potential impact of a proposed cross-
Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) on free trade
deals between Taiwan and other countries because she was not familiar with the
ECFA. But she said "the possibility always exists" for a free trade pact between
Taiwan and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a member of the WTO and APEC. An FTA is an economic issue, not a
political one, that depends on the two parties' interests," she said. "I don't
see any serious obstacles."</P>
      <P>Anwar was speaking in an interview with CNA in Bogor, where the center held a
forum on "Taiwan-Indonesian Dialogue" Dec. 7-8 along with the Taipei Economic
and Trade Office in Jakarta, Taiwan's de facto embassy. It was the second event
jointly organized by the two organizations since 2007.</P>
      <P>Participants were divided into four groups to discuss political, economic,
social and cultural, and non-traditional security issues.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuei-po, head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Research and
Planning Committee, said at the forum's closing session that it was meaningful
for the two sides to be able to work out joint strategies to resolve regional
challenges facing both countries.</P>
      <P>As civil exchanges can be helpful in achieving the goal, he hopes the two
nations will begin bilateral cooperation and exchanges based on the conclusions
of the dialogue, Huang added.</P>
      <P>According to the Habibie Center, a complete report of the conclusions will be
published in January, which will be presented to the Indonesian government and
congress as a policy reference.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan and Indonesia do not have diplomatic ties, economic ties are
growing. According to Taiwan's customs statistics, bilateral trade grew at an
annual rate of 25.51 percent in 2008 to reach US$10.92 billion.</P>
      <P>Indonesia is the ninth largest source of Taiwan's imports and Taiwan's 14th
largest export market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH hopes to hike health insurance premium rates within six months</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
12/09/09  16:28:15
(By Chen Li-ting and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top health official expressed the hope Wednesday that health
insurance premium rates would be hiked within six months to help solve the
financial shortfalls of Taiwan's National Health Insurance system.</P>
      <P>In an interview on a local radio station Wednesday, Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Yaung Chih-liang reiterated the need for higher premium rates but said
other measures to cut costs and increase revenues were being considered.</P>
      <P>Prior to the Dec. 5 local elections, Yaung argued that a premium rate hike was
necessary but denied that there was a timetable for the move.</P>
      <P>He said then that the rate, currently set at 4.55 percent of monthly salaries
with a ceiling of NT$131,700, is far lower than what he described as the
"reasonable rate" of 6.97 percent and warned that if the low premium remained
unchanged, the universal health insurance system will go bankrupt in 10 years.</P>
      <P>Those comments led some legislators of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to blame him
for the party's poor showing in the Dec. 5 local elections.</P>
      <P>Yaung on Wednesday  said he respected  their opinion  and acknowledged that it
was "bad timing" to talk about hiking premium rates before the elections.</P>
      <P>Since the situation occurred, he said he would take "general responsibility" for
it, but Yaung did not back down on his advocacy of hiking premium rates,
especially as Taiwan's population continues to age.</P>
      <P>The DOH minister said the system's financial woes could be partly attributed to
the graying of the population. There are 30 percent more senior citizens in
Taiwan than a decade ago, he noted, and their medical expenses per person
average 3.3 times more than younger citizens.</P>
      <P>Rising health care expenses that now average about US$1,000 per person per year
have also taken their toll on the health system's finances.</P>
      <P>Concerned about the sustainability of the system, Yaung said the economically
disadvantaged would suffer the most if the program was forced to shut down
because the wealthy could afford private insurance alternatives.</P>
      <P>On the timing of adjusting the health insurance premium, Yaung said he hopes to
accomplish it "within six months" and will do all he can to make it happen,
though other measures were under consideration to ease the burden of rate hikes
on the poor.</P>
      <P>"The ultimate goal is for economically disadvantaged groups to pay less but
enjoy the same health care protection as those who can afford insurance and help
to pay more," he said.</P>
      <P>Yaung also said he will actively call on legislators to convince them that a
rate hike is necessary.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, the health insurance program's accumulated deficit will
reach NT$50 billion by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The improvement in relations across the Taiwan Strait over the past year has
contributed to the unprecedented healthy development in U.S.-Taiwan-China ties,
a former foreign affairs minister and Taiwan representative to the United States
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Today, any two sides of the triangular relationship are hoping to enhance and
strengthen their relations with each other, which is a situation that has never
been seen before, observed Chen Chien-jen in a discussion co-sponsored by the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the most crucial factor in this development has been the
effort made by President Ma Ying-jeou since his inauguration in May 2008 to
adjust Taiwan's cross-strait and foreign policies, which helped mend relations
with China and rebuild trust with the United States.</P>
      <P>He reminded the Ma administration, however, of the importance of internal
communication in dealing with cross-strait and foreign relations issues. Without
such communication, the endeavor would be like a three-legged stool with one leg
missing, which could hardly stand, he argued.</P>
      <P>The discussion held at the American Chamber of Commerce was part of the third
annual China Town Hall, a U.S. nationwide webcast program presented by the New
York-based National Committee on United States-China Relations.</P>
      <P>This year's program featured Kurt Campbell, U.S. assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and speakers from 39 venues in the United
States, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to China in November, Chen
said the trip was a successful one because it showed the importance attached by
Washington to China's rise and recognized China's important position in the
world order.</P>
      <P>Also, demonstrating a style and philosophy that are totally different from his
predecessor George W. Bush, Obama has ruled out zero-sum games and unilateralism
in dealing with China and has focused on how to expand bilateral cooperation,
Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Communications Commission (NCC) rejected Next Media's applications
to establish general information and news TV channels during a review Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made because the company's presentation of news using lurid and
sensationalist graphic animation does not conform with the principle that news
should reflect the real facts, said NCC spokesman Chen Cheng-tsang.</P>
      <P>The provisions of Article 5 of the Basic Communications Act stipulate that media
content providers should produce and broadcast programs that safeguard human
dignity, respect the rights of the socially disadvantaged and promote
diversified and balanced cultural development.</P>
      <P>Judging from news samples provided by the company, it is apparently in violation
of the regulations, particularly as regards safeguarding human dignity, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>The commission said that all news reporting should be classified under the
general category rather than being classified  into restricted and parental
guidance categories.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-hsin, editor-in-chief of Next Media's TV news department, said the
company would respond until it had received official notification of the
application rejections.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two TV channels, Next Media Group has also filed applications
to establish sports, entertainment and movie channel.</P>
      <P>The NCC suspended screening of the applications for three channels and demanded
that the company provide more details about its overall plans.</P>
      <P>NCC members said Next Media had yet to clarify whether the entertainment and
sports news to be broadcast on its TV channels will be presented using graphic
animation techniques, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Next Media sparked a public outcry after its Apple Daily launched graphic
animation  online  news  services  featuring  explicit reconstructions of
criminal acts, including sexual assaults and murders.</P>

      <P>New Year's Eve partiers who want to enjoy the spectacular fireworks show at
Taipei 101 -- one of the world's tallest skyscrapers -- at close range will now
have a chance to do so, a Taipei 101 official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liu Chia-hao, assistant vice president of the Taipei Financial Center Corp.,
which owns the building, announced the New Year's Eve party at the landmark
building, the first of its kind.</P>
      <P>Liu said guests will have the unforgettable experience of witnessing 22,000
rounds of fireworks shooting into the night sky, while enjoying live music and
gourmet food and wine.</P>
      <P>He said the fireworks display -- now in its sixth year -- has become an
international event that has boosted sales in shops in the vicinity every year.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taipei 101 last year allowed people to watch the fireworks from
the observation deck on the 89th floor, with the 1,200 available tickets sold
out quickly.  "This is why we have decided to cooperate with Lions Travel to
hold a party this year, " Liu said, adding that New Year's Eve parties are now

      <P>Taipei 101 will not rule out the possibility of renting spare space to private
companies for New Year's Eve parties in the future, he went on.</P>
      <P>Liu said earlier that NT$30 million will be spent on this year's 188-second
fireworks show -- NT$10 million more than last year -- in response to complaints
by revelers that the 2009 event was not exciting enough.</P>
      <P>Some 22,000 fireworks will be launched, the most ever and 6,600 more than last
year, Liu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added, the angles covered by the 2010 show will be the widest in
history, with fireworks to be launched at 180 degrees, 90 degrees, 45 degrees
and 30 degrees.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-yi, president of Lions Travel, said that of the 1,000 tickets available
for individuals this year, half have already been sold.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Newspaper denounced for inaccurate report on cross-strait norms</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) strongly denounced a local
newspaper Wednesday for inaccurately reporting officials' remarks concerning a
planned cross-Taiwan Strait agreement on standards, inspection and
certification.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times reported in a front page story Wednesday that a Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) official had "confirmed" that an agreement between
Taiwan and China on setting up common industrial standards was reached with a
"one-China market" in mind.</P>
      <P>But Lu Chang-shuei, the MAC official responsible for public affairs and
parliamentary liaison, said Wednesday that the newspaper got it wrong.</P>
      <P>He said that when a Liberty Times reporter asked at a press conference Tuesday
whether establishing common industrial standards was a "one-China market"
concept, both MOEA Vice Minister Lin Sheng-chung and Chen Jay-san, director-
general of the MOEA's Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection, clearly
replied that it was not related to a one-China market and did not have any
political meaning.</P>
      <P>The newspaper's lead headline and story said, however, that the officials' slip
of the tongue on the planned standards agreement revealed the Kuomintang
government's ulterior motive of forming a "one-China" market and described it as
a "special standard" between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Lu denounced the report as smearing the government's policy and efforts to
promote the globalization of Taiwan's standards system.</P>
      <P>He said that Lin had explained at the press conference that thanks to their
strong technological  research and development capability,  some of Taiwan's
industries had already gained a competitive edge internationally based and
developed their own standards.</P>
      <P>"If the mainland adopts Taiwan's standards, they will not only be used on the
two sides but will gradually become international standards, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Chen insisted Tuesday that the agreement on common industrial
standards, inspection and certification, to be signed in the next round of
Taiwan-China talks later this month in Taichung, did not represent a "one-China"
market.</P>
      <P>Chen said the planned agreement is aimed at allowing domestic manufacturers to
produce products based on common cross-strait standards so that the products can
be sold in mainland China, Lu explained.</P>
      <P>Lu reiterated that the planned agreement is aimed at encouraging domestic
factories to make inroads into the mainland market and bring Taiwan's standards
to the world.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Wednesday:</P>
      <P>CHINA TIMES: Taiwan needs to do more in fight against global warming</P>
      <P>The United Nations summit on climate change is ongoing in Copenhagen. While the
12-day conference is not expected to come up with a concrete agreement to
replace the Kyoto Protocol, major world powers, such as the United States, China
and European Union member states, have promised to cut greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>In the face of this critical issue, Taiwan should not take a hands-off attitude
and should instead act quickly to help protect the natural environment as it is
crucial to human survival.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far done little to address the global warming challenge. Relevant
government agencies have seldom taken active steps to get to the bottom of the
issue. To date, no convincing figures are available for Taiwan's annual carbon
dioxide emissions and the annual growth or reduction rates over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The government has also not yet come up with any concrete mechanisms to regulate
various industries' greenhouse gas emissions nor has it evaluated how many local
people could still live on land if sea levels in waters surrounding Taiwan were
to rise one meter.</P>
      <P>The environmental issues may not be as urgent as many day-to-day public affairs
and election campaigns, but they are essential to our country's survival and
sustainable growth. The government should be more far-sighted in policy
formulation. If the government continues to sit idly, we may lose the battle
against global warming. UNITED DAILY NEWS It is more urgent for DPP than KMT to
adjust policy toward China</P>
      <P>Some pundits have predicted that the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will adjust its
policy on cross-Taiwan Strait relations following its recent election setback,
which they say reflects to some extent public dissatisfaction with the party's
rapprochement with China.</P>
      <P>That may be true. But the impact is not as great as that reported by some
foreign media outlets.</P>
      <P>While we share the view that the KMT should further fine-tune its cross-strait
engagement policies and strategies, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has come under even greater pressure  to  adjust  its  China  policy
following  its stronger-than-expected showing in last Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>If the electoral gain is a prelude to a DPP return to power, the party will see
pressure upon it to change its cross-strait policy increase in direct proportion
to the possibility of realization of such a scenario.</P>
      <P>Should the DPP return to power, it will not be possible for the party to use its
previous radical pro-independence approach to interact with China.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the DPP should consider adjusting its stances on major
cross-strait issues right now. Perhaps the party could  start  with  revising
its  attitude  toward  the  KMT administration's plan to sign an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP should drop its "downright opposition" stance toward the proposal and
instead focus on how to amend or reinforce the KMT-drafted version or how to
better protect Taiwan's interests once the ECFA deal is struck.</P>
      <P>If the DPP could adjust its radical pro-independence policy, it would stand a
better chance of staging a comeback. If it fails to do so, a return to power of
the party would spell disaster for the country. LIBERTY TIMES Voice opposition
to selling out Taiwan</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  people  should  stand  up and protest  the  KMT administration's plan
to strike a trade deal with China because only a few Taiwanese companies will
benefit from such an accord while most other local enterprises stand to lose
under market-opening terms in the agreement.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwanese voters used their ballots to express their opposition to the
Ma administration's China-tilting policy in last Saturday's local elections, the
administration has decided to go ahead with its ECFA plan and talks will begin
soon.</P>
      <P>Covering a broad range of issues, the proposed ECFA agreement will be tantamout
to setting norms and rules for future cross-strait commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's people should not keep silent on the issue. Judging from the Ma
administration's bowing to U.S. pressure in beef trade talks in October,  we
should keep a watchful  eye on the upcoming cross-strait high-level talks in
Taichung later this month.</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of Taiwan's small- and medium-sized enterprises may go
bankrupt because of competition from China's state-owned corporations once the
ECFA is inked.</P>
      <P>With such a threat looming, local people should not be deterred by the Taichung
police authorities'  plan to confine protest activities  to a designated  area
when Taiwanese  and Chinese negotiators meet in the city.</P>
      <P>The police's plan will not succeed so long as our people in the street are
determined to oppose the KMT administration's move to pander to China at the
expense of Taiwan's national interests.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will lodge a protest with the organizer of the World Expo 2010 Shanghai
for including Taiwan in the "China Pavilion, " as this implies that Taiwan is
part of China's territory, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wen-kai, director of the Taiwan Trade Center in Shanghai, said the
arrangement is in violation of a contract signed between the Taipei World Trade
Center (TWTC) and the Bureau of Shanghai World Expo Coordination, which states
that the Taiwan Pavilion will be located in an area of Zone A designated for the
national pavilions of Asian countries.</P>
      <P>According to the exhibition's master plan posted on its official Web site, Zone
A will host the China Pavilion, as well as national pavilions for Asian
countries other than those in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>"The China Pavilion consists of the 47,000-square-meter Chinese national
pavilion, a 38,000-square-meter regional joint pavilion and a 3,300-square-meter
pavilion for Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, " the plan stipulates.</P>
      <P>In Taipei that same day, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-
shun said that such an arrangement is "definitely not appropriate" and that the
MAC supports the TWTC's decision to lodge a protest with the organizer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is participating in the exhibition -- slated to be held May 1-Oct. 31,
2010 -- under the name of the TWTC. Construction work for the four-story Taiwan
Pavilion, which will be constructed in the shape of a mountain, began Aug. 17,
2009 and is expected to be completed next March.</P>

agricultural quarantine inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and
certification, and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>

civic groups have formed the One Taiwan One China 1221 Action Alliance, which
will make appeals in the interest of the Taiwan people on matters related to the
cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>The alliance will appeal for the talks between Taiwan and China be conducted on
a nation-to-nation basis, for the contents of the agreements to be reviewed by
the legislature, and for decisions involving the rights and welfare of the
people to be put to referendum, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen said that a mass march and rally will be held on the eve of the Chiang-Chen

    <HEADLINE>Peace prevails between Taiwan's offshore bastion and former adversary</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
12/09/09  19:46:54
(By Joe Hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lt. Col. Alfred Medendorp of the U.S. Army was killed in action on a tiny isle
only a few miles from Amoy on September 3, 1954. Chinese shore batteries on what
is now better known as Xiamen bombarded Little Quemoy (Little Kinmen) , half the
size of its larger neighbor of the same name without that lesser sobriquet.</P>
      <P>Colonel Medendorp, originally from the national guard of the state of Michigan,
was the first American officer of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group to
lay down his life for the defense of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The September 3 artillery duel was a prelude to the Kinmen crisis of 1958, also
referred to as the battle of the Taiwan Strait. A monument to the colonel,
erected in 1992 while Gen. Hau Pei-tsun was premier, stands testimony to the
U.S. determination to keep peace between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Hau was commanding general of the Ninth Division deployed on Little Kinmen,
called officially Lieyu or Fiery Island, which was bombarded twice as ruthlessly
during the battle of the Taiwan Strait, which broke out four years later on
August 23.</P>
      <P>The September 3 duel caused serious U.S. concern. Capitol Hill gave President
Dwight D. Eisenhower authority to use force if necessary to defend Kinmen, a
complex comprising fourteen tiny islands, one of them only about two miles off
Xiamen, a larger island connected with the mainland of China by railway.</P>
      <P>Kinmen is 152 miles from Kaohsiung and 207 miles from Keelung, both on Taiwan.
During the battle of the Taiwan Strait, 590 officers and men of the defense
force were killed, with 2,200 others wounded and 24 missing in action. At least
80 civilians on the two islands died and 221 others were injured, most of them
seriously. One more American colonel was killed on the first day of the crisis.</P>
      <P>The casualties were heavy because close to half a million artillery shells
rained down on the 131.7 square-kilometer islands in the 44-day bombardment,
which failed to pave the way for an invasion from the Chinese mainland. Half of
them, 240,460 shells, fell on Little Kinmen. The People's Liberation Army did
not make any attempt to land its troops on either of the Kinmens.</P>
      <P>On September 26, while the battle of the Taiwan Strait continued to rage, an LVT
(landing vehicle tracked) carrying a press contingent capsized off Liolo Bay on
Kinmen. Six war correspondents, including one from Japan and another from the
Republic of Korea, drowned.</P>
      <P>All these servicemen and civilians did not die in vain. Peace has reigned
between Kinmen and Xiamen, at first precariously and now expected to last as
Taiwan is improving relations with China after eight years of hostile
confrontation while President Chen Shui-bian was in office.</P>
      <P>"Peace is so lovable," said Lin Ma-teng, a veteran turned amateur historian who
is now curator of a cultural museum on Little Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Pointing to a northeastern shore of Xiamen Island, about 3.5 miles away from
Little Kinmen, Lin said skyscrapers have mushroomed over the past couple of
years."The Chinese are enjoying the peace as well," he quipped, "or they
wouldn't even try to build anything."</P>
      <P>That part of Xiamen is exposed to a Little Kinmen shore battery whose 240mm
howitzer can take out any structure and annihilate its occupants if a war breaks
out. The tiny isle is dotted with emplacements of similar artillery batteries
that can also fire surface-to-surface missiles.</P>
      <P>They and the well-trained garrison are combat-ready, not for war but to make
sure no hostilities occur by accident. No accident is likely after all tensions
across the strait have been removed since May 2008, however.</P>
      <P>"That has affected our business, " a souvenir shop owner happily lamented. Hung
Chih-ching, who worked as a reporter for the Kinmen Daily newspaper before
opening his store, isn't much worried about a fall in his business resulting
from a cut in troop strength on the island. He enjoyed a brisk business while
there were "many, many more soldiers."</P>
      <P>"My business has suffered a bit, " he added, "but I am happy for we do enjoy the
peace."</P>
      <P>Another storeowner likes the peace better. Hung Song-po sells peanut cake, the
best of its kind in China.uMore tourists come, not just from Taiwan and China
but from around the world, and they are all good customers,vhe beamed.</P>
      <P>The tourist boom, though not as large as was expected, has helped Kinmen sell
its world-famous Kaoliang liquor. To an ever-growing number of connoisseurs
throughout the world, Kaoliang means a fragrant, tasty and strong spirit like
vodka that is made from sorghum, which Kinmen is best suited to grow.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Distillery, owned by the county government of Kinmen, chalked up more
than NT$18 billion (US$600 million) in sales last year. Kinmen, which means
Golden Gate in Chinese, has a population of less than 40,000.</P>
      <P>Relatives of Hiroyuki Yasuda, the Tokyo-based Yomiuri Shimbun correspondent
killed in the LVT accident, came to Kinmen to witness his being enshrined at the
Martyrs' Temple. His fellow Korean reporter, Choi Ping Woo, and four Taiwan war
correspondents were honored as well in Kinmen's version of the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou took part in a memorial service for them on August 23,
2008 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Kinmen crisis. "Let Kinmen turn
from a killing field to a peace plaza, "Ma declared.</P>
      <P>Kinmen is transforming as such. The monument on Little Kinmen and the enshrining
of the six journalists attest a future in which there will be no more war
between the two sides of the strait.</P>

      <P>Demand for capital by Taiwanese businessmen operating in China is assessed at
between US$200 billion and US$400 billion, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean C. Chen said Wednesday, adding that the amount is
equivalent to the combined loan energy of "several banks."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a conference on cross-Taiwan Strait financial affairs
while speaking about a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on banking supervision
cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait that was signed Nov. 16.</P>
      <P>He said the MOU, which will go into effect Jan. 16, paves the way for allowing
Taiwanese banks to open branch offices in China, which can solve the problem of
capital demand from Taiwanese businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the MOU is seen as important not just by the Taiwanese banking
sector but also by those of many other countries, proven by the fact that
representatives of at least four leading industrial countries having visited the
FSC in the past year to study the progress of the cross-strait MOU.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Banking Bureau Director-General Chang Ming-daw at the FSC assessed
that the eight Taiwanese banks that have already opened representative offices
in China could release loans of around NT$16 billion (US$495.94 million) in the
early stage of their opening of branch offices, accounting for 0.11 percent of
their total assets.</P>
      <P>The MOU on cross-strait banking supervision cooperation was formed to facilitate
regulatory cooperation across the strait in the fields of information sharing,
market entry regulation, crisis management and resolution, as well as personnel
exchanges. It is designed for the effective supervision and regulation of the
banking financial institutions established across the strait, safeguarding the
soundness and safety of the respective banking sectors of the two sides.</P>

      <P>The chain store and franchise industry has played an important role in Taiwan's
economic development, with the sector's revenue reaching NT$1.7 trillion in
2008, or 48 percent of the total revenue of the retail and restaurant
industries, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sector made a great contribution to the service industry's total production
value in 2008, which accounted for 70 percent of the US$391.3 billion in gross
domestic product (GDP) that year, Yeh Yun-lung, chief of the MOEA's Department
of Commerce, said at a ceremony to present accreditation certificates to 12
chain store and franchise headquarters that have performed outstandingly in
service quality.</P>
      <P>The accreditation scheme was launched by the department as part of a program to
promote service quality and business performance, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>The program includes an assessment of chain store and franchise headquarters, a
Good Service Practice (GSP) accreditation system and a business talent
certification system, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The assessment and accreditation program was mapped out to create more jobs amid
the recession by helping people seeking to launch their own franchise or chain
store business to identify certified operators before making the choice of which
franchise to buy into.</P>
      <P>Twelve store operators passed the assessment this year, of which HB Housing was
cited as having an excellent franchise headquarters, while Medfirst Healthcare
Services Corp. and Jyi-Shien Enterprise Co., known for its Wu Tau Lunchbox
products, were listed as qualified headquarters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, over 900 stores were awarded GSP certificates this year, bringing to
more than 6,000 the number that have been awarded the certification since 2004.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's proposed recognition of Chinese universities will not lead to an exodus
of the country's top students, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Education Lin Tsung-ming, the move will instead
prompt universities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in healthy
competition.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Taiwan universities have the competitive edge, and there is no
need to worry about the "magnetic effect" of Chinese schools.</P>
      <P>He also said that the ministry is planning a phased recognition of diplomas from
more than 100 top Chinese universities, with 41 schools to be accredited in the
first stage, 55 in the second stage and a yet undecided number in the third
stage.</P>
      <P>This means that Taiwan students wishing to study in China will have limited
choices, he said. Besides, Taiwan is an open society and its students can go
wherever they wish to pursue higher education, he added.</P>
      <P>"Local universities, rather than worrying about losing students, should work
harder to upgrade their quality so that their students can compete with those
from top universities in other countries," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to Legislator Kuan Bi-ling of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party who expressed misgivings over the possible effects of the
government's plan.</P>
      <P>Kuan said that Chinese universities could indeed attract top Taiwan students,
and she cited the example of Premier Wu Den-yih's son who obtained a doctorate
in law from China's Tsinghua University.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet spokesman later in the day responded that Wu's son had studied for his
master's degree in the United States and later worked for a Taiwan businessman.

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will not back
off its commitment to wipe out corruption and establish clean politics despite
its recent election setback.</P>
      <P>Speaking in his capacity as KMT chairman at the party's first weekly meeting
following last Saturday's local elections, Ma said the party will accelerate
internal reform and work to the best of its ability for the interests of Taiwan
and its people.</P>
      <P>In the process, Ma said, both the KMT and the administration will strengthen
communications with all relevant sectors to win public support for various
reform initiatives.</P>
      <P>Noting that nearly all the programs he intends to carry out -- such as mergers
of cities and counties, government restructuring and taxation reform -- will
touch on changes of status quo, Ma said it is only natural that there will be
some backlash and discontent.</P>
      <P>"Reform is like pulling a tooth... it tends to cause pain... If there was no
price, it could hardly be called reform," Ma said.</P>
      <P>For instance, he noted, the KMT lost the Hualien magistrate seat to Fu Kun-chi,
a KMT maverick who was expelled from the party after he insisted on joining the
race without the party's endorsement.</P>
      <P>Ma said the party did not nominate Fu in the first place because he has a
conviction record for his involvement in insider trading.</P>
      <P>"We do not regret our decision, " Ma said, adding that the KMT, under his
leadership, will not retreat from the path of reform.</P>
      <P>Touching   on  the   Democratic   Progressive   Party's stronger-than-expected
showing in the latest election, Ma said he looks forward to normal engagement
between the KMT and the DPP now that the main opposition party has risen from
the ashes after a spate of corruption scandals surrounding its previous leader
-- former President Chen Shui-bin.</P>
      <P>"The KMT hopes to resume normal engagement with the DPP, " Ma said, adding that
the two parties should hold regular dialogue and work together for the public's
wellbeing through fair competition under the constitutional framework.</P>
      <P>Ma apologized to the public for some of the KMT candidates' alleged involvement
in vote-buying and violence in the just-concluded elections.</P>
      <P>He also  apologized  to KMT supporters  for  the  party's less-than-ideal
showing in the elections for mayors, magistrates, councilors and township chiefs
in 17 of Taiwan's cities and counties.</P>
      <P>"I am the one who should assume full responsibility for the party's latest
election setback," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The KMT lost two magistrate seats -- Yilan and Hualien counties -- that it had
held previous to the elections and also saw its vote share decline as compared
to its performance in the previous local elections four years ago.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversy over the government's relaxation of restrictions on U.S. beef
imports is heating up again, as Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang vowed
Wednesday to sue a student who publicized the cellphone numbers of KMT lawmakers
so that people could call them to complain about the issue.</P>
      <P>The student, Chu Cheng-chi of National Taiwan University, was seeking
sponsorship Wednesday for a billboard that would display the phone numbers of
several KMT lawmakers, including Lu's.</P>
      <P>Chu had earlier in the week displayed a poster with the phone numbers of some
KMT lawmakers, and urged the public to call them to protest the wider opening of
the Taiwan market to U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>His action came in response to a proposed amendment to the Food Sanitation Act
to clear the way for less stringent checks on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>However, KMT Legislator Kung Wen-chi, who had sponsored the proposed amendment,
withdrew his version on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless,  Chu went ahead with his plans to erect the billboard, but said he
was pleased to hear that Kung had dropped the proposal.</P>
      <P>The student expressed the hope that KMT lawmakers would introduce a bill that
would strictly prohibit imports of "risky" beef products.</P>
      <P>In response, Lu said that Chu is an opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) worker and an editor of a pro-DPP magazine, and that his actions were a
means of gaining publicity with the intention of running for political office in
the future.</P>
      <P>Lu vowed to take legal action against Chu for infringement of portrait rights
and disclosure of personal information.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at a press conference Wednesday, the KMT legislative caucus accused
the PDP of having stalled legislative meetings for one month over the
controversy for political expediency.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the KMT caucus has decided to adopt a version of the Food
Sanitation Act amendment proposed by KMT Legislator Huang Yi-chiao, with some
revisions.</P>
      <P>The Huang version of the amendment states that the government would ban the
importation of skulls, brains, eyes, spinal cords, bovine organs as well as
ground beef from cattle raised in areas and countries where bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, outbreaks have occurred.</P>
      <P>Those who illegally bring in beef from cattle that have been contaminated with "
specific risk materials (SRMs) " related to BSE will be fined between NT$3
million and NT$15 million, the proposed bill states.</P>
      <P>SRMs are defined in the U.S.-Taiwan beef protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>However, DPP lawmakers have been pushing for a reopening of negotiations with
the United States and a ban on the controversial beef parts, through
legislation. It said administrative checks and measures are not enough to fully
protect the health of the public.</P>

      <P>Demand for capital by Taiwanese businessmen operating in China is assessed at
between US$200 billion and US$400 billion, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean C. Chen said Wednesday, adding that the amount is
equivalent to the combined loan energy of "several banks."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a conference on cross-Taiwan Strait financial affairs
while speaking about a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on banking supervision
cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait that was signed Nov. 16.</P>
      <P>He said the MOU, which will go into effect Jan. 16, paves the way for allowing
Taiwanese banks to open branch offices in China, which can solve the problem of
capital demand from Taiwanese businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the MOU is seen as important not just by the Taiwanese banking
sector but also by those of many other countries, proven by the fact that
representatives of at least four leading industrial countries having visited the
FSC in the past year to study the progress of the cross-strait MOU.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Banking Bureau Director-General Chang Ming-daw at the FSC assessed
that the eight Taiwanese banks that have already opened representative offices
in China could release loans of around NT$16 billion (US$495.94 million) in the
early stage of their opening of branch offices, accounting for 0.11 percent of
their total assets.</P>
      <P>The MOU on cross-strait banking supervision cooperation was formed to facilitate
regulatory cooperation across the strait in the fields of information sharing,
market entry regulation, crisis management and resolution, as well as personnel
exchanges. It is designed for the effective supervision and regulation of the
banking financial institutions established across the strait, safeguarding the
soundness and safety of the respective banking sectors of the two sides.</P>

      <P>The chain store and franchise industry has played an important role in Taiwan's
economic development, with the sector's revenue reaching NT$1.7 trillion in
2008, or 48 percent of the total revenue of the retail and restaurant
industries, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sector made a great contribution to the service industry's total production
value in 2008, which accounted for 70 percent of the US$391.3 billion in gross
domestic product (GDP) that year, Yeh Yun-lung, chief of the MOEA's Department
of Commerce, said at a ceremony to present accreditation certificates to 12
chain store and franchise headquarters that have performed outstandingly in
service quality.</P>
      <P>The accreditation scheme was launched by the department as part of a program to
promote service quality and business performance, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>The program includes an assessment of chain store and franchise headquarters, a
Good Service Practice (GSP) accreditation system and a business talent
certification system, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The assessment and accreditation program was mapped out to create more jobs amid
the recession by helping people seeking to launch their own franchise or chain
store business to identify certified operators before making the choice of which
franchise to buy into.</P>
      <P>Twelve store operators passed the assessment this year, of which HB Housing was
cited as having an excellent franchise headquarters, while Medfirst Healthcare
Services Corp. and Jyi-Shien Enterprise Co., known for its Wu Tau Lunchbox
products, were listed as qualified headquarters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, over 900 stores were awarded GSP certificates this year, bringing to
more than 6,000 the number that have been awarded the certification since 2004.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's proposed recognition of Chinese universities will not lead to an exodus
of the country's top students, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Education Lin Tsung-ming, the move will instead
prompt universities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in healthy
competition.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Taiwan universities have the competitive edge, and there is no
need to worry about the "magnetic effect" of Chinese schools.</P>
      <P>He also said that the ministry is planning a phased recognition of diplomas from
more than 100 top Chinese universities, with 41 schools to be accredited in the
first stage, 55 in the second stage and a yet undecided number in the third
stage.</P>
      <P>This means that Taiwan students wishing to study in China will have limited
choices, he said. Besides, Taiwan is an open society and its students can go
wherever they wish to pursue higher education, he added.</P>
      <P>"Local universities, rather than worrying about losing students, should work
harder to upgrade their quality so that their students can compete with those
from top universities in other countries," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to Legislator Kuan Bi-ling of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party who expressed misgivings over the possible effects of the
government's plan.</P>
      <P>Kuan said that Chinese universities could indeed attract top Taiwan students,
and she cited the example of Premier Wu Den-yih's son who obtained a doctorate
in law from China's Tsinghua University.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet spokesman later in the day responded that Wu's son had studied for his
master's degree in the United States and later worked for a Taiwan businessman.
He did his doctorate in China under a company personnel development program, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that local universities would be allowed to admit Chinese students
through a joint entrance examination, and in the initial stage would only accept
newly graduates.</P>
      <P>However, if necessary, specific universities could also hold individual entrance
exams, he added.</P>

      <P>Speaking in his capacity as KMT chairman at the party's first weekly meeting
following last Saturday's local elections, Ma said the party will accelerate
internal reform and work to the best of its ability for the interests of Taiwan
and its people.</P>
      <P>In the process, Ma said, both the KMT and the administration will strengthen
communications with all relevant sectors to win public support for various
reform initiatives.</P>
      <P>Noting that nearly all the programs he intends to carry out -- such as mergers
of cities and counties, government restructuring and taxation reform -- will
touch on changes of status quo, Ma said it is only natural that there will be
some backlash and discontent.</P>
      <P>"Reform is like pulling a tooth... it tends to cause pain... If there was no
price, it could hardly be called reform," Ma said.</P>
      <P>For instance, he noted, the KMT lost the Hualien magistrate seat to Fu Kun-chi,
a KMT maverick who was expelled from the party after he insisted on joining the
race without the party's endorsement.</P>
      <P>Ma said the party did not nominate Fu in the first place because he has a
conviction record for his involvement in insider trading.</P>
      <P>"We do not regret our decision, " Ma said, adding that the KMT, under his
leadership, will not retreat from the path of reform.</P>
      <P>Touching   on  the   Democratic   Progressive   Party's stronger-than-expected
showing in the latest election, Ma said he looks forward to normal engagement
between the KMT and the DPP now that the main opposition party has risen from
the ashes after a spate of corruption scandals surrounding its previous leader
-- former President Chen Shui-bin.</P>
      <P>"The KMT hopes to resume normal engagement with the DPP, " Ma said, adding that
the two parties should hold regular dialogue and work together for the public's
wellbeing through fair competition under the constitutional framework.</P>
      <P>Ma apologized to the public for some of the KMT candidates' alleged involvement
in vote-buying and violence in the just-concluded elections.</P>
      <P>He also  apologized  to KMT supporters  for  the  party's less-than-ideal
showing in the elections for mayors, magistrates, councilors and township chiefs
in 17 of Taiwan's cities and counties.</P>
      <P>"I am the one who should assume full responsibility for the party's latest
election setback," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The KMT lost two magistrate seats -- Yilan and Hualien counties -- that it had
held previous to the elections and also saw its vote share decline as compared
to its performance in the previous local elections four years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Controversy over U.S. beef imports flares up again</HEADLINE>

      <P>The controversy over the government's relaxation of restrictions on U.S. beef
imports is heating up again, as Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang vowed
Wednesday to sue a student who publicized the cellphone numbers of KMT lawmakers
so that people could call them to complain about the issue.</P>
      <P>The student, Chu Cheng-chi of National Taiwan University, was seeking
sponsorship Wednesday for a billboard that would display the phone numbers of
several KMT lawmakers, including Lu's.</P>
      <P>Chu had earlier in the week displayed a poster with the phone numbers of some
KMT lawmakers, and urged the public to call them to protest the wider opening of
the Taiwan market to U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>His action came in response to a proposed amendment to the Food Sanitation Act
to clear the way for less stringent checks on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>However, KMT Legislator Kung Wen-chi, who had sponsored the proposed amendment,
withdrew his version on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless,  Chu went ahead with his plans to erect the billboard, but said he
was pleased to hear that Kung had dropped the proposal.</P>
      <P>The student expressed the hope that KMT lawmakers would introduce a bill that
would strictly prohibit imports of "risky" beef products.</P>
      <P>In response, Lu said that Chu is an opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) worker and an editor of a pro-DPP magazine, and that his actions were a
means of gaining publicity with the intention of running for political office in
the future.</P>
      <P>Lu vowed to take legal action against Chu for infringement of portrait rights
and disclosure of personal information.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at a press conference Wednesday, the KMT legislative caucus accused
the PDP of having stalled legislative meetings for one month over the
controversy for political expediency.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the KMT caucus has decided to adopt a version of the Food
Sanitation Act amendment proposed by KMT Legislator Huang Yi-chiao, with some
revisions.</P>
      <P>The Huang version of the amendment states that the government would ban the
importation of skulls, brains, eyes, spinal cords, bovine organs as well as
ground beef from cattle raised in areas and countries where bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, outbreaks have occurred.</P>
      <P>Those who illegally bring in beef from cattle that have been contaminated with "
specific risk materials (SRMs) " related to BSE will be fined between NT$3
million and NT$15 million, the proposed bill states.</P>
      <P>SRMs are defined in the U.S.-Taiwan beef protocol as brains, skulls, eyes,
trigeminal ganglia, spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from
cattle 30 months and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small
intestine from cattle of all ages.</P>
      <P>However, DPP lawmakers have been pushing for a reopening of negotiations with
the United States and a ban on the controversial beef parts, through
legislation. It said administrative checks and measures are not enough to fully
protect the health of the public.</P>

he has time and opportunity to spare, after the performance of those duties, he
should then employ them in literary pursuits."</TEXT>

      <P>President  and ruling  Kuomintang  Chairman  Ma Ying-jeou's appointment of his
most trusted ally King Pu-tsung as the party's new secretary-general has drawn
mixed reactions in the KMT ranks and wider society. While some party insiders
believe King's close relationship with Ma will facilitate party reform, others
have expressed doubts about his ability to fill that role.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily:</P>
      <P>Ma's appointment Wednesday of former Taipei Deputy Mayor King Pu-tsung to serve
as the KMT's new secretary-general has taken the KMT hierarchy and the rest of
the Taiwan political arena by surprise.</P>
      <P>King, who is now a visiting scholar at the U.S. think tank Brookings
Institution, will take over from Chan Chuen-po, one of the KMT's vice chairmen,
as manager of the party's day-to-day affairs. Chan will retain his position as
vice chairman.</P>
      <P>"This arrangement will shape a new iron triangle in our endeavor to accelerate
party reforms," Ma said at a weekly party meeting.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>King, nicknamed by local political observers as "King stylet" and Ma's right-
hand  man during his tenure as Taipei  mayor, demonstrated his expertise as a
campaigner and publicity guru in a number of important elections that involved
Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma is now seen drawing on King's agility to bolster and accelerate efforts to
revive the KMT monolith. (Dec.10, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The surprise appointment is bound to trigger opposition within the KMT ranks as
well as at the level of grassroots party workers.</P>
      <P>As a top party manager, the KMT secretary-general must be acutely tuned to the
party's grassroots and must have finely honed skills to navigate the country's
political environment.</P>
      <P>"The top manager will lead the party to a dead end if he makes judgments simply
on the basis of charts and figures that he reads at the office," some senior KMT
party officials said. (Dec. 10, 2009)</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s acquisition of a 20 percent stake in
Motech Industries, Inc. is widely seen as a landmark entry of major Taiwanese
business groups into the photovoltaic industry.  Market analysts  say the
involvement  of industrial heavyweights  will contribute  to the development  of
Taiwan's export-oriented solar energy industry.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest development:
Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  leading  wafer manufacturer  Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC) announced Wednesday that it will acquire a 20 percent stake in
Motech Industries at a cost of NT$6.2 billion (US$129.09 million).</P>
      <P>The deal will make TSMC the largest single investor in Motech, which is Taiwan's
oldest solar cell manufacturer and its stock prices are the highest among its
local competitors. Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>After resuming the post of TSMC chief executive officer, Morris Chang assigned
Rick Tsai to head the New Business Department. Tsai visited various firms in the
solar energy industry and chose Motech as partner because Motech's Chairman
Yuan-huai Simon Tsuo is one of his acquaintances and many executives of Motech
are former employees of TSMC. Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Industrial analysts have said that TSMC is investing in Motech on a trial basis,
as Motech, with a gross profit of 15 percent of its assets, lags far behind TSMC
which boasts a gross profit of 50 percent of its assets. The analysts have
predicted that TSMC will not take over Motech in the long term unless Motech can
raise its profits sharply.</P>

      <P>Former Taipei Deputy Mayor King Pu-tsung, widely known as President Ma Ying-
jeou's right-hand man during Ma's tenure as Taipei mayor, will rush back to
Taipei to take up his surprise appointment as secretary-general of the ruling
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Commenting  on the mixed reactions within the KMT to his appointment, King told
the Central News Agency that he too was taken by surprise by the appointment,
but that he would make every effort to prove the skeptics wrong.</P>
      <P>"I will speak less and do more in the future and give the job my best shot,"
said King, who is currently a visiting scholar at the U.S. think tank, the
Brookings Institution.</P>
      <P>He appealed to the KMT hierarchy and the wider Taiwan society to give him time
to do his best to streamline the ruling party.</P>
      <P>It is widely believed that Ma's appointment of King to the management  post was
a response to the KMT's setback in the just-concluded local elections.</P>
      <P>King declined to comment on the KMT's performance in the elections, saying that
it will take some time for him to gain a better understanding of the current
situation and be able to comment on the party's prospects and campaign
strategies in future elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, King said he will return to Taipei as soon as possible but will need
to wrap up some routine matters before he leaves.</P>
      <P>On his research experience in D.C., King said he has learned a lot at the
Brookings Institution over the past several months.</P>
      <P>He said he is now better versed in international affairs and hopes that he could
help push for closer contact between Taiwan and the rest of the world and
greater representation of the country in global organizations.</P>
      <P>"One of the priorities of my new job might be to promote party-to-party
diplomacy," he added.</P>
      <P>King, who started his research at Brookings in September this year, was

    <HEADLINE>TSMC's investment in Motech may hold new opportunities</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's leading wafer manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC) announced Wednesday that it will invest NT$6.2 billion (US$192.55
millin) to acquire a 20 percent stake in Motech Industries.</P>
      <P>The deal will give TSMC a foothold in the solar energy industry, while Motech,
Taiwan's oldest solar cell maker, will have a wealthy stock owner to fall back
on, but it will be best if the partnership could bring new prospects for the
whole industry and give it a shot in the arm.</P>
      <P>The investment deal will take effect in January next year, TSMC said Wednesday,
adding that it will hold on to its stake in Motech for a minimum of three years.</P>
      <P>A TSMC spokesman said that Motech will call a meeting of its board of directors
next January to approve the deal and TSMC is expected to gain two seats on the
new board.</P>
      <P>TSMC began to evaluate the potential of the solar energy industry long before
the industry rebounded from the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>TSMC's chief executive officer Rick Tsai, who was assigned in June as head of
its New Business Depart, was eyeing the acquisition of a solar energy firm as a
means of venturing into the industry.</P>
      <P>At one point, TSMC had reportedly set its sights on New Solar Power Corp., with
which it is closely associated.</P>
      <P>Before the global financial crisis broke, entry to the solar energy industry was
relatively easy because it didn't cost much, and speculations ran rife about
take-overs and acquisitions.</P>
      <P>Now that the crisis is over and price of raw materials is dropping, the cost of
solar energy could fall to the level of of grid electricity.</P>
      <P>TSMC is eager to break into new industries, while Motech is keen to find
investors with abundant cash, therefore the deal is advantageous to both sides.</P>
      <P>But neither side knows what the next step should be, although they both agree
that the prospects are bright for this burgeoning industry.</P>
      <P>As a novice in the alternative energy field, the semiconductor giant TSMC is
paying Motech a "tuition fee" of NT$6.2 billion. While this might be just a drop
in the bucket for TSMC, it is equivalent of the value of Motech's entire
production facility.</P>
      <P>With TSMC as its largest single investor, Motech now has a solid foundation for
future development and a chance to determine its next step.</P>
      <P>Within this context, the linking of TSMC and Motech is a reasonable and prudent
decision.</P>
      <P>The public hopes that the cooperation between the two companies will bring new
development opportunities for the emerging alternative energy industry,
according to analysts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two U.N. human rights covenants take effect a big step: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's adoption of two United Nations human rights covenants into domestic
law, which took effect Thursday, is an important step for the country, President
Ma Ying-jeou said the same day.</P>
      <P>The two U.N. human rights treaties -- the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights -- were signed into law May 14 by Ma and came into effect on Human Rights
Day, Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>"From today on, any individual in the Republic of China can cite these two laws
on human rights protection, which is an important step for Taiwan," Ma said at a
human rights award ceremony held by the government-funded Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy (TFD).</P>
      <P>In support  of a promise  made  by the  president  at a similar ceremony last
year, the legislature passed the bill in March this year.</P>
      <P>"I have delivered on my promise, made one year ago at a similar event, to make
these two treaties domestic law," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was one of the original signatories to the two treaties in 1967 when the
Republic of China was still a U.N. member. Although Taiwan lost its U.N. seat in
1971, it took steps many years later to adopt the treaties.</P>
      <P>However, Wang Sing-nan, caucus whip of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, accused the government Thursday of violating the terms of the treaties
that recognize "the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable
standard of physical and mental health."</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the government's decisions to allow imports of bone-in beef
from the U.S. and certain protein products from China have seriously endangered
public health and lives.</P>
      <P>The ceremony Thursday was held to honor Kim Seong-min, founder and CEO of Free
North Korea Radio, who was named winner of the fourth Asia Democracy and Human
Rights Awards (ADHRA), in recognition of his courage in defying the North Korean
regime.</P>
      <P>Ma said the ADHRA represents a significant transition in Taiwan, which was under
martial law 22 years ago. Restrictions on democracy and violations  of human
rights have been eliminated  through constitutional amendments and the
institution of new laws since martial law was lifted in 1987, he added.</P>
      <P>He recalled that in 2008, then U.S. President George W. Bush praised Taiwan as a
"beacon of democracy" in Asia and the world. According to Ma, the statement,
which was part of a congratulatory message to him on his election as president,
was very moving, but at the same time put a weight of responsibility on him for
Taiwan to be deserving of such praise.</P>
      <P>ADHRA was created in 2006 by the TFD, a Taiwan-based national democracy
assistance foundation, to honor individuals or groups dedicated to democratic
development, the advancement of human rights and the building of democracy.</P>
      <P>Reporters Without Borders Secretary-General Robert Menard won the first ADHRA,
while Cynthia Maung, founder of the Mae Sot clinic that provides service to
refugees and migrant workers in Myanmar, won the award in 2007, and Afghan human
rights activist Sima Samar in 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday that Taiwan is on good
terms with Japan, dismissing a Japanese daily's allegation that bilateral
relations have "abruptly frozen" since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May
2008.</P>
      <P>Describing the Asahi Shimbun report as "off-base, " Wang said the daily made its
mistake because the writer did not understand what Taiwan has done in its
efforts to cement ties with Japan.</P>
      <P>The Asahi Shimbun claimed in a Dec. 8 commentary that bilateral relations have
plummeted to a new low, evidenced by the departure of Masaki Saito, chief of the
Taipei office of the Japan Interchange Association -- Japan's de facto embassy
in Taiwan. The commentary said Saito's resignation was the result of deep
distrust between the leaderships of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Also disagreeing with the Asahi Shimbun commentary, Taiwan's representative to
Japan, John Feng, noted that the allegation only represents the stance of a
single Japanese media outlet.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan-Japan relations could not be better at present, " Feng said during a
visit to Wang at the Legislative Yuan that same day.</P>
      <P>Feng, who is in Taiwan on a business trip,  offered his appreciation for Wang's
Dec. 1 visit to Sapporo, capital of Hokkaido Prefecture, to witness the opening
of a Taiwan representative office there, the country's first new office in Japan
in 30 years.</P>
      <P>"Wang's visit and the opening of the Sapporo office were a shot in the arm in
terms of cementing bilateral ties," Feng noted.</P>
      <P>Wang told Feng that he will visit Japan again in February at the head of a group
of legislators to pay courtesy calls on party heavyweights across Japan's
political spectrum in a bid to further consolidate two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also rebutted the newspaper's
allegation, pointing out that a string of successes have been achieved in
bilateral ties this year, which it labeled "the year of special partnership
between Taiwan and Japan."</P>
      <P>So far this year, at least eight concrete achievements have been made, including
the resumption of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks after a hiatus of more than three
years, said Chen Tiao-ho, secretary-general of the Association of East Asian
Relations -- a quasi-official organization established to handle exchanges with
Japan after the two countries severed formal diplomatic relations in 1972.</P>
      <P>Other headway includes the signing of a working holiday program for young people
from the two sides, the establishment of a Taiwan cultural center in Tokyo,  the
Japan Interchange Association's financial assistance in the establishment of a
contemporary Japan research center at National Cheng Chi University in Taipei,
and the upgrading of the level of officials representing the two countries at
the annual Taiwan-Japan economic and trade conference to the level of bureau
chief, according to Chen.</P>

      <P>A proposed trade pact with China will not be negotiated, far less inked, in the
fourth round of negotiations between the two sides scheduled for later this
month, the country's top Chinese affairs official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Lai Shin-yuan told the Legislative Yuan,
however, that Taiwan's top negotiator -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) -- is expected to agree with his Chinese
counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
President Chen Yunlin, on possible talks on the signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement in their fifth round of talks.</P>
      <P>Out of respect for the legislature's power to supervise the executive branch,
Lai said, the MAC will brief the legislature thoroughly on the negotiations upon
the request of the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Huang Yu-tsai, deputy chief of the Council of Agriculture, assured
the legislature that Taiwan will not relax its animal and plant health
inspection and quarantine regulations to accommodate  Chinese products following
a proposed agricultural agreement with China.</P>
      <P>Huang said the agreement, which is expected to be concluded during the upcoming
Chiang-Chen meeting, is meant to bring the regulations of both sides into
balance and to oblige China to inform Taiwan of any disease outbreaks there.</P>
      <P>Lai and Huang made the remarks separately but almost at the same time when the
SEF announced in Taipei the details of Chen's Dec. 21-25 visit for the
negotiations that will take place in Taichung City, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The negotiations will take place Dec. 22-23, after which Chen's delegation will
tour central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The SEF said in a press release that the details were finalized by SEF Vice
Chairman Kao Koong-lian and Chinese officials in Fuzhou, southern China, earlier
that day.</P>
      <P>A Chinese delegation, led by ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong, will arrive in
Taiwan Dec. 18 to make the final arrangements for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>In response to the announcement, several pro-independence groups promised to
stage the largest demonstration ever seen in Taichung to greet the Chinese
delegation.</P>
      <P>The protest is designed to show disapproval of President Ma Ying-jeou's policy
of reconciling with China, said former Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen,
who is one of the organizers.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-cheng, another of the organizers, said he and his followers will rally
and protest wherever the Chinese delegation goes during its stay in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should ride on the momentum of economic recovery to boost its economic
growth by increasing the execution rate of a NT$500 billion (US$15.5 billion)
economic stimulus package, Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu called for all out efforts to implement the four-year public construction
program launched by the government amid the global economic downturn, saying
that the top priorities include promoting the six emerging industries and
developing the service industry to speed up the transition and upgrading of the
country's industrial base.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after listening  to a report by the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) on the present macroeconomic
situation and economic agenda.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, despite a relatively stable labor market, the
government should continue to carry out employment promotion measures to further
reduce unemployment.</P>
      <P>It should also try to eliminate investment barriers, improve the industrial
environment and pay close attention to the possible medium- and long-term impact
on commodity prices caused by hikes in international oil and raw material
prices, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In light of the significant decrease in tax revenue under the sluggish economy,
all government agencies should work together to retrench their expenses before
the end of the year, he added.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said predictions by international institutions indicate that the global
economy is bottoming out and is expected to see a positive growth in the fourth
quarter of this year, while the recovery will continue throughout next year with
a 2 percent annual growth.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should continue to promote its economic stimulus programs as planned,
given that economic recovery in this country and around the world is gradual,
while the stability of the global financial system has been affected by the
Dubai debt crisis," the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, careful attention should be paid to how the hikes in oil
and raw material prices will impact the global economic recovery and the price
of commodities, especially food.</P>
      <P>The government should make proper use of its grain stockpile to stabilize food
prices should that become necessary, it added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economy is in gradual recovery, with all economic indexes
moving up slightly, the CEPD said that private consumption expenditure
registered positive growth for the first time in the third quarter after
declining for four consecutive quarters.</P>
      <P>Positive  growth  was also seen in October  in industrial productivity, export
orders, the wholesale and retail industries and the food service industry, it
added.</P>
      <P>The economic climate flashed a green light signifying steady growth for the
first time in October, with an increase in November's consumer confidence index,
the CEPD said, adding that the country's overall exports saw positive growth in
November, even though exports to the U.S. and Japan remained in decline.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate was still high, despite drops for two consecutive months,
while negative growth was seen in the annual increase rate of average monthly
earnings, according to the CEPD.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih instructed the concerned authorities Thursday to step up
implementation of the government's four-year NT$500 billion economic stimulus
package to give greater momentum to the recovery.</P>
      <P>Wu issued the directive at a weekly Cabinet meeting, at which the Council for

economic situation.</P>
      <P>Citing forecasts by international research institutes, the CEPD said the world
economy is expected to show growth in the fourth quarter of 2009 as the global
recession bottoms out.</P>
      <P>The recovery will continue in 2010, with growth likely to register over 2
percent, the council said.</P>
      <P>A similar trend has emerged in Taiwan, with the monitoring indicator for the
country's economic activities in October finally flashing a green light, a sign
of steady economic growth, the CEPD noted.</P>
      <P>Also,  the consumer confidence index showed an upswing in November, and exports
posted year-on-year growth in November for the first time since September 2008,
according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Although  Taiwan's  unemployment  rate has dropped for two consecutive months,
it still remains high, while the average earnings of local workers have
continued to decline, the council said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the situation, Wu asked the relevant authorities to continue
providing employment assistance to the jobless to help lower the unemployment
rate.</P>
      <P>He also directed them to pursue investment deregulation so as to improve

      <P>A 2008 Nobel laureate in chemistry will deliver two keynote speeches in Taipei
to inaugurate a prestigious lecture series organized by Taiwan's leading
academic institute, Academia Sinica, according to a press statement released
Thursday by the institute.</P>
      <P>According to the press release, Roger Yonchien Tsien will make a four-day visit
to Taiwan Dec. 11-14. He will deliver the lectures, titled "Painting Cell
Signals with a Palette of Fluorescent Proteins" and "Building  Molecules  to
Image and Help Treat Cancer and Inflammatory Disease," Dec. 11 and Dec. 14,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Tsien, a professor at the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department of the
University of California, San Diego, was awarded the Nobel Prize with two other
chemists --  Martin Chalfie of Columbia University and Osamu Shimomura of Boston
University -- in recognition of their discovery and development of green
fluorescent protein (GFP).</P>
      <P>Commonly used in biology as a reporter of gene expression, Tsien and his co-
winners made unprecedented contributions to the general understanding of how GFP
fluoresces, extended the color palette beyond green, which allowed researchers
to give various proteins and cells different colors, the press release said.</P>
      <P>"The discovery of GFP has led to its widespread use as a tagging tool in
bioscience research. By using DNA technology, researchers can now use GFP as a
fluorescent marker to help better observe the movements, positions and
interactions of tagged proteins," it added.</P>
      <P>Born in New York in 1952, Tsien graduated from Harvard University with a

    <HEADLINE>Medical students, parents argue for fairness</HEADLINE>

      <P>A group of Taiwanese students who have studied medicine and obtained academic
credentials in China, along with their parents, argued for fairness Thursday at
a hearing on the government's plans to recognize academic credentials earned in
China.</P>
      <P>They voiced perplexity over the government's plans not to recognize medical
credentials earned in China but to recognize other credentials issued by Chinese
universities in other fields.</P>
      <P>Wu Pei-hsuan, a graduate of Peking University's medical school, said she had
hoped to return to Taiwan to work at a local hospital, but her plan was stymied
when she heard that her qualification would not be recognized here.</P>
      <P>"I was forced to head instead to Australia to find a job, " Wu said at the
hearing.</P>
      <P>Thursday's hearing, held in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, was the first
of 17 that the Ministry of Education (MOE) has scheduled until Dec. 23 to probe
public opinion on the ministry's recent decision to recognize academic
credentials issued by 41 top-notch universities in China and Taiwan's opening to
Chinese students seeking to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Yun-ying, whose son is studying medicine in China, said her son would prefer
to return to Taiwan to work upon graduation, but the MOE's plan has blunted his
desire to return home.</P>
      <P>"Why such unfairness?" Lin asked.</P>
      <P>Other parents who attended the hearing also expressed confusion, arguing why
Taiwanese students who study medicine in Poland and the Philippines can take
national medical examinations after returning to Taiwan, but those who have
earned diplomas in Chinese medical schools are not given such an opportunity.</P>
      <P>However, Ho Jow-fei, director of the MOE's Department of Higher Education, did
not answer their questions, saying instead that the recognition of academic
credentials issued by Chinese medical schools is a matter that falls under the
jurisdiction of the Cabinet-level Department of Health.</P>
      <P>"I will refer your opinions to the inter-agency meetings at the Executive Yuan
for further debate," Ho told the appellants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chao Tien-lin, a Kaohsiung city councilor representing the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, said at the hearing that it would be "unclear and
toothless" if the MOE stipulates only that Chinese will be barred from taking
part in Taiwan's professional and civil service examinations because "they are
neither Republic of China citizens nor foreign nationals."</P>
      <P>Chao suggested that the government make it clear in black and white that no
Chinese students or citizens will be allowed to sit tests in Taiwan for
professional  licenses  and civil service credentials.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top financial regulator and Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TWSE) have
dismissed speculations that the prices of Taiwan Depository Receipts (TDRs)
issued recently by overseas companies have been artificially jacked up.</P>
      <P>Discrepancies were seen not only in the prices of TDRs and their original shares
listed on markets outside Taiwan, but also in the prices of American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs) issued by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and
United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) and their original shares listed on local
bourse, according to Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, this is a normal phenomenon, he noted, saying that it had resulted from
discrepancies between supply and demand in each share  market  and different
valuations  of the TDR's future price-to-earning ratio.</P>
      <P>The commission will collaborate with TWSE and the Taiwan Securities Association
to develop means of easing the potential price hike of TDRs by maintaining a
balance between supply and demand, FSC Vice Chairman Wu Tang-chieh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a TWSE spokesman said that it common to raise funds by issuing
depository receipts and that the issuance of TDRs is still in its early stages.</P>
      <P>According to TWSE's statistics, as of the end of last month, five firms operated
by overseas Taiwanese businessmen -- Want Want China Holdings Ltd., Ju Teng
International Holdings Ltd., New Focus Auto Tech Holdings Ltd., Yorkey Optical
International (Cayman) Ltd., and Vietnam Manufacturing and Export Processing
Holdings Ltd. -- had raised a total of NT$7.1 billion (US$220 million) through
TDR issuances.</P>
      <P>The scale of TDR issuances is still small compared with that of the ADRs listed
by 26 companies on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ Stock Market,
which raised more than US$7.5 billion (approximately NT$250 billion) this year,
the statistics show.</P>
      <P>The ADRs issued by TSMC, UMC, Chunghwa Telecom,  Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering Inc., Siliconware Precision Industries Co., and AU Optronics Corp.
have posted price increases ranging from 1 percent to 76 percent, according to
the statistics.</P>
      <P>Since 2000, the six companies have raised US$17.4 billion (approximately
NT$565.7  billion)  through ADR issuances,  the statistics show.</P>
      <P>The issuance of DRs will help stimulate the bourses in which their original
shares are listed and could also create a price comparison effect between the
two stock markets, according to the TWSE spokesman.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies have issued DRs on markets in the United States, Luxembourg
and London, the statistics show.</P>

      <P>Responding to the growing possibility of water shortages, particularly in
southern regions, Premier Wu Den-yih has asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) to work out a comprehensive plan to deal with the worsening situation,
Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference following the Executive Yuan's regular weekly
meeting, Su said drought is a pressing issue facing both the local and central
governments -- a conclusion that President Ma Ying-jeou reached during a meeting
with the premier a day earlier.</P>
      <P>He said Wu has demanded that the MOEA hammer out a comprehensive program
involving government  agencies,  private companies  and individuals, to deal
with the problem as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Southern Taiwan could be soon suffering a water shortage and the amount of
rainfall forecast for the first quarter of next year is lower than previous
averages for the period, he said.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu has also instructed relevant government authorities
that water supplies for households and industrial use prior to the next year's
rainy season must be secured and that they should call one or two meetings every
month to monitor the water supply situation, Su added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chianan irrigation association announced that same day that some
18,000 hectares of rice paddy in the Chianan area of Chiayi and Tainan counties
will be left fallow for the first harvest next year due to the emerging dry
spell.</P>
      <P>The decision was made a day earlier by the South Water Resources Bureau under
the MOEA's Water Resources Agency to ensure the provision of water for
households and industrial use at least until the end of May next year,
association officials explained.</P>
      <P>The move will be the sixth of its kind since the Tsengwen Reservoir in Tainan
County started operating in 1975, and its impact will not be inconsequential,
they noted.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Tsengwen and nearby Wusanto reservoirs have a
total capacity of about 200 million cubic meters, but the two facilities have
been seriously silted by mud washed down by Typhoon Morakot, which lashed
southern Taiwan in August.</P>
      <P>Since that time, no rain has fallen in the Tainan area and the two reservoirs
have not taken in any more water, making the water supply in the region even
more difficult, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Water Resources Agency Director-General Yang Wei-fu said early this month that
water rationing might be imposed by the end of February if no rain falls in the
months between now and next spring.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been affected by a looming drought since the beginning of this year,
except for August, when Morakot hit the country, according to a climate change
monitoring center at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>During the first 10 months, it rained on only 52 days, some 90 days fewer than
the average level, the center said.</P>
      <P>The precipitation brought by Morakot to southern Taiwan, the highest level in
history, underscored a sharp change in rainfall patterns as a result of climate
extremes, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposed taxation agreement with China expected to be signed during the fourth
round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks later this month will protect Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China, lower the burden on taxpayers and increase the
government's tax revenues in the long run, Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee also gave an assurance  that  information  on neither individuals nor
companies will be revealed during tax information exchanges between the two
sides, in line with international tax treaty protocols. Such information will
only be supplied when there is a specific need for tax inspection in cases of
major tax evasion, he added.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a session at the Legislative Yuan in which legislators
voiced concern that the taxation agreement might enable China  to obtain  more
financial  information  about Taiwanese businessmen  operating there,  which
could affect their future operations.</P>
      <P>Lee said the agreement closely follows guidelines set forth by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations in their
model tax convention documents. Taiwan has signed similar tax treaties with 16
countries.</P>
      <P>Among those 16 countries, Lee said, there have been only eight cases of tax
information exchange -- all of them in relation to major tax evasion or
avoidance -- in the past five years, with four cases initiated by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said it would be impossible for either side to send officials across the
strait to conduct tax inspections.</P>
      <P>The taxation agreement will cover issues such as the taxation rights of each
government, the avoidance of double taxation and mutual assistance on taxation
matters. In recent talks, both sides have reached consensus on most of the
contents of the agreement, including tax allocation and exchange of tax
information.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that all cross-strait agreements, including the
taxation one, must be open and transparent to the public, and must be reviewed
and approved by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee said that without the taxation agreement, the two sides can hide their
incomes from each other, causing a lot of unfairness, and that the agreement
will help improve information transparency and better protect Taiwanese
businessmen working in China.</P>
      <P>In the long term, the agreement could also help attract more Chinese corporate
investment into Taiwan, further increasing the government's tax revenues, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>The agreement will also ensure that Taiwanese workers who stay for less than 183
days per year in China will only have to pay taxes on their salaries received in
China to the Chinese government rather than suffering double taxation.</P>
      <P>There are about 1 million Taiwanese people working in China, who mostly allocate
a larger portion of their income to be received in Taiwan so they can enjoy the
country's lower income tax rate.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the amount of Taiwanese investment in China is far bigger than
the amount of Chinese investment in Taiwan, the Chinese government will need to
give up its taxation right or apply lower tax rates for some of its income after
the agreement takes effect.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's net tax revenue for the first 11 months of this year totaled NT$1.43
trillion, representing a 14.6 percent drop from the same period of last year,
according to the latest statistics released by the ministry Thursday.</P>
      <P>The fourth and latest round of cross-strait talks between Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, and Chen Yunlin, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, is scheduled to take place
in Taichung City Dec. 22-23.</P>
      <P>The negotiations will mainly focus on four issues -- fishery cooperation,
avoidance  of double  taxation,  examination  and certification of standards and
the inspection and quarantine of agricultural products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should boost domestic consumption, investment: economist</HEADLINE>

      <P>As economies around the world are undergoing structural reshuffles, Taiwan
should seek to restructure its economy by boosting domestic consumption and
investment, Liu Yi-ju, chief economics consultant to the Chinatrust Financial
Holding Co. said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu said at a forum on economic prospects for 2010 that Taiwan has been
marginalized for some time in the process of regional economic integration. With
the improvements in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, however, the country now has
the chance to reverse the situation, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>She added, however, that should Taiwan fail to grasp the opportunity for change,
it will remain in the back seat in terms of economic growth next year.</P>
      <P>Stressing Taiwan's advantages of talent and solid infrastructure for industrial
development, Liu said it is possible for Taiwan to return to the international
stage in terms of economics and trade, even though many international
enterprises which have been focusing on China had abandoned Taiwan over the past
few years.</P>
      <P>She suggested that Taiwan should try to lure international capital in addition
to its efforts to attract Chinese investors.</P>
      <P>The economist, a former advisor to the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said that instead of relying on exports to boost the economy,
Taiwan should shift its focus from foreign trade to domestic consumption and
investment.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's economic growth in the past relied heavily on exports and foreign
reserves from trade surplus, the trade surplus accounted for only 4 percent to 8
percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>On the other hand, domestic consumption accounted for 60 percent of the GDP,
while domestic investment and government expenditure together accounted for more
than 30 percent, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>"It is as if a family is relying heavily on the youngest kid working at a fast
food stand to earn the household's bread, while the elder brothers are idle,"
Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Since the fast food stand has folded, it is time for all the brothers to do
their shares of the work," Liu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday: COMMERCIAL TIMES What if 'unequitable taxation" was an option in poll
on public grievances?</P>
      <P>Acting  on Premier  Wu Den-yi's  directive,  the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC) recently conducted an online survey to identify the
"top 10 public grievances," and found that exorbitant housing prices in urban
areas was at the top of the list.</P>
      <P>However, the respondents were given 15 pre-selected options from which to chose,
which means that the survey results might not be fully reflective of the whole
picture.</P>
      <P>We wonder whether the main grievances would have been different if "unequitable
taxation" was included on the RDEC-proposed list.</P>
      <P>Unequitable taxation has been relatively less frequently discussed because tax
issues can be very technical and the public tends be insufficiently informed
about the details.</P>
      <P>Only through academic research papers have we learned that eight of the 40
richest people in Taiwan, who each had annual incomes of over NT$100 million in
2002, did not have to pay any income tax that year, and that average wage
earners contribute more than 70 percent to the government's annual tax revenues.</P>
      <P>It was not until early this year when the government lowered the inheritance and
gift tax rates to 10 percent that we realized only 5 percent of local taxpayers
-- particularly the 200 most wealthy people who were originally subject to a 50
percent tax rate -- had benefited from the new measure.</P>
      <P>During a recent inspection tour of the Ministry of Finance, some Control Yuan
members took ministry officials to task over the lowering of the inheritance and
gift tax rate and what they said was the country's unusually low rate of capital
gain tax. In our view, finance officials have failed to give any convincing
explanations about the two issues.</P>
      <P>We are not opposed to the government's efforts to determine the main sources of
public grievances through opinion polls. But we suggest that "unequitable
taxation" be included on the list next time such a survey is conducted. ECONOMIC
DAILY NEWS: Policy initiatives most needed to rev up economy</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has vowed to improve the macro environment after the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) suffered a setback in the Dec. 5 local elections.</P>
      <P>Ma also recognizes that "revving up the economy" is an effective short-cut to
improving the macro economy.</P>
      <P>If he wants such endeavors to help boost the KMT's showing in next year's
elections  of the mayors of the country's  five municipalities, then his
administration should present the meat of its policy incentives as soon as
possible and take action with full vigor and urgency.</P>
      <P>However, there is irony in the government's budget plan for the coming year.</P>
      <P>At a time when most world powers are adopting  expansion strategies to sustain
economic growth in the wake of the year-long global recession, Taiwan seems to
be joining the ranks of the first group of countries that have ended their
stimulus measures.</P>
      <P>According to the 2010 budget plan, the government's regular budget and special
budget will both fall short of this year's amounts, while public investment will
also contract.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan does not want to see itself knocked out at a time when the global
economy is on the track of slow recovery, the Ma administration should correct
such flawed budget planning, come up with well-devised policy initiatives and
act resolutely to accelerate economic growth. CHINA TIMES Legislative speaker's
temper should have flared earlier</P>
      <P>The even-tempered Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng finally lost his cool
Monday when opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers again
paralyzed the legislature by besieging the speaker's podium to protest the
government's decision to relax restrictions on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which holds 27 of the legislature's 113 seats, has managed to disrupt
legislative floor meetings for more than one month over the U.S. beef import
issue.</P>
      <P>Wang angrily criticized the DPP legislators' boycott strategy, describing it as
"very, very inappropriate" and "senseless."</P>
      <P>Wang has reason to blast the DPP, but we must remind him that the ruling
Kuomintang should also be blamed for the Legislature's poor efficiency.</P>
      <P>People on the street are entitled to ask why the KMT, with more than 90
legislative seats, has been unable to pass legislation that is critical to the
implementation of the government's policies.</P>
      <P>Some KMT lawmakers like to ridicule President and KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou over
what they call his incompetence, but they should be aware that one of the
reasons behind Ma's fading popularity is his administration's inefficiency, as
many of his policy initiatives and reform programs are shelved in the
Legislature.</P>
      <P>If KMT lawmakers sit idly and let the DPP hold up the legislative proceedings
over the beef trade issue, it will be a no-win situation for both parties. APPLE
DAILY New appointment epitomizes Ma's reform commitment</P>
      <P>Ma's surprise appointment of his most trusted confidant, King Pu-tsung, as
secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang, sends a clear message that he will
continue streamlining the KMT monolith in line with the principles of "integrity
and capability."</P>
      <P>King and Ma share some common features in their characters. Both are
characterized by a strong moral ethos, self-motivation and drive, and political
cleanliness. King is a bit more smart and shrewd and takes comfort in playing
the role of a behind-the-scenes strategist and adviser.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the duo have developed a close partnership. During Ma's tenure as
Taipei mayor, King served as his door-guard in his capacity as deputy mayor,
helping to steer away many filthy politicians and shady political deals and
thereby allowing Ma to maintain his clean image.</P>
      <P>We are pleased to see that Ma remains committed to reforming the KMT after the
party suffered its election setback. Should that continue to be the case, we
hope Ma will delegate full power to King so that he can wipe out the party's old
guard with their shady criminal backgrounds. UNITED DAILY NEWS Can King Pu-tsung
change KMT culture?</P>
      <P>Some KMT lawmakers' strong reaction to Ma's appointment of King Pu-tsung as new
KMT secretary-general signals how challenging and tough his new role will be.</P>
      <P>As the KMT once ruled Taiwan uninterruptedly for more than five decades until
2000, its ranks are rife with the "sitting on a palanquin culture" -- with its
politicians used to passively waiting for other people to pave the way for them
to harvest their rewards and few willing to blaze a trail to explore new
frontiers.</P>
      <P>Only if King, with his resourcefulness and activism, can infuse new spirit into
the KMT apparatus, will Ma's pledge to overhaul the century-old party be
realized. LIBERTY TIMES No-one is an idiot</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi is wrong to describe independence advocates as "idiots."</P>
      <P>The majority of Taiwanese people do not want to be unified with China and a
series of public opinion surveys have repeatedly confirmed this.</P>
      <P>This is why the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has to wrap up its
ultimate goal of unifying Taiwan with China in the guise of signing a cross-
strait economic cooperation framework agreement, which will eventually integrate
both sides into a "one China" market.</P>
      <P>With such a scenario looming, advocating independence is a wise and responsible
strategy. According to the San Francisco Peace Treaty, Taiwan's sovereignty
belongs to the people of Taiwan. Local people should stand up to safeguard this
independent status quo and work even harder to make it a normal country.</P>

      <P>The fourth round of talks between the chief cross-Taiwan Strait negotiators on
each side -- Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung and Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) President Chen Yunlin -- will be held Dec. 22 in Taichung, the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the meeting will be to sign four cross-strait agreements
regarding  fishing  crew  cooperation,  agricultural quarantine inspection,
industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of
double taxation.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to arrive in the central city Dec. 21, according to an
itinerary released by the MAC.</P>
      <P>A seminar on Chinese investment in Taiwan will be held Dec. 23 on the sidelines
of the talks, after which Chen and his delegation will tour Taichung's
peripheral areas, including the popular tourist attraction of Sun Moon Lake,
before returning to Beijing Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun, there are no arrangements for Chen
to attend banquets hosted by political parties or businessmen during his visit.</P>
      <P>However, MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan will meet Chen Dec. 22 in Taichung, Liu
said, adding that there will also be a meeting between Chen and Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu on an as-yet undetermined date.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Chao Chien-min, another MAC vice chairman, said there are no
plans by the Taichung city government to set up a protest zone during the talks.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party had earlier
announced a plan to hold a demonstration in Taichung Dec. 20 to voice their
objections to the proposed signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement with China.</P>
      <P>In addition, more than 10 DPP-leaning groups in central Taiwan will also hold
protests during Chen's visit.</P>

Lu Chia-chen for the government to come up with measures to help market local
products via expanded distribution channels as the proposed signing of an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China could have a negative
impact on some traditional industries.</P>
      <P>Once the ECFA is signed, products made by traditional industries in China will
enjoy tariff-free entry into Taiwan's market, which will lead to an influx of
cheap substandard goods from China and severely hurt local industries, Lu said
at a legislative session.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Taiwanese products are of high quality, so the government
should work to expand the distribution channels for local products in
anticipation of cutthroat competition after the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Lai admitted that product distribution has long been a big problem for small-
and medium-sized enterprises and that traditional industries have expressed
concern over the issue several times over the past six years.</P>
      <P>In addition to the MAC, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also agreed with the
proposal to set up stores specifically for Taiwanese goods, Lu added.</P>
      <P>To ease the potential impact of the ECFA, the MOEA plans to earmark NT$95
billion (US$2.94 billion) over the next 10 years to assist Taiwanese industries
affected by the ECFA to enhance or transform their operations, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, a number of representatives from Taiwan's top 10 traditional
industries, including towel, bedding,  footwear, underwear, garment, sock,
leather and ceramic manufacturers, rallied in front of the Legislative Yuan to
protest against the ECFA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty years after a demonstration in Kaohsiung  turned  into  a brutal
confrontation  between  the pro-democracy opposition and the authorities Dec.
10, 1979, the Kaohsiung city government is sponsoring a series of commemorative
activities to mark the struggle for democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, one of the opposition activists who attended the rally
in front of the Kaohsiung headquarters of Formosa Magazine and who was arrested
and jailed for several years for her part in the Formosa Incident, or Kaohsiung
Incident as it is known internationally, visited an exhibition of photos and
archives at the former headquarters of the magazine Thursday.</P>
      <P>Looking back over the past 30 years, Chen said she had mixed feelings about the
incident and the years that followed, since it was the first time she had
stepped into the building that housed the magazine.</P>
      <P>Formosa Magazine was created in the summer of 1979 by a group of people calling
for an end to the martial law and demanding democratic elections and the lifting
of a ban on unauthorized newspapers and political parties.</P>
      <P>The incident was sparked when magazine staff and opposition politicians held a
rally to mark World Human Rights Day in Kaohsiung under tight police
surveillance.</P>
      <P>Lamenting the fleeting 30 years, Chen said she was grateful toward the land that
nourished the aspirations for democracy and freedom, toward the people who came
to their protection and defense when they were under trial, and toward the
families of those jailed, for their understanding and support.</P>
      <P>Some of the Formosa comrades, like the late Legislator Huang Hsin- chieh, have
died and some have taken different paths, Chen went on, adding that she honors
the decisions of those who declined to take part in the commemorative
activities.</P>
      <P>Former Chairman of the Democratic  Progressive  Party Shih Ming-teh, for
instance, refused to attend, while former President Chen Shui-bian, who as a
young lawyer represented some of those put on trial by the KMT following the
incident, is in detention, conducting an appeal against his life sentence for
graft and corruption.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government and various civic groups started the commemorative
program in mid-November, including seminars, a photo and archive exhibition, a
concert, a symposium and a mass rally slated for Dec. 12 in downtown Kaohsiung.</P>

      <P>Chinese Taipei took three gold and two silver medals in the tennis event and one
silver in the cycling event at the East Asian Games in Hong Kong Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan swept the board in the mixed doubles final, which saw Chuang Chia-jung
and Yi Chu-huan edge out compatriots Hsieh Su-wei and Lee Hsin-han 6-3, 6-7, 7-5
to win gold, leaving silver for Hsieh and Lee.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, Chuang and Hsieh won gold in the women's doubles after
defeating South Korea's Kim Song Jung and Lee Jin A in straight sets 6-0, 6-3.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Chang Kai Chen pulled off the women's singles title after coming from
behind to beat China's Zhang Shuai 4-6, 7-6, 6-2.</P>
      <P>In the men's doubles final, Taiwan's Li Chu-huan and Lee Hsin-han lost to
China's Zeng Shao-xuan and Zhang Ze 4-6, 6-7, 4-7 to win silver.</P>
      <P>However, the result was not a satisfactory one for Taiwan's tennis players, as
they failed to beat their own record of four gold medals won at the last East
Asian Games in Macau in 2005.</P>
      <P>Chen Nan, chief coach of Taiwan's national tennis team for international
competitions, said the games were merely seen as a warm up for the 2010 Asian
Games in Guangzhou, China.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Taiwanese cyclist Huang Ho-hsun finished second in the Individual
Road Race for Women, winning Taiwan's second silver medal in the cycling events.
China's Liu Xiahui won gold.</P>
      <P>At the close of Thursday's competition, Taiwan ranked fifth among the nine
states and regions taking part in the games, with six golds, 22 silvers and 20
bronzes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government collected NT$146.4 billion (US$4.53 billion) in net tax
revenues in November, up 9 percent from the same month of the previous year --
the first year-on-year rise since March, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, for the first 11 months of this year, the government garnered NT$1.43
trillion in tax revenue, a decrease of NT$243.4 billion, or 14.6 percent year-
on-year, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Hit by the global economic downturn, Taiwan's net tax revenue in the 11 month-
period posted the largest annual decrease in the country's history.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-chen, the ministry's statistics chief, said that the 11-month tax revenue
accounted for 80 percent of the budgeted NT$1.7844 trillion -- which was also
the lowest rate for the same period in recorded history.</P>
      <P>Income tax revenue --  including corporate income tax and individual
comprehensive income tax revenue -- amounted to NT$613.6 billion in the 11
months, recording a year-on-year decline of NT$191.7 billion, or 23.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Income tax revenue, which was affected most by the economic downturn, accounts
for almost 50 percent of the country's total tax revenues.</P>
      <P>Tax offices collected NT$45.8 billion in business turnover tax last month -- the
highest level in a year, up 4.9 percent from the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Land value tax, which the government just began collecting from November,
reached NT$36 billion, up 17.9 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Commodity tax revenue increased by 84.6 percent to NT$11.4 billion in November,
while the share transaction tax revenue of NT$8.2 billion represented a rise of
112 percent, according to MOF statistics.</P>
      <P>With the economy starting to recover, some tax categories started to show
revenue improvements, said Lin, adding that the monthly commodity tax revenue
has been standing above NT$10 billion for the past six months, while the share
transaction tax revenue increased by 10.2 percent, to total NT$94.4 billion for
the 11 months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Carbon emission reduction efforts pay off at schools</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
12/10/09  22:22:31

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government efforts to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions have paid off at
schools and universities, with the campaign helping to save over NT$700 million
(US$21.54 million) in electricity costs at educational institutions around the
country last year.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Education (MOE) , 312 universities and colleges, as
well as 248 senior high schools and 59 junior high and elementary schools, have
been taking part in a carbon reduction campaign since 2007.</P>
      <P>Comparing the schools' combined consumption levels in 2008 with the figure
recorded for 2006,  they consumed  about 7.8 less electricity last year than
they did in 2006, representing savings of more than NT$700 million in
electricity costs, according to MOE statistics.</P>
      <P>Among all the participating schools, vocational senior high schools scored the
highest rate of 12.31 percent in slashing carbon emissions, followed by colleges
and universities, which recorded an 8.03 percent reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions, an environmental protection task force under the MOE said.</P>
      <P>Senior high schools posted a reduction rate of 7.23 percent, ahead of junior
high schools with 6.54 percent and elementary schools with 6.07 percent, it went
on.</P>
      <P>The MOE hopes that all the country's schools and colleges will achieve an
average electricity use reduction of 7 percent per year by 2015, it added.</P>
      <P>Chang Zih-chao, executive secretary of the MOE task force, ascribed inadequate
measures and ageing lighting or air conditioning equipment to some schools'
failure to cut electricity use.</P>
      <P>The MOE will allocate more budget to help these schools phase out their
inefficient equipment in the coming years, he added.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University was among the 13 green universities selected this year by the
MOE for their outstanding performance in cutting back electricity consumption on
their campuses.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University  has slashed some 4.6 percent off its electricity  use this
year,  saving it some NT$19 million in electricity costs.</P>
      <P>Wei Jung-chung, head of the privately run university's general affairs
department,  said it is very important  to build  a carbon-reducing concept
among students.</P>
      <P>Wei said students have to pay for the lights if they want to play basketball or
tennis on school facilities. At the same time, devices are installed in
classrooms' air conditioning units and lamps so that they switch off
automatically at the end of the class and switch on 10 minutes before the next
one starts, he explained.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, however, public universities such as National Taiwan
University, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology and
Taichung University of Education (TUE) were more effective than their private
counterparts  in cutting back on electricity during the 2007-2008 period, Wei
said.</P>
      <P>The top 21 public universities succeeded in reducing about a total of 15,000
metric tons of greenhouse gas -- equivalent to a saving of NT$44 million in
electricity costs, he noted.</P>
      <P>Yi Cheng-ming, general affairs department director at the TUE, pointed out that
in addition to installing automated devices to regulate electricity use, it is
of maximum importance to raise carbon reduction awareness among students.</P>
      <P>To this end, the TUE has personnel periodically patrol the campus to persuade
students not to waste electricity, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposed taxation agreement with China expected to be signed during the fourth
round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks later this month will protect Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China, lower the burden on taxpayers and increase the
government's tax revenues in the long run, Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee also gave an assurance  that  information  on neither individuals nor
companies will be revealed during tax information exchanges between the two
sides, in line with international tax treaty protocols. Such information will
only be supplied when there is a specific need for tax inspection in cases of
major tax evasion, he added.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a session at the Legislative Yuan in which legislators
voiced concern that the taxation agreement might enable China  to obtain  more
financial  information  about Taiwanese businessmen  operating there,  which
could affect their future operations.</P>
      <P>Lee said the agreement closely follows guidelines set forth by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations in their
model tax convention documents. Taiwan has signed similar tax treaties with 16
countries.</P>
      <P>Among those 16 countries, Lee said, there have been only eight cases of tax
information exchange -- all of them in relation to major tax evasion or
avoidance -- in the past five years, with four cases initiated by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said it would be impossible for either side to send officials across the
strait to conduct tax inspections.</P>
      <P>The taxation agreement will cover issues such as the taxation rights of each
government, the avoidance of double taxation and mutual assistance on taxation
matters. In recent talks, both sides have reached consensus on most of the
contents of the agreement, including tax allocation and exchange of tax
information.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has said that all cross-strait agreements, including the
taxation one, must be open and transparent to the public, and must be reviewed
and approved by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee said that without the taxation agreement, the two sides can hide their
incomes from each other, causing a lot of unfairness, and that the agreement
will help improve information transparency and better protect Taiwanese
businessmen working in China.</P>
      <P>In the long term, the agreement could also help attract more Chinese corporate
investment into Taiwan, further increasing the government's tax revenues, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>The agreement will also ensure that Taiwanese workers who stay for less than 183
days per year in China will only have to pay taxes on their salaries received in
China to the Chinese government rather than suffering double taxation.</P>
      <P>There are about 1 million Taiwanese people working in China, who mostly allocate
a larger portion of their income to be received in Taiwan so they can enjoy the
country's lower income tax rate.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the amount of Taiwanese investment in China is far bigger than
the amount of Chinese investment in Taiwan, the Chinese government will need to
give up its taxation right or apply lower tax rates for some of its income after
the agreement takes effect.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's net tax revenue for the first 11 months of this year totaled NT$1.43
trillion, representing a 14.6 percent drop from the same period of last year,
according to the latest statistics released by the ministry Thursday.</P>
      <P>The fourth and latest round of cross-strait talks between Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, and Chen Yunlin, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, is scheduled to take place
in Taichung City Dec. 22-23.</P>
      <P>The negotiations will mainly focus on four issues -- fishery cooperation,
avoidance  of double  taxation,  examination  and certification of standards and
the inspection and quarantine of agricultural products.</P>

      <P>As economies around the world are undergoing structural reshuffles, Taiwan
should seek to restructure its economy by boosting domestic consumption and
investment, Liu Yi-ju, chief economics consultant to the Chinatrust Financial
Holding Co. said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu said at a forum on economic prospects for 2010 that Taiwan has been
marginalized for some time in the process of regional economic integration. With
the improvements in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, however, the country now has
the chance to reverse the situation, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>She added, however, that should Taiwan fail to grasp the opportunity for change,
it will remain in the back seat in terms of economic growth next year.</P>
      <P>Stressing Taiwan's advantages of talent and solid infrastructure for industrial
development, Liu said it is possible for Taiwan to return to the international
stage in terms of economics and trade, even though many international
enterprises which have been focusing on China had abandoned Taiwan over the past
few years.</P>
      <P>She suggested that Taiwan should try to lure international capital in addition
to its efforts to attract Chinese investors.</P>
      <P>The economist, a former advisor to the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said that instead of relying on exports to boost the economy,
Taiwan should shift its focus from foreign trade to domestic consumption and
investment.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's economic growth in the past relied heavily on exports and foreign
reserves from trade surplus, the trade surplus accounted for only 4 percent to 8
percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>On the other hand, domestic consumption accounted for 60 percent of the GDP,
while domestic investment and government expenditure together accounted for more
than 30 percent, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>"It is as if a family is relying heavily on the youngest kid working at a fast
food stand to earn the household's bread, while the elder brothers are idle,"
Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Since the fast food stand has folded, it is time for all the brothers to do
their shares of the work," Liu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials
Thursday: COMMERCIAL TIMES What if 'unequitable taxation" was an option in poll
on public grievances?</P>
      <P>Acting  on Premier  Wu Den-yi's  directive,  the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission (RDEC) recently conducted an online survey to identify the
"top 10 public grievances," and found that exorbitant housing prices in urban
areas was at the top of the list.</P>
      <P>However, the respondents were given 15 pre-selected options from which to chose,
which means that the survey results might not be fully reflective of the whole
picture.</P>
      <P>We wonder whether the main grievances would have been different if "unequitable
taxation" was included on the RDEC-proposed list.</P>
      <P>Unequitable taxation has been relatively less frequently discussed because tax
issues can be very technical and the public tends be insufficiently informed
about the details.</P>
      <P>Only through academic research papers have we learned that eight of the 40
richest people in Taiwan, who each had annual incomes of over NT$100 million in
2002, did not have to pay any income tax that year, and that average wage
earners contribute more than 70 percent to the government's annual tax revenues.</P>
      <P>It was not until early this year when the government lowered the inheritance and
gift tax rates to 10 percent that we realized only 5 percent of local taxpayers
-- particularly the 200 most wealthy people who were originally subject to a 50
percent tax rate -- had benefited from the new measure.</P>
      <P>During a recent inspection tour of the Ministry of Finance, some Control Yuan
members took ministry officials to task over the lowering of the inheritance and
gift tax rate and what they said was the country's unusually low rate of capital
gain tax. In our view, finance officials have failed to give any convincing
explanations about the two issues.</P>
      <P>We are not opposed to the government's efforts to determine the main sources of
public grievances through opinion polls. But we suggest that "unequitable
taxation" be included on the list next time such a survey is conducted. ECONOMIC
DAILY NEWS: Policy initiatives most needed to rev up economy</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has vowed to improve the macro environment after the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) suffered a setback in the Dec. 5 local elections.</P>
      <P>Ma also recognizes that "revving up the economy" is an effective short-cut to
improving the macro economy.</P>
      <P>If he wants such endeavors to help boost the KMT's showing in next year's
elections  of the mayors of the country's  five municipalities, then his
administration should present the meat of its policy incentives as soon as
possible and take action with full vigor and urgency.</P>
      <P>However, there is irony in the government's budget plan for the coming year.</P>
      <P>At a time when most world powers are adopting  expansion strategies to sustain
economic growth in the wake of the year-long global recession, Taiwan seems to
be joining the ranks of the first group of countries that have ended their
stimulus measures.</P>
      <P>According to the 2010 budget plan, the government's regular budget and special
budget will both fall short of this year's amounts, while public investment will
also contract.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan does not want to see itself knocked out at a time when the global
economy is on the track of slow recovery, the Ma administration should correct
such flawed budget planning, come up with well-devised policy initiatives and
act resolutely to accelerate economic growth. CHINA TIMES Legislative speaker's
temper should have flared earlier</P>
      <P>The even-tempered Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng finally lost his cool
Monday when opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers again
paralyzed the legislature by besieging the speaker's podium to protest the
government's decision to relax restrictions on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which holds 27 of the legislature's 113 seats, has managed to disrupt
legislative floor meetings for more than one month over the U.S. beef import
issue.</P>
      <P>Wang angrily criticized the DPP legislators' boycott strategy, describing it as
"very, very inappropriate" and "senseless."</P>
      <P>Wang has reason to blast the DPP, but we must remind him that the ruling
Kuomintang should also be blamed for the Legislature's poor efficiency.</P>
      <P>People on the street are entitled to ask why the KMT, with more than 90
legislative seats, has been unable to pass legislation that is critical to the
implementation of the government's policies.</P>
      <P>Some KMT lawmakers like to ridicule President and KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou over
what they call his incompetence, but they should be aware that one of the
reasons behind Ma's fading popularity is his administration's inefficiency, as
many of his policy initiatives and reform programs are shelved in the
Legislature.</P>
      <P>If KMT lawmakers sit idly and let the DPP hold up the legislative proceedings
over the beef trade issue, it will be a no-win situation for both parties. APPLE
DAILY New appointment epitomizes Ma's reform commitment</P>
      <P>Ma's surprise appointment of his most trusted confidant, King Pu-tsung, as
secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang, sends a clear message that he will
continue streamlining the KMT monolith in line with the principles of "integrity
and capability."</P>
      <P>King and Ma share some common features in their characters. Both are
characterized by a strong moral ethos, self-motivation and drive, and political
cleanliness. King is a bit more smart and shrewd and takes comfort in playing
the role of a behind-the-scenes strategist and adviser.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the duo have developed a close partnership. During Ma's tenure as
Taipei mayor, King served as his door-guard in his capacity as deputy mayor,
helping to steer away many filthy politicians and shady political deals and
thereby allowing Ma to maintain his clean image.</P>
      <P>We are pleased to see that Ma remains committed to reforming the KMT after the
party suffered its election setback. Should that continue to be the case, we
hope Ma will delegate full power to King so that he can wipe out the party's old
guard with their shady criminal backgrounds. UNITED DAILY NEWS Can King Pu-tsung
change KMT culture?</P>
      <P>Some KMT lawmakers' strong reaction to Ma's appointment of King Pu-tsung as new
KMT secretary-general signals how challenging and tough his new role will be.</P>
      <P>As the KMT once ruled Taiwan uninterruptedly for more than five decades until
2000, its ranks are rife with the "sitting on a palanquin culture" -- with its
politicians used to passively waiting for other people to pave the way for them
to harvest their rewards and few willing to blaze a trail to explore new
frontiers.</P>
      <P>Only if King, with his resourcefulness and activism, can infuse new spirit into
the KMT apparatus, will Ma's pledge to overhaul the century-old party be
realized. LIBERTY TIMES No-one is an idiot</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi is wrong to describe independence advocates as "idiots."</P>
      <P>The majority of Taiwanese people do not want to be unified with China and a
series of public opinion surveys have repeatedly confirmed this.</P>
      <P>This is why the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has to wrap up its
ultimate goal of unifying Taiwan with China in the guise of signing a cross-
strait economic cooperation framework agreement, which will eventually integrate
both sides into a "one China" market.</P>
      <P>With such a scenario looming, advocating independence is a wise and responsible
strategy. According to the San Francisco Peace Treaty, Taiwan's sovereignty
belongs to the people of Taiwan. Local people should stand up to safeguard this
independent status quo and work even harder to make it a normal country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between the chief cross-Taiwan Strait negotiators on
each side -- Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung and Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) President Chen Yunlin -- will be held Dec. 22 in Taichung, the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the meeting will be to sign four cross-strait agreements
regarding  fishing  crew  cooperation,  agricultural quarantine inspection,
industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of
double taxation.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to arrive in the central city Dec. 21, according to an
itinerary released by the MAC.</P>
      <P>A seminar on Chinese investment in Taiwan will be held Dec. 23 on the sidelines
of the talks, after which Chen and his delegation will tour Taichung's
peripheral areas, including the popular tourist attraction of Sun Moon Lake,
before returning to Beijing Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun, there are no arrangements for Chen
to attend banquets hosted by political parties or businessmen during his visit.</P>
      <P>However, MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan will meet Chen Dec. 22 in Taichung, Liu
said, adding that there will also be a meeting between Chen and Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu on an as-yet undetermined date.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Chao Chien-min, another MAC vice chairman, said there are no
plans by the Taichung city government to set up a protest zone during the talks.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party had earlier
announced a plan to hold a demonstration in Taichung Dec. 20 to voice their
objections to the proposed signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement with China.</P>
      <P>In addition, more than 10 DPP-leaning groups in central Taiwan will also hold
protests during Chen's visit.</P>

      <P>The government will help set up stores dedicated to selling Taiwanese products
in order to solve the product distribution  difficulties that local
manufacturers  could face following the signing of a proposed free trade pact
with China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Lai Shin-yuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the promise in response to a call by ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator
Lu Chia-chen for the government to come up with measures to help market local
products via expanded distribution channels as the proposed signing of an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China could have a negative
impact on some traditional industries.</P>
      <P>Once the ECFA is signed, products made by traditional industries in China will
enjoy tariff-free entry into Taiwan's market, which will lead to an influx of
cheap substandard goods from China and severely hurt local industries, Lu said
at a legislative session.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Taiwanese products are of high quality, so the government
should work to expand the distribution channels for local products in
anticipation of cutthroat competition after the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>Lai admitted that product distribution has long been a big problem for small-
and medium-sized enterprises and that traditional industries have expressed
concern over the issue several times over the past six years.</P>
      <P>In addition to the MAC, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also agreed with the
proposal to set up stores specifically for Taiwanese goods, Lu added.</P>
      <P>To ease the potential impact of the ECFA, the MOEA plans to earmark NT$95
billion (US$2.94 billion) over the next 10 years to assist Taiwanese industries
affected by the ECFA to enhance or transform their operations, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, a number of representatives from Taiwan's top 10 traditional
industries, including towel, bedding,  footwear, underwear, garment, sock,
leather and ceramic manufacturers, rallied in front of the Legislative Yuan to
protest against the ECFA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty years after a demonstration in Kaohsiung  turned  into  a brutal
confrontation  between  the pro-democracy opposition and the authorities Dec.
10, 1979, the Kaohsiung city government is sponsoring a series of commemorative
activities to mark the struggle for democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, one of the opposition activists who attended the rally
in front of the Kaohsiung headquarters of Formosa Magazine and who was arrested
and jailed for several years for her part in the Formosa Incident, or Kaohsiung
Incident as it is known internationally, visited an exhibition of photos and
archives at the former headquarters of the magazine Thursday.</P>
      <P>Looking back over the past 30 years, Chen said she had mixed feelings about the
incident and the years that followed, since it was the first time she had
stepped into the building that housed the magazine.</P>
      <P>Formosa Magazine was created in the summer of 1979 by a group of people calling
for an end to the martial law and demanding democratic elections and the lifting
of a ban on unauthorized newspapers and political parties.</P>
      <P>The incident was sparked when magazine staff and opposition politicians held a
rally to mark World Human Rights Day in Kaohsiung under tight police
surveillance.</P>
      <P>Lamenting the fleeting 30 years, Chen said she was grateful toward the land that
nourished the aspirations for democracy and freedom, toward the people who came
to their protection and defense when they were under trial, and toward the
families of those jailed, for their understanding and support.</P>
      <P>Some of the Formosa comrades, like the late Legislator Huang Hsin- chieh, have
died and some have taken different paths, Chen went on, adding that she honors
the decisions of those who declined to take part in the commemorative
activities.</P>
      <P>Former Chairman of the Democratic  Progressive  Party Shih Ming-teh, for
instance, refused to attend, while former President Chen Shui-bian, who as a
young lawyer represented some of those put on trial by the KMT following the
incident, is in detention, conducting an appeal against his life sentence for
graft and corruption.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government and various civic groups started the commemorative
program in mid-November, including seminars, a photo and archive exhibition, a
concert, a symposium and a mass rally slated for Dec. 12 in downtown Kaohsiung.</P>

      <P>Chinese Taipei took three gold and two silver medals in the tennis event and one
silver in the cycling event at the East Asian Games in Hong Kong Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan swept the board in the mixed doubles final, which saw Chuang Chia-jung
and Yi Chu-huan edge out compatriots Hsieh Su-wei and Lee Hsin-han 6-3, 6-7, 7-5
to win gold, leaving silver for Hsieh and Lee.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, Chuang and Hsieh won gold in the women's doubles after
defeating South Korea's Kim Song Jung and Lee Jin A in straight sets 6-0, 6-3.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Chang Kai Chen pulled off the women's singles title after coming from
behind to beat China's Zhang Shuai 4-6, 7-6, 6-2.</P>
      <P>In the men's doubles final, Taiwan's Li Chu-huan and Lee Hsin-han lost to
China's Zeng Shao-xuan and Zhang Ze 4-6, 6-7, 4-7 to win silver.</P>
      <P>However, the result was not a satisfactory one for Taiwan's tennis players, as
they failed to beat their own record of four gold medals won at the last East
Asian Games in Macau in 2005.</P>
      <P>Chen Nan, chief coach of Taiwan's national tennis team for international
competitions, said the games were merely seen as a warm up for the 2010 Asian
Games in Guangzhou, China.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Taiwanese cyclist Huang Ho-hsun finished second in the Individual
Road Race for Women, winning Taiwan's second silver medal in the cycling events.
China's Liu Xiahui won gold.</P>
      <P>At the close of Thursday's competition, Taiwan ranked fifth among the nine
states and regions taking part in the games, with six golds, 22 silvers and 20

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government collected NT$146.4 billion (US$4.53 billion) in net tax
revenues in November, up 9 percent from the same month of the previous year --
the first year-on-year rise since March, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, for the first 11 months of this year, the government garnered NT$1.43
trillion in tax revenue, a decrease of NT$243.4 billion, or 14.6 percent year-
on-year, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Hit by the global economic downturn, Taiwan's net tax revenue in the 11 month-
period posted the largest annual decrease in the country's history.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-chen, the ministry's statistics chief, said that the 11-month tax revenue
accounted for 80 percent of the budgeted NT$1.7844 trillion -- which was also
the lowest rate for the same period in recorded history.</P>
      <P>Income tax revenue --  including corporate income tax and individual
comprehensive income tax revenue -- amounted to NT$613.6 billion in the 11
months, recording a year-on-year decline of NT$191.7 billion, or 23.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Income tax revenue, which was affected most by the economic downturn, accounts
for almost 50 percent of the country's total tax revenues.</P>
      <P>Tax offices collected NT$45.8 billion in business turnover tax last month -- the
highest level in a year, up 4.9 percent from the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Land value tax, which the government just began collecting from November,
reached NT$36 billion, up 17.9 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Commodity tax revenue increased by 84.6 percent to NT$11.4 billion in November,
while the share transaction tax revenue of NT$8.2 billion represented a rise of
112 percent, according to MOF statistics.</P>
      <P>With the economy starting to recover, some tax categories started to show
revenue improvements, said Lin, adding that the monthly commodity tax revenue
has been standing above NT$10 billion for the past six months, while the share
transaction tax revenue increased by 10.2 percent, to total NT$94.4 billion for
the 11 months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Carbon emission reduction efforts pay off at schools</HEADLINE>

12/10/09  22:22:31
(By S.Y. Lin and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government efforts to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions have paid off at
schools and universities, with the campaign helping to save over NT$700 million
(US$21.54 million) in electricity costs at educational institutions around the
country last year.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Education (MOE) , 312 universities and colleges, as
well as 248 senior high schools and 59 junior high and elementary schools, have
been taking part in a carbon reduction campaign since 2007.</P>
      <P>Comparing the schools' combined consumption levels in 2008 with the figure
recorded for 2006,  they consumed  about 7.8 less electricity last year than
they did in 2006, representing savings of more than NT$700 million in
electricity costs, according to MOE statistics.</P>
      <P>Among all the participating schools, vocational senior high schools scored the
highest rate of 12.31 percent in slashing carbon emissions, followed by colleges
and universities, which recorded an 8.03 percent reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions, an environmental protection task force under the MOE said.</P>
      <P>Senior high schools posted a reduction rate of 7.23 percent, ahead of junior
high schools with 6.54 percent and elementary schools with 6.07 percent, it went
on.</P>
      <P>The MOE hopes that all the country's schools and colleges will achieve an
average electricity use reduction of 7 percent per year by 2015, it added.</P>
      <P>Chang Zih-chao, executive secretary of the MOE task force, ascribed inadequate
measures and ageing lighting or air conditioning equipment to some schools'
failure to cut electricity use.</P>
      <P>The MOE will allocate more budget to help these schools phase out their
inefficient equipment in the coming years, he added.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University was among the 13 green universities selected this year by the
MOE for their outstanding performance in cutting back electricity consumption on
their campuses.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University  has slashed some 4.6 percent off its electricity  use this
year,  saving it some NT$19 million in electricity costs.</P>
      <P>Wei Jung-chung, head of the privately run university's general affairs
department,  said it is very important  to build  a carbon-reducing concept
among students.</P>
      <P>Wei said students have to pay for the lights if they want to play basketball or
tennis on school facilities. At the same time, devices are installed in
classrooms' air conditioning units and lamps so that they switch off
automatically at the end of the class and switch on 10 minutes before the next
one starts, he explained.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, however, public universities such as National Taiwan
University, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology and
Taichung University of Education (TUE) were more effective than their private
counterparts  in cutting back on electricity during the 2007-2008 period, Wei
said.</P>
      <P>The top 21 public universities succeeded in reducing about a total of 15,000
metric tons of greenhouse gas -- equivalent to a saving of NT$44 million in
electricity costs, he noted.</P>
      <P>Yi Cheng-ming, general affairs department director at the TUE, pointed out that
in addition to installing automated devices to regulate electricity use, it is
of maximum importance to raise carbon reduction awareness among students.</P>
      <P>To this end, the TUE has personnel periodically patrol the campus to persuade
students not to waste electricity, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Net tax revenues up 9 percent in November</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government collected NT$146.4 billion (US$4.53 billion) in net tax
revenues in November, up 9 percent from the same month of the previous year --
the first year-on-year rise since March, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, for the first 11 months of this year, the government garnered NT$1.43
trillion in tax revenue, a decrease of NT$243.4 billion, or 14.6 percent year-
on-year, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Hit by the global economic downturn, Taiwan's net tax revenue in the 11 month-
period posted the largest annual decrease in the country's history.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-chen, the ministry's statistics chief, said that the 11-month tax revenue
accounted for 80 percent of the budgeted NT$1.7844 trillion -- which was also
the lowest rate for the same period in recorded history.</P>
      <P>Income tax revenue --  including corporate income tax and individual
comprehensive income tax revenue -- amounted to NT$613.6 billion in the 11
months, recording a year-on-year decline of NT$191.7 billion, or 23.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Income tax revenue, which was affected most by the economic downturn, accounts
for almost 50 percent of the country's total tax revenues.</P>
      <P>Tax offices collected NT$45.8 billion in business turnover tax last month -- the
highest level in a year, up 4.9 percent from the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>Land value tax, which the government just began collecting from November,
reached NT$36 billion, up 17.9 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Commodity tax revenue increased by 84.6 percent to NT$11.4 billion in November,
while the share transaction tax revenue of NT$8.2 billion represented a rise of
112 percent, according to MOF statistics.</P>
      <P>With the economy starting to recover, some tax categories started to show
revenue improvements, said Lin, adding that the monthly commodity tax revenue
has been standing above NT$10 billion for the past six months, while the share
transaction tax revenue increased by 10.2 percent, to total NT$94.4 billion for
the 11 months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Carbon emission reduction efforts pay off at schools</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
12/11/09  09:11:11

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government efforts to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions have paid off at
schools and universities, with the campaign helping to save over NT$700 million
(US$21.54 million) in electricity costs at educational institutions around the
country last year.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Education (MOE) , 312 universities and colleges, as
well as 248 senior high schools and 59 junior high and elementary schools, have
been taking part in a carbon reduction campaign since 2007.</P>
      <P>Comparing the schools' combined consumption levels in 2008 with the figure
recorded for 2006,  they consumed  about 7.8 less electricity last year than
they did in 2006, representing savings of more than NT$700 million in
electricity costs, according to MOE statistics.</P>
      <P>Among all the participating schools, vocational senior high schools scored the
highest rate of 12.31 percent in slashing carbon emissions, followed by colleges
and universities, which recorded an 8.03 percent reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions, an environmental protection task force under the MOE said.</P>
      <P>Senior high schools posted a reduction rate of 7.23 percent, ahead of junior
high schools with 6.54 percent and elementary schools with 6.07 percent, it went
on.</P>
      <P>The MOE hopes that all the country's schools and colleges will achieve an
average electricity use reduction of 7 percent per year by 2015, it added.</P>
      <P>Chang Zih-chao, executive secretary of the MOE task force, ascribed inadequate
measures and ageing lighting or air conditioning equipment to some schools'
failure to cut electricity use.</P>
      <P>The MOE will allocate more budget to help these schools phase out their
inefficient equipment in the coming years, he added.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University was among the 13 green universities selected this year by the
MOE for their outstanding performance in cutting back electricity consumption on
their campuses.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University  has slashed some 4.6 percent off its electricity  use this
year,  saving it some NT$19 million in electricity costs.</P>
      <P>Wei Jung-chung, head of the privately run university's general affairs
department,  said it is very important  to build  a carbon-reducing concept
among students.</P>
      <P>Wei said students have to pay for the lights if they want to play basketball or
tennis on school facilities. At the same time, devices are installed in
classrooms' air conditioning units and lamps so that they switch off
automatically at the end of the class and switch on 10 minutes before the next
one starts, he explained.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, however, public universities such as National Taiwan
University, National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology and
Taichung University of Education (TUE) were more effective than their private
counterparts  in cutting back on electricity during the 2007-2008 period, Wei
said.</P>
      <P>The top 21 public universities succeeded in reducing about a total of 15,000
metric tons of greenhouse gas -- equivalent to a saving of NT$44 million in
electricity costs, he noted.</P>
      <P>Yi Cheng-ming, general affairs department director at the TUE, pointed out that
in addition to installing automated devices to regulate electricity use, it is
of maximum importance to raise carbon reduction awareness among students.</P>
      <P>To this end, the TUE has personnel periodically patrol the campus to persuade
students not to waste electricity, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/11/09  10:36:20
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait are scheduled to sign a tax agreement in
central Taiwan's Taichung City Dec. 22 to avoid the double taxation of investors
on each other's territory. While senior officials say the accord will help
enhance the transparency of tax information, some lawmakers are skeptical of its
benefits for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest
developments: China Times:</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Thursday that there is a "blind spot" in
Taiwan's control of tax information concerning Taiwanese businesses operating in
China and that once the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sign a taxation
agreement, the transparency of cross-strait tax data will increase.</P>
      <P>In that way, the government will be able to control tax evasion or avoidance by
Taiwanese businessmen through a third country, and it will also be able to
protect businesses that pay tax in a legal manner, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed  out that there are around 800,000  Taiwanese businessmen who
currently have accumulated investments of NT$80.5 billion (US$2.5 billion) in
China. The data on tax figures for these people, however, are hazy.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance only knows that they have paid their comprehensive
income tax totaling around NT$1 billion each year in Taiwan, Lee said, which he
described as a blind spot. (Dec. 11, 2009) Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from the "pan-blue camp" have cast doubt on the government's stance
that Taiwan will benefit from the signing of a cross-strait tax agreement,
which, according to the minister of finance, will protect Taiwanese businessmen
operating in China, lower the burden on taxpayers and increase the government's
tax revenues in the long run.</P>
      <P>At a Legislative Yuan Committee of Finance meeting Tuesday, several legislators
of the ruling Kuomintang conveyed the concern of many Taiwanese businessmen over
a possible integrated tax inspection by the governments on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers claimed that the planned agreement will in fact help Beijing
collect tax from businessmen from Taiwan but will lead to a decline in Taiwan's
tax revenues (Dec. 11, 2009).</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih panned official red tape at a weekly Cabinet meeting
Thursday, saying the nonsensical working style of the country's bureaucracy lets
the people down.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih expressed fury Thursday over the inefficiency of some
government agencies in performing their duties, which he summarized as a mix of
inertia, procrastination and bureaucratic red tape.</P>
      <P>At a regular Executive Yuan meeting, Wu ordered all Cabinet agencies to boost
their administrative efficiency, saying that the last thing he wants to see as
premier is pointless document-shuffling -- "because the people cannot wait."
(Dec. 11, 2009) United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih lashed out at some Cabinet-level agencies, including  the
Ministry  of Economic  Affairs  and the Public Construction Commission, for
their snail-paced planning on and implementation of public construction projects
that are of vital importance to the day-to-day lives of the people.</P>
      <P>"Bureaucratic red tape is a waste of time and life, and we the government owe an

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) and experts have again given their assurances of
the safety of A(H1N1) vaccine as a national vaccination program is set to begin
Saturday following initial immunizations targeting specific groups.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Chang Shan-chwen said that since the immunization program
kicked off Nov. 1, 2.6 million people had been given shots as of Dec. 7. Among
the 242 cases of possible side effects reported, most complained of dizziness,
fever, headache, nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath.</P>
      <P>Most of them recovered within 48 hours, but the 44 more serious cases included
miscarriage, sudden death and weak legs.</P>
      <P>Chang, as well as Lee Bin-yin from National Taiwan University Hospital and Chiu
Nan-chang of Mackay Memorial Hospital, urged the public not to be alarmed by the
figures.</P>
      <P>They explained that even without the immunization program, there is a certain
ratio of miscarriage, sudden death and neuritis, while the DOH observed that the
ratio is no different to past years during seasonal flu vaccination programs.</P>
      <P>City hospitals in Taipei and Kaohsiung, as well as DOH hospitals around Taiwan,
will hold a competition in which hospitals and doctors who have given the most
shots will get commendations from the Central Epidemics Prevention Center, DOH
officials said.</P>
      <P>There will also be temporary immunization stations set up in big department
stores, hypermarkets, railway stations and temples, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>To encourage the public to get the shots, the DOH is offering agricultural
produce, stationery sets and lucky draws at these stations, they added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that his administration's efforts over the
past year to boost and cement relations with Japan have yielded fruit, evidenced
by a string of developments that have enhanced bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the 37th assembly of the Taiwan-Japan Economic
Conference in Taipei, Ma said he is basically satisfied with what has been done
by the two countries over the past year in terms of cementing bilateral ties,
although he admitted that more could be done in the future.</P>
      <P>Ma dismissed a Japanese daily's recent allegation that relations between Taiwan
and Japan have been "abruptly frozen" since he took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"The report was completely off-base," he said.</P>
      <P>He told his audience that while one Japanese dietman had expressed worry that he
would turn anti-Japan after being sworn in as Taiwan's new president, Ma said
the politician's perspective of him has changed completely over the past year.</P>
      <P>"I think you're pro-Japan now, " Ma quoted the dietman as saying to him during a
recent visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes Japan will realize that his administration's efforts to improve
relations with China do not run counter to its bid to enhance ties with Japan
and that they should not be mistaken for a tilt toward Beijing, because the
tempering of the cross-Taiwan Strait situation is consistent with regional and
global interests.</P>
      <P>He said that while Taiwan has improved its relations with China, it has also
spared no efforts to increase exchanges with Japan, the United States and the
European Union, and he stressed that it is vitally important that Taiwan should
become a "responsible partner and a peace creator" if it wants to make a mark
for itself and maintain good relations with the rest of the global community.</P>

      <P>A French artist unveiled two living walls composed of orchids at the National
Theater Hall in Taipei Friday, vertical gardens that the environmentalist said
are aimed at paying homage to both the flower and orchid growers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Patrick Blanc, a botanist and artist who invented the concept of a vertical
garden, told the Central News Agency in an interview that his creations can
appeal to people of all ages and professions and encourage them to think more
about nature.</P>
      <P>"What I like, actually, is to try to put plants where people are not waiting for
plants, " said Blanc, who calls his version of the concept "vegetal walls," from
the French "mur vegetal."</P>
      <P>"I want to show that life can be installed everywhere, " added the 56-year-old
artist, whose passion for plants is self-evident in his hair, which has been
dyed green for the past 25 years, and his green pants and shoes.</P>
      <P>His two latest vertical gardens, both measuring 8.15-meters long and 5.7-meters
wide, were unveiled at a ceremony Friday.</P>
      <P>Blanc, who created a vertical garden in the National Concert Hall in 2007, said
the two new walls at the National Theater Hall reflect the diversity of native
orchid species in Taiwan and Southeast Asia and recognize the achievements of
Taiwanese orchid hybridizers in developing unique, high quality orchids.</P>
      <P>The first wall, titled "The Wild Dance, " was made of 25 native Taiwanese orchid
species and others from Southeast Asia to exhibit the diversity of structure and
growth habits of the orchid family, which contains about 22,500 species.</P>
      <P>The second wall, "The Butterfly Dance, " composed of 46 colorful varieties of
phalaenopsis orchids, pays homage to the work of Taiwanese orchid hybridizers.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20 years, most of the new phalaenopsis hybrids were created by
Taiwanese horticulturists in the southern part of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The most challenging part of the project, Blanc said, was to find native orchid
species, but he admitted to enjoying putting together the living walls because
everybody involved was knowledgeable and very easy to work with.</P>
      <P>Blanc stressed that living walls are appropriate in both indoor and outdoor
settings, but they have different criteria and benefits.</P>
      <P>While outdoor walls are more about choosing the right plants for the right place
based on prevailing weather conditions, indoor walls are more about design and
aesthetic values.</P>
      <P>The benefits of living walls include increasing humidity and purifying the air
in indoor spaces and moderating temperatures and noise when used outside
buildings, Blanc said.</P>
      <P>Having installed some 200-250 vegetal walls around the world, Blanc said he
tries to visit each of his works every two to three years, no matter how far
away they are, or asks their keepers to send photos to help him keep track of
how his walls evolve.</P>
      <P>Some of the original plants used in the first vegetal wall he created at his
home in 1982 are still alive, an indication, Blanc says, of how easy the
vertical gardens are to maintain.</P>
      <P>Outdoor walls only need to be checked two to three times a year, while indoor
walls need to be checked every 45 days to two months.</P>
      <P>Since Blanc's first vertical garden was unveiled at the Museum of Science and
Industry in Paris in 1988, the designer has created many other vertical
landscapes around the world, including green walls at the Musee du Quai Branly
in Paris, the Siam Paragon shopping mall in Bangkok, and the 21st Century Museum
of Contemporary Art in Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ma pushes for adoption of global covenants into domestic law</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that Taiwan will continue to adopt
international covenants as domestic law to demonstrate its willingness to meet
its responsibilities as a member of the global village.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan will keep "internalizing" international covenants -- formal
international treaties that Taiwan cannot sign or was forced out of because it
is not a United Nations member -- to facilitate its integration into the
international community.</P>
      <P>The president hailed the adoption of two U. N. covenants -- the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights -- into domestic law, as bringing Taiwan's
human rights protection on a par with international norms.</P>
      <P>The two convenants took effect in Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a round-table with a group of representatives from the local legal
and judiciary sector, Ma said the Ministry of Justice will review relevant laws
and statutes of the country and come up with amendment suggestions in two years
if it finds certain articles run against the spirit of those two U.N. human
rights covenants.</P>
      <P>"It will be a giant legal engineering feat in the history of the Republic of
China," the president said.</P>
      <P>From Thursday on, any individual in the Republic of China can cite these two
laws on human rights protection, which is an important step for Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a bill in March this year to make these two treaties
domestic law.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was one of the original signatories to the two treaties in 1967 when the
Republic of China was still a U.N. member. It did not incorporate the treaties
into local law before losing its U.N. seat in 1971.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma told the panelists that from Jan. 1, 2010, computer monitors will
be installed and used at prosecutors' questioning sessions so that the suspects
can watch the recording of his or her interrogation as it happens.</P>
      <P>"This will contribute to reducing controversies afterward and better protecting
the suspects' human rights," he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the practice of illegal wiretapping or telephone monitoring that
has been long condemned by society will disappear.</P>
      <P>In related news, representatives of disadvantaged people and legal and judiciary
groups met with President Ma Friday to lodge appeals and propose suggestions on
judicial reforms.</P>
      <P>The representatives, headed by Taiwan Law Society Chairman Wellington Koo,
suggested that a judicial reform committee be established under the Presidential
Office,  with half of the committee's members coming from the private sector to
serve as supervisors.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that President Ma give judicial reform as high a priority as
a government campaign against corruption and make a progress report to the
public once every three months, according to Koo.</P>
      <P>"The president said he will see to it that the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of
Justice come up with concrete plans on the reform program in one month," Koo
noted.</P>

      <P>Minister of Education Wu Ching-ji expressed his pride in the country's
vocational education system Friday and anticipated that junior college
vocational schools around the island will be "stuffed" with Chinese students
once they are allowed to enroll in Taiwan's colleges and universities.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese  schools are attractive  enough to draw Chinese students, " Wu said
at the 44th founding anniversary of Meiho Institute of Technology in Pingtung
County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's vocational education is globally recognized as being of the same
quality as in Germany and Australia, Wu said, pointing out that National
Pingtung University  of Science and Technology's Department of Tropical
Agriculture and International Cooperation is the only one of its kind in the
world.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taichung City-based National Chung Hsing University enjoys a
reputation on a par with Japan's prestigious University of Tokyo in agricultural
and biotech research, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu said he believes the academic exchanges between Taiwan and China will help
further ease political tensions, but he also reiterated that principles are in
place to prevent Chinese students from seizing education resources from local
students, as some believe could happen.</P>
      <P>The principles include imposing restrictions on the number of Chinese students
allowed in Taiwan, not offering scholarships to Chinese students, and
prohibiting Chinese students from staying in the country to work after they
finish their studies here, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education has begun a series of 17 separate public hearings
around the country on its policy to open its doors to Chinese students and
recognize academic credentials from Chinese universities.</P>
      <P>The first public hearing of the series, which will run until Dec. 23, took place
Thursday at National Kaohsiung Normal University in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung
City and was hosted by Vice Minister of Education Wu Tsai-shun.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local associations call for cross-strait fishing labor pact</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives from local fishing associations across the country handed a
petition to the Legislative Yuan Friday that urged all lawmakers to support a
pact on fishing labor that will be signed during the upcoming cross-Taiwan
Strait talks in central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Huang Yi-cheng, the head of the Taiwan Provincial
Fisherman's Association, said such a pact is critical to help protect the
personal safety and property of Taiwanese fishing vessel owners through an
institutionalized system.</P>
      <P>Without a formal fishing cooperation agreement between Taiwan and China,
Taiwan's fishing boat operators have been unable to verify the identities of
Chinese crew members or deal with many incidents, including frequent mutinies on
the high seas in recent years, he said .</P>
      <P>Also, in May 2006, China began demanding that Taiwan's brokers apply to hire
fishing boat crewmen and pay a handsome deposit to Chinese authorities, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>If the existing practice were to continue over the long term, Taiwanese fishing
operators would be forced to accept the terms set by the Chinese side, making it
difficult for them to protect their own rights, he explained.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 of some 4,600 Chinese nationals currently employed on Taiwanese
fishing vessels have been introduced to local fishing operators by private
brokers through channels appointed by Chinese authorities, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>TPFA chief delegate Lin Chi-chang voiced the hope that the government could
clinch a fishing labor pact as soon as possible with China to allow Taiwanese
fishing companies to hire Chinese fishermen through an institutionalized channel
and screen their identity in advance.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a whip of the ruling Kuomintang's legislative caucus, said such
a pact will help address some grave problems facing Taiwan's fishing boat owners
and upgrade the quality of Chinese fishermen they hire.</P>
      <P>Lu also urged the legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party to back the signing of a fishery cooperation pact in the upcoming  fourth
round of cross-strait  talks between Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) -- slated to open on Dec. 22.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the meeting will be to ink four cross-strait agreements
regarding  fishing  crew  cooperation,  agricultural quarantine inspection,
industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of
double taxation.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Friday that it will amend the Labor
Standards Law in an effort to better protect the welfare of "dispatched" workers
-- those who work for employment agencies or specialized contractors and then
are dispatched to companies.</P>
      <P>"The CLA has decided to first amend the chapter in the Labor Standards Law that
governs labor contracts to strengthen the benefits of dispatched workers and the
responsibility of companies that employ such workers, " CLA chief secretary
Huang Chiu-kuei said at an international seminar on the subject held by the
Taiwan Confederation of Trade Unions (TCTU).</P>
      <P>The amended regulations will also apply to government agencies, which have the
largest number of dispatched workers, she added.</P>
      <P>CLA and Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics figures showed
that in May 687,000 of Taiwan's 9 million employees were dispatched workers, far
more than the 130,000 in 2003 and the 60,000 in 1996.</P>
      <P>TCTU Secretary-General Hsieh Chuang-chih said the statistics indicated  a
continuing  deterioration  in Taiwan's  employment environment, and TCTU
Chairman Mao Chen-fei said improvements in the system were needed.</P>
      <P>"Current  regulations  and laws do not provide  sufficient protection for
dispatched workers, many of whom are underprivileged," Mao said.</P>
      <P>These people are usually vulnerable and tend to be laid off when the economy
goes bad, such as after the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, he added.</P>
      <P>Hiring dispatched workers from contractors or employment agencies saves
companies the responsibility of hiring workers on their own and paying them
health and retirement benefits, bonuses, or severance pay. The practice helps
them reduce labor costs and gives them more flexibility in managing their
manpower.</P>
      <P>Mao said, however, that his confederation opposes dispatching jobs and contends
that the government should restrict such employment to certain industries and
provide better protection for dispatched workers rights and benefits.</P>

      <P>The ruling and opposition parties reached a consensus Friday to continue
consultations on an amendment related to a controversial protocol signed by
Taiwan and the United States that opened Taiwan's market to U.S. bone-in-beef.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called in the whips of the ruling Kuomintang
and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to discuss the issue, and
the two sides agreed to continue to talk based on a resolution reached a month
earlier.</P>
      <P>The Nov. 3 resolution stated that before the Act Governing Food Sanitation is
amended,  U.S.  beef parts considered hazardous, including beef offal, ground
beef, spinal cord, brain, skull and eyes, should not be allowed to be imported.</P>
      <P>Wang met earlier with the DPP caucus and Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to exchange
views on the dispute over the amendment, which led the DPP to boycott the
operations of the legislature for more than one month.</P>
      <P>Sources said Tsai asked the KMT legislative caucus to conclude the consultations
in one week, and stressed that if a consensus could not be reached, the DPP
legislative caucus will continue its boycott campaign.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, William A. Stanton, Taipei director of the American Institute in
Taiwan, called on Wang to reiterate Washington's view that Taiwan should abide
by the protocol signed with the U.S., which allows the import of previously
banned bone-in beef, ground beef and offal.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Wang Sing-nan said only U.S. slaughterhouses can test cow's
brains for prion protein, which is linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
or mad cow disease, and establish the safety of the cow.</P>
      <P>The examination fee for each cow would be NT$700 (US$22) , Wang said. If the
cows are turned into ground beef and imported to Taiwan without undergoing the
test, it will be impossible to detect such a disease.</P>
      <P>Wang said that to deter potentially hazardous beef from entering Taiwan, the
U.S. will have to take the initiative to inspect its beef, and that if Taiwan
thinks that it can conduct rigorous inspections of the beef when it arrives in
Taiwan, then it is delusional.</P>
      <P>KMT whip Lu Hsueh-chang said that according to quarantine officials of the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, only the U.S. can
detect the prion protein.</P>
      <P>"This is why the amendment will try to deter the beef from coming to Taiwan in
the first place," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Under a protocol with the U.S., Taiwan agreed to allow the entry of U.S. bone-in
beef, ground beef, and beef offal that were not contaminated by "specific risk
materials (SRMs) " related to mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>SRMs are defined in the protocol as brains, skulls, eyes, trigeminal ganglia,
spinal cords, vertebral columns and dorsal root ganglia from cattle 30 months
and older, or tonsils and the distal ileum of the small intestine from cattle of
all ages.</P>
      <P>The pact has resulted in great misgivings among the public. Civic groups
recently submitted  a petition to the Central Election Commission to try to
initiate a national referendum on restarting negotiations with the U.S. on the
issue.</P>
      <P>The DPP's principle will be to stop high-risk U.S. parts at their source and
that the government should restart talks with the U.S., DPP chairwoman Tsai said
earlier in the day.</P>

      <P>The following is a brief roundup of selected local newspaper editorials Friday:
APPLE DAILY China gearing up to undermine foundation of Taiwan-U.S. ties</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said after American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond
Burghardt briefed him on U.S. President Barack Obama's  visit  to  China  in
November  that  the  triangular Taiwan-U.S.-China relations are in their best
shape in six decades.</P>
      <P>If his remarks were not aimed at comforting himself or the man in the street,
they reflect Ma's ignorance of the fact that Taiwan-U.S. relations are changing
profoundly as China has geared up to undermine the foundation of Taiwan-U.S.
relations through lobby groups.</P>
      <P>If Ma was not alarmed by Obama's failure to mention U.S. obligations under the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) during his Beijing visit, his national security team
should read a recent article by former U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Vice Chairman
William A. Owens.</P>
      <P>The retired admiral said unequivocally that the TRA enacted 30 years ago has
done more harm than good to the U.S. and that selling defensive weapons to
Taiwan is also not in Washington's best interests.</P>
      <P>Owens further said that the United States should start to take China as a friend
and should not repeat the historical blunder of old powers engaging in wars with
rising powers.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the U.S. stop arms sales to Taiwan in exchange for China's
amity and that the themes of U.S. policy toward China should be cooperation,
openness and trust instead of restriction, competition or containment.</P>
      <P>It is worth paying attention to whether Owens' article signals that a pro-China
force is pushing the U.S. to invalidate the TRA under Beijing's encouragement on
the grounds that the present U.S. situation and development should not be
restricted by a 30-year-old law.</P>
      <P>The latest information from Washington shows that the U.S. is likely to sell
Taiwan Black Hawk helicopters and Patriot PAC III missiles but will reject
Taiwan's appeal for F-16C/D jet fighters.</P>
      <P>By so doing, the Obama administration has fulfilled the U.S. commitment to abide
by the TRA to help with Taiwan's national defense needs and to allow Taiwan to
remain confident in negotiations with China while avoiding angering its giant
neighbor.</P>
      <P>While the Ma administration is touting the achievements of its pragmatic
diplomatic approach, we must remind Ma's national security team that China does
not care whether the U.S. abolishes the TRA, as it is strongly lobbying
Washington to gradually retrench arms sales to Taiwan. COMMERCIAL TIMES
Enhancing transparency in cross-strait financial talks</P>
      <P>After hurriedly signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cross-strait
financial supervisory cooperation with China Nov. 16, Taiwan's government did
not reveal the content of the pact until after the curtain fell on mayoral and
magistrate elections last Saturday.</P>
      <P>We are concerned whether all future cross-strait agreements in trade, economic
and political fields will all follow this working model.</P>
      <P>The government began to advocate signing a cross-strait financial MOU more than
a year ago, but it had since been evasive on issues discussed during the
negotiations and the progress made in such talks.</P>
      <P>Policy and information opaqueness has led to rampant speculation about the pact
in local society and market players have used related issues to speculate on
local financial stocks over the past year.</P>
      <P>Insufficient  transparency has also resulted in unrealistic mirages. Among
others, many thought Taiwanese banks would enjoy promising business
opportunities once they are allowed to set up in China following the signing of
the MOU.</P>
      <P>The reality, however, is that foreign banks, including Taiwan's, must first set
up liaison offices in China before they are allowed to open branches there. Even
after they manage to open up branches, they have to wait another three years
before their branches can handle Chinese yuan-denominated deposits and loans.</P>
      <P>It's no secret that local banks will face challenges in the Chinese market,  but
the government  has not kept information transparent from the very beginning and
only reluctantly admitted to the barriers Taiwanese banks would encounter in the
Chinese market at the last minute.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, we cannot but ask whether other information has also been
deliberately concealed by the government.</P>
      <P>We must remind the present administration that popular demand for policy
transparency has increased significantly since the second change of power
between political parties. The government should never try again to keep key
provisions of any cross-strait agreements secret. CHINA TIMES Government needs
to provide platform for ECFA debate</P>
      <P>Some political analysts have partly attributed  the ruling Kuomintang's recent
election setback to the government's plan to sign an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, which the pro-independence opposition
Democratic Progressive Party has denounced as a prelude to Taiwan's integration
into a "one China" market.</P>
      <P>In an effort to clarify misconceptions, both Premier Wu Den-yih and Economics
Minister Shih Yen-shiang have offered to debate DPP lawmakers and politicians on
relevant topics.</P>
      <P>The government and the ruling party are indeed obliged to defend major policies
through dialogue. However, we do not see the need for senior officials to debate
the ECFA issue in person.</P>
      <P>The government just has to provide a platform or arrange a setting for
proponents and opponents to discuss the issues directly.</P>
      <P>As the free trade agreement-like ECFA will involve scores of industries, those
who will benefit from the accord should stand out to defend the proposal.</P>
      <P>If representatives of industries believed to benefit from the pact fail to
convince opponents in public debates, the government may have to think twice on
whether to go ahead with its plan to start ECFA talks early next year.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if DPP politicians and other opponents lose such debates,
they should stop their irrational opposition to the proposal. UNITED DAILY NEWS
Don't let people live in pall of election battles</P>
      <P>Soon after the curtain fell on elections  for mayors and magistrates in 17
cities and counties, society's focus moved to the more important elections for
mayors of five special municipalities next year and even the 2012 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>While some KMT politicians are fervently speculating on who should represent the
party in next year's mayoral elections, we should remind them that good
governance is the best strategy to win back the hearts and minds of the voter in
the street.</P>
      <P>For the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, our advice is that its gains in
the just-concluded elections is no guarantee for its performance in the next
elections. As many voters remain skeptical about its radical ideology and
governing competence, the party should rather think about how to contribute to
people's well-being rather than indulging in empty talk. ECONOMIC DAILY NEWS
Don't blame macroeconomic environment any more</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's appointment of his most trusted ally as the ruling
Kuomintang's new secretary-general seems to indicate that Ma is still not fully
aware of the reasons behind his party's poor showing in the just-concluded local
elections.</P>
      <P>Ma attributed the KMT's election setback to economic woes resulting from a
global financial meltdown. However, the worldwide financial crisis was just the
last straw to sink Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>The culprit actually lied in China's reckless policy of forcing its coastal
export-processing industries to upgrade. Under such a policy, Taiwanese and
other foreign investors were forced to relocate offshore or move into China's
inland provinces.</P>
      <P>China's export-driven economy then fell through and Taiwan's shipments to China
also dropped substantially.</P>
      <P>By mid-2008, China was facing an even more serious economic crisis than
Taiwan's. China's leaders did not blame the global financial tsunami for the
country's economic hardships and instead endeavored to find the root cause of
the problem and took immediate steps to address the issue.</P>
      <P>China stopped its rash industrial upgrading policy by resuming tax rebates and
easing wage restrictions to bolster its export sector.  In addition,  it
invested  heavily  in infrastructure construction and green industry while
encouraging private consumption to expand domestic demand. In the end, its
economic growth rate for this year will exceed its target of 8 percent.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Taiwan's leaders seem to still have their heads buried in the
sand and have failed to come up with substantive policy incentives to revive the
battered economy.</P>
      <P>With a much smaller territory and population, Taiwan needs to operate with
wisdom, vigor and ingenuity. Otherwise, how can it compete with China?</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA first step for Taiwan to get fair competition on world market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)
12/11/09  19:38:51</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the economic globalization continues relentlessly, Taiwan has no option but
to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China as the
first step to remain competitive in the world market, a top national growth
strategist said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ping-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), told the
CNA all Taiwan wants is fair competition in worldwide trade and investment to
survive the globalization,</P>
      <P>one of whose most distinctive features is regionalization, where Taiwan is
unfairly disadvantaged. In Asia, Chiang said, what is commonly known as "Ten-
plus-One" is coming into being as a free trade zone on January 1 next year. The
ten being member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
and the one the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is excluded.</P>
      <P>The exclusion makes Taiwan exports uncompetitive. Somewhere between 7 to 10
percent of tariff will be imposed on products ranging from textiles to
petrochemicals. Service industries, including banking and financing, will be
seriously affected, too. Most of manufacturing industries will be forced to
relocate away from Taiwan. Unemployment will soar, further worsening its
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>"That's why we have to have the ECFA, a framework of economic cooperation, first
with the other side of the Taiwan Strait," said Chiang, who will talk with his
Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin in Taichung at their fourth meeting scheduled to
start on December 22.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen, chairman of the Association for Relations across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), are expected to sign four agreements to improve relations
between Taiwan and China, though the much-heralded ECFA will not be signed.</P>
      <P>"No," Chiang said, "we are not going to ink the ECFA this time. We will put it
on the agenda for our next meeting." The meeting where the ECFA will be signed
will take place in China in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>Chiang allayed apprehension that the ECFA is a step toward Taiwan's closer
economic integration with China. "Far from it," he pointed out, "it's the first
step we should take and are taking to get the chance of fair competition to
remain economically competitive in the world in general and in Asia in
particular.</P>
      <P>"For one thing, the ECFA isn't a free trade agreement. It's like the list of
contents of a book, stating what Taiwan and China will do to remove all
obstacles to better cooperation in trade and investment.</P>
      <P>"We don't have a timetable for where to proceed and how," Chiang said.
Prioritization, also known as early harvests, is being arranged . For that
reason, many people in Taiwan do not understand what the ECFA does offer and how
it's going to impact some industries, farming and fishing among others. "One
thing we have to do," Chiang said, "is to make our people have a better
understanding of the ECFA."</P>
      <P>Countries in Asia and elsewhere are concerned that the ECFA may give Taiwan more
advantages than are fair. Seoul believes Taiwan, with the ECFA in force, will
outsell products from South Korea. Japan, whose new ambition is to form an East
Asian economic community with South Korea and China, does not like Taiwan to
have better edges in trade and investment across the strait. The United States,
excluded from the emerging Asian free trade bloc as well as the "ASEAN-plus-
Three" by 2012, does not consider favorably Taiwan's increasingly heavy economic
reliance on China. The other two of the "three" are Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Why with China first?" Because it's our top trade partner," said Chiang,
minister of economic affairs and chairman of the Council of Economic Planning
and Development under former President Lee Teng-hui .Trade with China, including
Hong Kong and Macao, accounts for 40 percent of Taiwan's worldwide sales and
purchases. With the ECFA signed with China, ASEAN states, whose trade with
Taiwan representing 15 percent of the total, is likely to follow suit, Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>The signing of such agreements, however, does not involve Chiang's SEF, a quasi-
official organization which together with Chen's ARATS conducts substantive
relations between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Efforts will then be made to conclude a similar arrangement with Japan, whose
trade with Taiwan makes up another seven percent of the latter's worldwide
volume.</P>
      <P>"Then it will be the United States and the European Union, each accounting for
12 percent of our international trade," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"Our global economic cooperation framework will be completed then," he pointed
out. "Only then will Taiwan be truly able to compete fairly in the world
market." Taiwan will be free of fear for economic marginalization. "We are not
afraid of competition," Chiang declared. "We are afraid only of unfairness in
competition," he said.</P>
      <P>Of course, an ECFA may be signed not in that order. The United States is
planning to resume its TIFA (trade and investment framework agreement)
negotiations with Taiwan. It may be signed ahead of that with the EU or vice
versa. That depends on how these countries think such arrangements are mutually
or commonly beneficial. (By Joe Hung)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, Japan ink air treaty to expand flight services</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan inked a new air treaty Friday to expand flight services between
the two countries that will pave the way for direct flights between the city
airports of Taipei and Tokyo beginning next October.</P>
      <P>Under the new treaty, the weekly number of flights from Taiwan to Japan's Kansai
region and central Japan will be increased from 28 to 45, including four new
daily round-trip flights between Taipei Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda
Airport.</P>
      <P>Flights between Taipei and Okinawa will also be increased.</P>
      <P>Peng Run-tsu, chairman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Association of East
Asian Relations, and Reijiro Hattori, chairman of Japan's Interchange
Association in Taipei, signed the pact at a ceremony in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"It is foreseeable that the agreement will further increase the economic
benefits and convenience of people-to-people exchanges between the two sides,"
Peng said.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to negotiate and seek resolutions to all kinds of aviation
issues between Taiwan and Japan and to create a win-win situation for mutual
benefit," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Peng, China Airlines, Eva Air, Japan Airlines and All Nippon
Airways will operate the flights between Songshan and Haneda airports, and
service will begin when the carriers have made the necessary prepartions and
Haneda Airport's new runway is ready, which is expected next October.</P>
      <P>Currently, flights between Taipei and Tokyo go through Taiwan's Taoyuan
International  Airport and Japan's Narita International Airport.</P>
      <P>Flying through airports located near the two countries' capital cities could
save around 90 minutes in door-to-door travel times for passengers.</P>
      <P>Peng also noted that the treaty will allow carriers to have more flexibility
when it comes to scheduling flights from each other's airports on to third
countries -- known as the Fifth Freedom -- by increasing cargo and passenger
capacities, the number of flights and the choice of beyond points.</P>
      <P>The increase in flights resulted from mounting demand because of the growing
economic and tourism ties between Taiwan and Japan, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade reached US$60.4 billion in 2008, and 2.48 million tourists
traveled between Taiwan and Japan last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Low energy prices blamed for Taiwan's high greenhouse gas emissions</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Dec.  11  (CNA)
12/11/09  20:59:32

    <TEXT>
      <P>Low energy prices in Taiwan are responsible for Taiwan's worsening greenhouse
gas emissions, a problem that requires immediate attention from the government,
a minister without portfolio said in the southern city of Kaohsiung Friday.</P>
      <P>Raising the issue in a lecture on Taiwan's environmental, energy and economic
strategies and trends, Liang Chi-yuan noted that while fuel and electricity
prices in Taiwan are the lowest among non-oil producing countries, the nation's
energy efficiency is barely half that of Japan and the European Union.</P>
      <P>Liang reasoned that low energy prices are unfavorable to the promotion of
energy-conserving products and technologies, which in turn undermines overall
energy efficiency, delays the structural adjustment of local industries and
hampers greenhouse gas reductions.</P>
      <P>This situation is best demonstrated by the fact that Taiwan has recorded the
world's highest growth in greenhouse gas emissions -- 138 percent -- over the
past 16 years, with the situation worsening noticeably after 2000, he said.</P>
      <P>On a proposal to impose a carbon tax in Taiwan, Liang said such a policy should
be promoted in a gradual manner to lower its impact on the economy and that
personal and corporate income tax rates should be reduced to ease the burden of
the new tax.</P>
      <P>He suggested that revenue from the carbon tax could then be used to offset lower
personal and corporate income tax revenues and that companies with excellent
greenhouse gas reduction performances be granted energy tax exemptions or
refunds.</P>
      <P>Also,  the government  should provide energy subsidies  to low-income households
and encourage local businesses to buy carbon emission rights from abroad, he
said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency later Friday, Liang explained that
the Cabinet's plan to reform the country's energy tax policy will not lead to an
increase in tax burden because the reforms will be implemented alongside other
measures, such as lowering income taxes and abolishing the excise tax for most
products.</P>
      <P>Before levying a carbon tax, the government will weigh whether it is the proper
time to do so, based on factors such as whether the economy has truly begun to
recover, he said.</P>

      <P>The patterned innovation,  green building, information and communications
technology (ICT), and smart electric car sectors were added Friday by Premier Wu

      <P>Wu's predecessor Liu Chao-shiuan had already designated specialty agriculture,
green energy, health care, tourism, cultural innovation and biotechnology as
industries with outstanding potential that could make significant contributions
to Taiwan's economy.</P>

      <P>According to Wu, 14 ICT-related products manufactured by Taiwan are at the top
of their respective markets around the globe, especially the IC design,
semiconductor and LED display panel sectors.</P>

      <P>A grassroots campaign to initiate a national referendum on restarting
negotiations on U.S. beef imports has passed its first hurdle, the Central
Election Commission (CEC) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The campaign was launched by the Consumers' Foundation and several other civic
groups to appeal for a national referendum that will ask voters to veto the
government's decision in November to open Taiwan's market to U.S. bone-in beef,
ground beef and beef offal and demand that the government renegotiate a beef
trade protocol with the United States.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's Referendum Act, referendum campaigners must first obtain
the signatures of at least 0.5 percent of eligible voters in the most recent
presidential election to have their proposal accepted by the CEC.</P>
      <P>Needing to collect 86,000 signatures to get past the first hurdle,  trade
protocol renegotiation advocates submitted their initiative with the endorsement
of 130,459 signatures to the CEC Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After an initial screening, CEC officials said, the referendum proposal has
passed the first threshold as 129,065 signatures submitted by the advocacy
groups were found to be valid, far exceeding the minimum requirement.</P>
      <P>"The referendum initiative will be referred to the Executive Yuan Referendum
Screening Committee soon for confirmation, " said CEC Secretary-General Teng
Tien-you.</P>
      <P>If the committee sanctions the proposal, the referendum campaign will enter the
second stage, where the civic groups must collect the signatures of at least 5
percent of the electorate -- in this case 860,000 eligible voters.</P>
      <P>Only if this second hurdle is passed will a national referendum on the beef
trade issue take place in accordance with the country's Referendum Act.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington signed a protocol Oct. 22 under which Taiwan agreed to
lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and certain other beef products, including
ground beef and beef offal.</P>
      <P>However, consumer rights activists have contended that the importation of high-
risk beef products could put consumers at risk of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>With their appeals for re-opening Taiwan-U.S. beef talks having been rejected by
the administration, advocacy groups have decided to push for a referendum.</P>

designated as a national park by the Executive Yuan, Premier Wu Den-yih
announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will soon announce the decision to set up a park
administration under the Ministry of the Interior to take over the park's

      <P>Stressing that the government is resolved to pursuing sustainable growth
nationwide and fully protect the public's health, Wu gave his assurance that the
government will never walk the old path again in its quest for a "green" Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I made the decision to terminate the 70-year-old mining business in two
mountain areas -- Chaishan and Panpingshan -- when serving as Kaohsiung mayor,
and now it is time we take action to preserve their natural environment," the
premier said.</P>
      <P>"The government is fully committed to developing  southern regions,  including a
future special municipality  composed of Kaohsiung City and County that will be
merged next year," he added.</P>
      <P>Chaishan is a scenic spot located in Kaohsiung City's Gushan district and forms
a natural protective screen for the city -- the largest in southern Taiwan. The
famous Sizihwan is located at Chaishan's foothills.</P>
      <P>In recent years, many mountain climbers in Chaishan have been harassed by

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will step up its protests
against the upcoming cross-Taiwan Strait talks to be held in Taichung, with
various demonstrations planned for Dec. 21-23 in addition to a march and rally
on Dec. 20, officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The DPP came to the decision one day after the initerary of the fourth round of
talks between the chief negotiators on each side -- Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF)  Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin -- was made public.</P>
      <P>According to the initerary released by the Mainland Affairs Council, Chen will
arrive in Taichung Dec. 21 and meet with Chiang Dec. 22 to sign four cross-
strait agreements regarding fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine
inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the
avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of Chen's visit, the pro-independence DPP had earlier announced
a plan to hold a march Dec. 20 in the central city to protest the proposed
signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP decided Friday that the protest campaign will be extended to cover the
first three days of Chen's stay in Taichung, in order to highlight the
"unreasonableness" of the Chiang-Chen talks, party officials said.</P>
      <P>Among the many protest ideas raised by party members were flash mobs and having
50 model planes hovering over the venue, they said, adding that further
discussions will be held to finalize the details of the planned protests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, expressing concerns over the DPP's planned action, local politicians
from the ruling Kuomintang urged the opposition party to make sure the protests
are non-violent so that the talks can proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>Chang Hung-nien, speaker of the Taichung City Council, said that the DPP should

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chaishan, a popular hiking area in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, will be
designated as a national park by the Executive Yuan, Premier Wu Den-yih
announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will soon announce the decision to set up a park
administration under the Ministry of the Interior to take over the park's
management, Wu said while attending the closing ceremony of a training course
for local leaders sponsored by the southern branch of the Executive Yuan in
Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government is resolved to pursuing sustainable growth
nationwide and fully protect the public's health, Wu gave his assurance that the
government will never walk the old path again in its quest for a "green" Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I made the decision to terminate the 70-year-old mining business in two
mountain areas -- Chaishan and Panpingshan -- when serving as Kaohsiung mayor,
and now it is time we take action to preserve their natural environment," the
premier said.</P>
      <P>"The government is fully committed to developing  southern regions,  including a
future special municipality  composed of Kaohsiung City and County that will be
merged next year," he added.</P>
      <P>Chaishan is a scenic spot located in Kaohsiung City's Gushan district and forms
a natural protective screen for the city -- the largest in southern Taiwan. The
famous Sizihwan is located at Chaishan's foothills.</P>
      <P>In recent years, many mountain climbers in Chaishan have been harassed by
monkeys that roam and beg for food in the area -- the result of a partial
military ban imposed on the mountain a decade ago. (By Emmanuelle Tseng and Flor

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will step up its protests
against the upcoming cross-Taiwan Strait talks to be held in Taichung, with
various demonstrations planned for Dec. 21-23 in addition to a march and rally
on Dec. 20, officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The DPP came to the decision one day after the initerary of the fourth round of
talks between the chief negotiators on each side -- Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF)  Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin -- was made public.</P>
      <P>According to the initerary released by the Mainland Affairs Council, Chen will
arrive in Taichung Dec. 21 and meet with Chiang Dec. 22 to sign four cross-
strait agreements regarding fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine
inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the
avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of Chen's visit, the pro-independence DPP had earlier announced
a plan to hold a march Dec. 20 in the central city to protest the proposed
signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP decided Friday that the protest campaign will be extended to cover the
first three days of Chen's stay in Taichung, in order to highlight the
"unreasonableness" of the Chiang-Chen talks, party officials said.</P>
      <P>Among the many protest ideas raised by party members were flash mobs and having
50 model planes hovering over the venue, they said, adding that further
discussions will be held to finalize the details of the planned protests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, expressing concerns over the DPP's planned action, local politicians
from the ruling Kuomintang urged the opposition party to make sure the protests
are non-violent so that the talks can proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>Chang Hung-nien, speaker of the Taichung City Council, said that the DPP should
take the event in stride because it is intended to address economic issues and
will not touch upon any political subjects.</P>

      <P>A ceramic mosaic of Mexico's most popular religious and cultural icon,  Our Lady
of Guadalupe, will be inaugurated Sunday in Taipei as part of celebrations to
commemorate the reported appearance of the Virgin Mary to a peasant nearly five
centuries ago, according to the Taipei-based Mexican Trade Services
Documentation and Cultural Office.</P>
      <P>"The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe  was donated by the Iberoamerican Community
in Taiwan to observe the Catholic event, "the office said.</P>
      <P>A special Holy Mass is scheduled to be held Sunday at St. Christopher Church
located in Taipei's Little Manila on Zhongshan North Road, along with a ceremony
to inaugurate a St. Damian crucifix and the mosaic of "Our Lady of Guadalupe, "
which have already been set on the sidewalk outside the church.</P>
      <P>The mosaic is made of Talavera tiles from the Mexican city of Puebla, while the
crucifix is made of limestone from Mexico's Guanajuato State.</P>
      <P>Monsignor Paul Russell, the Vatican's charge d'affaires to Taiwan, and clergies
from the United States, the Philippines and Spain,  as well as the local  Latin
American  and Philippine communities, are expected to attend the ceremony.</P>
      <P>According to the traditional account, on Dec. 12, 1531, the Virgin Mary appeared
miraculously to a Native American peasant at Tepeyac, a hill northwest of
downtown Mexico City.</P>
      <P>She identified herself as the Mother of the True God, instructed the seer, Juan
Diego, to have the bishop build a temple on the site, and left an image of
herself imprinted miraculously on his tilma, a poor quality cactus-cloth that
should have deteriorated in 20 years but shows no sign of decay until today.
Diego was canonized by Pope John Paul II July 31, 2002.</P>
      <P>Pope Pius XII declared the Virgin of Guadalupe "Queen of Mexico and Empress of
the Americas" in 1945, and "Patroness of the Americas" in 1946. Pope John XXIII
invoked her as "Mother of the Americas" in 1961, referring to her as Mother and

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has raised the possibility  of holding  a debate  with
opposition  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on the
proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
that the pro-independence party strongly opposes.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the issue during an interview with the cable network CTiTV Friday,
Ma again warned that if such an agreement is not signed, Taiwan will soon face
an exodus of local industries, especially those in the petrochemical sector,
which will greatly affect the country's economy.</P>
      <P>"The DPP is definitely aware of this situation, but it is simply branding  me as
leaning toward China."  said Ma,  who serves concurrently as chairman of the
ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"Could they (the DPP) please identify one thing I did that could be construed as
China-leaning?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes the debate with Tsai will take place after the ECFA
negotiations with China have produced some results, which will be a better time
to determine whether the agreement would be favorable or unfavorable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president gave the assurance that even after the ECFA is signed, the
government will only liberalize the importation of certain necessary items,  and
there will be no expansion  of agricultural imports from China.</P>
      <P>He promised that the government will promote the signing of the ECFA in a
transparent manner because it has the responsibility to make the people
understand that the agreement is essential to preventing marginalizion of
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ma's suggestion of a debate, DPP spokeswoman Hsiao Bi-khim said
her party has been waiting for such an opportunity for a long time and expects
the president to extend an official invitation to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Tsai will respond as soon as she receives the invitation, Hsiao said.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen responded
positively Saturday to President Ma Ying-jeou's suggestion of a debate with her
on the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China,
saying it is the government's responsibility to provide the public with
comprehensive information on the controversial trade deal.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the matter during a trip to the eastern county of Taitung, Tsai
said the DPP has long been supportive of the idea of a debate to discuss ECFA
issues because it believes that holding policy debates is "a responsibility of
political leaders" and "a must in a democratic society."</P>
      <P>"What the government has done so far is mere propaganda, which is not something
that a responsible government should be doing, " she said.</P>
      <P>According to the opposition leader, the Ma administration has an obligation to
explain clearly to the people on the possible long-term effects of the pact on
Taiwan's politics, economy and society and how the administration plans to deal
with them.</P>
      <P>This type of information is needed particularly in light of public opinion polls
that indicate many people have no idea what the ECFA is, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In an interview Friday with the cable network CTiTV, Ma raised the possibility
of debating the ECFA with Tsai, and said he hopes the debate will take place
after there have been some results from the negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>The president again stressed that such an agreement is important to preventing
marginalization of Taiwan's economy and he rejected the pro-independence DPP's
claim that his promotion of the ECFA is an example of him leaning towards China.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on Ma's suggestion Saturday, Premier Wu Den-yih said a debate
between Tsai and Ma, who is also chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, will help
focus the public's attention on the issue.</P>
      <P>It will also help to give the people a better idea of the likely benefits and
disadvantages of the agreement and allow them to form a truer picture of the
situation, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He agreed that a public explanation by the administration is crucial to clearing
up misunderstandings about the government's policies.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, none of the 1,415 Chinese agricultural products that are
allowed into Taiwan were liberalized by the Ma administration, but some farmers
in central and southern Taiwan are convinced that it was Ma who lifted the
restrictions and are concerned that the signing of the ECFA will lead to an
expansion of agricultural imports from China.</P>
      <P>The truth, Wu noted, is that the restrictions on 936 of the items were lifted
during the former DPP administration led by President Chen Shui-bian, and 479
others were allowed in during the previous 50 years.</P>
      <P>Pointing to another example, Wu said although the government has repeatedly
assured the public that Taiwan will not open up to Chinese laborers, many people
are being misled into believing that there will be an influx of Chinese workers
after the signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the government has not been able to clearly explain
the details of the ECFA to the public because there had been no substantial
results from the negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>Today, however, the lists of products to be covered by an early harvest program
under the trade deal are gradually taking shape through negotiations between the
two sides, he said.</P>
      <P>The results of a recent survey revealed that 48 percent of the people are in
favor of the pact while more than 30 percent are against it, which indicates
that the government should step up communication with the people and legislators
to seek a stronger consensus on the issue, Wu said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top ranked National Taiwan University (NTU) said Saturday that there is
no need to worry about the government's policy to allow the admission of Chinese
students, and gave the assurance that it will find the best strategy to continue
to develop leadership talent in the greater China region.</P>
      <P>Amid worry in some quarters over Taiwan's plan to recognize diplomas from top
Chinese universities and to allow Chinese students to study at Taiwan
universities, NTU president Lee Si-chen said that NTU is the best school in the
great China region, and people should trust Taiwan's quality of education.</P>
      <P>Lee said at a seminar that NTU has produced many leaders in the past, and he is
confident the trend will continue.</P>
      <P>In order to attract outstanding Chinese applicants, Lee said, NTU will seek
corporate donations to establish scholarships for such students.</P>
      <P>He also pointed  that over the past 50 years the Taiwan government's education
policy regarding overseas Chinese students has been very successful, adding that
there is no need to debate or worry about the admission of Chinese students once
they are classified either as overseas Chinese or as foreign students.</P>
      <P>According to the 2009 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), which was
published by the Center for World-Class Universities and the Institute of Higher

      <P>A national inoculation program against influenza A(H1N1) , commonly known as
swine flu, was launched Saturday, targeting the entire population in an effort
to stem the spread of the virus in the country.</P>
      <P>The central Department  of Health (DOH)  has set up free vaccination stations at
all public health centers, DOH-run and DOH-contracted hospitals, and in
department stores, hypermarkets, railway stations and temples around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Health Chang Shan-chwen, while on a visit to Taoyuan County
earlier in the day to inspect the inoculation operations there, called on the
public to get vaccinated against the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>The northern Taiwan county, where the country's main gateway Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport is located, has opened temporary immunization stations at
18 popular hypermarkets.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in Taipei County, the shots were being offered at 262 hospitals, 29
public health centers and other stations.</P>
      <P>Taipei County health officials said that the public is responding well to the
initiative, judging from the fact that over 400 people were waiting at the
Banciao public health center in the morning to receive vaccinations.</P>
      <P>The population of Taipei County in northern Taiwan is more than 3.8 million
people, which means that it is the largest administrative region in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC) , as of
Friday over 3.2 million people, or 14 percent of the country's population, had
been inoculated against swine flu.</P>
      <P>Among the 12 groups prioritized in the national immunization program that began
on Nov. 1, elementary school students had the highest rate of vaccination at 75
percent, followed by medical and health care personnel at 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The lowest rate was recorded among pregnant women, at 8 percent, the CECC
statistics show.</P>
      <P>Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw said the
low rate of H1N1 immunization among the 200,000 pregnant women in the country
may be linked to two cases of stillbirth.</P>
      <P>"Although it has not been confirmed that the stillbirths resulted from the
vaccine, the inoculation rate among pregnant women remains low," he said.</P>
      <P>Other reported problems and side effects associated with the vaccine include
deaths among elderly people and dizziness among students, which have dissuaded
some people from getting vaccinated.</P>
      <P>DOH officials admitted the reports of dizziness have scared some parents, who
withdrew their permission for their children to receive the shots.</P>
      <P>One of the concerned parents, opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator
Chen Ying, told the CNA that she will wait until the vaccine is proven safe
before allowing her children to be inoculated.</P>
      <P>Kuo Han-pin, director of the pulmonary medicine department at Chang Gung
Hospital in Linkou, Taipei County, said that about half of his outpatients had
been vaccinated. He said he will try to persuade the reluctant ones to have the
shots because the side effects are much milder than the symptoms of the disease.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital physician Yao Chien-an in the family
medicine department said he is also doing the same, as one vaccinated person can
help prevent the infection of many others.</P>
      <P>If someone asks whether or not to take the shot, "I will strongly recommend that
they do," Yao said.</P>
      <P>The H1N1 virus has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people around the
world this year, including 33 in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The government will do its best to improve Taiwan's handling of human rights
issues in the future, President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday at the opening of the
Jingmei Human Rights and Cultural Park in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Ma said the opening of the park is a landmark in
Taiwan's transition from an authoritarian regime to a democratic society.</P>
      <P>Emile Sheng, minister of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA),
Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng, and former Vice President Annette Lu also
attended the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Ma bowed to apologize on behalf of the government for the persecution of many
democracy activists in the past and pledged to take concrete and swift action to
further protect human rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president  said that Taiwan's recent adoption  of two international human
rights conventions as domestic law reflected the government's commitment to
safeguarding human rights in this country.</P>
      <P>In his address at the event, Sheng said the purpose of the park is to recover
the historical facts pertaining to human rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sheng said that after reading several letters sent to him by the relatives of
some political victims, he is deeply convinced that the CCA has to make a
greater effort to obtain more content for exhibitions at the park.</P>
      <P>Sheng paid tribute to the many people whom he said fought and made sacrifices to
achieve freedom and democracy in Taiwan, and he urged the public not to take
Taiwan's progress in this regard for granted.</P>
      <P>The CCA minister also solicited the opinion and advice of the public to better

    <HEADLINE>President urges reduction of greenhouse gas emissions</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Saturday called on the public to take steps to help
reduce carbon dioxide emissions and build Taiwan into an environmentally
responsible country.</P>
      <P>In his weekly address published on the Presidential Office's Web site, Ma noted
that Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol or the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). He warned that the country
could soon become a victim of climate change and be punished by international
organizations if it fails to respond to global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions.</P>
      <P>"For our own benefit and in order for Taiwan to become a creative and
constructive member of the international community, we should think of energy
conservation and carbon reduction as a virtue and work together to establish
Taiwan an environmentally responsible country," the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma's remarks coincided with a UNFCCC meeting that is currently taking place in
Copenhagen, Denmark, at which some 100 heads of states from around the world are
trying to decide on the future extent of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
and work out a new international climate change agreement before the Kyoto
Protocol expires in 2012.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which has 3 per mille of the world's total population, produces around 1
percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions, a number that Ma said is way too
high and is worrying.</P>
      <P>Climate change is no longer a fictional story or a disaster scene created by
special effects in movies such as "The Day After Tomorrow" and "2012," said Ma.
Humans would put themselves in irreversible danger if they allow continued
deterioration of the situation, he warned.</P>
      <P>Decades ago, it might have been hard for people to imagine that some island
countries in the South Pacific Ocean would soon have to relocate their entire
populations for fear of being submerged as the sea levels continue to rise, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that although it is already winter, the weather in Taiwan is still as
warm as at the beginning of autumn or the end of summer. The Chinese calendar,
developed through thousands of years of observations of nature, may have to be
rewritten if the situation continues to worsen, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration has laid out an ambitious plan
to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and has established targets to cut emissions to
the 2008 level by 2020, to the 2000 level by 2025, and to half of the 2000 level
by 2050, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Some might wonder why the government has set such stringent targets, he said,
but if Taiwan does not reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, it would be punished
by other countries around the world, he said.</P>

      <P>The number of Chinese citizens who run away after arriving legally in Taiwan has
been increasing since the country expanded its admission of sightseers from
China in July 2008, according to a report released earlier this week by the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The situation calls for immediate action by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
and related agencies to address the possible effects on public order, travel
security and tourism quality, the report stated.</P>
      <P>It noted that in the past 17 months since the liberalization policy was
implemented, the number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan has jumped by 9
percent.</P>
      <P>The number of runaways, however, has also been rising, it stated.</P>
      <P>While there were four runaways, with one remaining on the loose, in 2007, the
number went up to six in 2008, four of which have not yet been found, the report
said.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics compiled by the National Immigration Agency show that in
the first nine months of 2009, there were 15 runaways, 13 of whom have not been
located, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Universities to raise scholarships funds for Chinese students</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several leading universities in Taiwan are seeking to attract outstanding
Chinese students by offering them scholarships, but instead of using government
subsidies for this purpose, the universities plan to raise funds from the
business and industry sector.</P>
      <P>At a seminar Saturday  on the impact of opening Taiwan's universities to Chinese
students, university presidents from the host National Chengchi University
(NCCU) , National Taiwan University (NTU), and National Cheng Kung University
(NCKU) shared the view that offering scholarships would be a good incentive for
Chinese students to pursue advanced studies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>NCCU President Wu Se-hwa said that he would consider offering scholarships
comparable to those granted by U.S. universities.</P>
      <P>As the Ministry of Education has reiterated that universities are not allowed to
use allocations from the government to set up scholarships  for Chinese
students,  NCCU has contacted  local enterprises in an effort to raise funds, he
added.</P>
      <P>Expanding on the NTU proposal, NCKU President Michael M.C. Lai said he plans to
set up a foundation  that will offer full scholarships  (tuition and board and
accommodation) ,  partial scholarships that cover living expenses, and others
that pay tuition, for students with various qualifications.</P>
      <P>Fan Liming, vice president of Shandong University, one of the government-focused
universities on the Chinese mainland, said at the seminar that once Taiwan
begins to recognize diplomas issued by Chinese universities, schools in Taiwan
will become more attractive to Chinese graduate students because they will be
able to pursue studies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and earn double
degrees.</P>
      <P>Since 1998, the Chinese government has selected more than 30 research
universities to receive special subsidies, ranging from hundreds of millions to
billions of yuan annually, in order to raise academic standards. The initiative
was taken under the "985 Project", which was named after a phrase used by then
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on May 4, 1998 in a speech that pledged support
for prestigious universities.</P>
      <P>However, according to Fan, Taiwan's current policy of "three restrictions and
six prohibitions" would frustrate the interests of many Chinese students.</P>
      <P>In November 2008 when then Education Minister Cheng Jui-cheng announced the
policy of opening Taiwan universities to Chinese students, he stressed that
there will be three restrictions -- recognition  of certificates  will  be
limited  to only  some universities, only limited numbers of students will be
admitted to Taiwan's universities, and only limited categories of studies will
be recognized.</P>
      <P>In addition  to the three  restrictions,  the  educational authorities also set
six principles -- student admissions can only be acquired through applications,
the number of Chinese students admitted will not affect the quota for local
students, schools are not allowed to use government allocations to set up
scholarships for Chinese students, Chinese students are not permitted to work
other than in campus jobs such as research assistantships, Chinese students are
not allowed to take examinations for vocational certificates, and Chinese
students are not permitted to seek jobs in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fan said that she could understand the reasons for Taiwan's step-by-step
approach to the recognition of certificates issued by China universities.
However, in order to attract more Chinese students to Taiwan, the "three
restrictions and six prohibitions" policy needs to be reviewed and relaxed to
allow more incentives to be offered to Chinese students, she added.</P>

      <P>St. Lucia Prime Minister Stephenson King has expressed his government's
gratitude to Taiwan for the medical assistance provided in the wake of a fire at
a local hospital, according to a statement released by the Taiwan embassy in the
Caribbean country.</P>
      <P>St. Jude Hospital in Vieux Fort faced a severe shortage of medical staff due to
the departure of many foreign volunteer physicians  following  the fire that
engulfed the hospital in September.</P>
      <P>Upon receiving a request for help from the government of St. Lucia, Taiwan's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched a volunteer medical team of six health
care workers from Changhua Christian Hospital, which maintains sisterhood ties
with St. Jude Hospital.</P>
      <P>The members of the team were received by King Thursday, prior to their return to
Taiwan after three weeks of service in St. Lucia.</P>
      <P>King told the volunteers that their performance was highly praised by the
patients, and that the staff of St. Jude Hospital had also learned a lot from
their advanced medical skills and professional work attitude.</P>
      <P>In a report to parliament Wednesday, King announced that his government  has
obtained  a  commitment  from  international organizations and diplomatic
allies, including the Republic of China, to help rebuild St. Jude Hospital.</P>
      <P>In addition, King said he was thankful to the ROC government for helping his
country draft a reconstruction blueprint in a short period of time, the details
of which has been reviewed by the World Health Organization and the Pan American
Health Organization.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction project will begin in January 2010, with the first phase of
the work expected to be completed within 18 months, he said.</P>

      <P>The first cross-Taiwan Strait conference on the promotion of exchanges and
cooperation between Taiwan and China in the field of medicine opened Saturday in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The event was attended by high-ranking  Chinese officials, including He Luli,
vice chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of
the People's Republic of China; Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits; and his deputy Wang Fuqing.</P>
      <P>However, several Taiwanese health officials that were originally scheduled to
attend the event failed to show up at Saturday's opening ceremony. Their absence
was seen by some Chinese participants as related to the setback Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang suffered in the local elections last week.</P>
      <P>Wang said in his opening remarks that medical exchanges will play an important
role in the development of cross-strait relations, as they will cover areas such
as basic medical science, clinical medicine, Chinese Medicine, healthcare
business management, medical education and medical technology.</P>
      <P>"The outlook is bright for the medical sectors of Taiwan and China to strengthen
cooperation under the new cross-strait relations "Wang said.</P>
      <P>Over the years, China has introduced a number of measures to encourage medical
exchanges between the two sides, Wang said. It has encouraged Taiwanese citizens
to take medical doctor qualification tests or apply for licenses to practice
medicine in China, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese medical institutions are also welcome to work with their Chinese
counterparts to set up hospitals in mainland China, where several Taiwanese-
funded hospitals and health institutions are already in operation, he said.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Cross-straits Medicine Exchanges Association, a quasi-official
agency under the authority of the PRC's Ministry of Health,  the two-day
conference is themed "Creating a win-win opportunity -- cross-strait cooperation
and development of the medical industry."</P>
      <P>Some 500 experts and scholars from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Macau are
expected to participate in the event to discuss hospital management, technology
development in the medical industry and globalization  of healthcare  services.
They will also  share experiences in the field of stereotactic radiosurgery and
the treatment of cardiovascular disease.</P>

      <P>The NT$1.2 billion(US$37.3 million) Overseas Credit Guarantee Fund needs further
rectification to assist more overseas Chinese with their financing needs, the
head of the Cabinet-level Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>OCAC Minister Wu Ying-yih said at a meeting with overseas Chinese groups in the
city of Portland, Oregon that he plans to put greater effort into rectifying the
fund after it transferred from the Financial Supervisory Commission and put
under the management of the OCAC.</P>
      <P>Wu said he hopes that the fund will be able to guarantee loans to more overseas
Chinese who are unable to borrow from local banks.</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, the Overseas Credit Guarantee Fund, which was
established in 1988, had provided guarantees for a total of 5,500 borrowers for
credit amounting to US$1.06 billion.</P>
      <P>It has helped overseas Chinese and Taiwanese enterprises, in more than nine
industries, to obtain loans totalling US$1.6 billion from financial
institutions, its statistics show.</P>
      <P>The highest number of applications, 1,595, were from the Los Angeles area, and
New York was the second with 830.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the fund is to provide credit guaranties for overseas Chinese
businesses and Taiwanese enterprises that have growth potential but lack of
collateral, so as to assist them in securing loans from financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the OCAC chief also said that overseas Chinese education, which
accounts for about 50 percent of the OCAC's annual budget, is still its main
focus that it will put much more effort into managing that aspect well.</P>
      <P>Currently, OCAC textbooks are printed in both simplified and traditional
Chinese,  with Zhu-yin and Pinyin phonetic system included, he noted. It is
hoped that the OCAC could provide more assistance to overseas Chinese teachers
and help more foreign nationals understand Taiwan through these textbooks, he
added.</P>

      <P>Traffic congestion is the main source of complaints among citizens of Taipei
City, followed by high housing prices and surging consumer prices, according to
the results of a survey released Saturday.</P>
      <P>Traffic jams were cited by 49.3 percent of the respondents in the poll, high
housing prices by 19.7 percent, and rising consumer prices by 16.9 percent,
according to Taipei City councilors Hung Chien-i and Yen Kuan-sheng who
publicized the results.</P>
      <P>Also on the top-10 list in descending order were growing unemployment (9
percent) , the problematic Wenhu line on the city's mass rapid train system (8.3
percent), shortage of parking spaces (8 percent), bumpy roads (7 percent) ,
frequent road construction work (6.7 percent) , poor public order (5.9 percent)
and low salaries (4 percent).</P>
      <P>The survey was held to allow Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin to hear the voices of the
people, Yen said.</P>
      <P>Hung called on the municipal authorities to pay greater heed to public
complaints related to road traffic, noting that it is the source of 80 percent
of the public's grievances. He urged the city government to re-examine the
necessity for exclusive bus and cycling lanes in some road segments.</P>
      <P>In response to the councilors' comments, Taipei City Government spokeswoman Rose
Chao promised that more effective measures will be taken to improve traffic
congestion and rising unemployment in the capital. Attention will also be given
to a road resurfacing project that is currently being carried out in many areas
of the city, she added.</P>
      <P>However, Chao had reservations about the city's ability to address high housing
and consumer prices, noting that these are nationwide issues.</P>
      <P>The survey was conduced Dec.  10-11,  through 1,073 valid questionnaires. It had
a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</P>
      <P>According  to a poll carried out late last month by the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC), the top ten public complaints in
the country were about rampant telephone scams, high unemployment, high consumer
prices, high housing prices in urban areas, food safety, lack of parking lots,
drug abuse, strays dogs, the high cost of elderly care, and too many traffic
tickets.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should remove a requirement for individual Chinese citizens applying to
enter Taiwan to list their profession and reason for wanting to visit, Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) deputy chairman suggested Saturday.</P>
      <P>"In light of the current exchanges (between the two sides across the Taiwan
Strait) , the two requirements should be removed, " Kao Koong-lian said.</P>
      <P>Kao, who is also secretary-general of the semi-official SEF, said at a public
policy forum on cross-strait exchanges that it is not necessary for Chinese
professionals visiting at the invitation of local groups to include such
information on their applications.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintains a ban on visits by Chinese public servants, Communists and
military personnel, but this cannot be strictly observed as Chinese visitors who
are industry leaders, business managers, and technicians also serve in the China
government, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan allows visits by groups of Chinese sightseeers and
professionals engaged in exchanges in the fields of culture, education, science,
technology, health, sports and the media, and for business purposes.</P>
      <P>Regarding the upcoming fourth round of cross-strait talks on Dec. 22 in Taichung
City, Kao confirmed that the two sides will not sign the widely discussed cross-
strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) during that round of
negotiations between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart
Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"There will be dialogue and discussions at the most, " he said, explaining that
the ECFA issue has not yet been placed on the agenda for SEF-ARATS negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao expressed the hope that the issue of intellectual property rights
will be included in the fifth round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>He also said that he hopes culture and education will be two of the major topics
in the cross-strait negotiations, as they can serve as a good "lubricant" in
relations between the two political rivals.</P>

      <P>Taiwan athletes bagged another silver medal and three more bronzes at the East
Asian Games in Hong Kong Saturday, moving into fifth place on the medals table
one day before the games end.</P>
      <P>In the men's discus event, Taiwan's Wang Yao-hui finished in second place with a
throw of 55.18 meters in his last try, while Chang Ming-huang won a bronze medal
with a throw of 54.92 meters in his second attempt.</P>
      <P>The gold medal went to Japan's Shiro Kobayashi, who threw 55.98 meters.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed regret over the results, saying that they could have been very
different had he not been faulted by the judge in the second throw, which he
said would have been easily over 57 meters.</P>
      <P>"I didn't grab the chance to win the gold medal when I could. I need to adjust
my technique because when I throw, the angle of elevation tends to be too big,"
he said.</P>
      <P>In finals of the 100-meter sprint, Taiwan's Yi Wei-chen finished third in a time

Japan's Shintaro Kimura clocked 10.39 seconds to take second place.</P>
      <P>In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Taiwan's Chang Ai-hua took a bronze medal,
finishing in 1 minute 3.57 seconds, while Japan's Miyabi Tago and Kana Tsuru
took gold and silver, respectively.</P>
      <P>China is leading the medals table with 91 golds and a total medal count of 189,

      <P>No serious side effects were reported among the people who were vaccinated
Saturday, except for 15 cases of people complaining of dizziness after the
shots, he said.</P>
      <P>However, after resting at the immunization stations, all 15 recovered, he added.</P>
      <P>The national immunization drive will continue Sunday and the rest of the week at

advantage of the opportunity to get vaccinated.</P>
      <P>The comprehensive national H1N1 vaccination program was launched weeks after the
first shots were administered on Nov. 1 to people listed in priority groups,

      <P>Regarding the upcoming fourth round of cross-strait talks on Dec. 22 in Taichung
City, Kao confirmed that the two sides will not sign the widely discussed cross-
strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) during that round of
negotiations between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart
Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"There will be dialogue and discussions at the most, " he said, explaining that
the ECFA issue has not yet been placed on the agenda for SEF-ARATS negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao expressed the hope that the issue of intellectual property rights
will be included in the fifth round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>He also said that he hopes culture and education will be two of the major topics
in the cross-strait negotiations, as they can serve as a good "lubricant" in
relations between the two political rivals.</P>

      <P>Taiwan athletes bagged another silver medal and three more bronzes at the East
Asian Games in Hong Kong Saturday, moving into fifth place on the medals table
one day before the games end.</P>
      <P>In the men's discus event, Taiwan's Wang Yao-hui finished in second place with a
throw of 55.18 meters in his last try, while Chang Ming-huang won a bronze medal
with a throw of 54.92 meters in his second attempt.</P>
      <P>The gold medal went to Japan's Shiro Kobayashi, who threw 55.98 meters.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed regret over the results, saying that they could have been very
different had he not been faulted by the judge in the second throw, which he
said would have been easily over 57 meters.</P>
      <P>"I didn't grab the chance to win the gold medal when I could. I need to adjust
my technique because when I throw, the angle of elevation tends to be too big,"
he said.</P>
      <P>In finals of the 100-meter sprint, Taiwan's Yi Wei-chen finished third in a time
of 10.49 seconds. China's Su Bingtian won the race in 10.33 seconds, while
Japan's Shintaro Kimura clocked 10.39 seconds to take second place.</P>
      <P>In the women's 400-meter hurdles, Taiwan's Chang Ai-hua took a bronze medal,
finishing in 1 minute 3.57 seconds, while Japan's Miyabi Tago and Kana Tsuru
took gold and silver, respectively.</P>
      <P>China is leading the medals table with 91 golds and a total medal count of 189,
followed by Japan with 51 golds and 163 total, South Korea with 36 golds and 124
total, and Hong Kong with 20 golds and 89 total.</P>
      <P>The 5th East Asian Games is being held in Hong Kong Dec. 5-13. Some 2,300
athletes from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, North Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau,
Mongolia, and Guam are competing in 262 events in 22 sports. It is the largest
international multi-sport event ever held in Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>More than 500,000 people in Taiwan were vaccinated against influenza A(H1N1),
commonly known as swine flu, on Saturday, the first day of a national free
inoculation program that targets the entire population, a health official said.</P>
      <P>Most county and city health authorities around the country reported that they
had met their goal for the day in terms of the number of people inoculated,
Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw said.</P>
      <P>No serious side effects were reported among the people who were vaccinated
Saturday, except for 15 cases of people complaining of dizziness after the
shots, he said.</P>
      <P>However, after resting at the immunization stations, all 15 recovered, he added.</P>
      <P>The national immunization drive will continue Sunday and the rest of the week at
all public hospitals around the country, Chou said, urging the public to take
advantage of the opportunity to get vaccinated.</P>
      <P>The comprehensive national H1N1 vaccination program was launched weeks after the
first shots were administered on Nov. 1 to people listed in priority groups,
such as typhoon victims in shelters, high-risk medical personnel, elementary
school students, pre-school children, pregnant women and seriously ill patients,
Chou said.</P>
      <P>The daily average over the past month was 150,000 to 190,000 doses, he added.</P>

order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you can also make the people keep
away from wrongdoing, but they will lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If,
on the other hand, in government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain
order by encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense of
shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

      <P>The Taipei Zoo was turned into a "mini United Nations" Sunday as many new
immigrants in Taiwan donned their own countries' attire during a walk to mark
International Immigrants Day, which falls on Dec. 18.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah, dressed in South Korean garb, greeted
participants in Korean.</P>
      <P>"There are 960,000 new immigrants in Taiwan, and they have injected fresh blood
into this land and enriched Taiwan's culture, " Jiang said.</P>
      <P>National Immigration Agency (NIA) Director-General Hsieh Li-kung, who wore
traditional clothing from Southeast Asia during the event, laid out his agency's
future goals.</P>
      <P>"Human rights, jobs, language training, and helping people get acclimated to
life in Taiwan will be the goals the NIA will strive for," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The NIA official noted that his agency is already working with the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications to deal with the top complaint among new immigrants -- the use of
different romanization systems in public facilities and on roads.</P>
      <P>Many foreign nationals who took part in Sunday's walk have favorable impressions
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nathan Kaiser from Switzerland, who has lived in Taiwan for a decade and was
with his Taiwanese wife and their two-and-a-half-year-old son, said he loves the
living environment here and intends to stay for a long time.</P>
      <P>Salieh from Malaysia, who works in Taiwan and has her two children with her,
said she doesn't worry about "cultural barriers" because "everybody here is very
friendly."</P>
      <P>Malaysian Kamalrudin Bin Ali, in Taiwan with his children to visit his wife, who
works here, said he feels Taiwan's people are friendly to Islamic culture.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior, which sponsored the activity, estimated that more
than 2,000 people showed up for Sunday's walk. Most were Taiwanese, but there
were also many foreign housemaids and foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese students join Copenhagen climate parade</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Dec.  12 (CNA)

(By Lin Yu-li and Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 30 university students from Taiwan, acting as environmental ambassadors,
joined thousands of protesters on the streets of Copenhagen Saturday to demand
that world leaders take stronger action to fight climate change.</P>
      <P>Some of the Taiwanese students were dressed as the endangered Formosan black
bear, while others wore cardboard cutouts depicting Taipei 101 -- one of the
world's tallest buildings -- with a ring-shaped life preserver to show that
Taiwan is under threat of rising sea levels.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-chin, a National Taiwan University student, said the group wanted to
express Taiwan's concern about global warming and climate change and its
willingness to help resolve the crisis, at the same time as the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is being held in Denmark's
capital.</P>
      <P>Many individuals and environmental groups from around the world braved 2 degree
Celsius temperatures to participate in the march, with some dressing as polar
bears, which are under serious threat of becoming extinct because of global
warming.</P>
      <P>Donning a Formosan black bear costume, National Chung Hsing University student
Chen Kuan-wei said he was proud to shout the name "Taiwan" at an international
airport and bring the symbol of Taiwan's wildlife conservation efforts to
Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been excluded, however, from participating in the U.N. climate talks
as a "state" because it is neither a member of the U.N. nor a signatory nation
of the UNFCCC.</P>
      <P>To reflect the country's discontent, Cheng Yuan-ching,  an official of Taiwan's
Government Information Office posted in Denmark, wrote a letter to the editor
published  on Saturday  in the Jyllands-Posten  --  Denmark's  largest newspaper
with a daily circulation of over 170,000.</P>
      <P>Cheng said in the letter that although the conference being held from Dec. 7-18
is the most important climate conference in history, event organizers excluded
Taiwan from participating, in defiance of the goal of acknowledging that the
global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all
countries.</P>
      <P>Even Taiwan's Industrial Technology  Research Institute,  a nongovernmental
organization, was listed as being in China, Cheng protested.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's inability  to join a U.N.  carbon emission quota allocation will hurt
the competitiveness of Taiwan's green technology industry and affect its
development, he argued.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the event's organizers should have invited Taiwan to attend the
UNFCCC meetings as an observer, adding that it could provide support that they
cannot afford to ignore.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's exclusion from the conference,  the young environmental
ambassadors posted the minutes of the meetings and what they saw and heard
online at http: //blog.yam.com/tisecop15 to give the public a better
understanding of the proceedings.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, NTU graduate student Lin Ting-chie said that when he chatted with
people from other countries during the rally, he expressed the concerns of
Taiwan's students over global warming and told them that global warming is a
public issue that stretches beyond boundaries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA debate should be well planned: DPP chief</HEADLINE>

12/13/09  18:01:12

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou should come up with a well-devised format if he is
sincere in suggesting holding a public debate on his administration's
controversial plan to sign a free trade pact with China, an opposition leader
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"If President Ma indeed sees the need for a debate on the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) deal with Beijing, he should flesh out a
detailed plan instead of merely floating the idea to news media, " said
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government is obliged to keep the public informed of the
government's policy plans and work agenda, Tsai said prior to her departure for
a visit to Japan that she hopes the ECFA debate idea will not turn out to be
just another of Ma's political "teases."</P>
      <P>On several previous occasions, Tsai contended, Ma also offered to meet or debate
her on major policy issues.</P>
      <P>"However, those offers just left me feeling like I was being used... This time
around, I hope the president is not playing us any more," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Ma has touted the urgency of striking an ECFA deal with China to protect Taiwan
from being marginalized after a free trade area agreement between China and the
Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) takes effect at the start of next
year.</P>
      <P>The DPP and its pro-independence allies, however, are wary about signing such an
agreement with China, fearing that the pact could make Taiwan more reliant on
China economically and eventually lead to its annexation by China.</P>
      <P>Some political analysts attributed  the ruling Kuomintang's worse-than-expected
showing in the Dec. 5 local elections partly to public discontent with the
government's ECFA proposal, and Ma, who doubles as KMT chairman, decided to
become more visible publicly on the issue.</P>
      <P>In a television interview over the weekend that focused in part on the potential
trade pact, Ma said he would be willing to debate Tsai on ECFA-related  issues
in response to the interviewer's question.</P>
      <P>Tsai said, however, that she would not like to see such a debate end up as
simply political maneuvering or verbal sparring.</P>
      <P>She contended that through the process of debates, the people could better
understand the government's major policies and what impact they could have on
them, enabling them to decide if they agree with the policy or not.</P>
      <P>"Public debates among social elites are a healthy thing, " Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Wang becomes free agent after Yankees fail to tender new contract</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Dec. 13 (CNA)
12/13/09  18:44:19
(By Hwang Jaw-pyng, Sarah Lin and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New York Yankees decided not to offer Chien-Ming Wang a new contract before
Saturday's deadline, a move that officially made the two-time 19-game winner a
free agent and left his future with the Yankees in doubt.</P>
      <P>"There's no doubt that we had to make a tough decision, " said Yankees general
manager Brian Cashman. "We are still hopeful that our relationship can continue,
but those decisions are yet to be made."</P>
      <P>The Yankees could re-sign Wang to a lesser, incentive-based deal, as many have
speculated they will attempt to do, but Wang's agent, Alan Nero, said the right-
hander will now engage all 30 clubs as a free agent and take all other options
into consideration.</P>
      <P>"I think it's difficult to rationalize a non-tender as further building a bridge
with a team, but we'll see," Nero said.</P>
      <P>Wang could be a relatively inexpensive addition for another club, and some
believe that the Los Angeles Dodgers -- managed by Joe Torre, who managed the
Yankees when Wang had his best years -- would have some interest.</P>
      <P>Wang, who will turn 30 in March, earned US$5 million this season, becoming the
highest paid Taiwanese player in any U.S. professional sport, but he could only
manage a 1-6 record and 9.64 ERA in 12 appearances.</P>
      <P>He has never been the same since injuring his foot while running the bases in a
game in Houston on June 15, 2008. The injury forced him to miss the rest of that
season, and he was obviously not fully recovered at the start of 2009.</P>
      <P>After three disastrous starts, he was sent to the minors to continue his
rehabilitation. He then returned to the Yankees in late May and seemed to be
making progress until he injured his right shoulder.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is eligible for arbitration, would have had to be tendered a contract
of at least US$4 million, or no more than a 20 percent pay cut from his 2009
salary.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese hurler is not expected to pitch until sometime between April and
June, and the Yankees obviously did not want to risk committing US$4 million to
a pitcher who may not be productive in the upcoming season.</P>
      <P>Wang's mother-in-law said in Kaohsiung Sunday that all family members support
Wang no matter what team he eventually joins.</P>
      <P>She also said that Wang has not shown much emotion over the Yankees' latest move
and that the family "will respect his decision."</P>
      <P>Wang returned with his wife and their new born son to Tainan last month, but he
couldn't reached as of Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Beset by injuries since signing with the Yankees in 2000, Wang was finally
called up to the big league club in 2005, when he compiled a respectable 8-5
record and 4.02 ERA.</P>
      <P>He had a breakout season in 2006, winning 19 games to tie for the major league
with Johan Santana and posting a 3.63 ERA. He finished second to Santana in the
voting for the American League Cy Young award, the most prestigious award for
Major League pitchers.</P>
      <P>He again recorded 19 wins in 2007 despite starting the season in the disabled
list.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan bags two more gold medals at East Asian Games</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan held off challenges from Japan and China to secure the coveted gold medal
in the men's 4x100m relay at the 2009 East Asian Games Sunday and then completed
its gold medal haul in Hong Kong by winning the men's doubles in badminton.</P>
      <P>The two gold medals brought Taiwan's total to eight in the quadrennial sports
competition, which ended Sunday.</P>
      <P>The team of Tu Chia-lin, Liu Yuan-kai, Tsai Meng-lin and Yi Wei-chen won the
4x100m relay in a time of 39.31 seconds, its season's best but still four-tenths
of a second off the East Asian Games record of 38.93 set by Japan in 2001.</P>
      <P>Japan was second with a time of 39.40, and China won bronze with atime of 39.86.</P>
      <P>The gold medal was only the fifth Taiwan has won in the athletics competition --
traditionally a weak discipline for the country's athletes -- at the East Asian
Games.</P>
      <P>In 1993, sprinter Wang Hui-chen won gold in the women's 100-meter and 200-meter
springs and Nai Hui-fang captured a gold in the men's long jump. Eight years
later in 2001, Chen Tien-wen took gold in the men's 400m hurdles.</P>
      <P>In badminton, Taiwan's Hu Chung-hsien and Tsai Chia-hsin defeated compatriots
Chen Hung-ling and Lin Yu-lang in straight sets 21-17, 22-20 to win gold in the
men's doubles tournament.</P>
      <P>The winning duo dropped only one set in winning four consecutive matches to
emerge victorious.</P>
      <P>Taiwan finished the Games with a total of eight golds, 34 silvers and 37 bronzes
to finish fifth out of nine teams in the medals table.</P>

      <P>Like many countries around the world, Taiwan's sea levels have risen steadily as
a result of global warming and measures need to be taken urgently to combat an
increased threat of flooding, local environmental scientists said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's sea level has risen by an average of 3 centimeters over the past 10
years, or about 0.3 cm each year, said Fan Kuang-lung, a professor in National
Taiwan University's Institute of Oceanography.</P>
      <P>Fan, who led an NTU research team in studying tidal changes along the coasts of
Keelung,  Yilan,  Taitung and Kaohsiung between 1991-2001, said global warming
and human behavior, particularly on the west coast of the island, are leaving
Taiwan increasingly vulnerable to climate change.</P>
      <P>"Flooding will become the norm in some western tidal land areas," Fan said. He
explained that when typhoons strike, flash floods that inundate rivers will have
difficulty flowing out to sea because the sea's level will be higher than the
river's level.</P>
      <P>Floods could be exacerbated if sea waters inundate the areas as well, Fan said.</P>
      <P>Human behavior is only complicating the problem, the scientist suggested. Many
households along Taiwan's western coast regularly pump underground water for
farming or everyday use, gradually causing the ground to subside to a level
lower than sea level.</P>
      <P>When sea water floods in, Fan warned, it will not be able to flow back out and
consequently will accumulate in low-lying areas and cause severe floods and
property damage.</P>
      <P>Liu Shao-chen,  a distinguished researcher and director of Academia Sinica's
Research Center for Environmental Changes, said global warming, caused by
increased carbon dioxide emissions, is causing the polar ice caps to melt at a
pace faster than formerly estimated.</P>
      <P>He cited the latest report by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR), which forecast that if Greenland's entire ice cap melts down, the
Earth's sea levels will rise by an average of 4-5 meters, and if the entire
Antarctic Pole melts down, the world's sea levels will rise by an apocalyptic 70
meters.</P>
      <P>The SCAR report predicted that if global warming continues at its current level,
South Pole ice will melt at an accelerated clip and sea levels will rise 1.4
meters by 2100.</P>
      <P>The estimate far exceeds the 18-43 cm rise predicted by the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Liu said.</P>
      <P>"It is already too late to save Tuvalu, even if the world's nations step up
reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions now, " Liu argued. "Tuvalu
will be completely submerged in 20 to 30 years."</P>
      <P>His prediction is based on the argument that carbon dioxide, the main culprit in
global warming, remains in the atmosphere for 80 years and that the CO2 layers
that are impacting the Earth's temperatures today have been accumulated over the
past eight decades.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan does not face an immediate threat of being totally submerged,
but he predicted flooding would become an increasingly normal phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Noting that precipitation in Taiwan will increase 1.4 times for every 1 degree
Celsius rise in global temperatures, he urged Taiwan's government and people not
to relent in its flood prevention efforts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Civic group calls for small donation to help monitor legislature</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group has appealed for small donations to help it continue monitoring
and evaluating  the performance of Taiwan's lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Citizen Congress Watch Executive Director Ho Tsung-hsun said Sunday that the
organization needs around NT$8.9 million (US$247,600) a year to operate, but he
lamented that a fundraiser in November had collected less than NT$500,000.</P>
      <P>"We hope to get 2,000 citizens to donate NT$10 a day to help the group continue
the job of monitoring the legislature," Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hwa, the group's chairman, said that since it began to closely follow
the lawmaking body, it has issued a weekly report, and many legislators have
become aware of being subject to the group's watchful eye.</P>
      <P>Those efforts,  the group believes,  have led to concrete accomplishments over
the past two years, such as pushing the attendance rate of lawmakers to 98
percent, getting them to speak more at hearings, and helping increase the number
of bills that clear the legislature.</P>
      <P>But more needs to be done, Ku said, especially in shutting down a loophole that
has been abused by legislators who do not complete their term in office.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers Justin Huang and John Chih-yang Wu of the ruling Kuomintang  and Chang
Hwa-kuan  of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party were elected county
chiefs in the Dec. 5 local elections, bringing to 13 the number of lawmakers in
the current legislature who will have left office before completing their terms
in 2012.</P>
      <P>None of them, however, have returned a portion of the subsidies they receive for
winning a legislative election, Ku complained.</P>
      <P>The group hopes to plug the loophole by amending the law so that lawmakers who
quit in the middle of their term will return the subsidies on a prorated basis.</P>
      <P>More than 100 evaluators -- including academics, journalists, college students,
and representatives from civic groups -- took part in a review meeting in Taipei
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers in each legislative committee were assigned scores and ranked within
their committees based on criteria such as attendance, the number of proposals
they had made and whether they had supported bills to increase transparency in
the legislature.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday called on members of a youth volunteer team
organized by the National Youth Commission to spread the concept of carbon
emission reductions and energy conservation as they perform volunteer services.</P>
      <P>Praising the contribution of the Youth Volunteer Service for Regional Peace
during the team's anniversary celebration in Kaohsiung County, Ma urged the
volunteers to maximize the impact of their volunteer activities  by stressing
the importance  of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to those they help.</P>
      <P>He also asked the team, which has grown to 450,000 members this year from
109,000 last year, to respond to global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions at a time when the United States Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) is being held in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>Ma said that since he assumed office in May 2008, Taiwan has saved about 6
billion kWh of electricity, equal to the total energy consumed in Tainan City
and County over 16 months and representing a reduction of 3.84 million tons of
carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>People around the country, however, need to work together to conserve energy and
cut carbon emissions even further, Ma said, because while Taiwan's 23 million
people account for only 0.0034 percent of the world's population, they produce
around 1 percent of the world's global greenhouse gas emissions, ranking 18th in
per capita emissions.</P>
      <P>The president also noted that since he took office,  the Presidential  Office
has been working to conserve electricity, gasoline, water, and paper, and have
cut expenditures on these items by 10 to 20 percent, saving over NT$7 million
annually in the process.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that water conservation is particularly important as
water shortages loom in southern Taiwan. At present, Tsengwen Reservoir's water
supply is at about 39 percent of capacity, while Nanhua Reservoir and Wushantou
Reservoir are at about 50 percent, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The volunteer group was modeled after the U.S. Peace Corps, which was created in
1961 by President John F. Kennedy to help the Third World economically but also
to spread democracy, the president said, and volunteers sometimes have life-
changing experiences.</P>
      <P>Ma said the child of one of his friends eventually realized the world is not
fair and revised his vision of an ideal life after serving in Latin America, and
he touted volunteer service as offering a unique opportunity to learn and help
others.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture has clarified a media report that charged the
government has covertly opened Taiwan's doors widers to Chinese agricultural
goods by importing feed corn, saying feed corn purchases from China were being
made to meet supply shortages.</P>
      <P>The Ma Ying-jeou administration has been adamant that it will not open Taiwan
any further to Chinese agricultural products in a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, a pledge that has been received with
skepticism by the potential deal's critics.</P>
      <P>The media report said Taiwan was opening its doors to feed corn and other grains
to curry favor with China, but the Council of Agriculture argued Sunday that
Chinese feed corn was being imported on a spot basis to meet emergency needs.</P>
      <P>According to the COA, Taiwan imports 99 percent of the feed corn consumed
domestically, mostly from the United States and Brazil. The imports from China
were approved after being requested by local dairy farms to cope with postponed
deliveries from other parts of the world or surging prices.</P>
      <P>COA figures show that a total of 6,285 tons of the corn used to feed livestock
have been imported from China so far this year, compared to 137,821 tons in 2008
and 90,448 tons in 2004, all accounting for less than 3.2 percent of Taiwan's
average annual demand of 4.3 million tons.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China will be based on the needs of Taiwan and
the interests of the people, and the document will be subject to legislative
review.</P>
      <P>Comparing the pact to a book, Ma said negotiations on the agreement should be
completed chapter by chapter and could not possibly be finished at once.</P>
      <P>With two-way trade between Taiwan and China over US$130 billion annually, talks
on the issue need to be held year by year, Ma said while promoting the ECFA with
China during a tour of Chiayi where he visited a food processor and a machinery
manufacturer.</P>
      <P>The president argued that signing a framework agreement would help regulate
economic cooperation with China, and because China is Taiwan's largest trade
partner, such a move would be beneficial to Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>In addition, signing such a deal would prevent Taiwan from being marginalized.</P>
      <P>The president argued that since he took office last year and relations between
Taiwan and China have improved, Taiwan's mutual trust with Japan, the United
States and Europe has been restored.</P>
      <P>In similar fashion, Ma suggested, once an ECFA is signed with China, other
countries will be more willing to sign a free trade agreement with Taiwan
because obstruction from China would be partially removed.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated his pledge not to open Taiwan's market further to
Chinese agricultural products or allow the entry of Chinese laborers.</P>
      <P>He said that of the 1,415 Chinese agricultural products allowed to be imported
into Taiwan, 479 items were approved by the previous Kuomintang administration,
with the other 936 approved by the Democratic Progressive Party when it was in
power.</P>
      <P>Ma also insisted again that the signing of the framework agreement would not
compromise Taiwan's sovereignty and dignity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a senior official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs disclosed that
next May would be the target date for the signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>With a very limited timeframe, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will hold at
least five formal negotiations in order to meet the deadline, the official said.</P>

      <P>The nation's top China policy planner vowed again Sunday to safeguard Taiwan's
interests during the next round of talks between Taiwan and China that will take
place later this month in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan also said she hoped plans by
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to hold large protest rallies
would not lead to skirmishes during the talks.</P>
      <P>"I hope there will be no confrontation so as not to affect Taiwan's image
internationally, " Lai said while in her hometown of Taichung to attend the
inauguration of the Lai Family Shrine, during which she exchanged views with DPP
Taichung City councilors Chang Liao Wan-chien and Huang Kuo-shu.</P>
      <P>Chang Liao said the attitude of the police will be crucial, urging them to
"respect the people's expression of views and venting of negative feelings, "
and not to adopt coercive measures to "contain" their activities.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that the MAC run more ads to enable people to better understand
"cross-strait" issues.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and
Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), are scheduled to meet in Taichung for their fourth round of
talks and expected to sign agreements on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural
quarantine inspection,  industrial  product  standards,  inspection  and
certification, and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Sunday that he has told his counterpart that there might be protests
during the talks, which will demonstrate that Taiwan is a free and democratic
society.</P>
      <P>He said that the resumption of institutionalized talks is aimed at achieving
peace and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>But "the core value of Taiwan lies in its democracy, and democracy incorporates
different voices," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The freedom to express different views should be protected and it is natural to
have protests, said Chiang, who added that he had said the same thing to his
Chinese counterpart.</P>
      <P>But he also said that "freedom is restrained by law and should be rational, "
and he expressed the hope that it will be "a good opportunity for China's
delegates to see Taiwan as a democratic and orderly society."</P>
      <P>During the second round of SEF-ARATS talks that took place in Taipei in November
last year, Chen and the other Chinese negotiators were besieged by protesters at
a Taipei hotel after attending a dinner party hosted by Kuomintang Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Chen and other members of his delegation were unable to leave the hotel until
after midnight, despite a strong police presence.</P>
      <P>Interior  Minister  Jiang Yi-huah  said earlier  that such disturbances should

      <P>A high-profile delegation organized by Taiwan's main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) arrived in Tokyo Sunday to reach out to Japanese
politicians from across the political spectrum.</P>
      <P>Addressing a welcoming party sponsored by Taiwanese expatriate groups, DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said the party has managed to emerge from the ashes of
its embarrassing defeats in the presidential and legislative elections in 2008
with gains in the recent mayoral and magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>Thanks to concerted efforts of party members and many young volunteers, Tsai
said, the party not only retained its control in three southern Taiwan counties
but also reclaimed the northeastern county of Yilan.</P>
      <P>With limited resources, the DPP had to rely on small donations from passionate
supporters to finance its campaign activities, she said.</P>
      <P>Despite all the hardships, Tsai said she was gratified with the maturity of
Taiwanese voters shown in the Dec. 5 local elections -- a trend that will
contribute to Taiwan's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Touching on next year's mayoral elections for five special municipalities that
account for 60 percent of Taiwan's population, Tsai said the DPP will finalize a
slate of its best candidates for the races by next March.</P>
      <P>She further indicated  that the DPP will come up with a forward-looking platform
to win the hearts and minds of Taiwanese voters.</P>
      <P>The platform will lay out the party's visions for international and regional
situations as well as the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait. It
will also present strategies to tackle problems related to environmental
protection, aging population, and technological upgrading, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting with Japanese political figures, Tsai will also give
speeches and news conference during her stay.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of more than 20 DPP heavyweights, including two former
Taiwanese representatives to Japan Lo Fu-chuan and Koh Se-kai, is scheduled to
wrap up its visit Dec. 16.</P>

      <P>Just 10 days before the next round of formal talks between Taiwan and China, an
exhibition showcasing the intangible cultural heritage of the two countries
opened in Taichung Saturday, which officials from both sides said could help
develop cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which was organized by the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA),
opened at the Taichung Creative Culture Park in central Taiwan with more than
800 cultural artifacts on display.</P>
      <P>Emile Sheng, head of the country's top cultural agency, said at the exhibition's
opening ceremony that as Taiwan and China have many similar cultural traditions,
intangible cultural heritage exchanges can further improve cultural ties and
help develop better relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said he always stressed that Taiwan and China should
increase cultural exchanges, which could enhance mutual understanding and
therefore avoid necessary harm.</P>
      <P>China's Qu Shengrui, deputy director-general of the Ministry of Culture's
division of intangible cultural heritage, also recognized the significance of
cultural exchanges and said he will put greater effort into expanding such
exchanges in the future.</P>
      <P>According  to CCA officials,  there  will also be on-site demonstrations of
cultural traditions by approximately 20 national intangible cultural legends
from China, including papercutting master Liu Jinglan and ingigo print expert Wu
Yuanxin.</P>
      <P>The exhibition covers two main shows: one focusing on China's intangible
cultural heritage that will run through Dec. 20 and the other focusing on
Taiwan's that will run through Feb. 28, officials said.</P>

      <P>Businesses in the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP) are showing signs of
recovering from a deep economic slump, as job openings are increasing and fewer
workers remain on unpaid leave, STSP Administration Director Chen Chun-wei said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen's assessment came as 12 companies based at the science park in Tainan
County, including prominent firms such as TSMC, UMC, Chi Mei and Motech, jointly
sponsored an employment fair at which more than 500 job openings were available.</P>
      <P>Apart from the private sector, Chen said, the county's labor affairs bureau was
also recruiting over 100 workers for companies from outside the science park at
the fair.</P>
      <P>Although more than 4,000 job seekers flocked to the event to find work,  a sign
of continuing high unemployment, Chen predicted confidently that the business
environment has improved and that the park will employ 60,000 people next year
and reach a production value of NT$550 billion (US$16.92 billion).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of park workers still on unpaid leave has dwindled to
around 200, compared to an average of over 600 new jobs being created in the
park every month since September, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan, the Central Taiwan Science Park and
the Southern Taiwan Science Park are the country's main high-tech manufacturing

      <P>Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung urged the government on Saturday to
carefully deal with Chinese efforts to develop systematic research on Taiwan's
contempotary history, which he warned will give China the upper hand in
interpretating it.</P>
      <P>Huang, a Taiwanese contemporary history scholar, said that China's
interpretation of modern and contemporary historical events and developments
related to Taiwan, such as the Sino-Japanese war and the conflict between the
Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, could became the mainstream
interpretation in the future.</P>
      <P>Compared with China's all-out effort, Taiwan has done too little to interpret
its own history, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang, who has written extensively about important Taiwanese political figures,
social movements and cultural developments in the first half of the 20th
century, said that based on his understanding, not many government
establishments have preserved documents and archives on the Japanese colonial
era, with the exception of Academia Sinica, Taiwan Historica under Academia
Historica, and the National Central Library.</P>
      <P>Although  some  nongovernmental  foundations  have dedicated themselves to
preserving materials related to Taiwan's contemporary history, Huang suggested

      <P>Like many countries around the world, Taiwan's sea levels have risen steadily as
a result of global warming and measures need to be taken urgently to combat an
increased threat of flooding, local environmental scientists said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's sea level has risen by an average of 3 centimeters over the past 10
years, or about 0.3 cm each year, said Fan Kuang-lung, a professor in National
Taiwan University's Institute of Oceanography.</P>
      <P>Fan, who led an NTU research team in studying tidal changes along the coasts of
Keelung,  Yilan,  Taitung and Kaohsiung between 1991-2001, said global warming
and human behavior, particularly on the west coast of the island, are leaving

lower than sea level.</P>
      <P>When sea water floods in, Fan warned, it will not be able to flow back out and
consequently will accumulate in low-lying areas and cause severe floods and
property damage.</P>
      <P>Liu Shao-chen,  a distinguished researcher and director of Academia Sinica's
Research Center for Environmental Changes, said global warming, caused by
increased carbon dioxide emissions, is causing the polar ice caps to melt at a
pace faster than formerly estimated.</P>
      <P>He cited the latest report by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR), which forecast that if Greenland's entire ice cap melts down, the
Earth's sea levels will rise by an average of 4-5 meters, and if the entire
Antarctic Pole melts down, the world's sea levels will rise by an apocalyptic 70
meters.</P>
      <P>The SCAR report predicted that if global warming continues at its current level,
South Pole ice will melt at an accelerated clip and sea levels will rise 1.4
meters by 2100.</P>
      <P>The estimate far exceeds the 18-43 cm rise predicted by the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Liu said.</P>
      <P>"It is already too late to save Tuvalu, even if the world's nations step up
reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions now, " Liu argued. "Tuvalu
will be completely submerged in 20 to 30 years."</P>
      <P>His prediction is based on the argument that carbon dioxide, the main culprit in
global warming, remains in the atmosphere for 80 years and that the CO2 layers
that are impacting the Earth's temperatures today have been accumulated over the
past eight decades.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan does not face an immediate threat of being totally submerged,
but he predicted flooding would become an increasingly normal phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Noting that precipitation in Taiwan will increase 1.4 times for every 1 degree
Celsius rise in global temperatures, he urged Taiwan's government and people not
to relent in its flood prevention efforts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Civic group calls for small donation to help monitor legislature</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group has appealed for small donations to help it continue monitoring
and evaluating  the performance of Taiwan's lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Citizen Congress Watch Executive Director Ho Tsung-hsun said Sunday that the
organization needs around NT$8.9 million (US$247,600) a year to operate, but he
lamented that a fundraiser in November had collected less than NT$500,000.</P>
      <P>"We hope to get 2,000 citizens to donate NT$10 a day to help the group continue
the job of monitoring the legislature," Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hwa, the group's chairman, said that since it began to closely follow
the lawmaking body, it has issued a weekly report, and many legislators have
become aware of being subject to the group's watchful eye.</P>
      <P>Those efforts,  the group believes,  have led to concrete accomplishments over
the past two years, such as pushing the attendance rate of lawmakers to 98
percent, getting them to speak more at hearings, and helping increase the number
of bills that clear the legislature.</P>
      <P>But more needs to be done, Ku said, especially in shutting down a loophole that
has been abused by legislators who do not complete their term in office.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers Justin Huang and John Chih-yang Wu of the ruling Kuomintang  and Chang
Hwa-kuan  of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party were elected county
chiefs in the Dec. 5 local elections, bringing to 13 the number of lawmakers in
the current legislature who will have left office before completing their terms
in 2012.</P>
      <P>None of them, however, have returned a portion of the subsidies they receive for
winning a legislative election, Ku complained.</P>
      <P>The group hopes to plug the loophole by amending the law so that lawmakers who
quit in the middle of their term will return the subsidies on a prorated basis.</P>
      <P>More than 100 evaluators -- including academics, journalists, college students,
and representatives from civic groups -- took part in a review meeting in Taipei
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers in each legislative committee were assigned scores and ranked within
their committees based on criteria such as attendance, the number of proposals
they had made and whether they had supported bills to increase transparency in
the legislature.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday called on members of a youth volunteer team
organized by the National Youth Commission to spread the concept of carbon
emission reductions and energy conservation as they perform volunteer services.</P>
      <P>Praising the contribution of the Youth Volunteer Service for Regional Peace
during the team's anniversary celebration in Kaohsiung County, Ma urged the
volunteers to maximize the impact of their volunteer activities  by stressing
the importance  of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to those they help.</P>
      <P>He also asked the team, which has grown to 450,000 members this year from
109,000 last year, to respond to global efforts to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions at a time when the United States Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) is being held in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>Ma said that since he assumed office in May 2008, Taiwan has saved about 6
billion kWh of electricity, equal to the total energy consumed in Tainan City
and County over 16 months and representing a reduction of 3.84 million tons of
carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>People around the country, however, need to work together to conserve energy and
cut carbon emissions even further, Ma said, because while Taiwan's 23 million
people account for only 0.0034 percent of the world's population, they produce
around 1 percent of the world's global greenhouse gas emissions, ranking 18th in
per capita emissions.</P>
      <P>The president also noted that since he took office,  the Presidential  Office
has been working to conserve electricity, gasoline, water, and paper, and have
cut expenditures on these items by 10 to 20 percent, saving over NT$7 million
annually in the process.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that water conservation is particularly important as
water shortages loom in southern Taiwan. At present, Tsengwen Reservoir's water
supply is at about 39 percent of capacity, while Nanhua Reservoir and Wushantou
Reservoir are at about 50 percent, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The volunteer group was modeled after the U.S. Peace Corps, which was created in
1961 by President John F. Kennedy to help the Third World economically but also
to spread democracy, the president said, and volunteers sometimes have life-
changing experiences.</P>
      <P>Ma said the child of one of his friends eventually realized the world is not
fair and revised his vision of an ideal life after serving in Latin America, and
he touted volunteer service as offering a unique opportunity to learn and help
others.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture has clarified a media report that charged the
government has covertly opened Taiwan's doors widers to Chinese agricultural
goods by importing feed corn, saying feed corn purchases from China were being
made to meet supply shortages.</P>
      <P>The Ma Ying-jeou administration has been adamant that it will not open Taiwan
any further to Chinese agricultural products in a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, a pledge that has been received with
skepticism by the potential deal's critics.</P>
      <P>The media report said Taiwan was opening its doors to feed corn and other grains
to curry favor with China, but the Council of Agriculture argued Sunday that
Chinese feed corn was being imported on a spot basis to meet emergency needs.</P>
      <P>According to the COA, Taiwan imports 99 percent of the feed corn consumed
domestically, mostly from the United States and Brazil. The imports from China
were approved after being requested by local dairy farms to cope with postponed
deliveries from other parts of the world or surging prices.</P>
      <P>COA figures show that a total of 6,285 tons of the corn used to feed livestock
have been imported from China so far this year, compared to 137,821 tons in 2008
and 90,448 tons in 2004, all accounting for less than 3.2 percent of Taiwan's
average annual demand of 4.3 million tons.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China will be based on the needs of Taiwan and
the interests of the people, and the document will be subject to legislative
review.</P>
      <P>Comparing the pact to a book, Ma said negotiations on the agreement should be
completed chapter by chapter and could not possibly be finished at once.</P>
      <P>With two-way trade between Taiwan and China over US$130 billion annually, talks
on the issue need to be held year by year, Ma said while promoting the ECFA with
China during a tour of Chiayi where he visited a food processor and a machinery
manufacturer.</P>
      <P>The president argued that signing a framework agreement would help regulate
economic cooperation with China, and because China is Taiwan's largest trade
partner, such a move would be beneficial to Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>In addition, signing such a deal would prevent Taiwan from being marginalized.</P>
      <P>The president argued that since he took office last year and relations between
Taiwan and China have improved, Taiwan's mutual trust with Japan, the United
States and Europe has been restored.</P>
      <P>In similar fashion, Ma suggested, once an ECFA is signed with China, other
countries will be more willing to sign a free trade agreement with Taiwan
because obstruction from China would be partially removed.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated his pledge not to open Taiwan's market further to
Chinese agricultural products or allow the entry of Chinese laborers.</P>
      <P>He said that of the 1,415 Chinese agricultural products allowed to be imported
into Taiwan, 479 items were approved by the previous Kuomintang administration,
with the other 936 approved by the Democratic Progressive Party when it was in
power.</P>
      <P>Ma also insisted again that the signing of the framework agreement would not
compromise Taiwan's sovereignty and dignity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a senior official of the Ministry of Economic Affairs disclosed that
next May would be the target date for the signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>With a very limited timeframe, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will hold at
least five formal negotiations in order to meet the deadline, the official said.</P>

      <P>The nation's top China policy planner vowed again Sunday to safeguard Taiwan's
interests during the next round of talks between Taiwan and China that will take
place later this month in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan also said she hoped plans by
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to hold large protest rallies
would not lead to skirmishes during the talks.</P>
      <P>"I hope there will be no confrontation so as not to affect Taiwan's image
internationally, " Lai said while in her hometown of Taichung to attend the
inauguration of the Lai Family Shrine, during which she exchanged views with DPP
Taichung City councilors Chang Liao Wan-chien and Huang Kuo-shu.</P>
      <P>Chang Liao said the attitude of the police will be crucial, urging them to
"respect the people's expression of views and venting of negative feelings, "
and not to adopt coercive measures to "contain" their activities.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that the MAC run more ads to enable people to better understand
"cross-strait" issues.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and
Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), are scheduled to meet in Taichung for their fourth round of
talks and expected to sign agreements on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural
quarantine inspection,  industrial  product  standards,  inspection  and
certification, and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Sunday that he has told his counterpart that there might be protests
during the talks, which will demonstrate that Taiwan is a free and democratic
society.</P>
      <P>He said that the resumption of institutionalized talks is aimed at achieving
peace and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>But "the core value of Taiwan lies in its democracy, and democracy incorporates
different voices," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The freedom to express different views should be protected and it is natural to
have protests, said Chiang, who added that he had said the same thing to his
Chinese counterpart.</P>
      <P>But he also said that "freedom is restrained by law and should be rational, "
and he expressed the hope that it will be "a good opportunity for China's
delegates to see Taiwan as a democratic and orderly society."</P>
      <P>During the second round of SEF-ARATS talks that took place in Taipei in November
last year, Chen and the other Chinese negotiators were besieged by protesters at
a Taipei hotel after attending a dinner party hosted by Kuomintang Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Chen and other members of his delegation were unable to leave the hotel until
after midnight, despite a strong police presence.</P>
      <P>Interior  Minister  Jiang Yi-huah  said earlier  that such disturbances should
not be allowed to happen again.</P>

      <P>A high-profile delegation organized by Taiwan's main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) arrived in Tokyo Sunday to reach out to Japanese
politicians from across the political spectrum.</P>
      <P>Addressing a welcoming party sponsored by Taiwanese expatriate groups, DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said the party has managed to emerge from the ashes of
its embarrassing defeats in the presidential and legislative elections in 2008
with gains in the recent mayoral and magistrate elections.</P>
      <P>Thanks to concerted efforts of party members and many young volunteers, Tsai
said, the party not only retained its control in three southern Taiwan counties
but also reclaimed the northeastern county of Yilan.</P>
      <P>With limited resources, the DPP had to rely on small donations from passionate
supporters to finance its campaign activities, she said.</P>
      <P>Despite all the hardships, Tsai said she was gratified with the maturity of
Taiwanese voters shown in the Dec. 5 local elections -- a trend that will
contribute to Taiwan's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Touching on next year's mayoral elections for five special municipalities that
account for 60 percent of Taiwan's population, Tsai said the DPP will finalize a
slate of its best candidates for the races by next March.</P>
      <P>She further indicated  that the DPP will come up with a forward-looking platform
to win the hearts and minds of Taiwanese voters.</P>
      <P>The platform will lay out the party's visions for international and regional
situations as well as the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait. It
will also present strategies to tackle problems related to environmental
protection, aging population, and technological upgrading, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting with Japanese political figures, Tsai will also give
speeches and news conference during her stay.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of more than 20 DPP heavyweights, including two former
Taiwanese representatives to Japan Lo Fu-chuan and Koh Se-kai, is scheduled to
wrap up its visit Dec. 16.</P>

      <P>Just 10 days before the next round of formal talks between Taiwan and China, an
exhibition showcasing the intangible cultural heritage of the two countries
opened in Taichung Saturday, which officials from both sides said could help
develop cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which was organized by the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA),
opened at the Taichung Creative Culture Park in central Taiwan with more than
800 cultural artifacts on display.</P>
      <P>Emile Sheng, head of the country's top cultural agency, said at the exhibition's
opening ceremony that as Taiwan and China have many similar cultural traditions,
intangible cultural heritage exchanges can further improve cultural ties and
help develop better relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said he always stressed that Taiwan and China should
increase cultural exchanges, which could enhance mutual understanding and
therefore avoid necessary harm.</P>
      <P>China's Qu Shengrui, deputy director-general of the Ministry of Culture's
division of intangible cultural heritage, also recognized the significance of
cultural exchanges and said he will put greater effort into expanding such
exchanges in the future.</P>
      <P>According  to CCA officials,  there  will also be on-site demonstrations of
cultural traditions by approximately 20 national intangible cultural legends
from China, including papercutting master Liu Jinglan and ingigo print expert Wu
Yuanxin.</P>
      <P>The exhibition covers two main shows: one focusing on China's intangible
cultural heritage that will run through Dec. 20 and the other focusing on
Taiwan's that will run through Feb. 28, officials said.</P>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between the chief cross-Taiwan Strait negotiators on

      <P>Businesses in the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP) are showing signs of
recovering from a deep economic slump, as job openings are increasing and fewer
workers remain on unpaid leave, STSP Administration Director Chen Chun-wei said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen's assessment came as 12 companies based at the science park in Tainan
County, including prominent firms such as TSMC, UMC, Chi Mei and Motech, jointly
sponsored an employment fair at which more than 500 job openings were available.</P>
      <P>Apart from the private sector, Chen said, the county's labor affairs bureau was
also recruiting over 100 workers for companies from outside the science park at
the fair.</P>
      <P>Although more than 4,000 job seekers flocked to the event to find work,  a sign
of continuing high unemployment, Chen predicted confidently that the business
environment has improved and that the park will employ 60,000 people next year
and reach a production value of NT$550 billion (US$16.92 billion).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of park workers still on unpaid leave has dwindled to
around 200, compared to an average of over 600 new jobs being created in the
park every month since September, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan, the Central Taiwan Science Park and
the Southern Taiwan Science Park are the country's main high-tech manufacturing
centers.</P>

      <P>Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung urged the government on Saturday to
carefully deal with Chinese efforts to develop systematic research on Taiwan's
contempotary history, which he warned will give China the upper hand in
interpretating it.</P>
      <P>Huang, a Taiwanese contemporary history scholar, said that China's
interpretation of modern and contemporary historical events and developments
related to Taiwan, such as the Sino-Japanese war and the conflict between the
Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, could became the mainstream
interpretation in the future.</P>
      <P>Compared with China's all-out effort, Taiwan has done too little to interpret
its own history, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang, who has written extensively about important Taiwanese political figures,
social movements and cultural developments in the first half of the 20th
century, said that based on his understanding, not many government
establishments have preserved documents and archives on the Japanese colonial
era, with the exception of Academia Sinica, Taiwan Historica under Academia
Historica, and the National Central Library.</P>
      <P>Although  some  nongovernmental  foundations  have dedicated themselves to
preserving materials related to Taiwan's contemporary history, Huang suggested
that the Ministry of Education set up a research center under the National
Central Library to study and preserve such materials, especially those related

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's two gold medals in mainstream events -- athletics and swimming -- in
the East Asian Games have further fed the country's zeal for hosting
international sports extravaganzas. While some sports observers believe Taiwan
is overqualified to host a regional meet like the East Asian Games, others think
Taiwan should focus first on becoming more familiar with general world trends
before putting forward any formal bid.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reporting on the subject:</P>
      <P>China Times: Lin Hong-do, vice president of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee
who headed the Taiwanese team at the just-concluded East Asian Games in Hong
Kong, said that in terms of efficiency and infrastructure, the former British
colony was excellent. Overall, the games were good, although there was little
passion in the city, he said.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the Taiwanese people participated enthusiastically in the World
Games in Kaohsiung and the Deaflympics in Taipei, Lin said, adding that the
country definitely has the capability to host the quadrennial East Asian Games.
(Dec. 14, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Taiwan bagged two more golds -- in the men's 4x100m relay and
men's badminton doubles -- on the last day of the East Asian Games Sunday,
bringing its total haul of gold medals at the games to eight.</P>
      <P>After winning a swimming event Dec. 10, Taiwan finished first in an athletics
race, taking two golds for the first time in mainstream sports at a major meet.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu, a professor at National Hsinchu University of Education, said in an
opinion piece in the UDN that following the successful hosting of the World
Games and Deaflympics in Taiwan, cities on the island are now keen to bid for
other chances to host international sports event such as the East Asian Games.</P>
      <P>But Huang is of the opinion that Taiwan's most important task now is to collect
information, learn more about the application process and the politics of
international sports, and set up a mechanism to screen cities first at the local
level, instead of talking so much. (Dec. 14, 2009)</P>

      <P>Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung urged the government on Saturday to
carefully deal with Chinese efforts to develop systematic research on Taiwan's
contempotary history, which he warned will give China the upper hand in
interpretating it.</P>
      <P>Huang, a Taiwanese contemporary history scholar, said that China's
interpretation of modern and contemporary historical events and developments
related to Taiwan, such as the Sino-Japanese war and the conflict between the
Kuomintang and the Chinese Communist Party, could became the mainstream
interpretation in the future.</P>
      <P>Compared with China's all-out effort, Taiwan has done too little to interpret
its own history, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang, who has written extensively about important Taiwanese political figures,
social movements and cultural developments in the first half of the 20th
century, said that based on his understanding, not many government
establishments have preserved documents and archives on the Japanese colonial
era, with the exception of Academia Sinica, Taiwan Historica under Academia
Historica, and the National Central Library.</P>
      <P>Although  some  nongovernmental  foundations  have dedicated themselves to
preserving materials related to Taiwan's contemporary history, Huang suggested
that the Ministry of Education set up a research center under the National
Central Library to study and preserve such materials, especially those related
to social and political movements during the years of Japanese colonization.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Businesses in the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP) are showing signs of
recovering from a deep economic slump, as job openings are increasing and fewer
workers remain on unpaid leave, STSP Administration Director Chen Chun-wei said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen's assessment came as 12 companies based at the science park in Tainan
County, including prominent firms such as TSMC, UMC, Chi Mei and Motech, jointly
sponsored an employment fair at which more than 500 job openings were available.</P>
      <P>Apart from the private sector, Chen said, the county's labor affairs bureau was
also recruiting over 100 workers for companies from outside the science park at
the fair.</P>
      <P>Although more than 4,000 job seekers flocked to the event to find work,  a sign
of continuing high unemployment, Chen predicted confidently that the business
environment has improved and that the park will employ 60,000 people next year
and reach a production value of NT$550 billion (US$16.92 billion).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of park workers still on unpaid leave has dwindled to
around 200, compared to an average of over 600 new jobs being created in the
park every month since September, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan, the Central Taiwan Science Park and
the Southern Taiwan Science Park are the country's main high-tech manufacturing
centers.</P>
      <P>The southern park is composed of two separate parks -- the Tainan Science Park
and the Kaohsiung Science Park -- with integrated circuits, optoelectronics,
biotechnology, telecommunications, and precision machinery the main sectors
represented there.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four months after southern Taiwan was swamped with floodwaters, the region is
now facing the threat of a dire water shortage, as its major are reservoirs
drying up due to years of environmental degradation. The relevant government
agencies are scheduled to hold a meeting Monday to work out response measures.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest
developments:</P>
      <P>United Daily News: It is difficult to image that Taiwan's southern region, which
was inundated during a typhoon just four months ago, is now facing the
possibility of a water shortage next year.</P>
      <P>Chen Tzai-chung, the South Region Water Resources Office official responsible
for maintenance, said over the weekend that the region's two major irrigation
and drinking water supply sources -- Tsengwen and Nanhua reservoirs -- are dying
up because of landslides in the mountain upstream.</P>
      <P>"This is a national calamity, " Chen said, adding that "if no efficient strategy
is devised now, millions of southern Taiwan people would likely encounter the
rigors of water shortage on the scale experienced during the post World War II
years."</P>
      <P>Chen, who is in charge of the government plan to restore the silted Tsengwen
Reservoir. He noted that the Tsengwen River bed, which was once 100-200 meters
wide, is now less than 10 meters across. (Dec.14, 2009)</P>
      <P>In another report appearing in the United Daily News, Water Resources Agency
Deputy Director-General Hsieh Sheng-yen also warned "the Tsengwen and Nanhua
reservoirs are slowly drying up."</P>
      <P>Liu Chung-ming, director of the Global Chang Research Center at National Taiwan
University,  further pointed out that southern Taiwan's Tainan area has had 300
dry days this year.</P>
      <P>Drought and serious silting of the reservoirs have forced the Chiayi-Tainan
irrigation association to stop farmers in the region from planting their first
rice crop for 2010. A war against drought is at hand, Liu said. (Dec. 14, 2009)</P>

      <P>It is hoped that President Ma Ying-jeou will be able to attend the 2010 Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit next November in Yokohama, a former
mayor of the Japanese city said Monday.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Taipei with three Japanese parliamentarians, Hiroshi Nakada
said that the president's participation in the APEC meeting in Yokohama will be
deeply meaningful because it was Ma, during his tenure as Taipei mayor from 1998
to 2006, who initiated the friendship ties between the two cities.</P>
      <P>Nakada was mayor of Yokohama during that time, but he resigned in July this
year, more than eight months before the end of his second term.</P>
      <P>He said that as mayors of their respective cities, he and Ma interacted closely,
and he noted there has been significant progress in Taiwan-Japan relations since
Ma took office as president.</P>
      <P>Before paying a call on Legislative Yuan President Want Jin-pyng, Nakada told
reporters that he sincerely hopes President Ma will be able to attend the APEC
meeting next year.</P>
      <P>However, he said he did not spell out that hope during his courtesy call on Ma
earlier in the day. Their discussions were mostly about the issue of a strategic
partnership between Taiwan and Japan, Nakada added.</P>
      <P>Because of China's opposition, Taiwan presidents have been barred from attending
the annual APEC summit in person, and instead have had to name a proxy to attend
the meetings.</P>
      <P>Nakada said he was very pleased to note that a flight route will be opened in
October 2010 between Japan's Haneda Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport, which
he said will play an important part in Haneda airport's globalization efforts.</P>
      <P>In addition, the friendly ties between Taipei and Yokohama have led to exchanges
between young people of the two countries, he said, citing as an example the
launch this year of the working holiday program between Taiwan and Japan.</P>

      <P>A 2006 Nobel laureate in chemistry will deliver three keynote speeches in Taiwan
as part of a prestigious lecture series organized by Taiwan's leading academic
institute, Academia Sinica, according to a press statement released Monday by
the institute.</P>
      <P>According to the press release, Roger David Kornberg will deliver the lectures
at Academia Sinica in Taipei and at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu
during his Dec. 21-23 visit.</P>
      <P>Titled "Beyond Genes: The Molecular Basis of Transcription, " "Genetic Chemistry
at Near-Atomic Resolution" and "The Expression of Genetic Information, "
Kornberg's lectures are part of an Academia Sinica lecture series that
officially opened Dec. 11 with speeches given by Roger Yonchien Tsien, the 2008
Nobel laureate in chemistry.</P>
      <P>Kornberg, a biochemist and professor of the Department of Structural Biology at
Stanford University, was awarded the Nobel Prize for his fundamental studies
concerning how the information stored in genes is copied and then transferred to
those parts of the cells that produce proteins.</P>
      <P>"Dr. Kornberg was the first to create an actual picture of this process at the
molecular level, in the important group of organisms called eukaryotes," the
press release said.</P>
      <P>Born in 1947, Kornberg graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor of
science in chemistry in 1967 and a Ph.D in chemistry from Stanford University in
1972. He then became a postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular
Biology in Cambridge, England, from 1974 to 1975.</P>
      <P>Kornberg comes from a line of top academics. His father, Arthur Kornberg, was
also a Nobel laureate awarded the prize in physiology or medicine in 1959, and
his mother, Sylvy, was also a biochemist who worked at Stanford University,
according to the press release.</P>
      <P>Kornberg has said that his passion for science is partly a result of his
father's influence, it added.</P>
      <P>The Academia Sinica lecture series is being organized by Wong Chi-huey,
president of the institute, in an effort to build on the spirit of research and
free exchange of scholarly knowledge fostered at its "Academy President's Forum"
held last year to mark the 80th anniversary of the establishment of Academia
Sinica.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou praised the outgoing Japanese representative to Taiwan
Monday as having contributed to the very quick, positive development of ties
between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Masaki Saito, chief of the Taipei office of the Japan Interchange Association --
Japan's de facto embassy in Taiwan -- is scheduled to return home Dec. 20. He
will be succeeded by Tadashi Imai, a former ambassador to Israel, who will
arrive in late January to take up the new post.</P>
      <P>"During Saito's one year and five months in office, Taiwan and Japan have seen
the fastest pace of growth in bilateral relations," President Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma cited the opening of a Taiwan representative office in Sapporo on Dec. 1 and
the signing of a charter flight agreement between Japan's Haneda Airport and
Taipei Songshan Airport as examples of the progress achieved during Saito's
tenure.</P>
      <P>He also made mention of the financial assistance provided by the Japan
Interchange Association to help establish a contemporary Japan research center
at National Cheng Chi University in Taipei, which he said is resource for quick
and authoritative information on Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the working holiday program set up by the two countries now allows
for increased exchanges and better understanding between their young people, the
president noted.</P>
      <P>He said the private sector is also planning to establish a memorial park for
Yoichi Hatta (1886-1942), at Wushantou Reservoir in Tainan County, southern
Taiwan in honor of the Japanese hydraulic engineer who helped design Chianan
Canal and build the reservoir. This signals closer private sector exchanges
between the two countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have had long and deep historical links, and in the years after
World War II the ties were good, according to Ma. Even though bilateral
relations have undergone some twists and turns over the past years due to
China's obstruction, they should get back on an even keel with the improvement
of cross-Taiwan Strait ties, he added.</P>
      <P>Saito, in response, expressed appreciation for the hospitality accorded to him
during his tenure in Taiwan, and said he wished Imai success in opening a new
chapter in bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>It is widely believed that Saito's resignation resulted from the controversy
caused by his comment in May that "Taiwan's status remains unclear," which
angered Taiwan and spurred local officials to give him the cold shoulder.</P>

      <P>A large-scale genetic mapping study conducted by a consortium of researchers,
including four scientists from Taiwan's Academia Sinica, found that Asia was
initially settled by a single wave of migration along the coast.</P>
      <P>This genetic mapping of Asia may have important implications, especially in the
further understanding of migratory patterns in human history, and the study of
genetics and diseases, Academia Sinica said in a press release Monday.</P>
      <P>"This study is a milestone in collaboration among the geneticists from 10 Asian
countries and paves the way for a better understanding of our origins, " Chen
Yuan-tsong, director of the Academia Sinica's Institute of Biomedical Sciences
(IBMS), was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The study, published Dec. 10 in the prestigious academic journal Science, traced
the genetic origins of Asian populations in 73 Southeast Asian and East Asian
populations and concluded that genetic ancestry was highly correlated to ethnic
and linguistic groups.</P>
      <P>"There was a clear increase in genetic diversity from northern to southern
latitudes, and there was a single major inflow of human migration from Southeast
Asia into other parts of Asia," according to the study.</P>
      <P>These findings challenge the current predominant theory that presumes there had
been multiple inflows of human migration along both southern and northern
routes, it said.</P>
      <P>The group conducting the study was made up of over 90 scientists from the Human
Genome Organisations' (HUGO's) Pan-Asian Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (PASNP)
Consortium.</P>
      <P>The scientists were from over 30 top academic institutions in 10 countries,
including China, India, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The four Taiwanese scientists who participated in the study -- Chen Yuan-tsong,
Chen Chien-hsiun, Wu Jer-yuarn and Ho Seng-feng -- received support from the
National Genotyping Center and the National Clinical Core for Genomic Medicine,
two core facilities of the National Research Program for Genomic Medicine and

      <P>More and more parents have considered putting their children up for adoption
over the past five years, mainly because of financial difficulties, a child
welfare foundation reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Nearly 90 percent of the parents who phoned the Child Welfare League Foundation
to ask about putting their children up for adoption between 2003-2008 did so due
to financial problems, foundation spokesman Chen Ya-hui said, citing statistics
compiled by the foundation.</P>
      <P>The number of phone calls made to the foundation for this purpose posed a
significant 55 percent rise over the past five years, increasing from 495 cases
in 2003 to 770 in 2008, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>For the first 10 months of this year, the foundation accepted 511 phone calls on
the issue, an average of 1.7 calls daily, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Eighty-seven percent of those who made the calls did so because of financial
difficulties, representing a remarkable surge from 50 percent in January 2008 to
96 percent in September of the same year, with the percentage reaching 100
percent in January, March and June 2009, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>According to data collected by the foundation, another reason for children being
given up for adoption was because they were born to underage parents. About 23
percent of children put up for adoption had one parent under the age of 20, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>It is usually more difficult for sick children, those aged over 3 and children
of drug-addicts to find suitable parents willing to adopt them, Chen added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that he hopes to increase links with Japan's
ruling Democratic Party, which he said would facilitate efforts to promote
Taiwan-Japan ties.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting at his office with former Yokohama Mayor
Hiroshi Nakada, who is visiting Taiwan with three parliamentarians from the
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).</P>
      <P>Ma also expressed hope that more DPJ parliamentarians will join groups in the
Japanese Diet, or parliament, that are concerned about Taiwan issues as the
party has adopted some new diplomatic approaches since taking over the reins of
power earlier this year.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Ma described Nakada as "Taiwan's best friend, " someone who
spared no efforts to promote bilateral ties during his services as a House
representative and as mayor of Yokohama.</P>
      <P>He noted that it was Nakada who inspired him to push for the opening of a flight
route between Japan's Haneda Airport and Taipei's Songshan Airport -- part of
his presidential election campaign platform in 2008 -- which will begin services
next October.</P>
      <P>The president thanked Nakada for agreeing to "the proposal that has allowed us
to smoothly promote the further development of Taiwan-Japan relations."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the new flight route will help cut travel time between Tokyo and
Taipei by nearly three hours.</P>
      <P>Describing bilateral ties as having become closer and more friendly since his
administration was inaugurated 19 months ago, Ma cited examples to back his
opinion, including Taiwan's opening Dec. 1 of a representative office in
Sapporo, capital of northern Japan's Hokkaido Prefecture, and the forging in
June of a working holiday agreement that allows people aged 18-30 from both
sides to travel visa-free to each other's countries for a working holiday.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan chapter of the Christian charity World Vision said Monday that it has
finished building 50 permanent houses for survivors of Typhoon Morakot, which
devastated parts of Taiwan in August.</P>
      <P>A ceremony will be held on Thursday to celebrate the completion of the homes,
the group said.</P>
      <P>"The celebration on Dec. 17 is a significant milestone for those who are
recovering from the typhoon. The homes stand as a symbol of hope for them and of
the fact that there are people all around Taiwan who are truly concerned about
their future well-being, " Albert Yu, communications manager of World Vision
Taiwan, told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The new houses,  which will be officially handed over to typhoon-affected
families from Jalan Village of the eastern county Taitung on Thursday, will mark
the beginning of the process for villagers to rebuild their village into one
that is full of new memories and joy, according to World Vision Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This is the first batch of 1,200 permanent homes that World Vision Taiwan plans
to build for the storm victims in Taitung, Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Chiayi
counties, some of the worst affected areas.</P>
      <P>The charity has announced that it will invest over NT$1.4 billion (US$433
million)  from  public  donations  in  its  long-term rehabilitation programs to
help storm survivors rebuild their lives.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot swept through Taiwan from Aug. 8-9, killing more than 600

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that it will
mobilize 100,000 people to protest against the upcoming talks between Taiwan and
China in Taichung, central Taiwan, next week.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said that there will be a protest march on Sunday
afternoon, then the demonstrators will split into two lines and converge on a
downtown parking lot at 5 p.m. for a rally.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and four other party heavyweights -- -- former Vice
President Annette Lu, former Premiers Yu Shyi-kun, Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-
chang -- as well as Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Kun-huei, will join
the protests.</P>
      <P>The DPP will urge the government to "stop the closed-door talks and take care of
the people's rice bowls," and advocate that "the people must speak up and must
be the masters " of their own fate, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>At the protest, the party will stage a skit in which it will break an old black
case to symbolize its opposition  to the closed-door cross-strait talks, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Demonstrators will be encouraged to take pots and pans to the protest and create
as much as noise as possible to convey their dissatisfaction with the
government's approach to cross-strait negotiations, he added.</P>
      <P>During the fourth round of talks between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) Dec. 21-25, the
party will stage a series of activities that it said are in the planning stage.</P>
      <P>"Those who care about issues related to people's lives, those who are concerned
about the substandard products in China and the industries that would suffer as
a result of the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement" should come
out on Sunday," Tsai Chi-chang urged. "We demand that the people make the
decisions in cross-strait talks, and that President Ma Ying-jeou listen to the
people's voices," he added.</P>
      <P>The goal is to mobilize 100,000 protesters, but the more the better, he said.</P>
      <P>"The protest will insist on the people's voices being heard, but it will be
peaceful and rational," he added.</P>
      <P>In a related development, an action alliance of several pro-independence groups
in central Taiwan said Monday that it will organize a group of human rights
lawyers to provide legal advice to people about their rights.</P>
      <P>Chen said that many lawyers have misgivings about the upcoming meeting and 16 of
them have joined the group. If the government or police "go overboard" against
the people, the lawyers will advise on ways to seek assistance and redress, he
added.</P>
      <P>DPP Taichung City councilors Chen Shu-hua, Lai Chia-wei and Chi Li-yu, who
unfurled large protest banners last year at the ARATS delegation's hotel in
Taipei, said excessive measures by police had spurred public outrage.</P>
      <P>"If the people are allowed to freely express their views, there will be no
disturbance like last year's, because Taiwan people are actually very friendly,"
Lai said.</P>
      <P>National Police Agency Deputy Director-General Liu Chin-chang said that a
designated controlled area for protesters will not be cordoned off, and people
will be allowed to move freely in and out of the area.</P>
      <P>Also, there will be no body searches by police, except in special circumstances,
Liu added.</P>
      <P>During the second round of SEF-ARATS talks that took place in Taipei in November
last year, Chen and the other Chinese negotiators were besieged by protesters at
a Taipei hotel after attending a dinner party hosted by Kuomintang Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation was unable to leave the hotel until after midnight,
despite a strong police presence.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said earlier this month that this type of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative  Yuan's  internal administration committee passed a resolution
Monday to ban China's senior government officials from buying property in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent Chinese top government officials from investing in Taiwan's
real estate market, the Legislative Yuan's committee decided to add a clause to
the existing regulations governing real estate investments in Taiwan by Chinese
nationals -- to exclude China's communist party and government officials,
military leaders or intelligence officers from being granted rights for real
estate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the committee's meeting Monday, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislator Yeh Yi-ching asked the Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah if the
government will allow Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to invest in Taiwan's properties.</P>
      <P>Jiang responded that if Chen files an application, the local county or city
government will review it and then submit it for the central government's
approval,  but Jiang added that "not all applications will be approved."</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan began to open its real estate market to Chinese investment in 2002,
a total of 35 investment cases have filed applications, with 10 casesVall for
residential use - having been approved, Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, among the 18 cases which have been rejected, one applicant
which had wanted to buy a piece of property in the Boai special district,  an
area near the Presidential Building and presidential residence, was rejected for
security reasons.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the government will continue to examine Chinese applications and see
if there are any security or speculation concerns.</P>
      <P>There are seven cases currently under the review process, Jiang added.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan allows Chinese people to invest in Taiwan's real estates,
Chinese authorities still restrict the amount of fund inflows to Taiwan,
therefore the number of Chinese applications are not as many as expected, said
Jiang while answering legislators questions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is one of a series of brief roundups of selected local newspaper
editorials Monday: APPLE DAILY No rush into cross-strait political negotiations</P>
      <P>While the President Ma Ying-jeou administration is striving hard to forge a
national consensus on the signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA), China is reportedly growing impatient with Ma's
procrastination in starting cross-strait political talks.</P>
      <P>Whatever the case, we must remind the governments on both sides of the strait of
the old adages "more haste, less speed" and "haste makes waste." Both sides
should understand the wisdom behind the proverb "slow work yields fine craft."</P>
      <P>China's indignation  at Ma's deferral exploded  after Chao Chun-shan, chairman
of the Taipei-based Foundation on Asian-Pacific Peace Studies, said at a recent
forum that cross-strait political negotiations could start only after three
conditions are met -- the signing of a memorandum of understanding on financial
supervisory cooperation and an ECFA; a national consensus; and international
acquiescence.</P>
      <P>A Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs immediately responded that Chao's
statement only reflects Ma's excuses for delaying political talks.</P>
      <P>Some Chinese political commentators have said that Chao's remarks mirror his
softened anti-independence position after becoming head of one of the three
major Ma-backed think tanks.</P>
      <P>These comments signify China's discontent with its perception that Ma,  while
currying economic benefits  from Beijing,  is deliberately dragging his feet on
opening cross-strait political talks.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that China wants to launch political negotiations as early
as possible. For one thing, China's present detente efforts will turn out to
have been a waste if Ma is not re-elected in 2012, and its anxiety was
exacerbated after the ruling Kuomintang's recent local election setback.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, China is seeking to lay down a political mechanism  that
cannot  be denied  or changed  even  if the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party gets into power in 2012.</P>
      <P>China's urgency is also fed by the fact that Chinese President Hu Jintao's
tenure will end in 2012. Hu, of course, is seeking to leave his mark on history
by "making a crucial contribution to unification" at a critical juncture.</P>
      <P>Moreover, China believes that now is a good time to hold up Taiwan on the track
of unification as the United States is busy with its wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq and has adopted an unprecedentedly flexible attitude toward China.</P>
      <P>However,  China's rash pressure  on Ma could lead to two detrimental
consequences. First, if Ma were to yield to China's demands, he would lose
popular trust and be defeated in the next presidential polls. Second, if Ma
defies China's demands in order to maintain his dignity and popular support,
China and Ma will lose mutual trust should Ma be re-elected.</P>
      <P>All told, China should not be in a hurry with political talks that could squeeze
Ma into a corner, and Ma should also stick to his guns to avoid losing public
trust.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the reality is that China is moving in the wrong direction.</P>

      <P>The following is one of a series of brief roundups of selected local newspaper
editorials Monday: CHINA TIMES DPP should care about Taiwan's isolation</P>
      <P>Emboldened by its recent election gains, the pro-independence opposition
Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP)  is raising its confrontational rhetoric and
preparing to stage massive protest rallies during a Dec. 21-25 visit by China's
top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Amid looming social unrest, DPP lawmakers are pushing the Mainland Affairs
Council to reveal the hotel where Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits President Chen Yunlin will stay during his stay in the central city of
Taichung.</P>
      <P>While these DPP legislators are asking "where will Chen Yunlin stay? " we are
wondering why they do not ask where Taiwan will go after East Asian countries,
especially Taiwan's arch-competitor South Korea, sign free trade agreements
(FTAs) with China to mutually exempt tariffs and boost the free flow of goods
and capital.</P>
      <P>Faced with the turbulent waves of regional economic integration and
globalization, Taiwan has so far not been able to move a step forward. Where
does Taiwan's future lie?</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Taiwan's market shares in its major export outlets have
experienced steep declines, with the global market share for Taiwan's exports
dropping from 2.19 percent in 1999 to a mere 1.59 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Both South Korea and Singapore have been in intensive talks with its major trade
partners on signing FTAs and once South Korea and China sign a free trade pact,
most of its products will be able to enter the vast Chinese market tariff-free,
while the average tariff rate for Taiwanese products exported to China will
reach 8.94 percent. This will be a lethal impact for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Singapore is one of the countries that have signed FTAs with the largest number
of countries. Until 2003, the city state lagged behind Taiwan in exports, but
its exports have been growing at an annual rate of 18.6 percent on average over
the past five years. Singapore began to overtake Taiwan in terms of exports in
2004.</P>
      <P>Even more worrisome is that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
has become Taiwan's second-largest export market after China. What will be the
consequences after the "ASEAN plus One (China) " free trade area takes effect
Jan. 1?</P>
      <P>The DPP is still vociferously opposing the President Ma Ying-jeou
administration's plan to sign an FTA-like economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China and is attempting to use the topic to justify its
protest activities against Chen's upcoming visit.</P>
      <P>The DPP has long been known for its street-fighting tactics, but its leaders
should think about whether it makes any sense to spend so much energy preparing
to insult a single Chinese negotiator.</P>
      <P>While opposing the administration's ECFA proposal, the party should also come up
with its own platform for Taiwan's economic future.</P>
      <P>DPP leaders once said they would not hesitate to debate with their ruling
Kuomintang counterparts on ECFA issues once the pact's content has been fleshed
out in detail.</P>
      <P>The DPP should therefore let Chen have good talks on the issue with his
Taiwanese counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung, during their meeting in Taichung.</P>
      <P>Since DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen once headed the Mainland Affairs Council, she
should be competent and knowledgeable enough to lead the DPP to draft a better
and more feasible version of the proposed ECFA for reference. The DPP is also
free to suggest a new title for the proposed pact.</P>
      <P>For the sake of Taiwan's well-being, the DPP should present its own meat of
policy incentives instead of just branding as poisoned the policy overtures of
others.</P>

editorials Monday: LIBERTY TIMES Is Taiwan ready to give away tax revenues to
China?</P>
      <P>All of the agreements signed by the President Ma Ying-jeou administration with
China have later proved to be eroding Taiwan's sovereignty and hollowing out its
economic strength. The consequences of a tax accord to be signed at the upcoming
round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks could be even more devastating.</P>
      <P>Once the agreement takes effect, China will have access to full data about
business income taxes and personal income taxes paid to Taiwan's government by a
number of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China and their employees.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Chinese authorities will be able to levy taxes on those
Taiwanese citizens' earnings or incomes grossed in China in the future -- a
situation tantamount to Taiwan helping China levy taxes on Taiwanese citizens or
handing over large sums of tax money to China's coffers.</P>
      <P>The result of the soon-to-be-signed agreement could further worsen Taiwan's tax
shortfall and ultimately undermine its national strength.</P>
      <P>With so many bad omens on the horizon, we are saddened by our officials'
ignorance, as they are still touting the merits of the pact in enhancing
taxation transparency, avoiding double taxation on investors in each other's
territories, attracting Chinese investors and increasing tax revenues.</P>
      <P>One of the Kuomintang government's biggest faults lies in its belief that China
could be Taiwan's savior. It's like asking a ghost to write you a prescription.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration must remember that many of Taiwan's problems have their
roots in China and that their solutions lie in Taiwan. Since revamping the
ailing economy is Ma's top campaign promise,  the government  should start with
improving Taiwan's investment  climate by offering  tax incentives  and
upgrading administrative efficiency to help enhance corporate competitiveness.</P>

      <P>In addition to plans that include restricting rice cultivation in draught-hit
southern Taiwan, there is the need for special funding to pay for the dredging
of serious silt deposits in some reservoirs there, an economics official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Huang Chung-chiou highlighted the need for
measures to combat the draught in southern Taiwan after Premier Wu Den-yih
warned last week that water shortages could begin to affect the region from as
soon as January.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Water Resources Agency (WRA) has triggered its farming suspension
mechanism in the Chiayi and Tainan areas, and that the Taiwan Water Corp. is
planning to launch a price discount program to encourage people to save water.</P>
      <P>In the long run, the silted reservoirs in the region need to be dredged and
equipped with modern self-clearing facilities, he noted.</P>
      <P>WRA Deputy Director-General  Hsieh Sheng-yen has warned in particular that
Chiayi County's Tsengwen Reservoir "is slowly drying up" due to mudslides and
landslides in its catchment area, as well as being inundated with a vast amount
of driftwood washed down by typhoon-triggered flooding.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's superior, Yang Wei-fu, pointed out that the reservoir's water storage
capacity is only at some 40 percent of its effective capacity and that the
capacity declined greatly after Typhoon Morakot in August, adding that its
existing facilities cannot effectively get rid of the silt.</P>

      <P>The following is one of a series of brief roundups of selected local newspaper
editorials Monday: ECONOMIC DAILY NEWS Keys to ending 'stagnant decade'</P>
      <P>Two Academia Sinica academicians, Cyrus C. Y. Chu and Kuan Chung-ming,  have
expressed similar views on Taiwan's economic prospects for the coming year at a
recent forum. Both agree that Taiwan's economy is at a critical juncture after a
"stagnant decade."</P>
      <P>Taiwan averaged 8.18 percent annual growth in the 1980s, but that has fallen to
3.62 percent in the first decade of the 21st century, the lowest among the four
Asian "little dragons."</P>
      <P>The two scholars' studies show that Taiwan's failure to open up to free trade
due to the previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's hostile and
containment policy toward China during its eight years in power has led to a
deterioration of the country's foreign trade position.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, major countries around the world have actively negotiated
free trade agreements to ensure the free flow of merchandise and capital, but
Taiwan has been largely marginalized. It could be further marginalized next year
with the formation of the "ASEAN plus One (China)" free trade area.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan becoming ever more reliant on exports for its economic growth, it
must step up efforts to create a better trade environment. The proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China could be a part of the
solution.</P>
      <P>But we must remind the government that the pact can only be a catalyst rather
than a cure-all.</P>
      <P>The key lies in how the agreement will be signed, how Taiwan's economic
development will be oriented after it is signed, and which kinds of development
strategies will be adopted.</P>
      <P>The government should give a clear picture on these points. Otherwise, its ECFA
campaign will not be convincing.</P>
      <P>Even though it is not suitable to decide whether to sign an ECFA with China by a
public debate, we still look forward to the holding of a debate between
President Ma Ying-jeou and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on the issue because such
a debate will prompt the government to think more thoroughly and more deeply
about the issue.</P>

Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said in a CLA-sponsored forum on the trade pact's impact
on Taiwan's labor market and the government's measures to alleviate potential
problems for local businesses and workers.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the CLA's assistance to laborers will be in two ways - to ensure
the survival of the industries that are still useful and competitive and to help
industries that will become obsolete transition into other fields.</P>
      <P>To help still relevant industries survive, the CLA will assist in negotiations
between the laborers and the management and offer job training to increase
workers' skills.</P>
      <P>For those industries that are not expected to be viable, the government will
provide them counseling and help them shift into other businesses, offering them
subsidies to do so.</P>
      <P>On whether the signing of the ECFA will aggravate the already stark employment
prospects in Taiwan, Minister Wang said: "the impact will not be immediate, but
a long-term one."</P>
      <P>"Employment in sectors varies, but overall, jobs will increase," she added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the forum, Cheng Chih-yu, professor of National Chengchi
University's Institute for Labour Research, called for the government to heed
the rights of middle- and old-aged laborers who will suffer the most.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics by the Directorate General of the Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, Cheng said that the number of jobless people aged 45-64 was up 70.31
percent this year from last year, showing that laborers in this age bracket will
suffer the most.</P>
      <P>Although the government has come up with various measures, he said considering
the difficulties faced by laborers in this age bracket, the government should
come up with a solution to the problems they face: "low income, " "poor working
environment, " "no matching skills," and "age restrictions."</P>
      <P>Hsu Shih-hsun, head of the Department of Agricultural Economics at National
Taiwan University, said that if the ECFA is not signed with China, low-end
laborers will suffer the most.</P>
      <P>He said that if the two sides have not signed the ECFA, when China's free trade
pact with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- the ASEAN plus three
(China, Japan and South Korea) -- comes into effect, it will have a negative
effect on the job needs of most industries.</P>
      <P>Overall, if the competitive edge of traditional industries disappear, low-end
laborers will bear the brunt of the impacts, he added.</P>

      <P>Preparations for the next round of talks between Taiwan and China to take place
later this month in Taichung have entered the final stage,  Chiang Pin-kung,
Taiwan's top negotiator with China, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Still to be decided is the format of a meeting between Chen Yunlin, China's top
negotiator with Taiwan, and Kuomintang honorary chairmen Lien Chan and Wu Poh-
hsiung during Chen's visit, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), is scheduled to visit Taiwan Dec. 21-25 for the fourth round of
formal talks between him and Chiang, the chairman of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Four dinner banquets will be held during Chen's visit, hosted by the SEF, the
ARATS, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, and Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching,
respectively, Chiang said during a briefing on SEF's preparations for the
meeting.</P>
      <P>During Chen's stay in Taiwan, the government will be responsible for ensuring
Chen's safety, Chiang said, noting that the ARATS had not brought up any special
security-related requests.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China will not be discussed at the upcoming cross-strait meeting, but he
said the SEF plans to propose putting the issue on the agenda of the next round
of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Instead, the Taichung meeting will focus on reviewing the implementation of the
nine agreements signed during the three previous rounds of talks to see what
improvements can be made, and finalized the four agreements expected to be
signed on Dec. 22, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The two sides will also address issues related to intellectual property rights
protection and fishing cooperation and discuss the agenda of the fifth round of
negotiations.</P>
      <P>In addition, a seminar on Chinese investment in Taiwan will be held on the
sidelines of the Taichung meeting to allow Taiwanese authorities  and local
businesses  to introduce  the country's investment environment to the visitors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local police are preparing for expected protests during the Chiang-
Chen meeting.</P>
      <P>National Police Agency Deputy Director-General Liu Chin-chang said that although
police will set up a restricted zone near the venue of the meeting to facilitate
security, people will be free to move around the area as usual.</P>
      <P>According to Deputy Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang, the goal of law
enforcement authorities is to ensure the meeting is held smoothly and order is
maintained, while giving the public room to express their opinions.</P>
      <P>Chien warned, though, that the police have been ordered to act swiftly against
protesters who break the law.</P>

      <P>Two more Taiwanese people have died from swine flu, bringing the death toll from
the virus to 35 since the outbreak began earlier this year, health authorities
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Epidemics Command Center (CECC) , both new victims had
underlying health conditions and neither had been immunized for the influenza A
(H1N1) virus.</P>
      <P>One of them was a 28-year-old male resident of eastern Taiwan's Taitung County
who had hypertension and cirrhosis, and the other was a 53-year-old man living
in the southern port city of Kaohsiung who was suffered from hypertension.</P>
      <P>Their situations were not uncommon among the swine flu's victims. Of the 35
people who have died of the H1N1 flu in Taiwan, 85 percent were suffering from
chronic diseases, said Chou Jih-haw, deputy director-general of the Centers for
Disease Control under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>More than 750 people have been hospitalized after catching the H1N1 flu virus in
Taiwan, Chou said, but the number of reported H1N1 infections has dwindled since
an immunization program was launched Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>The campaign initially  focused on groups considered  most vulnerable to the
swine flu, such as typhoon victims housed in shelters, high-risk medical
personnel, elementary school students, pre-school children, pregnant women and
seriously ill patients.</P>
      <P>It was further expanded to Dec. 12 to cover all ordinary citizens.</P>

      <P>The Kinmen Garrison Command on Monday handed over a tunnel that hid howitzers
during the Cold War to the Kinmen County Government, which will convert it into
a new attraction in a park dedicated to the former battlefields of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Garrison Commander Lu Hsiao-jung  and Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-
feng signed a letter confirming the transfer after an artillery battalion
demonstrated to an audience how to prepare to the howitzer to be fired.</P>
      <P>The granite tunnel that was once filled with howitzers was built in June 1970
and helped the frontline island return fire when it was shelled by Chinese
batallions just a few kilometers away in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>After the Cold War, tensions eased between Taiwan and China and the old
battlefields in the northeastern corner of Kinmen were turned into a tourist
attraction.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 18, 1995,  the country's sixth national park was established in Kinmen
and featured the old battlegrounds and the island's unique southern Fujian
architecture.</P>
      <P>In its newest attraction, only one of the old 8-inch howitzers will remain in
the tunnel for tourists to see, according to Lu, while some of the other
decommissioned artillery will be housed in an exhibition hall to be developed by
the county government.</P>
      <P>The hall, which will also screen films on how the howitzers were fired and store
archives about the tunnel, is expected to be completed by the second half of
2010.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation from Taiwan headed by Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
Deputy Minister Chiu Wen-yen arrived in Copenhagen  Sunday for the U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference.</P>
      <P>Chiu said in a telephone interview with the Central News Agency that he hopes to
take the opportunity to discuss with other countries the development of green
energy technologies and solicit the support of Taiwan's diplomatic allies to
help the country participate in the conference in a more dignified way.</P>
      <P>A main goal of the UNFCCC conference is to reach a global agreement among rich
and developing countries that will commit them to specific greenhouse gas
emission reductions, and Chiu believes Taiwan should do the same even if it is
not a signatory nation of the UNFCCC.</P>
      <P>The EPA official said he hopes Taiwan's Legislative Yuan will quickly pass a
greenhouse gas control act to revise the country's target for cutting carbon
dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Chiu also said Taiwan should seek cooperation  with other countries in
introducing their technology or equipment to Taiwan to develop the local
renewable energy sector.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can learn a lot from Europe in terms of the development of green energy
industry, he said,  citing wave and tidal power technologies in the United
Kingdom and the complete renewable energy network developed by Germany.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiu expressed his discontent for EPA officials' participation  in
the conference  in their capacity as expert consultants with the Industrial
Technology Research Institute, a nongovernmental organization.</P>
      <P>As many of Taiwan's allies, such as the island countries of Palau and Kiribati,
are facing the threat of being submerged by rising sea levels, the delegation
will discuss with them ways Taiwan could help address the climate warming issue
and seek their support to push Taiwan's participation in the conference as an
observer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been excluded from participating in the U.N. climate talks as a
"state" because it is neither a member of the U.N. nor a UNFCCC signatory
nation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , Taiwan's leading
technology research institute, plans to help 70 percent of Taiwan's 18,000
clinics use electronic medical records within three years, the head of ITRI's
cloud computing research center said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiueh Tzi-cker, the head of ITRI's Cloud Computing Research Center for Mobile
Application (CCMA) , said at a seminar that the management of electronic medical
records and digital pictures through cloud computing technology -- is the
center's major focus in developing the cloud computing mobile applications
market.</P>
      <P>The CCMA, which was jointly established by ITRI and IBM in September, has
started working with many of Taiwan's small clinics to set up cloud computing
platforms suitable for developing and using electronic medical records, the ITRI
official said.</P>
      <P>Chiueh, a former director of the Core Research Group at Symantec, also said the
CCMA hopes to launch its self-developed cloud computing data center and
operating system by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The center believes the new system will create new commercial opportunities for
Taiwan and boost the country's exports.</P>
      <P>The CCMA has 33 employees divided into three teams -- hardware equipment,
software services, and applications. The center will continue to expand in the
near future, Chiueh said, with the number of employees expected to increase to
80 in the first quarter of 2010 and 150 in 2011.</P>
      <P>The center is expected to have a budget of NT$200 million (US$6.1 million) in
2010, ITRI said in September.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing is a Web-enabled software solution that uses the Internet as a
platform for performing tasks on the computer and delivers a range of inter-
operable applications.</P>
      <P>According to the institute, cloud computing can help a 200-person operation
reduce costs by about 30 percent.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwan's cloud computing services market is expected to reach
NT$5.56 billion this year, up 12.8 percent from last year, and could climb to
NT$6.21 billion next year, the Market Intelligence &amp; Consulting Institute
said in November.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told the Wall Street Journal Asia that military means is
one of the means his government will use to defend Taiwan, but it will also
depend on the country's soft power to engage China.</P>
      <P>In an interview with WSJ Asia editorial writer Leslie Hook in November at the
Presidential  Office,  Ma described  what his administration has achieved over
the past months in reducing tension in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He mentioned direct flights between Beijing and Taipei, direct postal links and
cargo shipments, Taiwan's opening to mainland tourists, and agreements on
fishing crews, industrial certification standards, agricultural standards, and
avoiding double taxation that are expected to be signed in Taichung in late
December.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue the current state of affairs, easing tension across the Taiwan
Strait, and trying to forge a closer relationship in economic and other fields,"
Ma added.</P>
      <P>Arguing that "Taiwan might be left in the cold and marginalized" as the pace of
regional economic integration continues to increase, the president insisted that
Taiwan needed to urgently open its economy to China and systemize trade through
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Describing Chinese tourists who visit Taiwan as a central part of his vision, Ma
said "they are very impressed by the society... a society where individuals
respect each other's rights and privacy, and the right to freedom of
speech....they also admire some of our democratic institutions."</P>
      <P>The story also noted that Ma emphasized that his diplomacy is built around the
"three no's" -- no unification during his term in office, no pursuit of de jure
independence, and no use of force to resolve differences across the strait.</P>
      <P>Referring to the idea of unification, Ma was quoted as saying that "both sides
have a lot to learn about each other."</P>
      <P>"Conditions for unification are not ripe, " and "we don't even know each other
that well,"the president maintained.</P>

      <P>A delegation from Taiwan headed by Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
Deputy Minister Chiu Wen-yen arrived in Copenhagen  Sunday for the U.N.
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference.</P>
      <P>Chiu said in a telephone interview with the Central News Agency that he hopes to
take the opportunity to discuss with other countries the development of green
energy technologies and solicit the support of Taiwan's diplomatic allies to
help the country participate in the conference in a more dignified way.</P>
      <P>A main goal of the UNFCCC conference is to reach a global agreement among rich
and developing countries that will commit them to specific greenhouse gas
emission reductions, and Chiu believes Taiwan should do the same even if it is
not a signatory nation of the UNFCCC.</P>
      <P>The EPA official said he hopes Taiwan's Legislative Yuan will quickly pass a
greenhouse gas control act to revise the country's target for cutting carbon
dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Chiu also said Taiwan should seek cooperation  with other countries in
introducing their technology or equipment to Taiwan to develop the local
renewable energy sector.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can learn a lot from Europe in terms of the development of green energy
industry, he said,  citing wave and tidal power technologies in the United
Kingdom and the complete renewable energy network developed by Germany.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiu expressed his discontent for EPA officials' participation  in
the conference  in their capacity as expert consultants with the Industrial
Technology Research Institute, a nongovernmental organization.</P>
      <P>As many of Taiwan's allies, such as the island countries of Palau and Kiribati,
are facing the threat of being submerged by rising sea levels, the delegation
will discuss with them ways Taiwan could help address the climate warming issue
and seek their support to push Taiwan's participation in the conference as an
observer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been excluded from participating in the U.N. climate talks as a
"state" because it is neither a member of the U.N. nor a UNFCCC signatory

      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , Taiwan's leading
technology research institute, plans to help 70 percent of Taiwan's 18,000
clinics use electronic medical records within three years, the head of ITRI's
cloud computing research center said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiueh Tzi-cker, the head of ITRI's Cloud Computing Research Center for Mobile
Application (CCMA) , said at a seminar that the management of electronic medical
records and digital pictures through cloud computing technology -- is the
center's major focus in developing the cloud computing mobile applications
market.</P>
      <P>The CCMA, which was jointly established by ITRI and IBM in September, has
started working with many of Taiwan's small clinics to set up cloud computing
platforms suitable for developing and using electronic medical records, the ITRI
official said.</P>
      <P>Chiueh, a former director of the Core Research Group at Symantec, also said the
CCMA hopes to launch its self-developed cloud computing data center and
operating system by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The center believes the new system will create new commercial opportunities for
Taiwan and boost the country's exports.</P>
      <P>The CCMA has 33 employees divided into three teams -- hardware equipment,
software services, and applications. The center will continue to expand in the
near future, Chiueh said, with the number of employees expected to increase to
80 in the first quarter of 2010 and 150 in 2011.</P>
      <P>The center is expected to have a budget of NT$200 million (US$6.1 million) in
2010, ITRI said in September.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing is a Web-enabled software solution that uses the Internet as a
platform for performing tasks on the computer and delivers a range of inter-
operable applications.</P>
      <P>According to the institute, cloud computing can help a 200-person operation
reduce costs by about 30 percent.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwan's cloud computing services market is expected to reach
NT$5.56 billion this year, up 12.8 percent from last year, and could climb to
NT$6.21 billion next year, the Market Intelligence &amp; Consulting Institute

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told the Wall Street Journal Asia that military means is
one of the means his government will use to defend Taiwan, but it will also
depend on the country's soft power to engage China.</P>
      <P>In an interview with WSJ Asia editorial writer Leslie Hook in November at the
Presidential  Office,  Ma described  what his administration has achieved over
the past months in reducing tension in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He mentioned direct flights between Beijing and Taipei, direct postal links and
cargo shipments, Taiwan's opening to mainland tourists, and agreements on
fishing crews, industrial certification standards, agricultural standards, and
avoiding double taxation that are expected to be signed in Taichung in late
December.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue the current state of affairs, easing tension across the Taiwan
Strait, and trying to forge a closer relationship in economic and other fields,"
Ma added.</P>
      <P>Arguing that "Taiwan might be left in the cold and marginalized" as the pace of
regional economic integration continues to increase, the president insisted that
Taiwan needed to urgently open its economy to China and systemize trade through
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Describing Chinese tourists who visit Taiwan as a central part of his vision, Ma
said "they are very impressed by the society... a society where individuals
respect each other's rights and privacy, and the right to freedom of
speech....they also admire some of our democratic institutions."</P>
      <P>The story also noted that Ma emphasized that his diplomacy is built around the
"three no's" -- no unification during his term in office, no pursuit of de jure
independence, and no use of force to resolve differences across the strait.</P>
      <P>Referring to the idea of unification, Ma was quoted as saying that "both sides
have a lot to learn about each other."</P>
      <P>"Conditions for unification are not ripe, " and "we don't even know each other
that well,"the president maintained.</P>

difference?"</TEXT>

      <P>Most people in the country,  however, including university students, seem to
have little understanding of the content of the proposed deal. On Monday, the
student unions of three universities in Taiwan -- National Taiwan University,
National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, and National Taiwan Normal
University -- released a joint statement, asking Premier Wu Den-yih to explain
to students in person what the ECFA is all about. (Dec. 15, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said Monday that the government
has planned a fund of NT$95 billion (US$2.94 billion) to help manufacturing
sectors expected to be "vulnerable" to the planned signing of the ECFA upgrade
and transform their businesses.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that half of the funding will be used to directly help workers.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>As the Straits Exchange Foundation -- Taiwan's intermediary body founded to
handle cross-strait exchanges -- was holding a board meeting, the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) issued a statement Monday urging the
government to fully communicate with the legislature on the content of the
proposed ECFA and put it up to a national referendum before it takes effect. It
also demanded that the issue not be put on the agenda of the upcoming cross-
strait talks in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>The DPP previously collected signatures calling for a national referendum on
whether the trade pact should be subject to a referendum. The request was
rejected by an Executive Yuan screening committee, but DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-
wen has filed a petition challenging the decision, according to spokesman Tsai
Chi-chang, who added that the party is still waiting for the result.</P>

      <P>The legislature passed an amendment to the Foreign Trade Act on Tuesday that
will require the government to set up a "Taiwan pavilion" or Taiwan exhibition
zone at domestic and foreign trade fairs to help promote Taiwan-made products.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Sing-nan of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
who initiated the amendment, said it is a challenge for Taiwanese businesses to
attend international trade fairs overseas because of the time, money and
manpower they need to set up their own booth.</P>
      <P>The government, therefore, is obliged to help fund businesses in promoting
Taiwan-made products whenever possible,  including by setting up a Taiwan
pavilion or exhibition zone at trade shows or assisting local businesses in
attending overseas exhibitions, he argued.</P>
      <P>The amendment will help meet those goals and boost the image of Taiwan-made
products by requiring the government to subsidize the activities of local
companies, organizations and civil groups in promoting foreign trade, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the amendment will also require that traders of strategic high-tech

      <P>Taiwan's media played up a comment by President Ma Ying-jeou in The Wall Street
Journal Asia Monday that the unification of China and Taiwan would depend on
events over the next "decade, " but the Presidential Office said Tuesday Ma was
misquoted and produced a tape recording to prove it.</P>
      <P>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Asia published Monday, Ma was
quoted as saying: "Whether there will be reunification as expected by the
mainland side depends very much on what is going to unfold in the next decade.
This is a question no one can answer at this stage."</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office ran a recording of the interview, however, in which the
president clearly said the word "decades" rather than "decade" as reported.</P>
      <P>Consistent with the longer time frame, Ma then said that the 23 million people
of Taiwan want to "secure one or two generations of peace and prosperity so that
people on either side of the Taiwan Strait can have sufficient time and freedom
to understand, to appreciate, and to decide what to do."</P>
      <P>President Ma also said that "the people on the Chinese mainland do not quite
understand my policy, " referring to the "three no's" -- no unification during
his term in office, no pursuit of de jure independence, and no use of force to
resolve differences across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes they don't understand why we don't want unification, " Ma was quoted
as saying in the report, and "it's quite obvious that conditions for unification
are not ripe. And we don't even know each other that well."</P>
      <P>In the interview, Ma also felt that the increased presence of Chinese tourist in
Taiwan could provide a historic opportunity by helping spread Taiwan's values
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I want to create a situation where the two sides can see which system is better
for the Chinese culture, for the Chinese people, " Ma was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>But he also pointed out that it is a dream Beijing leaders don't share and that
"they are a long way from embracing Taiwan's democratic experiment."</P>
      <P>The interview was conducted at the Presidential Office on Nov. 25 by Leslie
Hook, an editorial writer for the newspaper.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese delegate attending a global meeting on climate change in Copenhagen
argued that it is not in the spirit of carbon emissions reduction if carbon
emission credits are traded as futures.</P>
      <P>"Every country should spare no effort to cut carbon emissions. Only if they
cannot achieve binding targets should they be able to buy credits, " Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI) Executive Vice President Chu Hsin-sen told
reporters in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>"It is not helping global carbon emissions reduction if one does nothing but
just buy the credits," he added.</P>
      <P>Chu, who is heading Taiwan's delegation at the 2009 United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference being held in Denmark's
capital, was addressing calls for relaxing provisions in the Kyoto Protocol's
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).</P>
      <P>The mechanism allows  industrial countries to help developing countries earn
carbon emission credits by investing in projects or transferring technology that
will reduce carbon dioxide emissions in developing countries.</P>
      <P>The mechanism, however, has sparked criticism and disputes because some
interpret it as giving developed countries the right to pollute. Some studies
have concluded that many CDM programs have loopholes and have contributed little
to carbon emissions reduction.</P>
      <P>Environmental groups have expressed concern over a trend emerging from the
ongoing climate talks in Copenhagen where some negotiators hope to relax CDM
restrictions to make it easier for rich investors to buy carbon emission
credits.</P>
      <P>One of those groups lobbying  for more freedom under the cap-and-trade  system
is the International  Emissions  Trading Association (IETA).</P>
      <P>Although the ITRI is one of the IETA's 169 members, Chu said he does not agree
with the group's intention to treat carbon emission credits as futures.</P>
      <P>The IETA has been nominated as one of eight candidates for the Angry Mermaid
Award --  launched  by environmental  protection organizations including Friends
of the Earth International to shame companies  and corporate lobbyists who are
trying to sabotage effective action on climate change.</P>
      <P>The winner of the angry mermaid award will be announced at the Copenhagen
climate talks on Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan ranked the 47th among 57 countries with the world's largest carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions in the latest climate change performance index, dropping
from its previous ranking of 32nd place, according to the index for 2010
released on Monday.</P>
      <P>The German non-governmental organization, Germanwatch, presented the "Climate
Change Performance Index (CCPI) 2010" together with the Climate Action Network
Europe (CAN-Europe) -- a union of over 100 European organizations advocating
environmental protection -- in Germany and at the United Nations climate
conference taking place in Copenhagen, Denmark.</P>
      <P>The CCPI, published annually by Germanwatch and CAN-Europe, compares the climate
protection performance of 57 industrialized countries and emerging economies.</P>
      <P>The 57 countries and economies together account for more than 90 percent of
global energy-related CO2 emissions.</P>
      <P>The CCPI contains three partial ratings, including the evaluation of emissions
trends, that of a country's current emissions level, and that of a country's
national and international climate policies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was not evaluated as part of the system until 2008, when it was ranked
32nd place among 57 countries in the CCPI for 2009 with 51.5 points, a
performance better than its Asian neighbors of Singapore, South Korea, Japan and
China.</P>
      <P>But in the CCPI for 2010, Taiwan only got 47.5 points, which pushed it down to
the "poor" category.</P>
      <P>According to the 2010 index, Taiwan's performance in carbon reduction was seen
to be better than only Malaysia and China in Asia, while lagging behind India,
Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.</P>
      <P>In separate ratings, Taiwan fell in ranking to behind the 40th place in all the
evaluation of carbon emissions of power departments, the CO2 emission volume of
every unit of preliminary energy sources like coal and crude oil, and the per-
capita consumption of the preliminary energy sources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan only received a good score with its climate policies, and was seen as
having  improved  in the CO2 emissions  of road transportation,  as well  as
those  of the manufacturing  and construction sectors.</P>
      <P>Germanwatch's Jan Burck, one of the CCPI report authors, told the CNA that
industrial and developing countries around the world should equally share the
obligation to cut carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>The per-capita carbon emission volume should be the same among the countries by
2050, Burck said.</P>
      <P>Speaking of Taiwan's ranking, the expert who has helped develop the CCPI
methodology, said Taiwan fell behind in the climate change performance because
it has experienced significant growth in carbon emission volume per capita since
1990.</P>
      <P>In the latest CCPI index, Brazil, Sweden, Britain and Germany all recorded the
best performance, while China and the United States placed in the "very poor"
category along with Australia and Canada.</P>
      <P>According to Burck, countries are ranked against one another as well as against
the criteria of keeping temperature rise below the dangerous level of two
degrees. Since no country is thus far from adequately on the path toward halting
dangerous climate change, the three top spots in the rankings are empty once
again this year.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is compared only to the other countries, then it would rank in the
44th place this year, but since the CCPI compares countries not only to each
other but to the criteria, Taiwan therefore ranks 47th place this year.</P>

      <P>The decline in Taiwan's performance in protecting the environment from climate
change show that the country still has room for improvement in this aspect, the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>However, it noted that Taiwan's carbon dioxide emission volume in 2008 posted
negative growth for the first time.</P>
      <P>According to the fifth Climate Change Performance Index released Monday by
Germanwatch and Climate Action Network Europe, Taiwan ranks 47th among 57
countries, with a rounded score of 47.5 this year, down from 32nd in the
previous year when the country's score was 51.5.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's performance has been rated as "poor" for both years.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen said the results indicate that other
countries have performed better than Taiwan and that Taiwan needs to work harder
to push its ranking upward.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that Taiwan's efforts to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions
have produced some initial results.</P>
      <P>For example, the volume of Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions in 2008 was 4.4
percent lower than the previous year, and the per capita emissions was 4 percent
lower, Shen said.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's unsatisfactory overall performance, Shen pointed out that the
country is ranked 7th in terms of climate policy this year.</P>
      <P>This, he said, demonstrates that the various carbon reduction measures adopted
by the government, including the enactment of the Renewable Energy Development
Act, have won Taiwan international recognition.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  EPA Deputy Minister Chiu Wen-yen,  who was in Copenhagen to attend
the United Nations Climate Change Conference, told the Central News Agency that
there is a need for Taiwan's industrial and electricity generation sectors to
increase their awareness on climate protection.</P>
      <P>He noted that more than 60 percent of Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions are from
the electricity generation sector.</P>

Morakot.</P>
      <P>They included 500 Navy personnel from the USS Denver, an amphibious transport

AIT, and staff of the U.S. Defense Department.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, who was also at the ceremony, Defense Minister Kao extended

    <DATELINE>12/15/09  19:20:21</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The bride is the daughter of Ferry Yahia, former Indonesian economic and trade
representative in Taipei. Mrs. Yahia is a daughter of the Palembang datuk, an
Indonesian counterpart of a great British lord of yore.</P>
      <P>Her daughter' s traditional wedding ceremony, which took place at a rebuilt
regal Sumatran palace in the Pendopo Agung Sasono Utomo cultural theme park in
the heart of Jakarta, started with a parade, led by a martial-art dancing duet.
The performance appears like an ancient bride-robbing ritual.</P>
      <P>Under a noble canopy, the couple to be married, in full princely and princessly
regalia, followed with a long cortege of ladies in waiting. They proceeded to
the throne-like seats between those of the parents of the bride and the groom.</P>
      <P>Siti should be fascinated to watch the wedding parade in the palace along with
hundreds of relatives, friends and dignitaries. She wasn't, for she had to wait
in vain until after all of them had extended congratulations to the newly-weds
and their parents in law for a chance to get the only thing she wanted, telor
asin.</P>
      <P>That's one of the salted duck eggs, attached to short plumed bamboo sticks like
Easter eggs. They were inserted into a straw- wrapped pole decorated like a
Christmas tree. Siti coveted telor asin, which would be given away to guests as
a souvenir for their lucky attendance, though she doesn't know how salted duck
eggs, a common and not expensive Chinese delicacy, have come to be part of
Indonesian culinary culture.</P>
      <P>Chinese emigrants to the former Dutch East Indies left their southern Fujian
home a little earlier than those who migrated to Taiwan in the 17th century.
Salted duck eggs were one of the least expensive sources of protein on their
diet.</P>
      <P>Indigenous peoples on Taiwan did not take to the salted eggs, but their cousins
in the Dutch Indies did. Well, some of Taiwan's tribespeople still keep away the
eggs which they regard as taboo.</P>
      <P>Over the years the Austronesian people in Indonesia have come to consider telor
asin a coveted part of their diet, like bihun, rice vermicelli that is Taiwan's
most popular "pasta."</P>
      <P>They accept rice vermicelli as their own and use the Hoklo word of bihun to call
the tasty food, which is also enjoyed by those Japanese born and brought up on
Taiwan while it was under Japan's colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Waiting for almost two hours, Siti was close to tears, when she was given the
souvenir. All her misery was gone. She beamed when Sun Shine Kwang, chairperson
of Radio Taiwan International, gave her her telor asin.</P>
      <P>Visiting Jakarta to attend the 72nd founding anniversary of Antara, Kwang was
invited to the prince's wedding party. Andrew Hsia, Taipei's economic and trade
representative in Indonesia, had also been invited, but he had to excuse
himself. As he had to attend a meeting in Bali of Taiwan businessmen in
Indonesia, he asked Tommy Lee, his press counselor, to represent him.</P>
      <P>While in Jakarta, Kwang's RTI signed a memorandum of understanding on news
exchange with the Indonesian national news agency on news exchange. So did
Antara and the Central News Agency. Their cooperation is expected to promote a
better understanding and friendship between Taiwan and Indonesia, the largest of
the ASEAN states.</P>
      <P>All ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will join China in
forming one of the world's biggest free trade zones, come January 1. Taiwan has
to promote trade with and investment in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>"You know our Taiwan entrepreneurs have invested heavily in Indonesia," said
Lester Leu, deputy director of the economic division of the Taipei Economic and
Trade Office in Jakarta.</P>
      <P>Indonesia is the third top destination of Taiwan's foreign direct investment
after China and Vietnam. They invest mostly in textile and other manufacturing
industries. "We hope more investment will come to Indonesia from Taiwan," Leu
said.</P>
      <P>Some investors from Taiwan must introduce products that will become part of
Indonesian culture like telor as in and bihun. (By Joe Hung)</P>

      <P>Taipei City's government will look into an accusation made by a city councilor,
who accused China of copying the emblem design of its 2010 Taipei International
Gardening and Horticulture Exposition (Taipei Intl Flora Expo) for a similar
domestic event in Beijing, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kao Chen-yuan, head of the Taipei City Government's Department of Economic
Development, said that it remains uncertain whether Beijing did pirate Taipei's
design for the 7th China Flower Expo that ran from Sept. 26-Oct. 5 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said that the emblem of the Taipei Int'l Flora Expo is inspired by orchids,
while Beijing's emblem is based on peonies, but that the city government will
ask experts to determine the similarity of the two emblems based on their design
and concepts.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City government will resort to legal actions if Beijing's emblem is a
pirated copy of its emblem, he added.</P>
      <P>Kao made the remarks at a press conference held by Hung Chien-yi, a city
councilor of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. Hung accused Beijing
of copying the emblem design of the Taipei flora expo, saying that the emblem of
the 2010 Taipei Int'l Flora Expo was revealed in February 2008, while Beijing
presented its design in September that year.</P>
      <P>The two look so much alike in the choice of color, their shape and overall
patterns, according to Hung.</P>
      <P>"Besides the tiny difference on the design of the peripheral part of the
flowers, the two emblems have a 90 percent resemblance," Hung said. "I think the
Taipei City government should take legal actions against Beijing and seek
compensations," Hung said.</P>
      <P>Scheduled to be held for the first time in Taiwan from Nov. 6, 2010 to April 25,
2011, the Taipei Int'l Flora Expo is the first category A2B1 world exposition
for Taiwan to host under the authorization of the Netherlands-based
International Association of Horticultural Producers.</P>
      <P>The Int'l Flora Expo is dubbed as the "Olympics in horticultural industry, "
while the China Flower Expo, launched in 1987, is a nation-level exhibition held
domestically in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIER adjusts 2010 economic forecast upward</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15. (CNA)
12/15/09  19:29:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local think tank forecast Tuesday a 4.66 percent economic growth for Taiwan
next year, 0.01 percentage points over its previous prediction made in October.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) also predicted that the
economic contraction will be reduced to 2.96 percent from its previous forecast
of 3.72 percent, against a backdrop of rising consumer confidence, boosted
revenues for both the retail and restaurant sectors, and positive November
growth of both exports and imports -- the first growth of this kind this year.</P>
      <P>However, Wang Lee-rong, director of CIER's Center for Economic Forecasting, said
at a Taipei seminar on global economic prospects that the country's employment
market will only show signs of slow recovery, with the jobless rate moving
downward to 5.8 percent next year compared to this year's 5.91 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang said that although the world economy has began to bottom out, there are
still unfavorable factors, including a possible comeback of inflation -- a
result of famine, rising oil prices, depreciation of the U.S. currency and
speculation -- and a rapid accumulation of national debts among the developed
countries.</P>
      <P>Turning to China's economic performance, CIER research fellow Tien Chun-mei said
the country is sure to achieve its projected 8 percent growth for 2009.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he warned of the risk of a Chinese economic bubble brought  about
by the government's  heavy  financial  burden, over-production, the expanding
gap between the rich and the poor, the skyrocketing loan volume and rising share
and property prices.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Chinese currency has depreciated 6.9 percent since February this
year, resulting in frequent U. S. accusations that Beijing has manipulated the
value of its currency at the expense of reduced job opportunities in the U.S.
and demands for a correction to help safeguard steady global economic growth.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/15/09  19:38:36
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Based on statistics for the first 11 months of 2009, Taiwan's tax revenues could
fall NT$250 billion short of the budgeted target. It will not be difficult for
the government to make up for the shortfall, but we are worried about the
prospect of finding a real solution to the government's financial woes.</P>
      <P>The huge shortfall can be attributed to the excessive optimism of planners when
they worked out last year's budget, but we also believe such a result is self-
induced.</P>
      <P>The Tax Reform Committee under the Executive Yuan has buckled under the slogan
of "increasing debt to save the economy" and the strong lobbying of vested
interests, leading to a spate of tax cuts rather than tax hikes.</P>
      <P>We are worried that tax revenue shortfalls will become a long-term phenomenon as
tax reduction measures passed this year begin to take effect in the future.
Premier Wu Den-yih's rejection of proposals to expand the tax base and raise the
value-added tax rate out of political considerations also does not bode well for
future revenues.</P>
      <P>The country's financial woes are now extremely serious. The Directorate  General
of the Budget,  Statistics and Accounting estimates that next year's budget
deficit will reach 22 percent of overall government spending, and that new debt,
including special budgets, will exceed NT$500 billion. Both would be record
highs.</P>
      <P>No one likes tax increases, but the public cannot accept it if the country is
plunged into financial turmoil. Premier Wu should show his rage at such a
predicament.</P>

      <P>As world leaders are meeting in Copenhagen to discuss climate change, President
Ma Ying-jeou has urged the public to help build Taiwan as environmentally
responsible country.</P>
      <P>But we notice that Ma failed to mention his most important pillar of
environmental protection -- energy taxes. This omission, coupled with Premier Wu
Den-yih's recent remarks that there is no timetable for the implementation of an
energy tax, raises doubts over the government's determination to introduce the
tax.</P>
      <P>Without a solid policy, Taiwan would not be able to attain the goal of becoming
an environmentally responsible country.</P>
      <P>Rich and poor countries are fighting bitterly at the Copenhagen meeting on who
should cut more carbon emissions. Although Taiwan is not a member of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and has no obligation to abide by
any agreements reached at the meeting, it has already experienced the disastrous
results of global warming, as seen during Typhoon Morokat in August.</P>
      <P>After such an ordeal, can Taiwan still buck world trends and recklessly develop
more high-polluting and high energy-consuming industries?</P>
      <P>We should be ashamed of our record, as Taiwan has one of the fastest emissions
growth rates in the world and the rate has escalated sharply since 1999.
Analyses indicate that the government, with its long-term support for low-cost
energy and high-energy industries, should be blamed.</P>
      <P>If President Ma, now that he is also chairman of the ruling party, cannot
deliver on his presidential campaign promise to introduce a basic energy tax, we
don't know how he can talk about building an environmentally responsible
country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Quite a few observers have described Taiwan politics in recent years as "blue
versus green, " but we believe that blue, represented by the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT), has actually disappeared from the political scene as the blue parties
have become proxies of the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Since 2005 when then KMT Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese leader Hu Jintao signed
a communique, the KMT has embraced the CPC "ideologically." Three years later,
Ma Ying-jeou was elected president and the communique was even put into the
party's platform.</P>
      <P>With the KMT doing little except toeing the CPC line, the pacts signed between
the two parties, including the nine agreements and one consensus reached during
the last three rounds of cross-strait talks, have yielded fewer benefits than
promised.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, more and more Taiwan people are learning the truth. Recent public
opinion polls have shown that a high percentage of the public wants the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China to be delayed and the
government to clearly explain the nature of the agreement.</P>
      <P>President Ma has instructed that the ECFA publicity campaign be stepped up and
has said he would debate the issue if necessary. We think there has been too
much publicity and too little explanation of policy since Ma took office.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, the exercise of civil rights through referendum is the
last safety net in the formulation of policies toward China.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/15/09  19:39:14
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After the ruling Kuomintang suffered a setback in the Dec. 5 elections,
President Ma Ying-jeou offered to have an open debate with opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen on a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), which was a target of attacks during the
local elections.</P>
      <P>But what is strange is that Tsai claims that she does not even know what the
ECFA is, a claim that seems to be in line with most experts and the media, not
to mention ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The ECFA has been one of the most important policies of the Ma administration.
We wonder why the trade pact is still a mystery to most others even after one
year of intensive publicity campaign.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is without doubt a free trade agreement under the World Trade
Organization. Taiwan has wanted desperately to sign FTAs with other countries,
but has been in the past hampered by China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Now that China, our biggest trade rival, is willing to sign this FTA-like pact
with us, why are Taiwanese people afraid?</P>
      <P>We would like to take the ASEAN free trade agreement as an example, which
actually evolved from an ECFA a decade ago. After the signing of the FTA, most
of the commodities will begin a free trade, and reach a free trade status within
two or three years.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the ECFA will be for both sides to negotiate a framework, and there
is no substantive free trade, or at most is about "3,000" kinds of items on the
"early harvest list."</P>
      <P>In the ensuing negotiations on specific items and service trade, the reciprocity
will become more clear, but unless specific items are negotiated and signed,
there will be no free trade. Such a process can take as long as several years to
10 years..</P>
      <P>Even if both sides of the Taiwan Strait sign the ECFA next year, the situation
could still be the same within the next few years.</P>
      <P>Even so, we think that there is still room for debate, such as the impacts on
Taiwan's industrial structure, public employment, as well as whether the signing
of the ECFA will remove the hurdles for Taiwan to sign FTAs with other
countries.</P>
      <P>If the ruling and opposition parties could clear misgivings through debates, it
will help clear the way for the KMT to move toward a new milestone.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Design and concept of Taiwan pavilion for Shanghai Expo revealed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The design and concept of Taiwan's pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo 2010 was
officially revealed Tuesday in Taipei, with high-ranking officials from the
expo's organizing committee coming to promote the much-anticipated event.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan pavilion, which is designed by renowned Taiwanese architect Lee Chu-
yuan, features a theme revolving around nature and soul.</P>
      <P>The outside structure of the pavilion resembles a "sky lantern" or "Kong Ming
lantern, " which people fly during Chinese New Year and the Lantern Festival to
pray for happiness, safety and health. It is a steel structure covered with
smart film, a new kind of smart glass technology that adjusts to light under
electric pressure to switch between a transparent and a semi-opaque state.</P>
      <P>Hanging down from the roof of the Taiwan Pavilion is a gigantic globe made of a
panoramic light-emitting diode (LED) screen, which will display projections of
Taiwan's natural and cultural images.</P>
      <P>Lee said that while the 20th Century world expos empathized on technology
civilization, the 21st Century expos should be focused on the spiritual and
soulful aspects of human beings.</P>
      <P>Wang Chih-kang, chairman of the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC) -- which is in
charge of the Taiwan pavilion project -- said that Taiwan's participation in the
2010 World Expo is of special significance, as it will be the first time in 40
years that it was invited.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had not participated in world expos over the past four decades because
the country is not a member of the Paris-based Bureau of International
Exhibitions. It was blocked from becoming a member of the Bureau due to
opposition from China, which considers Taiwan a part of its territory and
objects to Taiwan participating in groups whose members are normally countries.
With improving relations between Beijing and Taipei, however, Taiwan received
invitation from China on May 21 this year to take part in the event it is
hosting.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the construction of the Taiwan pavilion is going according to
schedule, with the exhibition hall's steel structure completed on Dec. 10. It
took less than four months for workers to finish the pavilion's steel structure,
since construction started in August, according to Wang, adding that the
exhibition will be installed by the end of March and trial operations will start
in April.</P>
      <P>Zhong Yanqun, a deputy director of the World Expo 2010 Shanghai Executive
Committee, was among a delegation of the Shanghai Expo organizing committee who
attended the ceremony to officially reveal what the Taiwan pavilion will look
like.</P>
      <P>With 137 days to go before the Shanghai Expo opens, Zhong expressed great
confidence in the event, saying that the construction and preparation work are
going smoothly and that the event is expected to attract a record 70 million
visitors.</P>
      <P>"I sincerely invite people from Taiwan to visit the 2010 Shanghai Expo," Zhong
said. "As the events emblem is trying to represent, the expo will not only serve
as the platform for cultural exchanges, but also a special occasion for people
from around the world to gather joyfully together."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Luxury houses to be heavily taxed: finance ministry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of Finance (MOF) Chang Sheng-ho confirmed Tuesday that the
government is considering a heavy tax on luxury homes and said that his ministry
will present a detailed plan after an initial assessment is completed in spring
2010.</P>
      <P>The MOF has asked the Taipei City Government's revenue service to formulate a
definition of luxury mansions within its jurisdiction by March or April 2010, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Based on that initial definition of a luxury home, the MOF will devise a
detailed process to appraise the market value of such residences and to levy
higher taxes on them across the country, " Chang added.</P>
      <P>Citing the Taipei Revenue Service, Chang said houses valued at more than NT$100
million (US$3.1 million) in Taipei City would be considered luxury residences.
The existing tax on such properties is unfairly low, he added.</P>
      <P>A deluxe home in Taipei City can cost NT$2 million to NT$3 million per ping
(3.305 square meters) , but the tax on a NT$100 million residence is only about
NT$38,000 a year, Chang noted. This is extremely low compared to public space
management fees for such buildings, which is around NT$50,000 to NT$60,000 per
month, he said.</P>
      <P>The MOF has reportedly notified all tax offices in other cities and counties to
take similar steps based on the Taipei City model, with the intention of raising
taxes on luxury homes nationwide by 2011.</P>
      <P>On the reports, stock prices of major construction companies, such as Kindom
Construction, Kuo Yang Construction, Huang Hsiang Construction, Highwealth
Construction and Farglory Land Development, fell on the local bourse by an
average of about 2 percent during Tuesday's trading.</P>
      <P>Kindom, which is set to launch several construction projects in upscale
districts in Taipei and Taichung cities, suffered the biggest stock price plunge
of more than 3.5 percent shortly after the market opened, and did not recover
during the day's trading.</P>
      <P>Highwealth, which is planning to build a luxury tower near the intersection of
Nangjing East Road and Hsinsheng East Road in downtown Taipei, with each unit
valued at more than NT$100 million, saw its stock price fall by over 1.6 percent
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although the MOF's taxation plan is likely to affect the stock performance of
some high-end construction companies in the short term, analysts forecast, the
impact would be more psychological than substantial.</P>
      <P>The luxury house tax would not significantly affect the wealthy, according to
one analyst.</P>
      <P>As long as bank interest rates remain low, the tax will not produce any major
impact on the local bourse and the real estate property market will continue to
prosper, others contended.</P>
      <P>The tax is unlikely to drive down top-end housing prices in Taipei City, as
deluxe homes are not usually built on average land plots, and wealthy people
looking to build luxury homes will continue to buy exclusive properties, market
observers said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) unveiled Tuesday a plan
to besiege the Presidential Office in protest against what the party claimed
were under-the-table deals between President Ma Ying-jeou's administration and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The protest was being planned to coincide with the fourth round of talks between
the chief negotiators of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait -- Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin -- which is slated for Dec. 22 in Taichung.</P>
      <P>In  anticipation  of  Chen's  arrival  on  Dec.  21,  the pro-independence DPP
is also planning to muster 100,000 people to take part in a march on Dec. 20 in
the central city to voice the party's opposition to the proposed cross-strait
trade agreement, known as an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Chuang Suo-han, an acting spokesman of the pro-independence DPP, said his party
believes that the upcoming Chiang-Chen talks are intended to set the stage for
the signing of the controversial trade pact.</P>
      <P>The DPP insists that in promoting such an agreement, the government must consult
with the industrial sector, be subject to monitoring by the Legislative Yuan,
hold public debates on the issue, and call a referendum to allow the people to
decide whether the pact should be signed, but none of these things have been
done so far, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-yee, a senior DPP legislator, said the DPP will oppose any cross-strait
negotiations  unless they are conducted in a transparent manner.</P>
      <P>He accused Ma of being two-faced by offering to debate ECFA with DPP Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen on the one hand and continuing to promote the Chiang-Chen talks on
the other.</P>
      <P>Ma's move, he alleged, is made in preparation for Taiwan's ultimate unification
with China.</P>
      <P>Ma, however, has pledged he will not discuss unification with China during his
term as president. He has also argued that the free-trade  agreement  is crucial
for Taiwan to maintain  its competitiveness when trading with China, as the
mainland is about to sign free-trade accords with its other trade partners in
Asia, which will offer those countries tariff-free access to the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Chuang claimed that remarks made by Ma in a recent interview with The Wall
Street Journal have revealed his intention to promote unification between the
two sides, which is against the people's will.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that over 85 percent of the people in Taiwan are in favor of
maintaining the cross-strait status quo, and the DPP insists that any decision
to change the status quo should be made by the people in a referendum.</P>
      <P>In a story published Monday that was based on the interview with Ma, the
newspaper quoted the president as saying that "whether there will be
reunification as expected by the mainland side depends very much on what is
going to unfold in the next decade."</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office clarified Tuesday that Ma was misquoted because what he
said was "in the next decades, " instead of "in the next decade."</P>
      <P>Lee, however, said it is not important whether the term used by Ma is "decades"
or "decade." The point is how come Ma can decide on behalf of the people that
Taiwan will ultimately move toward unification with China,  instead of achieving
independence  or maintaining the status quo, he added.</P>
      <P>"If Ma is to promote unification with China against the people's will, the
people will be forced to shed blood to resist tyranny, " he warned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 560,000 people were vaccinated against influenza A (H1N1), commonly known
as swine flu, on the first day of a national free inoculation program that began
Dec. 12, bringing to 4.12 million the total number of people immunized in the
country, according to statistics released Tuesday by the Central Epidemics
Command Center (CECC).</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Health Chang Shan-chwen said at a CECC press conference that
Taiwan is among the world's top five countries with the highest inoculation
rate, as since the DOH's immunization program started Nov. 1, 17.9 percent of
Taiwan's 23 million people have been vaccinated against H1N1.</P>
      <P>"Given that no country but Taiwan has held a large-scale inoculation program in
schools, it could also be a world record that 80 percent of lower-grade and 75
percent of higher-grade elementary school students have been vaccinated," Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Targeting the entire population in an effort to stem the spread of H1N1
following an inoculation program for people considered at higher risk of
contracting the disease, the national inoculation program kicked off Dec. 12 in
2,584 clinics and hospitals and 354 free vaccination stations set up by the
Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>According  to  CECC  statistics,  563,712  people  received vaccinations on the
first day of the program, with 20 counties and cities meeting their target
numbers of inoculations.</P>
      <P>Among them, Lienchiang County, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Tainan County and
Taitung County vaccinated 1.5-3.5 times more people than expected, the CECC
added.</P>
      <P>The H1N1 virus has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people around the
world this year, including 35 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day, Health Minister Yang Chih-liang said in an interview with a
local radio station that compared with other countries in the region, Taiwan has
done a good job with its vaccination program and getting the epidemic under
control.</P>
      <P>He noted that over 4 million of 7 million vaccines doses acquired by the
government have been used, while the rate of people developing side effects
after receiving  the vaccine is similar  to the international level.</P>
      <P>Also, people in Taiwan should consider themselves lucky because the government's
immunization program is free and covers everybody, said the health minister.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, Hong Kong, which has only one-third of Taiwan's population,
has had twice the number of H1N1 deaths recorded in Taiwan, despite having
acquired H1N1 vaccines much earlier.</P>
      <P>He also noted that in Japan, only low-income people are eligible for free
vaccinations, while in the United States, they are free only for seriously ill
patients and children.</P>
      <P>Rebutting criticism that the government is giving profits to Adimmune Corp.,
Taiwan's only human vaccine manufacturer,  by purchasing their vaccine, Yang
pointed out that the company produces high-quality vaccine at only half the
price of imported products.</P>
      <P>The company also has stricter standards in testing for residues and toxins than
the World Health Organization, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun denied Tuesday that a
fishing labor pact to be signed soon between Taiwan and China is meant to pave
the way for Taiwan's opening to Chinese workers.</P>
      <P>Liu said the media report on the issue was "totally groundless" and stressed
that the fishing cooperation pact, to be clinched in the upcoming cross-Taiwan
Strait talks in Taichung City, "has nothing to do with the importation of
Chinese workers into Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman urged the public to stay calm over the matter prior to the
fourth round of cross-strait negotiations, because the government is not
planning to allow in fishery workers or white-collar employees from China.</P>
      <P>The fishing crew cooperation pact, along with three other agreements on
agricultural quarantine inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and
certification, and the avoidance of double taxation, will be signed in the
coming round of talks between the Taipei-based  Straits  Exchange  Foundation
(SEF)  and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
from Dec. 22 in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the main objective of the fishing labor agreement is to ensure
proper management of Chinese fishermen on Taiwan fishing vessels so as to
guarantee the rights and personal safety of people from both sides.</P>
      <P>The pact is meant to help Taiwan's ship owners better manage Chinese crews, and
the key stipulation that Chinese fishermen must be hired offshore remains
unchanged, he said.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 of the approximately 4,600 Chinese nationals currently employed
on Taiwanese offshore fishing vessels and over 10,000 Chinese laborers working
on board Taiwan deep-sea vessels were recruited by private brokers, which makes
it very difficult for Taiwan fishing boat operators to check the crews'
credentials, Liu explained.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the planned fishing labor pact, Taiwanese fishing vessel
owners will be able to recruit qualified crew through an institutionalized
channel and ask China to assume responsibility in cases of mutiny, he added.</P>
      <P>In related news, Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung reiterated
Tuesday the restrictions on 830 banned Chinese agricultural and industrial items
will not be lifted.</P>
      <P>"I will step down as COA chairman if any of these Chinese products are allowed
to enter Taiwan, " Chen vowed during a citation ceremony for the 10 most
outstanding agricultural promotional depots.</P>
      <P>The upcoming cross-strait agricultural quarantine inspection agreement  aims
only to provide  quick and safe shipment  of agricultural products between the
two sides, he stressed.</P>
      <P>The newspaper report that claims Taiwan is about to open its market to a wider
range of agricultural products from China is far-fetched, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Central bank to solicit views on coins honoring democracy pioneer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
12/15/09  21:49:14
(By Fanny Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Among the coins in circulation in Taiwan, only portraits of three historical
figures -- Dr. Sun Yat-sen, late President Chiang Kai-shek and aboriginal
resistor against Japanese rule Mona Rudao -- are featured, but the Central Bank
of the Republic of China is considering whether to issue a new coin bearing an
image of Taiwanese democracy pioneer Chiang Wei-shui.</P>
      <P>However,  it remains unclear whether  the coin will be a commemorative coin or a
replacement for the existing NT$10 coin featuring Chiang Kai-shek, which was
introduced 28 years ago.</P>
      <P>Lin Fu-hsin, Deputy Director-General of the bank's Department of Issuing, said
the central bank will solicit public opinion on the issue before presenting a
proposal to the Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>The bank is required by law to submit to the Executive Yuan in advance a report
detailing the face value, composition, form and design of any new version of
banknotes or coins.</P>
      <P>Rebutting reports that President Ma Ying-jeou has failed to deliver on a
campaign promise to issue commemorative coins bearing the likeness of Chiang
Wei-shui, the Presidential Office said Monday that the central bank will
introduce the new coin at the proper time and according to its own rules.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times reported that same day that following his election in March
last year, Ma wrote a letter to ask Chiang's descendants for their consent to
replace the current NT$10 coin -- which bears the likeness of the late President
Chiang Kai-shek -- with one showing the prominent late Taiwanese dissident.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Chiang's grandson, Chiang Chao-ken, said he felt
disrespected, as there had been no further news about the coin, despite the
family's agreement that it could be minted.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-pao, director of the Presidential Department of Public Affairs, said
there might have been some misunderstanding over the issue.</P>
      <P>Chang said Chiang's descendants thought after they received the letter from Ma
that the central bank would issue a new version of the NT$10 coin, but he
pointed out that the issuance of a commemorative coin has to follow
administrative procedures.</P>
      <P>He explained that Ma had suggested to Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan that
it would be better to issue commemorative coins featuring Taiwanese historical
figures rather than the past precedent of having the new president on the post-
election coins issued as keepsakes.</P>
      <P>However, the central bank still issued coins for commemorating the inauguration
of the president and vice president in May 2008 bearing images of Ma and Vice
President Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>According to a central bank official at Department of Issuing, some 9,000 sets
of gold commemorative coins and 46,000 sets of silver coins have been sold.</P>
      <P>At present, the NT$10, NT$5 and NT$1 coins all bear the image of Chiang Kai-
shek.</P>
      <P>It was not until 2001, when the central bank issued a new NT$20-denomination
coin bearing the portrait of Mona Rudao, that the trend of using Chiang Kai-
shek's portrait was changed.</P>
      <P>The portrait of Sun Yat-sen -- frequently referred to as the Father of the
Nation -- has been used twice in the country's coin history. First was on a
commemorative NT$10 coin to celebrate the nation's 90th birthday in 2001, and
again on the NT$50 coin introduced in 2002.</P>
      <P>Known as "Taiwan's Sun Yat-sen," Chiang Wei-shui was a doctor and also founder
of the Taiwanese Cultural Association and the Taiwanese People's Party -- the
island's first legal political party.</P>
      <P>He was imprisoned several times under Japanese rule and is seen as one of the
most important figures in the colonial-era resistance movement. He died in 1931
at the age of 40 and the freeway from Taipei to Suao in his native Yilan County
is named after him.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office announced Tuesday that three outstanding  members of
Taiwan's  highest research institution, Academia Sinica, are the winners of this

      <P>Liao Liou-i hailed their remarkable academic performances on the world stage and
described them as "the pride of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will personally deliver the awards to the three
scientists Dec. 18, with each one receiving prize money of NT$2 million
(US$61,920), a certificate and a trophy.</P>
      <P>Liao I-chiu, 73, took the award in the category of applied science for his
prominent research in and contribution to Taiwan's breeding of shrimps and fish.</P>
      <P>Dubbed Taiwan's "father of black tiger shrimp, " Liao is the first scientist in
the field to receive the prize. He is also responsible for introducing from
Israel the tilapia, a fish now popular among Taiwanese consumers.</P>
      <P>Chien, 78, attributed his award in the category of life science, to his wife, to

      <P>CNA Chairman Joe Hung and Antara President Ahmad Mukhlis Yusuf inked the pact at
a ceremony held earlier in the day at Antara headquarters in Jakarta.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the pact, in addition to increasing exchanges of news and
journalists, CNA and Antara will also join hands to hold news photo exhibitions.</P>
      <P>Hung said at the signing ceremony that Indonesia, with its vast land area and
population and the upcoming formation of the "Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) plus one" arrangement with China next year, has long been very
important to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Indonesia plays a very important role in the 10-member ASEAN grouping, which
will inaugurate a free trade zone with China from Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Hung said the MOU will be of great help to both news agencies, as each will be
able to obtain information from the other about Taiwan and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile in the ceremony, Sun Shine Kwang, chairwoman of Taiwan's Radio Taiwan
International, signed a similar pact with Antara.</P>
      <P>Andrew Hsia, Taiwan's representative to Indonesia, was also present at the
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Both Hung and Kwang were in Jakarta  to attend the 72nd anniversary a day
earlier of Antara, the country's national news agency.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office announced Tuesday that three outstanding  members of
Taiwan's  highest research institution, Academia Sinica, are the winners of this
year's Presidential Science Prize, the fifth of its kind, held every two years
since 2001.</P>
      <P>Presidential Secretary-General Liao Liou-i announced Li Jen-kuei, Liao I-chiu
and Chien Shu as the winners at a news conference at the Presidential Office
that was attended by Academia Sinica President Wong Chi-huey and National
Science Council Minister Lee Lou-chuang.</P>
      <P>Liao Liou-i hailed their remarkable academic performances on the world stage and
described them as "the pride of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will personally deliver the awards to the three
scientists Dec. 18, with each one receiving prize money of NT$2 million
(US$61,920), a certificate and a trophy.</P>
      <P>Liao I-chiu, 73, took the award in the category of applied science for his
prominent research in and contribution to Taiwan's breeding of shrimps and fish.</P>
      <P>Dubbed Taiwan's "father of black tiger shrimp, " Liao is the first scientist in
the field to receive the prize. He is also responsible for introducing from
Israel the tilapia, a fish now popular among Taiwanese consumers.</P>
      <P>Chien, 78, attributed his award in the category of life science, to his wife, to
whom he has been married for 52 years.</P>
      <P>Chien, a graduate from the National Taiwan University School of Medicine and
internationally famous for his long-term research in microcirculation and
hemorheology, said Taiwan must cultivate deep roots in scientific studies if it
wants to be a strong power.</P>
      <P>The 73-year-old Lee, a linguistic expert for over 40 years, won the award for
his long-term studies of the Austronesian tribes.</P>
      <P>Since 1968, Lee has traveled to islands scattered across the South Pacific,
including Vanuatu and the Philippines among many others, to trace the origins of
the diverse Austronesian languages and dialects.</P>
      <P>"It is hard for many people to imagine what kinds of hardship and solitude a man
has to endure while carrying out such a task, " he recounted.</P>
      <P>Li commented that Taiwan's aboriginal languages are the biggest gift the country
has endowed  to the world because "Taiwan's aboriginal  languages  are essential
and indispensable  to the reconstruction of Austronesian history and culture."</P>
      <P>His work on the dispersal of the Formosan aborigines in Taiwan stands as witness
to his devoted research in the field.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/16/09  10:26:43
(Also with contribution by Szuyu Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>The air conditioning system in Yuan Ze University classrooms is just like that
at any other university. It costs a lot of money to run.</P>
      <P>But at Yuan Ze, where saving energy has become an obsession, the air
conditioning and the lights are only turned on 10 minutes before class begins
and shut off automatically after class ends. Lights in hallways and student
lounges go off five minutes after they are turned on.</P>
      <P>Rather than simply preach environmental consciousness, Yuan Ze administrators
also make students pay for the discretionary use of electricity to instill
energy-saving concepts.</P>
      <P>Students are required, for example, to use stored value cards to pay to play on
the campus's tennis and basketball courts at night.</P>
      <P>"The idea is not aimed at saving or making money, " said Rong-jong Wai, the
university's chief general affairs officer. "We want the students to be
environmentally conscious."</P>
      <P>Yuan Ze University's aggressive approach to saving energy seems to be working.
The private school, founded by business conglomerate Far Eastern Group, won a
Ministry of Education (MOE) Green University competition this year by cutting
power consumption 4.6 percent in 2009 and reducing the school's electricity bill
by NT$19 million (US$588,780).</P>
      <P>"The trick is to link the school's power supply and monitoring systems to the
scheduling of classes," Wai disclosed.</P>
      <P>Believing that environmental awareness should be cultivated through everyday
life and in schools, the MOE started a campaign in early 2008 to get schools to
take the issue seriously and offer them assistance in saving energy and water.</P>
      <P>The MOE is limited by budgetary constraints and can provide only minimal cash
incentives to schools that succeed in saving resources, but the program has
nonetheless awakened institutions to the threat of climate change and Taiwan's
need to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>So far 312 universities and colleges, 248 senior high schools and 59 junior high
and elementary schools have responded to the campaign, according to the MOE
Environmental Protection Task Force.</P>
      <P>Though the rate of participation remains relatively low, it has created a
spillover effect among other schools, the task force said, leading to a
reduction in power usage.</P>
      <P>The combined electricity consumption of the country's schools in 2008 was 7.8
percent lower than in 2006, the task force said, citing data from Taiwan Power
Co., Taiwan's sole power generator and distributor.</P>
      <P>"That represents savings of about NT$700 million if the value of the savings are
calculated based on a unit cost of NT$2.65 per kilowatt-hour," said Chang Tzu-
chao, executive secretary of the task force.</P>
      <P>A breakdown shows that vocational high schools were the most effective at
conserving energy, reducing power consumption by 12.3 percent in 2008 compared
to 2006, followed by universities and colleges, senior high, junior high, and
elementary schools, which lowered power use by 8.03 percent, 7.23 percent, 6.54
percent and 6.07 percent, respectively, over the same period.</P>
      <P>Unlike in 2009 when a private university won the top prize for being a "green"
institution, the top 21 universities in 2008 were all public national
institutions, Chang said.</P>
      <P>That top 21 saved NT$44 million in electricity expenses in 2008 from a year
earlier, translating to a reduction of 10,500 tons of greenhouse gas emissions
that would have otherwise been emitted, he noted.</P>
      <P>Of these schools, National Taiwan University, with NT$7 million in savings, and
National Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology, with NT$6 million
in savings, saved the most in electricity expenses.</P>
      <P>National Taichung University, however, had the highest rate of reduction of
electricity consumption of the 21 top performers.</P>
      <P>University  administrator  Yi Cheng-ming  said the school's mechanical systems
and other facilities were overhauled to save power,  but getting people to
change their behavior was more difficult.</P>
      <P>"People are more difficult to manage than machines, " Yi said, explaining that
it has taken more than rhetoric to get students to be environmentally
responsible.</P>
      <P>He said the university employs extra shifts of workers to patrol the campus
simply to prevent electricity from being wasted.</P>
      <P>If the person on patrol finds that students  engaged  in after-class  studies
are scattered  too thinly over too many classrooms, he will ask the students to
move to one or two smaller rooms to study.</P>
      <P>If he finds that the ambient temperature is not high enough to warrant the use
of air conditioning, students are persuaded to turn them off, Yi explained.</P>
      <P>The MOE Environmental Protection Task Force said conserving electricity is not a
daunting task. Schools can easily reduce power consumption by at least 5 percent
if people in schools become more environmentally  conscious  and closely  adhere
to power-saving measures, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that a significant portion of the power consumed on campuses was
wasted because schools tend to use old air conditioners and conventional light
bulbs that are not energy-efficient, a problem that can be easily fixed.</P>
      <P>"Electricity bills will shrink by 10 percent if old light bulbs are replaced
with energy-saving bulbs and by another 10-15 percent if out-of-date air
conditioners are replaced with new, energy-efficient models," he asserted.</P>

      <P>After the Wall Street Journal Asia misquoted President Ma Ying-jeou on his
vision of the future development of relations with China, the Presidential
Office responded quickly, highlighting how contentious talk of cross-strait
unification is.</P>
      <P>The newspaper quoted Ma as saying: "Whether there will be reunification as
expected by the mainland side depends very much on what is going to unfold in
the next decade, " but the Presidential Office produced a recording showing that
Ma actually said "decades." Opposition groups took the opportunity to again
stress that Taiwan's future should be decided by its people in a national
referendum, not by any single party or individual.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest developments
related to the sensitive unification issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News: President Ma Ying-jeou reaffirmed Tuesday that he will not
negotiate unification with China during his term in office and that his cross-
strait policy is no independence, no unification and no use of force while
maintaining the status quo.</P>
      <P>In a private meeting with professor Winston L. Y. Yang from Seton Hall
University of the United States, Ma also clearly said that "there is little
support in Taiwan for unification with China." (Dec. 16, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: The ruling Kuomintang suffered a setback in recent local
elections and a recent opinion poll suggests it has to do with the Ma
administration's  China-oriented  political and economic policies.</P>
      <P>A poll released by CommonWeath Magazine Tuesday showed that 61 percent of the
people worried that Taiwan's economy is too dependent on China.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 62 percent of respondents identified themselves as
Taiwanese, 22 percent as both Taiwanese and Chinese, and only eight percent as
Chinese. Among those in the 18-29 age bracket, 75 percent said they are
Taiwanese. (Dec. 16, 2009)</P>
      <P>China Times:  Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-
wen said in Tokyo Tuesday that the party will insist that Taiwan's people decide
their future.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo, Tsai also said
that the party will safeguard the democratic system in Taiwan to let Taiwan's
people choose and decide their own future.</P>

      <P>King Pu-tsung, who was recently named to serve as secretary-general of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT), arrived in Taiwan Wednesday after spending time in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, he said he would
attend the KMT's Central Standing Committee meeting later in the day.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the just-concluded local elections in which the KMT suffered
a setback, he said he will address the issue publicly at a later date, stressing
that at present, he wants to "speak less and do more."</P>
      <P>King, a former deputy mayor of Taipei, was widely seen as President Ma Ying-
jeou's right-hand man during Ma's tenure as the city's mayor.</P>
      <P>In his capacity as KMT chairman, Ma appointed King on Dec. 9 to replace Chan
Chuen-po, who is also a KMT vice chairman, as the manager of the party's day-to-
day affairs.</P>
      <P>The announcement came as King was serving as a visiting scholar at the Brookings
Institution in the U.S. and drew mixed reactions from within the KMT.</P>
      <P>Before he returned to Taiwan, King told the Central News Agency that he was also
surprised by the appointment and that he would make every effort to prove the
skeptics wrong.</P>
      <P>"I will speak less and do more in the future and give the job my best shot," he
said.</P>
      <P>He appealed to the KMT hierarchy and Taiwan's society to give him time to do his
best to streamline the ruling party.</P>
      <P>It is widely believed that Ma's appointment of King to the management  post was
a response to the KMT's setback in the just-concluded local elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan dropped 15 places and was ranked among countries judged as performing
poorly in a global rating of national carbon emission reduction performance.</P>
      <P>But government officials said the assessment by two Germany-based
nongovernmental think tanks was based on 2007 figures and did not reflect
Taiwan's current situation. If last year's figures were used in the poll, they
said, Taiwan should have been part of the group of top-ranked countries.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest developments
related to the carbon emissions reduction issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan was ranked 47th and received 47.5 points in the 2010 Climate Change
Performance Index (CCPI) , lagging behind India, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan,
Singapore and South Korea in Asia while faring better than only China and
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>It was just the second year that Taiwan was included in the CCPI, which
compared  the  emissions  reduction  performance  of 57 industrialized
countries.</P>
      <P>While pointing out that Taiwan's CO2 emission volume posted negative growth for
the first time in history in 2008, Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)
Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen said Tuesday the decline in Taiwan's CCPI ranking
indicates there is still room for improvement and that other countries have
progressed faster than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The EPA unveiled the "Taiwan Carbon Label" Tuesday as part of its efforts to
raise consumer awareness of the environmental impact of individual products. The
labeling campaign will be launched in March 2010 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>"The label, featuring the words 'CO2, ' a footprint composed of a dark green
heart carrying a number representing the carbon footprint of a product, and two
pale green leaves, epitomizes our love for the Earth and our commitment to move

      <P>A cold air mass from China sent temperatures falling through much of Taiwan
Wednesday and could further push the mercury down to below 10 degrees Celsius in
northern and central Taiwan this coming weekend, according to the Central
Weather Bureau.</P>
      <P>The cold air mass will envelop Taiwan completely beginning Thursday, making the
weather noticeably colder, and could linger over Taiwan until next week, a CWB
forecaster said,.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, temperatures are expected to be around 18 degrees in the north and
northeast -- with lows of around 15-16 degrees -- 22-23 degrees in central and
eastern Taiwan, and 24-25 degrees in the south and southeast.</P>
      <P>The cold air mass brought snow to Taiwan's highest mountain, Yushan, early
Wednesday morning. Around 1.5 centimeters of snow had accumulated on the
3,952-meter peak, also known as Jade Mountain, as of 8 a.m.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsin-tien, a technician at the CWB's Yushan station, said the temperature

      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications said Wednesday that it will
try to push for more flights between Taiwan and popular destinations in China to
help bring fares down to a more reasonable level.</P>
      <P>Amid complaints that fares are still high one year after the launch of shortened
nonstop flights between Taiwan and China, Deputy Transportation Minister Kuang
S. Yeh said the relatively high fares are mainly due to the popularity of some
flight destinations.</P>
      <P>"When destinations are too popular, air fares will naturally go up, " he said.
Yeh argued that if the government deliberately intervened to cut fares, it might
give rise to scalpers.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will also actively communicate with carriers in a bid to make air
fares more reasonable and cheaper," he said.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a legislative hearing on why the government will not step
in to deal with the issue, Yeh also noted that fares on some routes have come
down.</P>
      <P>He said fares between Shanghai and Taipei's Songshan Airport have fallen 17.7
percent for tickets with a validity of 30 days and 15.9 percent for tickets
valid for 90 days.</P>
      <P>According  to an opinion poll conducted by the Consumers' Foundation, 74 percent

      <P>Concerned that Taiwan may become further marginalized after Southeast Asian
countries and China form a free trade zone in 2010, President Ma Ying-jeou said
Taiwan needs to work harder to be part of the trend toward regional economic
integration.</P>
      <P>"I hope Taiwan will not be further isolated or marginalized, " Ma said  in an
address  at a ceremony  held  by the  partially government-funded think tank
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) to dedicate its newly
established Taiwan ASEAN Studies Center (TASC).</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long faced Beijing's suppression in the international community,
leaving most countries unwilling to sign free trade agreements with Taiwan or
accepting it into regional economic alliances.</P>
      <P>Ma noted in his speech that North Korea and Taiwan are the only two countries
that have not signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with other nations in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Since Ma took office in 2008, the hostile standoff between Taiwan and China has
eased, but better relations have yet to translate into new opportunities to sign
free trade pacts with non-allied countries.</P>
      <P>In his address delivered in English, Ma mentioned Taiwan has signed a memorandum
of understanding  on financial supervision cooperation with China and that
Taiwan is preparing to forge an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with Beijing to promote mutual exchanges further.</P>
      <P>At the same time Taiwan also wishes to increase its interaction with Southeast
Asian countries, Ma said.</P>
      <P>His administration believes that signing an economic cooperation framework
agreement can open the way for Taiwan to engage in trade talks with other
countries, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CIER Chairman Cyrus C. Y. Chu, introducing the new center, said
Taiwan needs a professional research institute to assist the government and
people in gaining a better understanding of Southeast  Asian countries  and
their economic  alliance,  the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) ,
as it forms bigger economic blocs with China, South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>Chu warned that with the ASEAN countries moving to further forge an East Asian
common market by 2015, Taiwan could end up isolated and marginalized, causing
serious harm to its export-oriented economy.</P>

      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Timothy C.T. Yang said Wednesday that the ministry will
propose that Taiwan's desire to join international organizations be included in
future cross-Taiwan Strait talks.</P>
      <P>He said the ministry will propose the matter to the Mainland Affairs Council,
the nation's top China policy charter, so that it can in due time list the issue
for communication with China.</P>
      <P>Yang said that "Taiwan's bid to join international organizations requires
support from other countries, as well as the goodwill of China, " adding that
"presently, Taiwan has seen China display goodwill on international affairs."</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a legislative hearing in which legislators expressed
concern about Taiwan being shut out of international organizations due to
Chinese obstruction and suggested that the issue be included in cross-strait
talks scheduled for next week.</P>
      <P>The legislators are also concerned that Taiwan was represented by a non-
governmental organization -- The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
-- at a recent climate conference in the Danish capital of Copenhagen, and that
the ITRI was listed under the name of China.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Shen-liang of the ruling Kuomintang said Taiwan's lodging of
protests at the meeting were to no avail and suggested that the MOFA use the
warmer cross-strait relations under the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou
to include the issue in the upcoming meeting between the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"If this is not done, Taiwan will have to protest every time, " Liang said.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Tsai Huang-liang  of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
echoed his words, saying that the issue should be included on the meeting agenda
to help Taiwan's bids to join United Nations-affiliated agencies.</P>
      <P>During the SEF-ARATS talks scheduled to take place next week in the central city
of Taichung, four agreements are expected to be signed  on fishing  crew
cooperation,  agricultural  quarantine inspection,  industrial  product
standards,  inspection  and certification, and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>

      <P>A former member of India's Members of Legislative Assembly said Wednesday while
visiting CNA that he was impressed by the democratic developments and the

      <P>Vijay Jolly is heading a six-member bipartisan delegation of politicians of
India's National Congress Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on a six-
day visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a join convener of the BJP's foreign affairs department, Jolly said that the
trip to observe Taiwan's democratic system and pluralistic values represents
"the fulfillment of a childhood dream." Members of the delegation hope to learn
areas for exchange and cooperation between India and Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>He cited in particular the possibility of further bilateral economic and
cooperation exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade with India totaled US$5.3 billion in 2008 and direct investment
in India by Taiwanese businesses to date has reached US$1.2 billion, according
to Jolly.</P>
      <P>He suggested that in comparison with Taiwanese investment in China, "there is
obviously much more room for growth."</P>
      <P>The other members of the delegation are Ravni Thakur, joint secretary of the

      <P>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) cannot change its one-China
policy,  but the positive developments in China-Taiwan relations can help Taiwan
in its efforts to sign free trade pacts with ASEAN countries, a Malaysian
lawmaker said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tan Sri Dato' Seri Syed Hamid bin Syed Jaafar Albar, a former foreign minister,
made the remarks in a keynote speech at an international conference on Taiwan-
ASEAN economic cooperation and strategy that was organized by the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CIER) and its newly established Taiwan ASEAN
Studies Center (TASC).</P>
      <P>Based on recent remarks and efforts by President Ma Ying-jeou to rebut incorrect
media reports about cross-Taiwan Strait policies, the senior Malaysian official
said he believes the future development of cross-strait relations will be
positive, which he said means a greater opportunity for Taiwan to sign free
trade pacts with ASEAN countries.</P>
      <P>China-Taiwan relations need to be changed before any change can take place in
relations between Taiwan and ASEAN, he went on, adding that ASEAN will closely
watch the movement of Taiwan and China toward integration.</P>
      <P>He said ASEAN is different from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum, as the latter handles mostly economic issues. Taiwan needs to solve its
sovereignty problem before it can join ASEAN plus three (China, Japan and South
Korea), he added.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of TASC that same day, Ma said Taiwan is eager
to be included in regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>The two-day international conference has invited several scholars and experts
from Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to
discuss topics that include the effects of the global financial crisis on the
regional economy and their implications on regional integration, economic
cooperation between Taiwan and ASEAN, the progress and implications of a
proposed cross-strait economic cooperation agreement in the region, and Taiwan-

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) might deal separately with its
nominations for the 2010 elections in five special municipalities and the 2012
presidential election, party officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In recent discussions with DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, most party heavyweights
said the municipal nominations should be given priority over the presidential
nominations, a view shared by Tsai, the officials said.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai, who just returned from a visit to Japan, will consult with more
party members before coming to a conclusion on the issue, they went on, adding
that related details will also be raised for discussion in a provisional party
congress slated for Jan. 24.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Sunday in Tokyo that the DPP is planning to finalize its nominations
for the municipal elections by next March.</P>
      <P>Before her departure for Japan last week, Tsai met with former Vice President
Annette Lu and former party chairmen Yu Shyi-kun, Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang
to hear their opinions on the elections.</P>
      <P>According to DPP officials, Lu believes that with the next presidential election
still more than two years away, the party should not rush to decide on its
nominee now, because doing so too early might be unfavorable to the party's
campaign.</P>
      <P>Yu said that deciding on the presidential nominee too soon would mean exposing
him or her to attacks by the ruling party ahead of time, which could be very
disadvantageous to the DPP as the party has no administrative resources.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the DPP's top priority should be to unite its many factions to win
next year's municipal elections and that the presidential nomination should be
put off until after that.</P>
      <P>Su for his part said he had no opinion on nomination matters and added that he
will let the party and public opinion decide on which municipal election he
should run in.</P>

as the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) 's secretary-general Wednesday, succeeding Chan
Chuen-po.</P>
      <P>President Ma, in his capacity as chairman of the KMT, officiated at the handover
ceremony. Lauding King's loyalty to the party, President Ma said that King is a
"very appropriate person" for the post. Ma named King as the KMT's new chief
executive officer last week after the party suffered a setback in the Dec. 5
local elections.</P>
      <P>Upon receiving the seal of office, King said that he is aware of the challenges
and difficulties he faces and would do his best to cooperate with his colleagues
to carry out the task of party reform. He reiterated that he would stick to the
principle of "less talk and more action."</P>
      <P>He pledged that he would make the party more attractive in order to win greater

      <P>King's predecessor, Chan Chuen-po, who will remain as one of the party's vice

great tasks." The appointment of King comes "at the right time," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, it should not distance itself from the related issues;
otherwise, it would "have to lie on the bed it helped make."</P>
      <P>Taiwan once prioritized economic development at all costs, which led to a
squandering of environmental resources and disregard for ecological protection.
As a result, future generations will inherit a huge environmental debt.</P>
      <P>Because of that lack of foresight, Taiwan has also accumulated enormous
financial debts.</P>
      <P>Given  Taiwan's  ever declining  birth rate and its aging population, its
younger generations are already saddled with heavy burdens. The continued pile-
up of national and environmental debts amounts to generational injustice.</P>
      <P>A responsible government should not sit idly and let these problems escalate,
but instead should act quickly to correct the trend of excessive consumption of
resources.</P>
      <P>The "double debt" plight is not insoluble. If the government has the guts to
introduce energy and environmental taxes, the two problems could be resolved in
the long run. Levying green taxes on industries in proportion to their
ecological footprint would not only encourage energy conservation and carbon
emissions reduction, but can also serve to fund government welfare services for
the poor, develop green industries and bolster industry upgrade.</P>
      <P>The introduction of an energy tax was one of President Ma Ying-jeou's  campaign
promises.  It is regrettable  that  his administration has decided to
indefinitely postpone that plan on the one hand while promoting several energy-
consuming investment programs on the other.</P>
      <P>That is an issue that should spur Premier Wu Den-yih to "get mad."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>has gotten back on its feet following its recent electoral gains. But as some
insightful DPP bigwigs have observed, the party only managed to solidify its
core support base in the just-concluded local polls.</P>
      <P>Whether the party can return to power will hinge on its leadership's  capability
to lead the party  onto a path  of normalization.</P>
      <P>The DPP must show a stronger commitment to uphold clean politics and ethical
integrity. The Dec. 5 polls were seen as the DPP's first post-Chen Shui-bian
elections, with none of its candidates trying to draw on the strength of the
detained former president to canvass support on the campaign trail.</P>
      <P>But the ruling Kuomintang still has higher approval ratings than the DPP, an
indication that voters have yet to become fully confident in the DPP's
determination to root out corruption once it reclaims power.</P>
      <P>Another hurdle will be to win the hearts and minds of independent swing voters.
Though it improved its share of the vote in places like Taoyuan County, that may
have reflected the absence of KMT-leaning voters at the polls to express their
dissatisfaction with the KMT administration (rather than the DPP picking up
swing voters).</P>
      <P>Also, when the DPP was in power from 2000-2008, it was often restricted by its
ideologies. The radical pro-independence rhetoric in Chen's second term was one
case of the DPP's failure to shed the specter of its deep-rooted pro-
independence ideology.</P>
      <P>Even though the DPP has emerged from the pall of Chen's corrpution scandal and
its defeat in the 2008 presidential election, it has not yet freed itself from
the restraints of its ideology as shown in its stubborn opposition to the
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The DPP should propose an alternative package to help Taiwan recover from its
economic recession and resolve the looming threat of further marginalization
after the "ASEAN plus One (China) " free trade area comes into being in January.</P>

      <P>Positions in the financial sector are returning to the hot job list in Taiwan as
the sector appears to be recovering  well from the global financial crisis,  an
online employment broker said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Driven by the recovery, many financial firms have abolished pay cuts  for
employees.  The recent  signing  of memorandums  of understanding (MOUs) on
financial supervision and regulation with China has also greatly boosted the
sector's prospects, 1111 Job Bank said.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey conducted by the job bank, approximately 40
percent of office workers are planning to enter the financial sector, mainly
because they have an academic background or expertise in this area, are
interested in the field, or are attracted to the high pay.</P>
      <P>Among the workers who intend to enter the sector or are already in the sector,
more than 50 percent chose to work in banks, and 17 percent in the securities
and futures industry, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>Sixty-four percent of office workers said the signing of the cross-strait MOUs
has heightened their interest in pursuing a career in the financial sector, 85
percent of whom indicated an intent to work in China.</P>
      <P>The main reasons for choosing to work in China are that career development there
is better, China-invested firms have good prospects in Taiwan, and China is more
internationalized, according to the respondents.</P>
      <P>Ho Chi-sheng, the job bank's director of public relations, noted that Taiwan and
China are about to open their financial markets to each other under the terms of
the MOUs, which will result in an increased flow of financial talent across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, people with professional licenses will have more
career opportunities, he predicted.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Dec. 2-15 among 1,239 office workers and employees in
the financial sector. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.41 percent.</P>

      <P>Taichung City was rated as the most digitized city in the country this year for
the first time, with more than 81 percent of residents having used computers and
77 percent having used the Internet, according to the results of an annual
survey on the country's digital divide released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In terms of digitization, Hsinchu City and Taipei City were ranked second and
third, respectively. Taipei was ranked as the country's most digitized city in
2008.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission (RDEC) found that 67.6 percent of people above the age of 12 in
Taiwan  have accessed  the Internet, representing little change from 68.5
percent recorded the previous year.</P>
      <P>Based on the results of the survey, RDEC Minister Chu Chin-peng said during a
press conference that Taiwan's wired population is estimated to be close to 14
million, compared to 13.71 million last year.</P>
      <P>The RDEC pointed that although 78 out of every 100 households have access to the
Internet, the connection rate for Taiwanese households remained little changed
compared to 2008.</P>
      <P>Among households with Internet connections, one in every three households
considers connection fees to be a heavy financial burden, showing that fees are
one of the barriers preventing more families from upgrading their information
environment.</P>
      <P>The results show that Internet users spend an average of 2.95 hours a day on the
Internet -- nine minutes more than the average of 2.8 hours last year.</P>
      <P>They also show that 67.1 percent of respondents in the 41-50 age group are
Internet users, up from 64.2 percent last year, while the rate of Internet use
in the 51-60 age group has edged down from 40.5 percent to 37.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Among the Internet users, 52 percent have mobile phones with Internet
connection, 38.2 percent have notebooks with Internet connection, and 9.9
percent have PDAs with Internet access.</P>
      <P>However, 75 percent of Internet users said they do not use their mobile phones
for Internet access, even though they believe that is a future trend, with 31
percent of the respondents citing high costs as the reason preventing them from
using this service.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that Internet connection fees would need to be
reduced to NT$500 monthly per household in order to reduce the financial burden
on citizens and help attain the goal of providing universal Internet access.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out between July 13 and Aug. 21 among 16,133 people via

    <HEADLINE>Three quarters of foreigners satisfied with life in Taiwan: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts in establishing a foreigners-friendly environment has received
a positive response with 75.1 percent of white-collar foreign residents living
in the country expressing satisfaction with life here, according to a survey
released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A majority of foreigners who had responded to a poll by the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) said they are happy with Taiwan on
the whole, including their life here, work here, Taiwan's cultural tolerance,
and its degree of globalization, RDEC Minister Chu Chin-peng said.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Chu said foreigners felt life in Taiwan was "convenient and
delightful."</P>
      <P>Chu made the statement while releasing the results of the survey targeting
white-collar foreigners who are working and living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the RDEC, respondents were questioned in four categories, including
their life in Taiwan, their work in Taiwan, Taiwan's tolerance toward other
cultures and the level of internationalization here.</P>
      <P>Asked about life in Taiwan, 80.9 percent of the respondents said they are
satisfied with both the material and cultural lives here; 87.4 percent expressed
satisfaction with the convenience of using their mother tongue in speaking with
local people; and 82.6 percent said they are content with the shopping
convenience.</P>
      <P>In terms of their work environment in Taiwan, 70.7 of the respondents said they
were satisfied, with 87.1 percent of the respondents saying their local
colleagues are friendly and 78.5 saying their employers are friendly, the survey
showed.</P>
      <P>Half of the respondents also stated that their fondness for Taiwanese culture is
the major motive for them to stay on the island for work. Meanwhile, 62.1
percent of the surveyed expressed satisfaction with their salary in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In terms of satisfaction with Taiwan's tolerance toward foreign cultures, the
overall satisfaction level reached 65.2 percent, according to the survey, which
revealed that 72.1 percent of the polled said they saw the Taiwanese face
different cultures with an attitude of acceptance, active tolerance and
eagerness to learn.</P>
      <P>While 50.4 percent of the respondents were found speaking English most of the
time in Taiwan and 30.9 percent using Chinese here, 44.2 percent of the
respondents said Taiwanese people employ a "common" English proficiency,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the foreigners' overall satisfaction with Taiwan's internationalized
living environment was at 71.4 percent, with 65.5 percent content with the
airport and customs services and 40 percent satisfied with the English-Chinese
bilingual signs on public transport tools and tourist spots.</P>
      <P>However, only 19.5 percent of the surveyed foreigners expressed satisfaction
with the bilingual labels on the packages of merchandise, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>The survey also indicated that 88.8 percent of foreign residents think the
Taiwanese are friendly, and 76.7 percent expressed they have adjusted to life in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The commission said the survey will serve as a reference for the government to
implement policies aimed at attracting more foreign investors and talented
professionals to live in the country.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted by Taipei-based Shih Hsin University under the RDEC's
commission on randomly-selected white-collar foreign residents from Aug. 1-Sept.
15. A total of 1,076 valid samples were collected. The margin of error was at
plus or minus 3 percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Accomplice in annexation plan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/16/09  19:59:32
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's recent interview with the Wall Street Journal Asia has
once again exposed his hope for the ultimate unification of Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The newspaper quoted Ma as saying: "Whether there will be reunification as
expected by the mainland side depends very much on what is going to unfold in
the next decade."</P>
      <P>Although the Presidential Office quickly produced a recording showing that Ma
actually said "decades, " the issue is not about "decade" or "decades."</P>
      <P>Ma's major fault lies in his ignorance of Taiwan's independent sovereign status.
There is no such issue as unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The
term "unification" is just a term coined by China to camouflage its attempt to
annex Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma's other mistake is his failure to recognize that only the 23 million people
of Taiwan have the right to decide Taiwan's future. Since Taiwan and China are
two different countries, China's 1.3 billion people should have no say in
determining Taiwan's destiny. It is wrong to say that Taiwan's future would be
jointly decided by people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Most threatening  is that Ma thinks  Taiwan  has resisted unification because
"conditions are not ripe...We don't even know each other that well."</P>
      <P>In other words, unification is a given for him. This is why he has promoted many
China-leaning policies since assuming office -- he is striving to lay a solid
foundation for so-called cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>Ma must remember that as a popularly elected president, he is obligated to
defend Taiwan's national security and sovereignty. If he fails in his duty and
lets the people down, he would be a traitor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Did DPP truly win?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/16/09  19:59:38
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang recently urged the party not to be too
ecstatic over its recent electoral gains because it has not yet seen any
significant expansion of its core support base.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the rise in the DPP's share of votes in the Dec.5 local
elections mainly resulted from some pan-blue supporters' reluctance to vote due
to their dissatisfaction with the incumbent Kuomintang administration.</P>
      <P>The total number of ballots cast for the DPP actually decreased by tens of
thousands compared to previous mayoral and magistrate elections, he noted.</P>
      <P>Hsu's view was shared by other cool-headed political observers. Although the DPP
narrowed the gap between its share of the vote and the KMT's to 2.5 percentage
points, if the ballots cast for KMT mavericks are factored in, the gap between
the KMT-led blue camp and the DPP-led green camp would be 8 percent.</P>
      <P>The green camp has so far not succeeded in tipping the scales from the current
60/40 percent to gain a core support of 50 percent of the electorate.</P>
      <P>We hope the DPP will not misread its recent electoral gains and misdirect its
strategy, thus losing its opportunity for revival.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's airlines seeking transshipment permission in China flights</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
12/16/09  20:38:54
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of
Transportation has sent delegates to Xiamen to negotiate with Chinese
authorities for permission to fly cross-Taiwan Strait direct flights that carry
transit passengers and operate transshipment business.</P>
      <P>If China agrees, flights, currently only allowed to fly between two destinations
- one in Taiwan and one in mainland China - could carry passengers or cargo to a
third destination, giving a potential boost to airline businesses.</P>
      <P>One year after the signing of an agreement on cross-strait direct air and sea
travel between Taiwan and mainland China, cross-strait travel has become much
more convenient.</P>
      <P>However, the transportation sector in Taiwan has said that remaining
restrictions on cargo transshipments have limited their business opportunities.</P>
      <P>In April this year at the third round of negotiations between the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart the Association
for the Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), it was agreed that cross-
strait cargo flights would increase from 60 flights per month to 28 flights per
week or more than 100 a month, and passenger planes would be allowed to carry
cargo.</P>
      <P>But as China insists that the cargo be limited to goods transported between only
China and Taiwan, Taiwan's transportation sector has been disappointed about not
being able to take up the transshipment business.</P>
      <P>CAA statistics indicate that 70 percent of the cargos transported between Taiwan
and China were goods to be transshipped to other destinations.</P>
      <P>Unless China lifts its ban, the transportation sector's profits from direct air
and sea transportation would be limited, according to a business source.</P>
      <P>Also, Chinese passengers are not allowed to take connecting or follow-up flights
from Taiwan to other destinations.  Aviation companies believe that there is a
need for direct cross-strait travel to be allowed more flexibility.</P>
      <P>China allows its people to travel to Taiwan with an existing passenger permit,
instead of a passport of the People's Republic of China. Without a passport, a
mainland Chinese passenger will not be able to proceed on a trip from Taiwan to
another destination.</P>
      <P>CAA delegates  are currently in Xiamen to negotiate  more flexibility in cross-
strait transportation since issues related to cross-strait direct transportation
are not included in the fourth round of negotiations between SEF Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung and ARATS Chairman Chen Yunlin scheduled to be held in Taichung,
central Taiwan, from Dec. 21-23.</P>
      <P>One year after the relaxation of cross-strait travel, Taiwan's transportation
sector expects that aviation authorities on both sides can work out measures to
allow more flexibility, according to the business source.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President makes commitment to carbon emissions reduction</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
12/16/09  21:39:18
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that Taiwan, as a constructive member of
the global village, is committed to reducing carbon emissions and the government
will uphold its responsibility in that regard in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Ma said he envisions that the country will make greater progress in its efforts
to cut emissions, as there is a desire worldwide to reduce greenhouse emissions
and slow global warming.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Taiwan's poor ranking in the Climate Change Performance Index 2010
released Tuesday in Copenhagen, the president said that "over the past 19 months
up to the end of November, Taiwan had saved 6 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity -- equivalent to a reduction of 3.84 million tons of carbon
emissions."</P>
      <P>In the index, Taiwan's ranking dropped from 32nd in 2009 to 47th among 57
economies. The 57 countries and economies together account for more than 90
percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions.</P>
      <P>Despite the lower ranking, studies by the Industrial Development Bureau under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed that Taiwan's six major industries,
which are engaged in more than 2,000 reduction projects, had succeeded in
cutting carbon emissions by 5.34 million tons during the 2005-2008 period.</P>
      <P>In related news, a group of green activists have embarked on a "meat-free"
campaign to raise public awareness of the importance of cutting carbon
emissions, to coincide with the global climate change meeting in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>Su Hsiao-huan, a long-term vegetarian and writer; Hsu Jen-shiu, a famous
photographer of Taiwan's ecology; and Homemaker's Union and Foundation  CEO Hu
Ya-mei were among those who announced the "Meat-free Monday" campaign at a news
conference in September in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"If each person in Taiwan goes without meat for three days a year, it would help
reduce greenhouse gases in the country by 200,000 tons per year," Su said at the
time.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the campaign aims to make "meat-free Monday" a routine for
Taiwan people for the next two years.</P>
      <P>Following in the footsteps of the Belgian town of Ghent that designated Thursday
as "meat-free day,"  Taipei City is likely to become the world's second city to
adopt this approach, according to Su.   "The Taipei City  council is assessing
the possibility of designating Monday as 'meat-free day' in the capital," he
said.</P>
      <P>Su said he was surprised to learn that Paul McCartney, a former member of the
Beatles and an avid vegetarian, is also advocating that Americans eat no meat on
Mondays in an effort to cut carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>"When I launched the campaign, I did not know about McCartney's 'meat-free'
mission, " Su said. "This coincidence fully reflects an irreversible  trend
across the globe,  and devastating natural catastrophes are a warning for us to
take concrete action."</P>
      <P>McCartney was quoted on the Web site of the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper as saying
that "one designated meat free day a week is actually a meaningful change that
everyone can make, that goes to the heart of several important political,
environmental and ethical issues all at once."</P>
      <P>A 2009 World Bank study showed that the livestock industry was responsible for
60 percent of the world's total release of methane, which is 72 times more
effective than carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Yen Mei-chuan, CEO of the Earth Charter Taiwan, urged Taiwan consumers to eat
locally grown fresh food, in part to help cut greenhouse emissions and in part
to help domestic small farmers continue with sustainable growth.</P>
      <P>In line with the "food miles" concept, Taiwan will introduce a carbon footprint
label in March next year to help consumers make informed food choices, under a
plan unveiled by the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA).</P>
      <P>The aim of the program is to help consumers identify the environmental impact of
a product by assessing its carbon footprint, EPA Minister Stephen Shen said.</P>
      <P>As the Copenhagen climate change summit kicked off on Dec. 12, hundreds of
people also took to the streets in Taipei City and held a candle light vigil to
express their grave concerns over increased global warming.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One year after the expansion of direct travel between Taiwan and mainland China,
businessmen in Taiwan have said that its impact is limited and that it is of
benefit mainly to those making investments in China.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs in July conducted a survey among 3,100
manufacturers in Taiwan, to obtain their views on the impact of direct cross-
strait transportation in terms of investments in China, exports, company
operations, domestic investments, and domestic market demand.</P>
      <P>The poll results, released in late November, show that the transportation links
have not produced much change in domestic investments, according to 79.65
percent of the respondents.</P>
      <P>In terms of domestic market demand, 72.24 percent of those polled said they saw
little change, while 71.37 percent said not much development had taken place in
terms of investments in China.</P>
      <P>Some 65.42 percent said there was no change in exports, and 63.34 percent said
company operations remained very much the same.</P>
      <P>Businesses that considered the cross-strait direct link positive far exceeded
those with negative assessments, with 26.62 percent saying that it would benefit
people investing in China, 27.76 percent considering it good for Taiwan's
exports, 28.42 percent seeing advantages in company operations, 13.46 percent
suggesting it would be beneficiary to domestic investments, and 14.33 percent
expecting the benefits to boost the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Among manufacturers, traditional industries may have the greatest cause for
concern about the opening, as they are facing the competition from Chinese
products. Among the 3,100 manufacturers polled, 13.43 percent said they believed
that cross-strait direct transportation would have an adverse impact on Taiwan's
domestic market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Trusted Ma adviser becomes secretary general of ruling party</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou on Wednesday swore in his long-time trusted
adviser to a leading post as secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
party, in a move widely seen as an attempt by Ma to gear up for reelection in
2012.</P>
      <P>King Pu-tsung, considered the brains behind Ma's successful presidential
campaign which helped him get elected in 2008, flew back to Taiwan Wednesday,
cutting short his visiting scholar post in the United States, and was sworn in
almost immediately as the KMT's new secretary general.</P>
      <P>He gave few clues about what his top priorities are on his first day on the job,
but promised to "less talk and more action" and carry out various party reform
plans that are underway, saying he will be the one who is responsible for
reforming the 115-year-old party.</P>
      <P>"My job is the (KMT's) chief executive officer, therefore I am the one to be
held accountable if things fail, " the close confidant of Ma said in the first
press conference he gave after assuming office.</P>
      <P>Ma has been keen to rid the party of corruption and clean up its image, but
observers said that would not be the only reason the president sought King's
help.</P>
      <P>King's appointment comes just days after Ma's ruling party suffered a setback in
the Dec. 5 county and city elections, winning a smaller percentage of overall
votes than it did in local elections four years ago. The election results were
widely seen as a warning to the party, especially with the presidential race
just two years away.</P>
      <P>King served as the main campaign manager in Ma's two mayoral elections and the
2008 presidential election. He was lured back to Taiwan halfway through his
visiting  scholar program with the Washington-based Brookings Institution.</P>
      <P>His main tasks now are believed to be helping the ruling party win four upcoming
elections in the next 12 months, reversing the party's long standing culture of
vote-buying and handling its assets.</P>
      <P>King said all of these tasks will not be easy, and he will not be able to do it
alone without teamwork.</P>
      <P>Nicknamed "the Switchblade, " and "loner" King, an avid Triathlon runner, has
built a reputation in Taiwanese politics over the years as someone who is good
at political maneuvering.</P>
      <P>But King presented a different image at the press conference Wednesday. He said
that if he could be good at one thing, he wants to change the polarization in
Taiwanese politics and make the KMT's battle with the opposition Democratic
Progressive party (DPP) "a healthy competition".</P>
      <P>He also envisioned the party being "accepted and embraced" by younger
generations of Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>"I want to make the KMT a better party," King said.</P>
      <P>King told the media his first move will be visiting local counties and cities,
especially those the KMT had lost in previous elections and the ones which will
hold legislative by-elections next month.</P>
      <P>He did not rule out the possibility of carrying out a personnel reshuffle in the
KMT, saying that "of course we'll make personnel changes."</P>
      <P>Whatever he does, he is expected to enjoy the backing of the president, who also
serves as the KMT's chairman and handpicked King as his right hand man.</P>
      <P>With King's help, Ma has never lost an election.</P>
      <P>Now, many political analysts and ordinary Taiwanese people will be watching to
see if King can again deliver an election victory for the president, whose
approval ratings have taken a beating from the recession, public criticisms over
his administration's handling of Typhoon Morakot,  and criticisms  over his
proposed free-trade agreement with China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Wednesday that he expects most of the
Taiwan investors in China will choose to be taxed in Taiwan after the proposed
cross-strait agreement on avoidance of double taxation is signed.</P>
      <P>This is because Taiwan only levies a 20 percent operating income tax, much lower
than the 25 percent imposed by China, he said.</P>
      <P>As a result, the government's tax revenues will definitely grow, Lee said at a
press conference held to explain the proposed tax agreement with China.</P>
      <P>But Lee said he cannot assess how much the additional tax income will amount to
until after the pact takes effect, as the government currently has no idea about
the business situation of Taiwan investors in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China negotiators will meet in the central Taiwan city of Taichung
Dec. 21-23 to sign four agreements, including the tax pact.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the tax agreement is aimed at protecting Taiwanese businessmen's
rights and ensuring the government's power to levy taxes on its nationals on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Without the pact, Taiwan investors in China are not under any government
protection since Taiwan does not have a say in the way China treats them, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee refuted news reports that many Taiwan investors in China are worried that
the proposed Taiwan-China tax agreement will enable the government to easily
trace their business deals and incomes.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has signed tax agreements with 16 countries, and over the
past five years, there have been only eight cases of tax information exchange
between Taiwan and those countries for the purposes of preventing major tax
evasions.</P>
      <P>Lee gave the assurance that exchanges of tax information would not result in
leakage of data on the incomes of any Taiwanese individual or company in China.</P>

      <P>Nearly 60 percent of Internet users in Taiwan have made online purchases this
year -- an increase of 10 percentage points compared to 2008, according to the
results of an annual survey on the country's digital divide.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission (RDEC) found that 59.3 percent of people over the age of 12 in Taiwan
who went online this year have made Internet purchases.</P>
      <P>However, due to the economic downturn, the average value of individuals' online
purchases dropped to NT$9,816 (US$304) from NT$13,565 in 2008, according to the
survey results which were released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 88 percent of Internet users went online to search for
information on daily life, up slightly from 86 percent the previous year.</P>
      <P>In addition,  80.7 percent of Internet users searched for information on travel
and gourmet food; 80.7 percent for news; and 68.6 percent researched product and
pricing information before making purchases.</P>
      <P>Some 75 percent of the respondents engaged in online leisure and entertainment
activities, 6.7 percentage points higher than last year; while 28.9 percent used
online banking services, up from 26.1 percent last year.</P>
      <P>There is an obvious gender divide in terms of online shopping, the poll
indicated, as 63 percent of the online shoppers were women, while 55.1 percent
were men.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that about 10 percent of Internet users have sold products
online, with 90 percent of them being part-time online sellers.</P>
      <P>In terms of the profit generated from online auctions, 50.3 percent of the
sellers said they gained less than NT$1,000 a month, 22.2 percent said their
profits were between NT$1,001 and NT$5,000, and 4.2 percent said they made more
than NT$5,000 a month.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that 43.8 percent of Internet users have their own
blogs, up from 36.7 percent last year.</P>
      <P>Nearly half of the younger respondents -- 49.5 percent of the 21-30 age group --
have their own blogs, compared to 44.4 percent last year.</P>
      <P>Instant messaging and blogging remain a craze among the younger generation, with
micro-blogging becoming a new, growing segment this year.</P>
      <P>Some 81.7 percent of those in the 21-30 age group said they have MSN Instant
Messenger accounts, 58 percent are members of Facebook, 13 percent are on Plurk
and 4.6 percent have Twitter accounts.</P>
      <P>According to 38 percent of the respondents, they spend time on Internet social
networks primarily because they want to connect with friends quickly and
economically; while 7 percent admitted that they suffer anxiety if they are away
from the Internet for more than a day.</P>
      <P>Among those who are on social networks, 40 percent said they have forwarded
information about influenza A(H1N1), disaster prevention and important
government information via MSN Instant Messenger, email and other services.</P>
      <P>The RDEC said that the Internet is expected to become another excellent public
information dissemination tool based on the fact that each Internet user has an
average of 60 contacts on their online friends list, with more than 80 percent

    <HEADLINE>Gov't sets goal of reverse mortgage plan by end of 2010</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is expected to work out by the end of 2010 a plan for the
introduction of reverse mortgages in Taiwan, which is considered essential to
retirement security among the growing number of senior citizens, Minister of the
Interior (MOI) Jiang Yi-huah said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Jiang, the government will solicit the opinions of various sectors
of society in its formulation of the plan, with attention to details such as
whether to enact a special law for the system and whether to link it to a social
welfare program.</P>
      <P>The minister noted that the policy -- which will allow senior homeowners to
convert equity into cash -- has received much public attention since it was
proposed a few months ago, mainly because it is likely to meet the needs of
Taiwan's fast-graying society.</P>
      <P>At present, the number of citizens aged 65 or older accounts for over 10 percent
of the country's population, and is likely to surpass 20 percent in less than 20
years, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of surveys conducted by the MOI revealed that the number
of seniors who live alone has been increasing, from 25 percent in 1986 to 40
percent in 2008, he said.</P>
      <P>The percentage of seniors who live with their children, on the other hand,
dropped from 70 percent in 1986 to below 50 percent in 2008, he added.</P>
      <P>Also, the surveys found that 33 percent of seniors do not have any regular
source of income, while more than 60 percent are living on their own or their
spouses' retirement benefits, Jiang noted.</P>
      <P>The minister was attending a seminar in Taipei on the issue of reverse
mortgages.</P>
      <P>Among the other speakers was Edward Szymanoski, a member of a team within the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that 20 years ago developed a
reserse mortgage model which came to be known as the Home Equity Conversion
Mortgage.</P>
      <P>Sharing his country's experience in promoting the program, Szymanoski said when
the model was first launched in the United States, the results were
unsatisfactory because there was too little government intervention.</P>
      <P>The program, however, has produced prominent results since it was made part of
the U.S. social welfare system, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-o, a professor at National Chengchi University's Department of Land
Economics, explained that reverse mortgages are intended to allow seniors to
"age in place," which means not having to move from their residence in order to
secure support services in response to changing personal needs.</P>
      <P>In addition to reverse mortgages, a sale-and-leaseback program under which
seniors can sell their homes to an insurer in return for annuities can also
serve a similar purpose, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Another option is for senior homeowners to obtain loans using their property as
collateral, and those loans would not have to be repaid until after the death of
the borrowers. They could also transfer their property into a trust to pay for
the care services provided by social welfare institutions, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Trusted Ma adviser becomes secretary general of ruling party</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  16  (CNA)
12/17/09  08:36:18
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou on Wednesday swore in his long-time trusted
adviser to a leading post as secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
party, in a move widely seen as an attempt by Ma to gear up for reelection in
2012.</P>
      <P>King Pu-tsung, considered the brains behind Ma's successful presidential
campaign which helped him get elected in 2008, flew back to Taiwan Wednesday,
cutting short his visiting scholar post in the United States, and was sworn in
almost immediately as the KMT's new secretary general.</P>
      <P>He gave few clues about what his top priorities are on his first day on the job,
but promised to "less talk and more action" and carry out various party reform
plans that are underway, saying he will be the one who is responsible for
reforming the 115-year-old party.</P>
      <P>"My job is the (KMT's) chief executive officer, therefore I am the one to be
held accountable if things fail, " the close confidant of Ma said in the first
press conference he gave after assuming office.</P>
      <P>Ma has been keen to rid the party of corruption and clean up its image, but
observers said that would not be the only reason the president sought King's
help.</P>
      <P>King's appointment comes just days after Ma's ruling party suffered a setback in
the Dec. 5 county and city elections, winning a smaller percentage of overall
votes than it did in local elections four years ago. The election results were
widely seen as a warning to the party, especially with the presidential race
just two years away.</P>
      <P>King served as the main campaign manager in Ma's two mayoral elections and the
2008 presidential election. He was lured back to Taiwan halfway through his
visiting  scholar program with the Washington-based Brookings Institution.</P>
      <P>His main tasks now are believed to be helping the ruling party win four upcoming
elections in the next 12 months, reversing the party's long standing culture of
vote-buying and handling its assets.</P>
      <P>King said all of these tasks will not be easy, and he will not be able to do it
alone without teamwork.</P>
      <P>Nicknamed "the Switchblade, " and "loner" King, an avid Triathlon runner, has
built a reputation in Taiwanese politics over the years as someone who is good
at political maneuvering.</P>
      <P>But King presented a different image at the press conference Wednesday. He said
that if he could be good at one thing, he wants to change the polarization in
Taiwanese politics and make the KMT's battle with the opposition Democratic
Progressive party (DPP) "a healthy competition".</P>
      <P>He also envisioned the party being "accepted and embraced" by younger
generations of Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>"I want to make the KMT a better party," King said.</P>
      <P>King told the media his first move will be visiting local counties and cities,
especially those the KMT had lost in previous elections and the ones which will
hold legislative by-elections next month.</P>
      <P>He did not rule out the possibility of carrying out a personnel reshuffle in the
KMT, saying that "of course we'll make personnel changes."</P>
      <P>Whatever he does, he is expected to enjoy the backing of the president, who also
serves as the KMT's chairman and handpicked King as his right hand man.</P>
      <P>With King's help, Ma has never lost an election.</P>
      <P>Now, many political analysts and ordinary Taiwanese people will be watching to
see if King can again deliver an election victory for the president, whose
approval ratings have taken a beating from the recession, public criticisms over
his administration's handling of Typhoon Morakot,  and criticisms  over his
proposed free-trade agreement with China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's tax revenues will rise after pact with China: minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Wednesday that he expects most of the
Taiwan investors in China will choose to be taxed in Taiwan after the proposed
cross-strait agreement on avoidance of double taxation is signed.</P>
      <P>This is because Taiwan only levies a 20 percent operating income tax, much lower
than the 25 percent imposed by China, he said.</P>
      <P>As a result, the government's tax revenues will definitely grow, Lee said at a
press conference held to explain the proposed tax agreement with China.</P>
      <P>But Lee said he cannot assess how much the additional tax income will amount to
until after the pact takes effect, as the government currently has no idea about
the business situation of Taiwan investors in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China negotiators will meet in the central Taiwan city of Taichung
Dec. 21-23 to sign four agreements, including the tax pact.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the tax agreement is aimed at protecting Taiwanese businessmen's
rights and ensuring the government's power to levy taxes on its nationals on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Without the pact, Taiwan investors in China are not under any government
protection since Taiwan does not have a say in the way China treats them, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee refuted news reports that many Taiwan investors in China are worried that
the proposed Taiwan-China tax agreement will enable the government to easily
trace their business deals and incomes.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has signed tax agreements with 16 countries, and over the
past five years, there have been only eight cases of tax information exchange
between Taiwan and those countries for the purposes of preventing major tax
evasions.</P>
      <P>Lee gave the assurance that exchanges of tax information would not result in
leakage of data on the incomes of any Taiwanese individual or company in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Internet shopping increases from last year: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of Internet users in Taiwan have made online purchases this
year -- an increase of 10 percentage points compared to 2008, according to the
results of an annual survey on the country's digital divide.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission (RDEC) found that 59.3 percent of people over the age of 12 in Taiwan
who went online this year have made Internet purchases.</P>
      <P>However, due to the economic downturn, the average value of individuals' online
purchases dropped to NT$9,816 (US$304) from NT$13,565 in 2008, according to the
survey results which were released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 88 percent of Internet users went online to search for
information on daily life, up slightly from 86 percent the previous year.</P>
      <P>In addition,  80.7 percent of Internet users searched for information on travel
and gourmet food; 80.7 percent for news; and 68.6 percent researched product and
pricing information before making purchases.</P>
      <P>Some 75 percent of the respondents engaged in online leisure and entertainment
activities, 6.7 percentage points higher than last year; while 28.9 percent used
online banking services, up from 26.1 percent last year.</P>
      <P>There is an obvious gender divide in terms of online shopping, the poll
indicated, as 63 percent of the online shoppers were women, while 55.1 percent
were men.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that about 10 percent of Internet users have sold products
online, with 90 percent of them being part-time online sellers.</P>
      <P>In terms of the profit generated from online auctions, 50.3 percent of the
sellers said they gained less than NT$1,000 a month, 22.2 percent said their
profits were between NT$1,001 and NT$5,000, and 4.2 percent said they made more
than NT$5,000 a month.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that 43.8 percent of Internet users have their own
blogs, up from 36.7 percent last year.</P>
      <P>Nearly half of the younger respondents -- 49.5 percent of the 21-30 age group --
have their own blogs, compared to 44.4 percent last year.</P>
      <P>Instant messaging and blogging remain a craze among the younger generation, with
micro-blogging becoming a new, growing segment this year.</P>
      <P>Some 81.7 percent of those in the 21-30 age group said they have MSN Instant
Messenger accounts, 58 percent are members of Facebook, 13 percent are on Plurk
and 4.6 percent have Twitter accounts.</P>
      <P>According to 38 percent of the respondents, they spend time on Internet social
networks primarily because they want to connect with friends quickly and
economically; while 7 percent admitted that they suffer anxiety if they are away
from the Internet for more than a day.</P>
      <P>Among those who are on social networks, 40 percent said they have forwarded
information about influenza A(H1N1), disaster prevention and important
government information via MSN Instant Messenger, email and other services.</P>
      <P>The RDEC said that the Internet is expected to become another excellent public
information dissemination tool based on the fact that each Internet user has an
average of 60 contacts on their online friends list, with more than 80 percent
of those being known acquaintances.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out between July 13 and Aug. 21 among 16, 133 respondents
via telephone. It had a margin of error of 0.8 percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is expected to work out by the end of 2010 a plan for the
introduction of reverse mortgages in Taiwan, which is considered essential to
retirement security among the growing number of senior citizens, Minister of the
Interior (MOI) Jiang Yi-huah said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Jiang, the government will solicit the opinions of various sectors
of society in its formulation of the plan, with attention to details such as
whether to enact a special law for the system and whether to link it to a social
welfare program.</P>
      <P>The minister noted that the policy -- which will allow senior homeowners to
convert equity into cash -- has received much public attention since it was
proposed a few months ago, mainly because it is likely to meet the needs of
Taiwan's fast-graying society.</P>
      <P>At present, the number of citizens aged 65 or older accounts for over 10 percent
of the country's population, and is likely to surpass 20 percent in less than 20
years, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of surveys conducted by the MOI revealed that the number
of seniors who live alone has been increasing, from 25 percent in 1986 to 40
percent in 2008, he said.</P>
      <P>The percentage of seniors who live with their children, on the other hand,
dropped from 70 percent in 1986 to below 50 percent in 2008, he added.</P>
      <P>Also, the surveys found that 33 percent of seniors do not have any regular
source of income, while more than 60 percent are living on their own or their
spouses' retirement benefits, Jiang noted.</P>
      <P>The minister was attending a seminar in Taipei on the issue of reverse
mortgages.</P>
      <P>Among the other speakers was Edward Szymanoski, a member of a team within the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that 20 years ago developed a
reserse mortgage model which came to be known as the Home Equity Conversion
Mortgage.</P>
      <P>Sharing his country's experience in promoting the program, Szymanoski said when
the model was first launched in the United States, the results were
unsatisfactory because there was too little government intervention.</P>
      <P>The program, however, has produced prominent results since it was made part of
the U.S. social welfare system, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-o, a professor at National Chengchi University's Department of Land
Economics, explained that reverse mortgages are intended to allow seniors to
"age in place," which means not having to move from their residence in order to
secure support services in response to changing personal needs.</P>
      <P>In addition to reverse mortgages, a sale-and-leaseback program under which
seniors can sell their homes to an insurer in return for annuities can also
serve a similar purpose, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Another option is for senior homeowners to obtain loans using their property as
collateral, and those loans would not have to be repaid until after the death of
the borrowers. They could also transfer their property into a trust to pay for
the care services provided by social welfare institutions, he said.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) issued a mobilization order
Wednesday for its members to gather for a protest at an airport in Taichung
where Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator with Taiwan, will land Monday for a
meeting in the central city.</P>
      <P>The DPP also plans to hold a mass protest march and rally Sunday afternoon prior
to Chen's arrival, DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang told reporters..</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the DPP will organize a motorcade in the city in protest against
Chen's presence in Taiwan, and on Wednesday it will hold a seminar discussing
the facts surrounding past secret deals between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
Communist Party of China, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 DPP supporters are expected to take part in the series of
anti-China activities, he said.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, former Vice President Annette Lu and former Premier
Frank Hsieh are expected to join Sunday's protest march, he noted, adding that
party members who fail to show up at these events will be disciplined.</P>
      <P>"These activities will be conducted peacefully, " the spokesman said, and he
urged the police and other authorities not to overreact to the protests.</P>
      <P>Bloody squabbles erupted between policemen and DPP supporters last year when
Chen was in Taipei City for the second round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Chen, in his capacity as president of China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), will hold the fourth cross-Taiwan Strait talks with
his Taiwan counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation, Dec. 22-23, in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Four agreements  on fishing crew cooperation,  agricultural quarantine
inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the
avoidance of double taxation are expected to be signed by Chiang and Chen in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
preparing to stage massive protest rallies during the fourth round of high-level
cross-Taiwan Strait talks, government authorities have stepped up security
measures to prevent any incidents during the Chinese delegation's upcoming
visit.</P>
      <P>The DPP headquarters has also issued action guidelines to demand that its
members  exercise  self-restraint  during the protest activities.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest developments
related to security concerns in Taiwan during that time:</P>
      <P>China times:</P>
      <P>The Taichung City police have begun to prepare for protests during the Dec.
21-25 meeting between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The SEF said it has been told that security personnel will be able to cope with
up to 150,000 protesters. If the weather in the central city of Taichung is
fine, the protests will be marathons, which means that China's top negotiator
with Taiwan could be besieged for all five days during his stay.</P>
      <P>Information obtained by the SEF indicated that a number of private companies are
footing the bill for protesters to travel by bus from southern Taiwan to
Taichung to join the demonstrations against Beijing's proxy and his delegation.</P>
      <P>Yu Hui-mao, deputy director-general of the Taichung city police department, said
the police will set up a restricted zone near the venue of the Chiang-Chen
meeting to ensure security,  and if necessary, traffic to and from the Taichung
Cloverleaf will be closed. (Dec. 17, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>In order to protect Chen and his group, the security forces of President Ma
Ying-jeou's administration will not only be in battle array against their own
compatriots, but the police could also close the main traffic artery in
Taichung.</P>
      <P>It is far too much to have the right of movement of thousands of motorists
compromised simply because of one man's visit. (Dec. 17, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong is expected to lead a group of Chinese
security officers to Taiwan Friday, three days before Chen's arrival Dec. 21, to
ensure that the meeting is held smoothly and order is maintained.</P>
      <P>Zheng and his group are expected to scout the 10-plus locations that the SEF has
arranged for Chen and his delegation to visit, to simulate security conditions
there. (Dec. 17, 2009)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's top negotiator with Taiwan -- Chen Yunlin, president of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- is scheduled to arrive in
Taiwan next Monday for a new round of talks with his Taiwanese counterpart --
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung -- on matters of mutual
concern, such as industrial certification standards,  agricultural quarantine
and avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Chen will reportedly take advantage of his Dec. 21-25 visit to push Taiwan to
further ease restrictions on cross-strait investment and lobby Taiwan's top flat
panel manufacturer AU Optronics Corp. to invest in China to produce new
generation liquid crystal display (LCD) panels.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the latest developments
related to the flat panel industry:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has promised to evaluate before the end of
this year the feasibility of allowing local companies to invest in China in the
production of large-sized LCD panels.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, ARATS President Chen Yunlin will try to attract Taiwanese
manufacturers in the field to venture into the Chinese market, with AU Optronics
(AUO) as the prime target.</P>
      <P>Chen's delegation will include representatives of 18 blue-chip companies  in
electronics,  fiber optics  and other  high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>On the sidelines of the formal Chiang-Chen talks, Chinese high-tech  industry
executives  will meet with their Taiwanese counterparts on possible trade or
joint-venture deals. Chen will also take the opportunity to explore the
possibility of AUO setting up production facilities in China.</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>With flat panel prices going up, foreign institutional investors have raised
profit forecasts for major local LCD companies, such as AUO and Chi Mei, for the
first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>Merrill Lynch securities analysts said Wednesday that major South Korean flat
panel makers have reported increases in market demand for their products. With
panel prices about to be raised from January, the analysts predicted that AUO
and Chi Mei will see better profits next quarter.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's trade promotion agency officially opened a new overseas office in
Singapore Thursday, as part of efforts to develop a more comprehensive trade
network service and to further explore business opportunities  in the markets of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>The  establishment  of the 48th  overseas  branch  of the government-funded
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) is an indication of the value
it attaches to helping Taiwanese companies further explore the ASEAN markets,
the trade promotion body said.</P>
      <P>The core mission of the new Taiwan Trade Center is "to help Taiwanese companies
expand their market share in Singapore and to provide Singaporean companies with
better services and information on trade and investment opportunities in Taiwan,
" Liao Jun Sheng, head of the center, was quoted as saying in a TAITRA press
release.</P>
      <P>Noting that it had an office in Singapore from 1987-1996, TAITRA said the
decision to return there will help to develop the friendship between Taiwan and
Singapore on the basis of their current strong economic and trade relations.</P>
      <P>The new office will coordinate with other TAITRA branches in Thailand,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, India and Bangladesh to build a comprehensive
trade promotion network in the region, TAITRA added.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, bilateral trade between Singapore and Taiwan for the period
January to November 2009 was US$12 billion, making Singapore Taiwan's 6th
largest trading partner, after China, Japan, the United States, Hong Kong and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese  companies have some 465 investment  projects in Singapore  valued at
a total US$5.47 billion,  mainly in the electronics and financial sectors, it
noted.</P>
      <P>The opening of TAITRA's Singapore  center was attended by officials and
representatives from the business sectors, including TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-
kang, Taiwan's representative to Singapore Vanessa Y.P Shih, and deputy chief
executive officer of International Enterprise Singapore Chua Taik Him.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi's temper flared at a recent weekly Cabinet meeting over the
slow progress of major infrastructure construction projects.</P>
      <P>Wu was not the first top administrator to become angry over the government's
poor efficiency. His predecessor Liu Chao-shiuan also got upset over the slow
pace of public construction.</P>
      <P>The government's inefficiency is not confined to the public construction sector,
but is actually pervasive and a major source of public grievances.</P>
      <P>For years,  lackluster government efficiency has repeatedly dragged down
Taiwan's ranking in global competitiveness surveys.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's democratization, senior leaders became obsessed more with
campaigning than day-to-day governance. Working-level civil servants tend to
follow rigid regulations and seldom show any initiative on reform or innovation.</P>
      <P>Legislative lethargy is also a major contributing factor to the government's
poor efficiency.  The opposition party,  with its filibustering and boycotts, is
partly responsible, but the ruling party must also share the blame since it
controls more than two-thirds of the seats. Only 27 of the 50 urgent bills
listed by the Cabinet as urgent were passed in the last legislative session. The
ruling Kuomintang should exercise more discipline over its lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Now that President Ma Ying-jeou has taken over the helm of the KMT,
collaboration between the government and the ruling party should improve.</P>
      <P>As the country's top administrator, Premier Wu should also lead by example and
work out a package of measures to upgrade government efficiency and oversee its
full implementation. He will leave a memorable legacy if he can achieve this.</P>

      <P>Six years since its inception, the Central Taiwan Science Park (CTSP) is fast
catching up with the country's two other older major science parks to become
another powerful engine driving the country's  innovation  and high-tech
manufacturing industries.</P>
      <P>Ground-breaking for the science park's Erlin Site -- its fourth phase of
expansion -- located in the central county of Changhua, is slated for Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>With the new site, the park, known as the "Silicon Valley" of central Taiwan, is
poised to add another high-tech manufacturing arm, said CTSP Administration
Director-General Yang Wen-ke.</P>
      <P>The Erlin science park, which will mainly house a cluster of optoelectronics
makers, is expected to solicit NT$1.2 trillion (US$37 billion) in investment
capital once it is completed.</P>
      <P>"The new park area is expected to create 30,000 job openings and generate NT$920
billion in business turnover annually when it eventually becomes fully
operational," Yang said.</P>
      <P>The Erlin Park, situated on an area of 350 hectares -- equivalent to the area of
the Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan, which is the biggest science park
in Taiwan --  will be home to the 10th-generation of TFT-LCD display
manufacturing operations of AU Optronics Corp., one of the leading TFT-LCD
display manufacturers in Taiwan, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>"Currently, around the world only Sony and Sharp have operated such type of
plants in Japan, while South Korea's Samsung is planning on building one," Yang
said.</P>
      <P>Yang added that the Erlin Park will eventually be a high-tech production  chain
integrating  the  upstream-  midstream-  and downstream-optoelectronic
industry,  along with other satellite industries, such as semiconductor,
precision machinery, biotechnology and green energy manufacturing.</P>
      <P>In the face of rising environmental awareness, Yang said, the Erlin Park will
spare no efforts to perfect management of waste water and control of hazardous
chemicals discharges.</P>
      <P>"Communicate, communicate and communicate, " Yang said, pointing out that it is
the CTSP's responsibility to communicate with the public, particularly residents
living in areas adjacent to the Erlin Park, on the possible impact that the new
park area may cause to the environment.</P>
      <P>"Our aim is to secure a balance between economic development and environmental
protection," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang said the Chung Hsing New Village in central Taiwan's Nantou
County, once the seat of the Taiwan provincial government, will be transformed
into a high-level research park in 10 years.</P>
      <P>According to a CTSP plan, the 276-hectare Chung Hsing New Village park project
will break ground in 2010, with the first phase of construction to be completed
in 2014, and the full project in 2019, at a total cost of NT$26.7 billion.</P>
      <P>With some 250 companies,  7,500  research  and development personnel, as well as
16,500 residents expecting to be accommodated in the park, it is envisioned to
generate an output of cutting-edge products worth NT$29.5 billion annually.</P>

      <P>More than 500 movie industry players in the Asia-Pacific region gathered in
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County Thursday for the opening of the Asia-Pacific
Film Festival, as a more than half a century old event is revived for the first
time.</P>
      <P>The festival, which came to a sudden stop two years ago due to the global
financial crisis, opened with the 500 delegates from 17 countries and regions
attending festivities at I-Shou University in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>As a founding member and eight-time sponsor of the international event and a
long-time host of its secretariat, Taiwan felt obliged to revive the film
festival, according to Justin Chou, a Taiwanese legislator who is also chairman
of the event.</P>
      <P>Chou, as a commissioner of the Secretariat, attended the festival's board
meeting in Jakarta in November 2008. It was at that time that he agreed to
sponsor the 53rd Asia-Pacific Film Festival on behalf of Taiwan's film industry.</P>
      <P>Chou said in a press conference earlier this month that Kaohsiung County was
chosen as the venue of the international event because the organizer hoped the
festivities could help revitalize the region devastated by Typhoon Morakot in
August.</P>
      <P>Among the 63 entries from Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea,
Iran, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, India, and
Australia, dozens have been selected to be shown at theaters at the E-Da World
recreational park near I-Shou University.</P>
      <P>The festival will run from Dec. 17-19, with the awards presentation ceremony to
be held at I-Shou University's stadium on Saturday evening.</P>

      <P>The number of furloughed workers at Taiwan's three major science parks has
continued to decline, as the country's economy seems to have bottomed out, the
National Science Council (NSC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The total number of workers on unpaid leave at the Hsinchu Science Park,
Southern Taiwan Science Park and Central Taiwan Science Park had dropped sharply
to 1,032 as of Dec. 1, down 99 percent compared to the record high of 132,414
posted in January, NSC officials said in a report to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih attributed the encouraging trend mainly to a series of
stimulus measures that the administration has taken over the past year to boost
business at the three leading science parks.</P>
      <P>The measures included halving the management fees the NSC charges firms
operating at the science parks and promoting projects aimed at upgrading the
parks' R&amp;D capabilities, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The premier also exhorted the administrations of the three science parks to
accelerate planning for the construction of new, eco-friendly science parks
around the country, including a biomedical park in Hsinchu County, a new science
park in Yilan County, a science park in Tongluo, Miaoli County, the Erlin
science park in Changhua County and the Chung Hsing New Village high-end
research park in Nantou County.</P>
      <P>"Equal importance should be given to production and environmental protection to
achieve sustainable development in the country while striving for industrial
competitiveness," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Health insurance fee overhaul</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Department  of Health (DOH)
12/17/09  16:36:14
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister Yaung Chih-liang has braved the possibility of populist backlash to
advocate an increase in national health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that Taiwan's health insurance system is heavily in debt.
Without some increase in fees, the government would have to cut welfare spending
to support the universal health care system. In essence, freezing health
insurance fees will not benefit anyone.</P>
      <P>However, there is room for discussion about the DOH's reform plan.</P>
      <P>In a bid to expedite the process by avoiding a law revision, the DOH has
proposed raising premium rates. Under the plan, highly-paid wage earners will be
required to pay more for health insurance.</P>
      <P>When the universal health care system was launched in March 1995, computerized
databanks were still in the development stage in Taiwan, therefore it would have
been difficult for the government to peg health insurance premiums to income
other than wages.</P>
      <P>As a result, the existing health insurance system is not equitable, as the
premiums of wealthy corporate bosses, who earn most of their money from capital
gains and dividends, are not calculated based on their full income, but rather
only on wages.</P>
      <P>Now that computerization has become the order of the day and detailed income
data is easily available, it is no longer justifiable to calculate premiums on
the basis of wages only.</P>
      <P>We hope Minister Yaung will pay attention to this point in his efforts to revise
health insurance premium payments. He should be patient and go the distance to
push for an amendment to Article 22 of the National Health Insurance Act so
other forms of income, such as capital gains and stock dividends, could be
factored into the calculation of premiums.</P>

    <HEADLINE>48.5% of Taiwanese want protests during Chiang-Chen talks: DPP</HEADLINE>

      <P>Nearly half of the people responding to a recent public opinion survey are in
favor of staging protests against the next round of talks between Taiwan and
China's top negotiators slated to be held next week in Taichung City, according
to the results of the poll released Thursday by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the DPP to explore the public's views on issues
surrounding the fourth round of talks between Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that 65.2 percent of respondents expressed opposition to a
government ban on various demonstrations that the DPP and other pro-localization
groups are planning to hold during the talks, while 48.5 percent said they are
in favor of staging such protests and rallies during this period.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the meeting will be to sign four cross-Taiwan Strait
agreements regarding cooperation on certification standards, agricultural
quarantine, fishing-related labor affairs, and avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP said that 87.06 percent of the respondents said they do not
know the contents of the agreements.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 81.5 percent of respondents thought the government had
failed to state the agreements' contents and the impacts they would have.</P>
      <P>While 67.6 percent of them believed that the signing of a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China will benefit
business consortiums, 36.7 thought the proposed ECFA will have a negative impact
on their employment and their family income, and 49.6 percent expressed their
opposition to signing the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>On the controversy surrounding an article published Monday in the Wall Street
Journal Asia, in which President Ma Ying-jeou was quoted as saying: "Whether
there will be reunification as expected by the mainland side depends very much
on what is going to unfold in the next decade, " and a follow-up clarification
by the Presidential Office that the president actually said "the next decades, "
70.1 percent of the respondents said they believe Ma will lead Taiwan toward
unification with China, while only 5.5 percent thought Taiwan will move toward
independence.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted from Dec. 15-16 among people who are 20 years old or
older by random sampling via telephone interviews. A total of 956 valid samples
were collected. It had a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.2 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign offices in Taiwan opt for e-cards this year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
12/17/09  17:27:33

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several foreign representative offices in Taiwan have decided to send electronic
Christmas cards to government agencies and other contacts this year, as part of
efforts to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) and the British Trade
and Cultural Office (BTCO) said that the use of e-cards is less detrimental to
the environment than buying paper cards.</P>
      <P>The decision also coincides with a United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC) meeting that is currently taking place in Copenhagen,
Denmark, at which some 100 heads of states from around the world are trying to
decide on the future extent of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and work
out a new international climate change agreement before the Kyoto Protocol
expires in 2012.</P>
      <P>"The world is currently searching for a solution to combat climate change. It is
therefore important that we take action rather than simply talk about taking
action, " Guy Ledoux, head of the EETO, told the Central News Agency in an
e-mail.</P>
      <P>"The electronic card is one small action that we can do to save the environment,
and even though it is not an actual card, it still conveys our most sincere
appreciation to all the friends of the EU and the EETO," he added.</P>
      <P>The decision to send e-cards for the first time was an internal one made by the
EETO.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the BTCO, which sends an average of 600-700 cards each year, is also
taking similar action to help save the planet by encouraging its staff to use
e-cards or existing printed cards to send seasonal greetings this year.</P>
      <P>This is one of the many steps taken by the BTCO to be kinder to the environment,
according to the office,  adding that other energy-saving measures include using
natural light whenever possible and turning off computers, printers and copy
machines at lunchtime and after work.</P>
      <P>The EU and the United Kingdom are playing leading roles in global efforts to
mitigate climate change, as they have set ambitious targets to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>The EU has adopted legally binding measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions
to an average of 30 percent below the 1990 level by the year 2020 and is
prepared to further increase this effort if other partners take on comparable
commitments in a new international agreement. The U.K. introduced a Climate
Change Act in November 2008 to cut emissions by at least a third by 2020 and by
at least 80 percent by 2050.</P>
      <P>With the increasing public awareness of environmental protection and the
convenience of sending holiday greetings via e-cards and text messages, the sale
of Christmas cards in Taiwan has been gradually declining, said Huang Hui-ling,
public relations specialist</P>
      <P>at Eslite Corp., one of Taiwan's largest bookstores that launched its first
Christmas card sale in 1989.</P>
      <P>She told the Central News Agency in a telephone interview that the company has
seen a steady decrease in the number of Christmas cards sold over the past
decade, but sales have been stabilized in recent years because of a retro trend
of sending printed cards.</P>
      <P>"Despite the convenience of sending e-cards, it is a completely different
experience for people to receive printed cards, which symbolize the love and
care of the senders," said Huang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States are likely to resume two-way talks early next year
based on the foundation of a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) , a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since the two countries suspended formal diplomatic ties in 1979, the TIFA talks
have provided a significant official channel for Taiwan-U.S. dialogue on trade
and economic issues after the agreement was signed in September 1994. The talks
are usually hosted by either side on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>Harry Ho-jen Tseng, director general of the MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, told reporters Thursday that ranking officials with the U.S. Trade
Representative Office had visited Taiwan last week to pave the way for the next
round of the TIFA talks.</P>
      <P>"Although a precise date has yet to be set, the talks might take place in early
2010," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, a wide range of matters can be discussed in the two-way TIFA
talks, but agreements on bilateral investment and the avoidance of double
taxation are the more pressing issues facing the two sides.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt, the top U.S. liaison
official with Taiwan who was in Taipei late last month to brief Taiwan's
authorities on U.S. President Barack H. Obama's China visit, also mentioned that
U. S. officials would visit Taiwan in December to prepare for the reopening of
the TIFA talks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States held their last TIFA talks in Washington, D.C. in
July 2007, when Taiwan was represented by John C.C. Deng, chief negotiator of
the Office of Trade Negotiations under the Ministry of Economic Affairs,  and
the United States was represented by Deputy Trade Representative Karan Bhatia.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) new secretary-general said Thursday that he will
do his best to help engineer a meeting between the leaders of the main
opposition and ruling parties.</P>
      <P>On his second day in office, King Pu-tsung said that President Ma Ying-jeou, who
is also chairman of the KMT, would like to see more positive communication and
healthy competition between the KMT and main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"We will try our best to achieve this and to do it well, " said King, in
response to reporters questions about the proposed meeting.</P>
      <P>However, King said he is not sure whether Ma will meet with DPP Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen in his capacity as president or as KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>"This is not something I can decide," he said.</P>
      <P>On the question of the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
with China, King said that while the Executive Yuan is working to promote the
agreement, the KMT will help to explain the details of it to the public.</P>
      <P>He said it is not appropriate for him to comment further on ECFA issues, adding
that there should be a clear line between the administration and the party.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, King said since the DPP does not have any idea whether the ECFA is
"round or flat," the party's strong opposition to the pact lacks legitimacy.</P>
      <P>His comments raised hackles in the DPP, with its spokesman Tsai Chi-chang noting
Thursday that various public opinion polls have shown that a lot of people have
no idea what the ECFA is, and adding that it would be too late wait until the
pact is signed to object to it.</P>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang, a former party chairman and premier, also urged the government
to clearly explain the ECFA, as not only the DPP, but also the general public,
is still at sea.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP spokeswoman Hsiao Bi-khim said Thursday that the party has not
yet received an invitation to debate the issue with President Ma, as he
proposed.</P>
      <P>In a television interview last Friday, Ma raised the possibility of debating the
ECFA with DPP Chairwoman Tsai, and said he hopes the debate will take place
after there have been some results from the negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>However, DPP spokesman Tsai expressed doubts over the government's sincerity to
debate the ECFA, and said it was regrettable that Premier Wu Den-yih had
declined to discuss ECFA issues with university students.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, the student unions of three universities in Taiwan --
National Taiwan University, National Taiwan University of Science and
Technology, and National Taiwan Normal University -- released a joint statement,
asking Premier Wu to explain to students in person what the ECFA is all about.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu said he has asked Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang, who is most
familiar with topic, to represent the government in the discussions with the
students.</P>
      <P>President Ma has touted the urgency of striking an ECFA deal with China to
protect Taiwan from being marginalized after a free trade area agreement between
China and the Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) takes effect at the
start of next year.</P>
      <P>The DPP and its pro-independence allies, however, are wary about signing such an
agreement with China, fearing that the pact could make Taiwan more reliant on
China economically and eventually lead to its annexation by China.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih pledged Thursday that the government will try to strike a
balance between maintaining public order and upholding individual freedom, in
anticipation of protests to be launched by the opposition against the upcoming
cross-Taiwan Strait talks in Taichung.</P>
      <P>"While the government is obliged to protect its citizens' freedom of speech, as
the host,  Taiwan must also show its generous hospitality and ensure the
security of its guests," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He urged the protesters to work with the government to protect Taiwan's
international image and win respect from the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah, 200 police officers will be
deployed at the venue during the talks, and the police force will be increased
to 1,000 when the guests are taken on tours, when traffic control measures are
needed.</P>
      <P>In a report to the Legislative Yuan, the ministry said that police will respect
citizens' rights to express their differences while enforcing the law.</P>
      <P>In doing so, police will protect law-abiding citizens, crack down on those who
break the law, and take actions against violence, it said.</P>
      <P>The chief negotiators of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait -- Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin -- will meet Dec. 22 in Taichung to sign four cross-strait agreements
regarding fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection,
industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of
double taxation.</P>
      <P>Accusing the administration  of President Ma Ying-jeou  of attempting to
formulate under-the-table  deals with Beijing by promoting the signing of an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between the two sides,  the pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has planned a series of protests
right before Chen's arrival and during his stay in the central city, including a
march and rally on Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>Various demonstrations will also be held on Dec. 21-23.</P>
      <P>DPP politicians in Taichung said Thursday that protesters will be ubiquitous and
will follow Chen wherever he goes during the period to let Chen know that half
of Taiwan's population are against the controversial trade pact.</P>
      <P>Among the protest methods to be adopted will include releasing sky lanterns
inscribed with protest messages outside the event's venue and bombarding the
venue with paper-made missiles, according to Fan Sung-yu, convener of the DPP
caucus in the Taichung City Council.</P>
      <P>The party will also have floats stationed around the venue to propagate its
appeals, Fan said, stressing that all of these protests will be non-violent.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ming-yuan, a former DPP legislator, said his party is against the ECFA
because the pact will downgrade Taiwan's status to that of a region within
China.</P>
      <P>The DPP insists that the government should hold a referendum to allow the people
to decide whether Taiwan should engage in ECFA talks with China and calls on all
people in Taiwan to come out to voice their opposition to the Chiang-Chen talks
and proposed trade pact, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu again urged the DPP to take the cross-
strait talks in stride and make sure the protests are conducted through rational
and non-violent means so as not to undermine Taiwan's democracy.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and over 100 guests gathered together Thursday in a small
village of the eastern county of Taitung to celebrate the official handover of
50 newly built houses for families affected by Typhoon Morakot which devastated
parts of Taiwan in August.</P>
      <P>The 50 permanent houses is the first batch of some 1,200 homes that World Vision
Taiwan, the local chapter of the international Christian charity, is planning to
build in Taitung, Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Chiayi counties, some of the worst
affected areas.</P>
      <P>"I have visited Taitung County four times since Typhoon Morakot struck. Every
time I passed by this construction site, I saw these houses being built and felt
very touched, as these houses look like real homes," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president  made the remarks in a celebration  of the inauguration of the new
houses in Taitung County's Jalan Village, praising World Vision Taiwan for
having respectfully incorporated into its reconstruction project the cultures
and values of the indigenous people, many of whom were seriously affected in the
storm.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan and donor HTC Foundation handed a symbolic door key to
village chief Lin Jiao-guang, to mark a significant milestone for Typhoon
Morakot reconstruction efforts.</P>
      <P>Ma also helped villager Wu Jin-shan install a doorplate for his new house number
112-50 and visited other typhoon-affected families to share their joy of moving
into the new homes.</P>
      <P>Hank Du, executive director of World Vision Taiwan, expressed gratitude to the
many donors and partners who have contributed funds, gifts-in-kind, time, and
talent to help the typhoon survivors recover from the disaster.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to the efforts of all the villagers and partners, we have seen many
stories full of blessing and gratefulness happening on this piece of land," Du
said.</P>
      <P>"Recovery is more than recovering what is lost. More importantly, it's about
sharing love, peace and hope," he added.</P>
      <P>According to World Vision Taiwan, through its "Collaborative Home Building"
approach, these houses were constructed by the beneficiaries with help from
professional teams, military personnel, and volunteers from Taiwan and overseas.</P>
      <P>The construction work commenced two weeks after the typhoon struck in early
August, and took four months of tireless labor to complete. It has transformed
what was once a wasteland into a settlement now called "Jalan 88 New Community,"
it added.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan has announced that it will invest over NT$1.4 billion
(US$433 million) from public donations in its long-term rehabilitation programs
to help storm survivors rebuild their lives.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot swept through Taiwan from Aug. 8-9, killing more than 600
people. The damage caused by the typhoon in parts of southern and eastern Taiwan

      <P>Over 60 percent of affluent Taiwanese investors say they became wealthier during
the last six months, mainly due to the global stock market rally, according to a
survey conducted by the Nielsen Company.</P>
      <P>The percentage of affluent respondents in Taiwan who said their wealth rose
climbed to 61 percent from 33 percent six months ago, according  to the Hong
Kong-based  HSBC Holdings  Plc,  which commissioned the survey.</P>
      <P>The poll on wealth management for the Asia Pacific found that some 80 percent of
Taiwan's rich people responding to the poll own stocks, nearly 90 percent still
hold Taiwanese currency in cash and savings, and 43 percent have taken out a
life insurance policy, said Betty Miao, an HSBC official in Taiwan in charge of
personal financial services.</P>
      <P>Thirty-nine percent of the Taiwanese respondents said they have savings in
foreign currencies, marking the highest percentage in all eight Asian countries
and areas surveyed, Miao said.</P>
      <P>The pollsters defined "affluence" in Taiwan as people earning at least NT$70,000
(US$2,166) per person per month, in addition to possessing liquid or floating
assets worth NT$3 million or more.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll found that 70 percent of the Taiwanese respondents say they
will invest in the stock or securities markets in the Greater China area over
the next six months.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that affluent Taiwanese tend to choose the Greater China
area and new emerging markets for stock or fund investment.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese affluent are not only well traveled, they also have relatives and
friends from all over the world, " Miao quoted the poll findings as indicating.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted in September and October, was based on interviews with
1,700 wealthy investors aged between 30 and 55, HSBC said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Sweden's top representative here Henrik Bystrom said Thursday that a planned
trade pact between Taiwan and China should be conducive to closer cross-Taiwan
Strait trade ties and that it is something looked forward to by many people.</P>
      <P>Bystrom was referring to an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA),
which Taiwan hopes to sign with China by early next year.</P>
      <P>He made the comments after receiving an Economic Medal from Minister of Economic
Affairs Shih Yen-shiang at the ministry for his outstanding contribution to
Taiwan-Sweden exchanges in both the government and private sectors.</P>
      <P>In principle, the pact should be a pact that would help Taiwan and China forge
closer trade and economic relations -- which Bystrom said will be a welcome
development for many people.</P>
      <P>He hailed Taiwan as an open society with friendly people and a bright future,
but he pointed out that Taiwan is facing a serious challenge of building value-
added brands in the world market amid fierce competition in the region as many
Taiwan-based companies have relocated their operations to China.</P>
      <P>Bystrom, who has been representative of the Swedish Trade Council Taipei since
August 2001, will retire from the post by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>During his tenure of more than 10 years in Taipei, the Swedish envoy has helped
push the two countries to clinch mutually beneficial pacts on two-way
cooperation concerning energy and environment conservation,  telecommunications,
and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>During the decade Bystrom has served in his post, the number of Swedish firms
with a stronghold in Taipei grew from 35 to 70 at present.</P>

      <P>"Pan" -- the pronunciation of the Chinese character for "hope" -- has been
selected as the word most representative of Taiwan for 2009 in a recent opinion
survey.</P>
      <P>When the survey asking respondents to choose a word best reflecting the
situation in the country for the year was held for the first time in 2008, the
word "chaos" was chosen.</P>
      <P>The selection of the word "hope" to replace last year's choice represents an
encouraging turn of mood in Taiwan. It shows that the majority of local people
have endeavored to set aside the confusion and disorder of the previous year to
focus on a more promising future.</P>
      <P>The annual survey, co-sponsored by the United Daily News and the Far Eastern
Group, provides clues to general social sentiment over the past year and is
aimed at inspiring those in power to reflect upon their governance.</P>
      <P>In this year's survey, more than 60 percent of the 30 final selections were
negative, but "hope" winning the largest number of votes indicates that the
mainstream attitude of Taiwanese people last year was to move forward in a
positive and optimistic manner.</P>
      <P>Hope implies happiness and its selection as the word best representative of 2009
symbolizes most people's good wishes and eagerness to usher in a new year. It is
hoped that the coming year will be a period of harmony, peace and prosperity.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent CommonWealth Magazine poll about local people's stances on Taiwan's
future found that 78 percent of the respondents want the present status quo,
while 11 percent look forward to de jure independence soon and 2 percent desire
for quick unification with China.</P>
      <P>Among the status quo supporters, 35 percent hope to see the status quo
maintained forever; 33 percent yearn for slow moving toward  de jure
independence;  10 percent  call  for ultimate unification.</P>
      <P>Sometime ago, a National Taiwan University survey conducted as part of a
research on globalization also found that 44.78 percent of the respondents want
the status quo to remain; 29.97 percent want to maintain the status quo and
gradually move toward de jure independence; 4.32 percent aspire to maintain the
status quo and gradually move toward unification; 9.11 percent call for fast
independence and a mere 1.82 percent want fast unification. In other words, up
to 83.86 percent do not want to see Taiwan annexed into China.</P>
      <P>Both surveys convincingly prove that maintaining the status quo and eventually
moving toward de jure independence is the common aspiration of the people of
Taiwan. In essence, maintaining the status quo and transforming Taiwan into a
fully normalized country is the choice of a majority of Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the only road for the leader of a democratic country like
Taiwan to take is safeguarding its present independent status quo and then
moving toward de jure independence.</P>
      <P>As a presidential candidate, Ma Ying-jeou spoke loudly on the campaign trail
that Taiwan's future should be determined solely by the 23 million Taiwan people
and vowed to fight for local people's common aspiration for representation in
the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Once elected, Ma, however, immediately backed off his promise and recognized the
so-called "92 consensus" - a move tantamount to embracing Beijing's "one China"
principle.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office more than a year ago, Ma has even moved faster to "lock
Taiwan's economy into China's fold." In the face of China's relentless
suppression of Taiwan in the international arena, the Ma administration still
touts its "diplomatic truce" strategy at the expense of Taiwan's sovereign
status.</P>
      <P>While Ma is seeking even closer economic ties with China by preaching the
urgency of signing a cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement, the
CommonWealth Magazine poll shows that 61 percent of the respondents worry about
Taiwan's economic over reliance on China.</P>
      <P>If Ma remains oblivious to the alarming signals shown in the ruling Kuomintang's
setback in the recent local elections, he should heed the mainstream opinion
seen in the results of the latest CommonWealth poll; otherwise, his chance to
win a second presidential term would be slim.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Steel Corp. to invest US$94.55 million in Brazil iron mine</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official from Taiwan's largest integrated steel maker, China Steel
Corporation (CSC), said Thursday that the company has reached an agreement with
two Japanese major shareholders of Brazil's NAMISA iron ore mine to obtain a 1
percent share in the mine.</P>
      <P>It is the first time CSC has sought to obtain a stake in a foreign iron company
and the decision is seen as an effort to try to take control of the raw material
source, as Brazil is one of Taiwan's main suppliers of iron ore.</P>
      <P>Chung Lo-min, CSC executive vice president, said the agreement was officially
passed in a CSC board meeting that same day, but will only take effect after it
is approved by NAMISA stakeholders and the Brazilian government.</P>
      <P>CSC has agreed to pay 8.5 billion Japanese yen (US$94.55 million) to obtain the
1 percent stake in NAMISA from the Itochu Corporation, a Japanese trading
company, and major Japanese steel producer Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., which
own 16 percent and 2.64 percent of the Brazilian iron ore mine, respectively.</P>
      <P>Founded in 2007, NAMISA is largely owned by Brazilian steel maker CSN, which has
a 60 percent share, while the rest is owned by a consortium of Japanese and
South Korean steel companies.</P>
      <P>NAMISA is estimated to produce 14.5 million tons of iron ore this year, rising
to 39 million tons per year by 2014.</P>
      <P>"After years of exploitation, iron ore and coal are destined to become rare
resources, with prices continuing to increase in the long run. Therefore, this
participation project is of great investment value," Chung said.</P>
      <P>He noted that CSC's 1 percent stake is too little to suggest that the company is
trying to get total control of the iron ore resource.</P>
      <P>According to the Brussels-based World Steel Association, CSC, which is largely
state-owned, was the 26th-largest steel producer in the world in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA to spend US$1.1 billion to help workers deal with trade pact</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has agreed to allocate NT$36.4 billion (US$1.1 billion) to
help workers with job placement in anticipation of the impact of a proposed
economic pact it hopes to sign with China, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The labor assistance fund, which will be part of NT$94.3 billion that will be
allocated to help upgrade and transform industries that could be seriously
affected in the wake of the signing of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA), will be managed by the CLA, said CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan at
a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>The CLA will not use its employment insurance fund or employment security fund
to assist workers with the ECFA impact, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The NT$36.4 billion budget will be allocated over 10 years, he went on, adding
that the subsidies offered to workers will be short- term and designed to
enhance their job skills so that they can find stable jobs in the long term.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, a widespread idea that signing the ECFA with China  will
only  benefit  industry  and not workers  is "a misunderstanding." Industries
and workers are all in the same boat, he said,  adding that signing  the ECFA
will strengthen  the competitiveness  of industries,  which  can also increase
job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Based on the CLA's report, the signing of the ECFA will create 105,000 to
125,000 jobs -- a far cry from a report from the Ministry of Economics Affairs
(MOEA) that predicts a net increase of 250,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Wang explained that the lower CLA figure is because it uses a static simulation
that only considers jobs created while the country's competitiveness increases,
while the MOEA study applies a dynamic simulation that assumes that after the
signing of the ECFA, more industries from other countries will invest in Taiwan,
which will bring more jobs.</P>
      <P>Wang said that overall, the signing of the ECFA will not increase the
unemployment rate.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese students at four education levels all fared worse than their South
Korean counterparts in the 2008 Test of English for International Communication
(TOEIC), with local senior high school students performing the poorest with an
average score of 524, 151 points lower than the South Korean average.</P>
      <P>The average scores of Taiwanese students at senior high schools, technical and
vocational colleges, general universities and graduate schools, respectively,
were all lower than those of South Korean students at similar education levels,
according to a report on comparisons of 2008 TOEIC scores in Taiwan, Japan and
South Korea released Thursday by the Taiwan branch of the U.S. Educational
Testing Service (ETS).</P>
      <P>Taiwanese university students scored an average of 577 points on the TOEIC last
year, again lower than the 621 average scored by their South Korean counterparts
but higher than 553 average scored by Japanese students.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's technical and vocational college students scored an average of 408,
lower than the average of 460 scored by their counterparts in South Korea and
also lower than the average of 484 obtained by students at two-year junior
colleges in Japan.</P>
      <P>Local senior high school students got an average score of 524 points,  close to
the 522 average recorded by their Japanese counterparts but far lower than South
Korea's 675 average.</P>
      <P>Graduate students in Taiwan also lagged behind their South Korean counterparts,
scoring an average of 585, behind South Korea's 663 average but slightly higher
than Japan's average of 583.</P>
      <P>The report was issued after ETS Taiwan released the 2008 TOEIC scores for global
test takers earlier this year that shows the average TOEIC score in Taiwan
ranked in eighth place among 14 Asian countries and areas, ahead of Japan but
behind South Korea.</P>
      <P>Benjamin Wang,  an ETS representative  in Taiwan said the comparisons made to
gauge students' English language proficiency in the three countries with similar
education systems can help show their overall competitiveness in the world
market.</P>
      <P>TOEIC is a test of English proficiency used as a standard for establishing
workplace English writing skills and spoken English proficiency for non-native
English-speaking people. The highest possible score is 990.</P>
      <P>However, according to another report released that same day by the Taiwan branch
of Cambridge ESOL, Taiwanese children in the 7-12 age group ranked second among
non-English-speaking countries in Asia in the 2009 Cambridge Young Learners
English tests, second only to Indonesia but ahead of China and South Korea.</P>

      <P>A three-judge panel of the Taiwan High Court ruled late Thursday that former
President Chen Shui-bian should remain in custody for another two months, on the
grounds that he might abscond if released from detention.</P>
      <P>The court announced that Chen should be detained for another two months from
Dec. 24-Feb. 23. The next hearing on whether Chen should be detained for a
longer period might be held before the Feb. 13-21 Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The judges said that Chen, who was president for eight years and took part in
many secret diplomatic missions, has had the chance to come into contact with
foreign governments and members of the private sector, making him "more familiar
than ordinary people with ways to flee overseas."</P>
      <P>With Chen's influence and the assets stashed overseas by his family, he could
live a comfortable life if he were to run away to evade the severe sentence that
he could face, the judges said.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen were sentenced Sept. 11 by the Taipei District
Court to life in prison, in addition to receiving fines of NT$200 million
(US$6.13 million) and NT$300 million, respectively, on several counts of
corruption, including embezzling from a presidential fund for state affairs,
taking bribes from local businessmen and money laundering.</P>
      <P>The high court panel took charge of Chen's case Sept. 24 after he appealed the
judgment. The panel ruled that same day that Chen should remain in custody for
another three months.</P>
      <P>The former president was first detained Nov. 12, 2008 and was released Dec. 13
following his indictment.</P>
      <P>He was detained again Dec. 30 after the Taipei District Court approved a request
by prosecutors to take him back into custody and he has not been released since.</P>

official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the establishment of a carbon emissions trading system, the

      <P>Dozens of national leaders gave their statements on the urgency to unite the

      <P>Taiwan may take 20 years to complete its talks with China on a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), an economist said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a bid to forge closer cross-Taiwan Strait economic and trade relations to
sharpen its competitive edge, Taiwan is poised to sign the ECFA early next year.</P>
      <P>"Given the great differences among the public with regard to ties with China, it
might take 20 years or so for Taiwan to complete ECFA issues other than the
items to be included on an `early harvest list, '" said Chu Yun-peng, a former
minister without portfolio and one of the main economic advisers to President Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Chu, now an economics professor at National Central University, said at a Taipei
seminar on the global financial crisis and cooperation between Taiwan and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that the ECFA is not a panacea
but rather a possible solution for Taiwan in the face of the formation of
regional trade groupings from which Taiwan is excluded.</P>
      <P>He added that the countries in the region and the rest of the world have been
aggressively signing free trade agreements (FTAs) , which are having a negative
impact on Taiwan, especially in terms of its trade competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Although it is now too late for Taiwan to seek an FTA with ASEAN, it still could
pursue bilateral economic cooperation and tariff reduction arrangements with
ASEAN countries through negotiations, Chu said, adding that "China's influence
will be crucial to Taiwan's attempts to forge closer economic ties with ASEAN."</P>
      <P>Chu, who has been dubbed the "pusher" of the ECFA idea, said that since public
support for the pact is still low, it poses a rigorous challenge for the
government.</P>
      <P>He said that an ECFA is not tantamount to an FTA with China but is rather a
framework agreement with most of its contents needing to be added step-by-step
through negotiations.</P>
      <P>An ECFA can only serve to help eliminate Taiwan's competitive disadvantages,
while the nation has to create "a new blue sea" by creating brands and
possessing advanced technologies, Chu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Master Kong TDRs fall after first-day daily jump</HEADLINE>

      <P>The price of Master Kong Taiwan Depository Receipts (TDRs) fell Thursday on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange after surging to its 7 percent daily limit at the opening
of trading, a worse-than-expected performance on the second day of the public
offering.</P>
      <P>The price of the famous instant noodle maker's TDRs opened at NT$51.5 (US$1.59)
at the opening of trading, but soon dropped to NT$50.3 and hovered around that
level before closing at NT$50.1 amid heavy selling on a large handover volume of
109,032 shares -- breaking widespread  speculation  among many investors about a
"honeymoon effect" that the shares would see a 7 precent jump in price at least
for three days in a row.</P>
      <P>This is a sign that market confidence in the release of the Master Kong TDRs is
not that strong as had been widely speculated, analysts said, adding that their
performance -- good or bad -- will have an effect on the local bourse.</P>
      <P>The share rallied to its daily limit at NT$48.15 shortly after the opening on
its debut the previous day on the local bourse.</P>
      <P>Wei Ing-chou, chairman of Tingyi Holding Corporation, which owns the Master Kong
brand, had predicted recently that Master Kong shares would reach the daily
ceiling at least three times.</P>
      <P>Master Kong made Forbes Asia's Fabulous 50 Companies list in 2009, with a total
market value of NT$416.82 billion.</P>
      <P>The TDR listing was the biggest ever launched in the country by a Taiwan-
invested company returning from overseas, and it raised some NT$17 billion by
floating  about 380 million TDRs through  a premium-priced strategy on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange Dec. 2-7.</P>
      <P>Tingyi is the largest food and beverage maker in terms of market value in China.
Ting Hsin International Group is the biggest shareholder in Tingyi and is
controlled by Wei and his three younger brothers.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation announced Thursday that the Cabinet-level Department
of Health (DOH) and Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), along with the Civil

accused of failing to keep the interest rates of debit cards and credit cards
within reasonable levels, in addition to being incapable of protecting the

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Study without thinking is labor lost. Thinking

theories -- that is very injurious indeed. Shall I teach you what is
understanding? To know what it is that you know, and to know what it is that you
do not know -- that is understanding."</TEXT>

      <P>A ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislator said Thursday at a legislative committee
meeting that the government should use metaphors to teach the public about the
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Hung-chi, signing the proposed trade pact with China is like
wearing spiked racing shoes to enhance Taiwan's competitiveness, while forcing
Taiwanese companies to compete with other countries on a non-level playing field
is like wearing iron shoes.</P>
      <P>Lin said he had been told by some labor leaders that briefings held by the
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) about the ECFA were not very helpful and that
they still do not understand what it is.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan may take 20 years to complete its talks with China on a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), an economist said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a bid to forge closer cross-Taiwan Strait economic and trade relations to
sharpen its competitive edge, Taiwan is poised to sign the ECFA early next year.</P>
      <P>"Given the great differences among the public with regard to ties with China, it
might take 20 years or so for Taiwan to complete ECFA issues other than the
items to be included on an `early harvest list, '" said Chu Yun-peng, a former
minister without portfolio and one of the main economic advisers to President Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Chu, now an economics professor at National Central University, said at a Taipei
seminar on the global financial crisis and cooperation between Taiwan and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that the ECFA is not a panacea
but rather a possible solution for Taiwan in the face of the formation of
regional trade groupings from which Taiwan is excluded.</P>
      <P>He added that the countries in the region and the rest of the world have been
aggressively signing free trade agreements (FTAs) , which are having a negative
impact on Taiwan, especially in terms of its trade competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Although it is now too late for Taiwan to seek an FTA with ASEAN, it still could
pursue bilateral economic cooperation and tariff reduction arrangements with
ASEAN countries through negotiations, Chu said, adding that "China's influence
will be crucial to Taiwan's attempts to forge closer economic ties with ASEAN."</P>
      <P>Chu, who has been dubbed the "pusher" of the ECFA idea, said that since public
support for the pact is still low, it poses a rigorous challenge for the
government.</P>
      <P>He said that an ECFA is not tantamount to an FTA with China but is rather a
framework agreement with most of its contents needing to be added step-by-step
through negotiations.</P>
      <P>An ECFA can only serve to help eliminate Taiwan's competitive disadvantages,
while the nation has to create "a new blue sea" by creating brands and
possessing advanced technologies, Chu said.</P>

      <P>A series of public opinion polls has found that more than half of the
respondents do not want to see street protests against high-level cross-Taiwan
Strait talks slated to take place Dec. 21-25 in the central Taiwan city of
Taichung. Even a survey conducted by the opposition DPP, which is planning to
stage the protests, found that only 48.5 percent support the plan.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of local media reports on the latest developments
related to the polls on cross-strait talks:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Fifty-three  percent  of  the  Taiwan  people  oppose  the pro-independence
opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) intention to stage massive
protest rallies against the upcoming meeting between the top negotiators from
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>The latest poll conducted by the daily found that 71 percent of the respondents
are aware of the Dec. 21-25 meeting between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Thirty-nine percent of the respondents said they are in favor of the meeting, 49
percent said the current pace of cross-strait engagement is "just right, " while
53 percent said they disagree with the DPP's plans to boycott the meeting.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 50 percent of the respondents do not consider it as
"selling out" Taiwan if the country chooses to sign an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, while a high of 76 percent hope President
Ma Ying-jeou will debate with DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen over the ECFA plan.
(Dec. 18, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The holding of the fourth round of high-level cross-strait talks in central
Taiwan has triggered a new standoff between the DPP and the Kuomintang
government, with the Ministry of the Interior stepping up security measures to
prevent any incidents from occurring and the DPP threatening a massive "siege"
against Beijing's proxy and his delegation.</P>
      <P>A DPP poll has found that nearly 50 percent of the Taiwan people support  the
planned protests  and demonstrations  against the forthcoming Chiang-Chen
meeting, while over 60 percent oppose the government's plans to compromise the
people's freedom of assembly in the name of assuring Chen's personal security
during the visit. (Dec. 18, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top China policy planner, the Mainland Affairs Council, has claimed
that over half of the Taiwan people have endorsed all of the four agreements
expected to be signed during the imminent Chiang-Chen meeting.</P>
      <P>Poll figures, however, are telling the truth that the people's support for
systematic cross-strait negotiations has waned, from over 70 percent in the past
to lower than 60 percent now. (Dec. 18, 2009)</P>

      <P>A number of Taiwanese delegations attending the Copenhagen conference on climate

from over 110 countries and in consideration of the limited accommodation at the
Bella Center, the conference venue, it could allow only 300 NGO members to
attend that day's conference.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese schoolchildren's English ability is second-best in non-English-
speaking Asian nations, but older students lag behind other countries in the
region, according to the results of recent international examinations.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on Taiwanese students'
English proficiency:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Benjamin Wang, president of the Taiwan branch of the U.S. Educational Testing
Service (ETS), attributed the problem Thursday to the fact that Taiwan's English
education at senior high and vocational schools attaches no importance to the
field of teaching or guiding students on how to use the language in daily life.</P>
      <P>Even though English proficiency among children in the 7-12 age group ranked 2nd
among non-English-speaking Asian nations, the poor performance of technical and
vocational school students in the Test of English for International
Communication (TOEIC) played a leading role in pulling down the overall average
TOEIC score of Taiwanese students, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>A manager at the Taiwan branch of Cambridge ESOL -- another major English
proficiency test -- said the overall performance of Taiwanese children in the
7-12 age group in the ESOL test was almost at the average global level, but she
agreed that they lost their edge when they entered more advanced levels. (Dec.
18, 2009)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Wang Su-wei, a manager at the Cambridge ESOL Taiwan branch, said she has found
that Taiwanese students cannot use English well in daily life and treat the
language as only a tool for school tests.</P>
      <P>Since the ESOL tests focus on overall English proficiency in listening,
speaking, reading and writing, they appear difficult for local students at
higher grades, who are simply taught to recite vocabulary and study grammar when
learning English, Wang said. (Dec. 18, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Professor Chen Chao-ming of the Department of English at National Chengchi
University said Taiwanese college students do not read enough English and warned
that if the problem is not addressed, Taiwanese students' English skills will
lag further and further behind those of other Asian countries such as South
Korea. (Dec. 18, 2009)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) unveiled the results of a public opinion
survey Friday showing that nearly 60 percent of the respondents support
systematic consultations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The results show that 59.5 percent of those polled support such talks, while
18.7 percent do not.</P>
      <P>The results also show that over half of the respondents support the four
agreements expected to be signed Dec. 22 in Taichung, central Taiwan by Chiang
Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation and his Chinese
counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Association of Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results,  65.3 percent support an agreement  on
industrial  product  standards,  inspection  and certification,  while  61.3
percent  believe  an agreement  on agricultural  quarantine inspections will
help safeguard public health.</P>
      <P>Fifty-six percent support both sides reaching an agreement on the avoidance of
double taxation, while 50.2 percent support a fishing crew cooperation
agreement.</P>
      <P>Asked about their views on cross-strait trade relations, 31.7 percent said they
"should be further strengthened." This compared with 25.7 percent who said the
pace was "just fine, " and 27.3 percent who said trade relations are "too
close."</P>
      <P>The Dec. 11-13 survey, conducted by the Election Study Center of National
Chengchi University and commissioned by the MAC -- targeted people over the age
of 20, collecting 1,092 effective samples with a margin of error of 2.97
percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China cuts in to oppose Taiwan's UNFCCC bid</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A marathon meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) Conference was held in the Danish capital Thursday, during which many
of Taiwan's diplomatic allies spoke in support of Taiwan's inclusion in the
group until a Chinese delegate cut in to oppose the bid.</P>
      <P>Unlike the heads of states or ministers of Republic of China allies who took the
meeting's podium to voice their support for Taiwan's inclusion in the global
response to climate change, the Chinese official merely signaled his opposition
from his seat in the audience.</P>
      <P>Citing Beijing's "one China principle" as the reason for his opposition, he said
those nations' initiatives in favor of Taiwan's bid to join the UNFCCC as an
observer have "hurt the feelings of the 1.3 billion Chinese people."</P>
      <P>Altogether, nine of Taiwan's diplomatic allies had voiced support for Taiwan's
UNFCCC bid over the past two days in Copenhagen -- Palau, St. Lucia, Kiribati,
Burkina Faso, Swaziland, Sao Tome and Principe, Saint Christopher and Nevis and
The Gambia, as well as Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>Gambian Vice President Isatou Njie-Saidy  spoke to support Taiwan's cause. She
cited Taiwan's admission into the World Health Assembly -- the decision-making
body of the World Health Organization (WHO) -- as an observer in May this year
as an "acceptable precedence, of course applicable to other international fora,
in this case the UNFCCC, with climate change affecting no doubt all members of
the international community and humans everywhere."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan as a member of the global family therefore should be part of all United
Nations-related mechanisms, for the sake of justice and fairness," she added.</P>
      <P>Soon after Njie-Saidy's speech, the Chinese official was allowed by the
meeting's chair to make a brief statement from his seat.</P>
      <P>Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Samuel Santos Lopez followed the Chinese official's
statement to express Nicaragua's support for Taiwan's UNFCCC bid.</P>
      <P>The meeting had proceeded until nearly 3 a.m. Friday as of press time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has called on the UNFCCC to consider the need for the country to
participate in climate change discussions as it is especially  vulnerable  to
extreme  weather conditions,  rising temperatures, unpredictable storms and loss
of biodiversity.</P>

      <P>Israel's top representative to Taiwan signed an agreement with Taiwan Friday
that will prevent double taxation, deter tax evasion, and ensure that taxpayers
in both countries will be treated equally.</P>
      <P>Raphael Gamzou, representative of the Israeli Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei (ISECO) , Israel's de facto embassy in Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic relations, said he will bring the treaty to have it signed by Terry
G.C.  Ting,  Taiwan's top representative to Israel, next week, before it takes
effect Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has signed similar agreements with 16 other countries, including
Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Describing the agreement as a milestone in bilateral economic relations between
Taiwan and Israel, Gamzou said it will serve as an incentive to entrepreneurs of
Taiwan and Israel and will encourage the business communities in both countries
to be more willing to enter into partnerships with the other side.</P>
      <P>"I think it is a good finale for 2009, which was not the best economic year, but
this is definitely a good sign for the future year and years to come," Israel's
top envoy to Taiwan said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said at the signing ceremony that both sides
worked very hard to push through the treaty since beginning negotiations in 2006
and that the agreement will further strengthen the already close economic
relations and cooperation mechanisms between Taipei and Tel Aviv.</P>
      <P>"The agreement  will help systematize,  simplify and bring transparency to
bilateral taxation affairs and business exchanges, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Israel inked an agreement on mutual assistance and cooperation in
customs affairs in June this year and a bilateral temporary admission carnet in
2003, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, bilateral trade between
Taiwan and Israel reached US$1.18 billion in 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After six years of field investigation, the first map of Taiwan's vegetation --
nearly 60 percent of which is forest -- was published Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the Council of Agriculture's Forestry Bureau, it can
be used as a "treasure map" to learn the distribution of plant species in the
country and expand conservation areas if necessary.</P>
      <P>The first national vegetation resources inventory project, which began in 2003,
involved hundreds of people who climbed hundreds of mountains on the island, the
officials said. A total of 1.62 million hectares was mapped, with more than
670,000 hectares, or about 41 percent, designated as conservation areas, the
Forestry Bureau said.</P>
      <P>The map, which will be sold at price of NT$1,200 (US$37), can serve as a
reference guide for ecological conservation and national land planning,
according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>"Just like a treasure map, it can tell us what kinds of plant communities we
have and exactly where they are so that we can plan conservation," said Lee Tao-
sheng, deputy director-general of the Forestry Bureau.</P>
      <P>Up to 67 percent of the native vascular plant species in Taiwan was recorded,
and 59 percent of the total area of Taiwan was mapped in the project, according
to Hsieh Chang-fu, president of the Taiwan Society of Biodiversity Conservation
who headed the project.</P>
      <P>One of the most noteworthy findings in the field studies was the discovery of a
new habitat of the Taiwan Beech, a rare and valuable endemic plant species,  in
the mountains  of Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan, said Hsieh.</P>
      <P>The new beech forest, covering about 35 hectares, was found at the lowest
altitude ever for the species, in the Daibai Mountain and Lankan Mountain areas,
he added.</P>
      <P>Beech forests are mostly found in Europe and the temperate areas of North
America, so it was surprising to discover a new growth in subtropical Taiwan,
Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>Fifty-six exiled Tibetans have been staging a hunger strike outside the central
government building in Taipei for more than two days as their visas will expire
at the end of this year. Several of them have become so weak they have been
taken to hospital.</P>
      <P>Some legislators are planning to come up with a proposal demanding that the
National Immigration Agency extend their visas for one more year. They have also
promised to legislate a refugee act to address relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan has signed into law the U.N.-sponsored International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, it should be a matter of course that political
refugees are legally allowed to remain on Taiwanese territory.</P>
      <P>None of the Tibetans have criminal records in Taiwan and they have no other
place to go. If Taiwan expels them, they will become stateless "human balls."
Fearing China's possible strong opposition, few countries would be willing to
shelter them.</P>
      <P>Since they are already in Taiwan, we hope lawmakers and the NIA will find or
create a legal basis for them to rebuild their lives and careers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As China has also signed the U.N. human rights covenant, the government  need
not consider a possible China backlash while grappling with the Tibetan exiles'
visa issue. Human rights know no borders. The government should not let the
Tibetans become displaced outcasts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said recent cases of pregnant women losing their
babies after being immunized against the influenza (H1N1) virus were unrelated
to getting the vaccine, and it urged pregnant women not to fear getting a flu
shot.</P>
      <P>Liu Ting-ping, who is in charge of the immunization program at the DOH's Centers
for Disease Control, said hospitals have notified her agency of five complaints
from pregnant women after receiving an H1N1 flu shot.</P>
      <P>Two cases involved stillborn babies, two involved miscarriages, and one woman
was simply unhappy at getting an H1N1 shot before learning she was pregnant.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Chang Shan-chwen said that in two of the cases reported in
the media, an older woman's baby was stillborn because of an abnormal placeta,
and one of the miscarriages was caused by the umbilical chord encircling the
fetus.</P>
      <P>After studying the two cases, a group of physicians who serve as advisers to the
DOH found that neither incident was caused by the new vaccine, Chang said, and
he insisted that based on results to date, the immunization program is safe for
pregnant women.</P>
      <P>"More than 13,000 pregnant women have been immunized. The ratio of miscarriages
is lower than for pregnant women who have not taken the shots, and the ratio of
stillborn babies is the same for the two groups," he said.</P>
      <P>The DOH will continue to monitor the effect of H1N1 vaccines on pregnant women
and their babies, he added.</P>
      <P>The CDC's Liu said her agency has received 22 applications for redress from
people who suffered problems after receiving H1N1 shots. Among them, one was
filed by one of five pregnant women reported to the CDC, but her case is still
being reviewed.</P>
      <P>Of the other 21 applications, three have been screened by a team of medical
experts, which found that their conditions had "nothing to do with the new
vaccines," according to the DOH's Chang.</P>
      <P>The three cases involved an 82-year-old man who died because of acute
cerebrovascular disease or a heart attack; a 19-month-old infant whose right
eyelid droop was caused by a disease in the immune system; and a senior high
school student who became numb on the left side of her body after taking the
shot but whose neural functions were found to be normal.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that the family members who were not satisfied by the panel's judgment
could take legal action to have a forensic examination to help determine the
exact cause of death.</P>

      <P>"Without you, without revival efforts, Taiwan's film industry will be reduced to
doing OEM work for the movie industry on the Chinese mainland, " Taiwanese
director Leon Dai told the government Thursday in Taipei, during a discussion
with a Hollywood director on the limited resources in the local film industry.</P>
      <P>The two directors, Dai and John Woo, were invited to discuss film industry
issues at a forum attended by government officials, film industry specialists
and the media, as part of the program of the 53rd Asian-Pacific Film Festival
from Dec. 17-19.</P>
      <P>Dai is seen an emerging talent in Taiwan's movie industry, while Woo is an
acclaimed Hong Kong director known for his highly choreographed action films in
the 1980s and his success in Hollywood in the past decade.</P>
      <P>At the forum, Woo praised Dai's Golden Horse Award winner "No Pudeo Visir Sin
Ti, " saying that with better commercial packaging it could have done even
better at the box office.</P>
      <P>In response, Dai said, with open frustration, that the production crew did the
best it could, with a budget of NT$4 million, to package the film.</P>
      <P>"You cannot expect a film with such a small budget to achieve a box office
record of NT$100 million," said Dai.</P>
      <P>The gap between Hollywood productions and those of most Taiwanese directors is
like the difference between a posh restaurant and a roadside food stand, Dai
said, adding that like many Taiwanese directors he must start with the food
stand.</P>
      <P>Dai lamented that because the traditional Chinese concept of theater is merely
one of entertainment, he is doubtful that the country's leaders would make the
film industry a key incentive sector.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to give adequate support to Taiwan's movie industry to
help it avoid the fate of becoming an OEM for China, as is already the case with
some traditional manufacturing industries.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government put similar efforts into reviving the movie
industry, as it has done for the electronics sector, by providing incentives.</P>
      <P>In response, Frank Chen, director of the Government Information Office's (GIO's)
Department of Motion Pictures, said that the GIO has mapped out a five-year
development plan to provide more incentives to film producers and that a market
research institute is being planned.</P>
      <P>Citing market research and his experience in the international market, Woo
suggested that Taiwan producers try films of various genres.</P>
      <P>"If you want to explore the international market, you must be able to find the
movie language recognized by audiences of different regions and cultures," he
said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan film industry was greatly encouraged last year by the success of the
local production "Cape No. 7, " which achieved a box office record of NT$350
million in the domestic market that is generally dominated by Hollywood movies.</P>
      <P>On the heels of that success, Dai impressed audiences and the jury of the Golden
Horse Film Festival in November with a film based on a true story about an
impoverished single father's struggle to retain guardianship of his young
daughter.</P>
      <P>"No Pudeo Visir Sin Ti, " a NT$4 million production, won four Golden Horse
Awards -- best feature film, best director, best original screenplay and most
outstanding Taiwanese film of the year.</P>
      <P>However, while the awards may help propel his movie career, Dai said, they do
not guarantee financial support for his future projects and he still needs to
find capital from investors at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>"Creativity is one of Taiwan's advantages in the development of its film
industry," he said, adding that he expects the government to provide more
support to the local film industry to create an original Taiwanese cultural
brand.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top academic institute Academia Sinica will this year honor a record
number of nine graduates from its prestigious Taiwan International Graduate
Program (TIGP), according to a press statement released Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu Chao-han, vice president of Academia Sinica and director of the TIGP, was
quoted as saying that he was delighted by the success of this year's graduates,
many of whom have taken up positions in leading international institutions such
as the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University and the Department
of Chemistry at the University of Ottawa in Canada. Others will continue their
research as post-doctoral fellows at Academia Sinica, he added.</P>
      <P>A total of 45 papers were published by this year's graduating TIGP students in
prestigious journals that included PNAS, BMC Bioinformatics, Nucleic Acids
Research, BioTechniques, Cell, Journal of Applied Physics, and the Journal of
the American Chemical Society, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Launched in 2002 through collaboration between Academia Sinica and Taiwan's top
research universities, the TIGP program is touted as integrating the first-class
facilities and top-notch faculty at Academia Sinica into a learning environment
where English is the first language.</P>
      <P>According to the institute, currently there are 307 students enrolled in nine
PhD programs in the TIPG and approximately half of the students are from abroad.</P>
      <P>One of this year's graduates Ho Cheng-hsun, who recently published a research
paper on nitrate sensors in plants in the academic journal Cell, said that the
key advantage of the TIGP is its diverse student body.</P>
      <P>"The multinational background of the students in TIGP encouraged me to become
more competitive on the global stage," Ho was quoted as saying in the press
statement.</P>
      <P>Another TIGP graduate Su Chia-yu, who has accepted a position as an assistant
professor at Taipei Medical University, also praised TIGP's international
learning environment, saying that to be eligible for graduation, students must
have their papers published in top international journals.</P>
      <P>This requirement, she stressed, inspired her to search for research topics that
"matter most in the world of science." The certificate award ceremony will be
held in Taipei Dec. 22.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan improving relations with Indonesia</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta, Dec. 18 (CNA)
12/18/09  18:00:52</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is fast improving relations with Indonesia after an eight-year lag that
resulted from the loss of trust between Jakarta and Taipei due mainly to former
President Chen Shui-bian's ill-advised diplomatic sally.</P>
      <P>That trust is being restored, said Taiwan's top representative to Indonesia
Andrew Hsia, who assumed his post as head of Taiwan's Economic and Trade Office
in Jakarta, Indonesia two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Indonesia were on course before Taiwan's former
President Chen Shui-bian began adopting "checkbook diplomacy," in which he tried
to expand Taiwan's diplomatic activities and overseas visits.</P>
      <P>Chen's stopover in the Indonesian island of Batam under the pretext of making
his journey more "comfortable" on his way back from his Latin American tour in
2006 was actually politically motivated and had shattered any trust Jakarta had
ever had in Taipei.</P>
      <P>With the change of government in Taiwan in 2008, relations between the two sides
began to change, Hsia told the Central News Agency in an interview.</P>
      <P>Since taking up his new post, Hsia has met with Indonesian lawmakers and top
government officials for talks on how to promote cultural, educational and
economic exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"We have so much to talk about after that long delay," said Hsia, who had
previously served as deputy foreign minister.</P>
      <P>Hsia succeeded Timothy C. T. Yang, who was recalled to Taipei as foreign
minister a little more than a month ago due to a Cabinet reshuffle that occurred
in the wake of Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>Indonesia is one of Taiwan most important trade partners.</P>
      <P>In the first three quarters of this year, trade between the two nations totaled
US$3.95 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's aggregate investments in Indonesia as of the end of September had hit
US$13.94 billion, its third highest after China and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>"Our foreign direct investment is expected to create at least one million jobs
for Indonesians," Hsia said Sunday, speaking in Bali at a conference of Taiwan
chambers of commerce in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The conference was held to help the Taiwanese business community learn more
about investment potential in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Indonesia needs investment in agriculture,  aquaculture and IT (information
technology) industries to expedite economic growth and employment, according to
Hsia.</P>
      <P>"We are helping Indonesia to attract our entrepreneurs," Hsia added.</P>
      <P>One of them is Taiwan's CPC petroleum company, which is interested in producing
biofuel in Indonesia, Hsia said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, cultural and educational exchanges are also being promoted. For one
thing, Hsia has helped Radio Taiwan International and the Central News Agency
sign memorandums of understanding on news exchanges with Indonesia's Antara News
Agency.</P>
      <P>RTI has a Bahasa Indonesian service for more than 130,000 Indonesian migrant
workers in Taiwan. Antara and the CNA will organize photo exhibitions in each
other's country as a starter for closer partnership.</P>
      <P>"I've received three university presidents from Taiwan, and all of them look
forward to student and faculty exchanges with Indonesia," Hsia said.</P>
      <P>As the largest member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, with a
population of over 200 million, Indonesia must enhance its higher education to
train its people to be scientists, engineers, doctors and other professionals,
Hsia said.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that Taiwan can be of help to Indonesia in this field,
particularly in the training of personnel for medical service, Hsia said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has top-rate hospitals where more Indonesians may go to get treatment
that is unavailable here," Hsia said, adding that the hospitals offer better and
cheaper treatment than their counterparts in advanced countries in Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's medical service could also greatly boost tourist arrivals from
Indonesia, according to Hsia. Hsia's office is Taiwan's busiest consular office
abroad. It has a dozen consular officers to handle visa applications from
migrant workers from Indonesia. Staff at the office have to take care of the
workers as well as an influx of tourists from Taiwan, who keep the China
Airlines and EVA Airway as well as Garuda airline of Indonesia busy year round.</P>
      <P>All of this will strengthen Taiwan's relations with Indonesia, according to
Hsia, who added that Indonesia will play a major role in the emerging free trade
zone in Asia, known popularly as Ten-plus-One.</P>
      <P>The grouping is made up of the 10 ASEAN members and the People's Republic of
China. The new Asian trade bloc comes into being on January 1.</P>
      <P>One thing that surprised Hsia most was the popularity in Indonesia of Taiwan's
Tzu Chi Foundation. The Buddhist organization made great contributions to the
relief of victims of last year's tsunami, which killed thousands of people in
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>"Indonesians know that and are ever thankful," Hsia said, "but I was truly
surprised to find the Da Ai Drama, offered by Da Ai TV, winning an increasingly
large number of fans in Indonesia."</P>
      <P>Da Ai, which means Great Love, is operated by the Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>One of the fans is the wife of a deputy minister Hsia met last week.</P>
      <P>"She told me she loves the TV series for they are true stories of moving love
and friendship," he said, noting that they are not cheap soap opera churned out
by commercial TV networks to boost their ratings for advertising income.</P>
      <P>The belief among Indonesian people that Taiwan is extending its friendship and
assistance to their country the way Tzu Chi is giving its help to the tsunami
victims, could make Hsia's challenging work in Jakarta a little easier. (By Joe

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that Taiwan's non-governmental  organizations
are still encountering obstacles  in their  efforts  to participate  in
international activities, due to Beijing's interference.</P>
      <P>"There are still incidents of Beijing blocking Taiwan NGOs' representation in
the international community, " Ma said during a year-end meeting with heads and
executives of the five branches of government over tea.</P>
      <P>"This is an issue that the government should strive harder to address," he said.</P>
      <P>He said his administration hopes China would turn away from that trend of
interference "to avoid giving the Taiwan people a bad impression of Chinese
authorities."</P>
      <P>The president's comment was seen as an oblique reference to a recent incident in
Copenhagen, in which a Chinese official cut in to signal opposition during
speeches by Taiwan's diplomatic allies in support of Taiwan's inclusion in the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as an observer.</P>
      <P>Ma said that his administration has made strenuous efforts to cut greenhouse gas
emissions and reduce energy consumption in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said it is still unclear whether the ongoing meeting of UNFCCC signatories in
Copenhagen will reach any operational agreements on climate change and carbon
emissions as previously expected.</P>
      <P>However, "Taiwan's resolve to further reduce its carbon footprint will not
change," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Ma said that
there have been great improvements over the past year, with the two sides having
signed nine agreements to improve the everyday lives of the people on both
sides.</P>
      <P>Four more accords are expected to be signed during the fourth round of high-
level cross-strait talks that will be held Dec. 21-23 in Taichung, central
Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>"I hope there will be further stabilization of cross-strait ties so that Taiwan
can have an environment in which we can gradually realize our ideals," the
president said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOI hopes more national pension insurance enrollees pay premiums</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to encourage more individuals eligible for the government-run
national pension insurance program to pay premiums so that they can have some
financial security when they get older, the vice interior minister said Friday.</P>
      <P>A total of 4.1 million people are eligible for the program, a social insurance
system covering individuals in the 25-65 age group who are not enrolled in
national labor insurance systems for public servants, military personnel,
teachers, workers and farmers.</P>
      <P>Although all of those eligible are forcibly enrolled in the program, they are
free to decide whether or not they want to pay the premium that entitles them to
receive a monthly pension after they are 65 years old.</P>
      <P>At present, 60 percent of those eligible paid their premiums in 2009 -- a ratio
similar to that seen in Japan and South Korea -- but the government hopes to
push the ratio higher, said Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang at a
conference held by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to review the pension
insurance system.</P>
      <P>Chien said more than 1 million people had already benefited from the program
since it was put into practice on Oct. 1, 2008, with a total of NT$37.9 billion
(US$1.17 billion) being disbursed to the insured.</P>
      <P>Around 870,000 of the beneficiaries are senior citizens who were receiving
senior citizen pensions  under a program  that was incorporated into the
national pension insurance scheme.</P>
      <P>Chan Hou-sheng, a professor in National Taiwan University's Department of Social
Work, warned that because most of those under 65 enrolled in the program are
economically disadvantaged, the scheme could turn into a "social relief" program
if the government fails to increase the number of those eligible who actually
pay for the insurance.</P>
      <P>At present, the monthly premium for pension insurance costs NT$1,123, with 60
percent of the total, or NT$674, to be paid by the insured and the remaining 40
percent to be picked up by the government.</P>
      <P>The government's portion of the bill rises by varying degrees if the insured are
physically or mentally challenged or live in poverty.</P>
      <P>Chan cautioned that the government's financial burden will grow as more people
turn 65 and become eligible to receive monthly stipends, and he suggested that
measures be taken to adjust the system by reviewing and collecting data on all
of the other existing pension systems in the country.</P>

      <P>However, Taiwan's efforts in technological research and patent applications have

      <P>Take the biotechnology industry. Taiwanese scientists have often managed to have

Taiwan has yet to secure a significant share of the multibillion global

      <P>In the face of this "fault line, " the government should figure out how to
integrate scientific and technological research and industrial development.</P>
      <P>The best approach would be to pick a person well versed in scientific and

      <P>A second round of test runs will be held from Jan. 22 to Feb. 28, with free
tickets offered to tourists staying in hotels in the southern port city, Ou

      <P>The Taichung City government said Friday that a main road leading to the hotel
where talks between Taiwan and China are to be held next week will not be sealed
off, despite planned protests by the opposition.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China's chief negotiators -- Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin -- will meet Dec. 22 at
the Windsor Hotel Taichung to sign agreements on fishing crew cooperation,
agricultural quarantine inspection,  industrial  product  standards,  inspection
and certification, and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has planned a series of
protests right before Chen's arrival and during his stay in the central city,
including a march and rally Dec. 20 on Jhonggang Road, where the Windsor Hotel
is located.</P>
      <P>The DPP has accused President Ma Ying-jeou's administration of attempting to
formulate under-the-table  deals with Beijing by promoting the signing of an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between the two sides and will
protest the proposed ECFA even though it is not formally on the agenda of this
round of talks.</P>
      <P>Various demonstrations will also be held on Dec. 21-23 near the hotel.</P>
      <P>Worried that the protests could disrupt traffic on the busy road, Taichung
Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi visited Chen Ta-chun, chairman of the DPP's Taichung
branch office, to negotiate a solution.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said in light of the fact that Jhonggang Road is one of the city's most
important arteries, the city government is not going to seal it off unless
necessary.</P>
      <P>He urged the DPP to help respect the flow of traffic so as not to affect the
rights of other road users.</P>
      <P>Chen, meanwhile, promised that the protests will be conducted in a peaceful
manner and will not hamper traffic.</P>
      <P>He asked, however, that law-enforcement authorities not overreact to the
protests, warning that improper security measures by police could provoke

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Friday that although a senior U.S.
Trade official visited Taiwan last week to discuss various economic and trade
issues, it is difficult to say whether bilateral trade talks will resume in
January on the basis of the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA).</P>
      <P>Tim Stratford, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for China Affairs at the
Office of the United States Trade Representative, met last week with MOEA Vice
Minister Liang Kuo- hsin to discuss issues related to the possibility of signing
a bilateral investment agreement and amending the regulations on U.S. beef
imports, an MOEA official said.</P>
      <P>Because the U.S. is concerned about the position being taken by the Legislative
Yuan on U.S. beef imports, it is difficult to say whether U.S.-Taiwan trade
talks would reopen in January, the official said.</P>
      <P>The representative group, led by Stratford who is responsible for developing and
implementing U.S. trade policy toward China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and
Mongolia, also discussed with Taiwan officials matters such as rice imports,
pesticide residues, and standards for fire-proof construction materials,
according to the official.</P>
      <P>The U.S. hopes Taiwan would follow international standards on building material
imports, not just Japanese standards, as sometimes U.S. building materials are
rejected under the Japanese standard, the</P>
      <P>MOEA official said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. may seek to resolve that issue with Taiwan within the framework of the
World Trade Organization, the official added.</P>
      <P>Since the two countries suspended formal diplomatic ties in 1979, the TIFA
talks, agreed to in 1994, have provided a significant official channel for
Taiwan-U.S. dialogue on trade and economic issues. However, the talks, which are
usually hosted by either side on an annual basis, have been suspended since
2007.</P>
      <P>Harry Ho-jen Tseng, director general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
North American Affairs Department, told reporters Thursday that the visit by
officials of the U.S. trade representative office last week was meant to pave
the way for the next round of TIFA talks.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, a wide range of matters could be discussed in the next round
of talks, but agreements on bilateral investment and the avoidance of double
taxation are the most pressing matters for the two sides.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed the hope Friday  that  the present  atmosphere
of cross-Taiwan  Strait reconciliation  could be extended  to Taiwan's
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>As tensions with China have eased since his inauguration last year, Ma has
repeatedly called for mutual respect and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait
instead of engaging in vicious competition.</P>
      <P>That has not only helped Taiwan cement its relations with its 23 diplomatic
allies, the president said, but also enabled it to take part in the Agreement on
Government Procurement under the World Trade Organization and in the World
Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>In comparison, however, Taiwan's NGO activities around the world still encounter
Beijing's pressure and suppression, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"NGOs form a major area where both sides of the Taiwan Strait should show
respect and cooperation, " Ma said, expressing the hope that Beijing  would
stop suppressing  Taiwan's  NGOs so that cross-strait relations can further
develop peacefully.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on NGOs' international participation sponsored by the
Taipei County government, Ma lauded the performance of Taiwan's NGOs and asked
government agencies to make more resources available to help in their
development.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that organizations such as the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation and the Buddha's Light International Association have set up
footholds in foreign countries to provide international assistance.</P>
      <P>He also cited the Taiwan Democracy Foundation, which received an international
human rights award for the fourth consecutive year in Asia, and the Taiwan Fund
for Children and Families and World Vision Taiwan, which have sponsored over
280,000 children at home and abroad.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has grossed an additional NT$51.1 billion in tax revenues since the
introduction of an alternative minimum tax (AMT) in 2006, with NT$38.7 billion
coming from corporations and the rest from individuals.</P>
      <P>Most of the AMT revenues from individual taxpayers derive from income on stock
bonuses given to employees and capital gains from unlisted stock transactions,
an indication that the AMT system has to some extent helped make our income tax
system more equitable by "taxing the rich more."</P>
      <P>According to the 2007 tax data, 4,284 individuals paid the alternative minimum
tax. Among them, 343 had an annual net income of over NT$10 million and 828 had
an annual net income ranging between NT$5 million and NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>Starting next year, overseas income will also be subject to the alternative
minimum  tax,  and  the tax's  impact  on income redistribution will be even
more evident. At the very least, wealthy individuals will be discouraged from
transmitting assets abroad to evade tax payments.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the tax has been lauded as the previous Democratic
Progressive  Party administration's  most impressive achievement in tax reform.
It is also regarded as Taiwan's only "tax increase" in decades.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's approval rating has plunged to a new low following the
ruling Kuomintang's setback in the Dec. 5 local elections. We believe it would
help Ma regain voters' hearts and minds if he took a cue from the United States'
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) system to help the working poor.</P>
      <P>The EITC is a refundable income tax credit for low to moderate income working
individuals and families. In the U.S., the EITC was originally conceived to help
people offset social security taxes. When it exceeds the amount of taxes owed,
it results in a refund for the applicant.</P>
      <P>Over 93 percent of the respondents to a recent CommonWealth Magazine poll
described the growing rich-poor divide in Taiwan as a "serious" problem, the
most in the annual survey's history.</P>
      <P>If Ma heeds such a concern, he should promote an EITC-like system to deliver on
his campaign promise of creating an equitable tax system that will "tax the rich
to help the poor."</P>

      <P>There will be a "minor" Cabinet reshuffle sometime around Dec. 20, and two-term
mayors and magistrates who have performed well will be invited to join the
Cabinet when their tenures expire after that date, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Friday.</P>
      <P>However,  they will not necessarily be asked to serve as ministers, or ministers
without portfolio, but rather may be assigned to head state-owned enterprises,
Wu said in response to reporters' questions at the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>The reshuffle would be a minor one, as a new Cabinet was assembled just three
months ago, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Wu disclosed that Hsinchu's two-term mayor Lin Junq-tzer was
one of those being considered for a seat in the Cabinet. Lin has consistently
been at the top of the rankings in surveys on the performance of mayors and
magistrates in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle has been at the forefront of discussions
since the ruling  Kuomintang's  less-than-ideal performance in the just-
concluded local elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT managed to hold on to 12 of the 17 mayor and magistrate seats that were
up for grabs in the Dec. 5 local elections, but lost a significant seat in Yilan
County and saw its solid support base eroded in several localities.</P>
      <P>The last Cabinet reshuffle took place on Sep. 10 amid public criticism of the
government's response to the Typhoon Morakot disaster in August.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Cement Company, Taiwan's leading cement maker, is poised to become a
cement giant in southern China after formally acquiring the capacities held by
the Hong Kong-based Prosperity Minerals Holding Ltd., a corporate source said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Cement signed a memorandum of understanding on the proposed acquisition
deal with PMH in late November and the two firms struck a final agreement Friday
on the deal, said Edward Huang, senior vice president of Taiwan Cement.</P>
      <P>Under the deal -- signed by the PMH management and Taiwan Cement's Hong Kong
subsidiary, TCC International Holdings -- Taiwan Cement will buy out all of the
existing five kilns in China owned by Upper Value Investments, a PMH spin-off,
at a cost of HK$3.8 billion (around NT$16.634 billion), according to Huang.</P>
      <P>The acquisition meant that Taiwan Cement's capacities in China will increase by
16 million metric tons annually.</P>
      <P>This is set to boost the company's total cement producing capacity in China to
some 43 million tons, up from 27 million tons now.</P>
      <P>"It significantly helps us near the target laid by Chairman Leslie Koo that
Taiwan Cement's annual output should top 50 million," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The deal also echoed a recent remark made by Koo that the company will expand
its Chinese operation via collaboration with other enterprises, as the Chinese
government has banned the construction of new cement kilns.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator with Taiwan, proposed Friday in Beijing that
the issue of intellectual property rights (IPR) be included in the fifth round
of cross-Taiwan strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , said it is time to establish a sound system to protect IPR on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait amid increased two-way exchanges and that China
is very willing to list the issue in the fifth round of bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>Many brands from Taiwan, such as Want Want, Giant, President Chain Store and
BenQ, are already popular in China, but are just a fraction of the 62,925
Taiwan's trademarks officially registered in China as of September 2009 and they
need effective protection, he told the press.</P>
      <P>Famous brands of Taiwan's fine-quality farm produce, including tea, fruit, and
vegetables, are rampantly pirated in China.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that while a planned economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
will not be signed in the fourth cross-strait talks, he and his Taiwan
counterpart might discuss ECFA-related issues on Dec. 22.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the misgivings of some Taiwan businesses about the proposed pact,
Chen said Chinese authorities will do their best to address the matters of major
concern to Taiwan in a way that would benefit both sides.</P>
      <P>Chen is due to arrive Monday in Taichung City, central Taiwan, for the fourth
cross-strait talks with Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>According to Chen, scores of prominent Chinese entrepreneurs from a wide range
of sectors will accompany him to Taiwan and they will explore the possibility of
forming joint ventures with Taiwan companies and will try to gain a better
understanding of Taiwan's laws and regulations.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes more and more Chinese state and private companies will be
willing to make investments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During their meeting next week, Chen and Chiang are expected to sign four
agreements on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection,
industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of
double taxation.</P>

      <P>Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan visited Japan recently to meet with
Masanori Nishio, the mayor of Changhua's sister city Hakodate in Hokkaido, and
promote tourism in the central Taiwan county, a county official said Friday.</P>
      <P>During the meeting with Nishio, Cho promised to design Changhua tour packages
catering to tourists from Hokkaido to attract more Japanese visitors to the
county, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The magistrate particularly appealed to Hokkaido golfers who cannot play during
the northern island's harsh winters to visit the new course built in Changhua
County, which is open year round.</P>
      <P>Cho's visit drew considerable coverage from Japanese media, including the
Hakodate Shimbun, Hokkaido Shimbun, and local TV stations, the official said.</P>
      <P>Cho also visited Aeon LakeTown, Japan's largest eco-shopping center, which
opened in Saitama outside of Tokyo in October 2008. He was there to learn how
the shopping mall has been able to generate 80 billion Japanese yen (NT$28.72
billion) in sales and attract 45 million visitors over the past year.</P>
      <P>The magistrate attributed the mall's success to many factors, including
accessibility and an effective marketing strategy that targets customers in
various age groups and categories.</P>
      <P>The trip also gave Cho the idea of collaborating with the private sector to
promote the development of the county's logistics and tourism sectors under
build-operate-transfer, build-operate-own or other models to stimulate
consumption  and expand employment, according to the official.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy will bounce back to enjoy a growth rate of 4.45 percent in 2010
after weathering the anticipated recession of 2.57 percent this year, the Taiwan
Research Institute (TRI) predicted on Friday.</P>
      <P>TRI President Wu Tzai-yi attributed the next year's predicted growth to the
gradual global economic recovery that is expected to boost Taiwan's exports, as
well as the recovery in local consumer confidence as the country's economic
fundamentals regain momentum.</P>
      <P>The TRI forecast the quarterly economy in 2010 will grow by 8.48 percent in Q1,
5.53 percent in Q2, 3.59 percent in Q3, and 0.99 percent in Q4.</P>
      <P>The Q4 economy in 2009 is forecast to grow 6.76 percent, according to the TRI.</P>
      <P>Private consumption will increase 1.82 percent next year, ,thanks to the
recovery in the stock and labor markets, and private investment is expected to
increase by 7.56 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>Other economic research institutes have also predicted growth for Taiwan in
2010, with a growth rate of 4.66 percent forecast by the Chung-Hua Institution
for Economic Research, 4.57 percent by the Polaris Research Institute, and 4.21
percent by the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
forecast an economic growth of 4.39 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Taiwan University mathematics professor Lin Chien-fu
suggested the government bring an end to its interest rate lowering policy,
explaining that low interests have resulted in a drop in people's banking
interest incomes, frustrating private consumption.</P>
      <P>The decline has become a big challenge to the country's economic recovery, Lin

    <HEADLINE>Without ECFA, Taiwan could face more difficult situation: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy will face a more difficult situation if the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China is not signed, a Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade, argued
that the trade pact would prevent Taiwan from being marginalized in the region
after a free trade agreement between China and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries takes effect Jan. 1 and similar pacts
between ASEAN and other countries in the region are put in place by 2018.</P>
      <P>While the economic pact might affect certain industries, Huang said the overall
benefits of signing an ECFA with China outweigh its negatives, and he promised
that the government will continue to communicate  with the public and help
companies in vulnerable industries upgrade or transform their operations.</P>
      <P>"A lot of decisions need to be made through compromise by many parties. The
government will go on with ECFA talks and report regularly to the legislature
without sacrificing the interests of certain groups, " pledged Huang, who serves
as the MOEA's contact with China's Ministry of Commerce.</P>
      <P>Huang was speaking at a public hearing on ECFA's impact on Taiwan held Friday by
Democratic Progressive Party legislator Pan Men-an and attended  by  government
officials,  scholars  and  business representatives.</P>
      <P>Woo Rhung-jieh, a professor in National Taiwan University's Department of
Agricultural Economics, said that based on trade theory, Taiwan's workers will
suffer the most if the trade pact is signed because trade liberalization usually
leads to a narrowing in price and wage differences between the trade partners.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wage rates would therefore fall if a deal with China were signed, Woo
contended.</P>
      <P>Lee Chung-hang, executive director of the Pingtung Agricultural Development
Association, contended that farmers already believe that Taiwan's agricultural
sector would suffer a blow if the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>He accused the government of not clearly explaining to farmers what the trade
deal's impact would be, at what level "stop-loss" points would be set, and the
direction of future agricultural policies.</P>
      <P>Defending the potential deal, Chang Su-san, head of the Council of Agriculture's
International Affairs Department, reiterated the government's pledge that the
830 agricultural products that cannot be imported from China at present would
continue to be barred under the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Also, aside from establishing an information channel on animal and plant
diseases, Taiwan and China could discuss how to label agricultural products to
avoid infringements of the intellectual property rights of Taiwan's agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>Wang Liang,  director-general of the Ministry of Finance's Department of Customs
Administration, said that after the ECFA is signed,  the government could
introduce anti-dumping  or other defensive measures to protect products made in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been pushing for the signing of ECFA, which is aimed at expanding
economic and trade cooperation and removing barriers.</P>
      <P>Critics have said the deal will allow China to flood Taiwan with cheaper
products and threaten Taiwanese businesses, putting many people out of work.</P>
      <P>Proponents of the agreement, including President Ma Ying-jeou, have insisted  it
is necessary  to help Taiwan maintain  its competitiveness in the region.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) will open
their fourth round of talks in Taichung Monday, a day after the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) launches a large-scale protest.</P>
      <P>Led by Taiwan's chief negotiator SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart, ARATS President Chen Yunlin, the negotiations are expected to
result in agreements on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine
inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the
avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations designated by the
governments of Taiwan and China, respectively, to handle cross-strait dealings
in the absence of official contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The three-day meeting, from Dec. 21-23, represents the fourth round of the
biannual talks over the past two years since the two organizations resumed
discussions in June 2008 after a 13-year hiatus, ending years of tension.</P>
      <P>In a press briefing on Thursday, SEF Chairman Chiang said that the nine
agreements reached during the past three rounds have benefited Taiwanese
businesses by helping them reduce their operating expenses and improving
efficiency.</P>
      <P>He suggested that a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ,
which aims to normalize trade between the two countries and eventually lead to
the reduction of tariff barriers, will be on the agenda of the next round of
talks, which will be held in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition DPP and more than 10 civil groups are expected to hold
a major protest against the ECFA, even though it is not on the agenda of this
round of talks.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, secretary-general of the Taiwan Society, one of the civil groups
to participate in the Sunday protest, said his group was against the lack of
transparency in the ECFA negotiations and advocated holding a referendum on the
proposed trade pact before the start of the negotiation process.</P>
      <P>Other smaller scale protests are expected to be held throughout Chen's stay in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang as host of this round of talks, called on the protesters to be peaceful,
rational and law-abiding.</P>
      <P>The DPP hopes to mobilize 100,000 demonstrators for Sunday's rally, while the
Ministry of the Interior plans to mobilize 200 police officers to patrol the
negotiating venue in Taichung and a total of 1,000 to share the task of
providing security for Chen when he travels outside the venue, according to
Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah.</P>

      <P>The head of Taiwan's government agency tasked with handling China affairs
expressed hope Friday that consensus can be reached in Taiwanese society over
controversial issues arising ahead of Taiwan and China's new round of talks next
week.</P>
      <P>As the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is planning rallies against
China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin, Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said Friday that the government highly respects freedom
of speech expressed in a legitimate manner.</P>
      <P>Previous similar round of talks in Taipei sparked fierce protests from the DPP
and pro-independence activists who accused the government headed by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) party of leaning toward China.</P>
      <P>Lai urged all sectors  within  Taiwan  to rationally  and realistically look at
the negotiations between Taiwan and China, while calling for people to back the
government's efforts.</P>
      <P>She said she hopes that the new round of Taiwan-China talks to be held in
Central Taiwan's Taichung City from Dec. 21-23 could be a new starting point for
reaching consensus at home.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China used to be long-time political rivals, but they resumed talks
aimed at strengthening the two sides' economic cooperation after Taiwan's
President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May last year.</P>
      <P>Representatives from Taiwan and China in the coming Taichung talks will sign
agreements on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection,
industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of
double taxation.</P>
      <P>Opponents however will target the government's plans to sign a controversial
trade agreement with China, saying it will flood Taiwan with cheaper Chinese
products, cause job losses and ultimately hurt Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent controversy surrounding President Ma Ying-jeou's interview with the
Wall Street Journal Asia is a typical example of "trivial matters shifting the
focus on key policy initiatives" that have often hindered his administration's
achievements over its 18 months in power.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Ma tried to remind Chinese leaders that political  freedom
and  democracy  are  crucial  to achieving reunification as expected by China.</P>
      <P>Ma's actual and complete wording was: "Whether there will be reunification as
expected by the mainland side depends very much on what is going to unfold in
the next decades, " but the Journal wrote "next decade" -- which triggering
criticism from pro-independence groups that Ma was setting a 10-year timetable
for unification.</P>
      <P>It was not the first time that he has been misquoted by foreign news media. Why
have similar situations repeated themselves? It can be attributed to two causes.</P>
      <P>One factor lies in Ma's preference to give interviews in English, even when such
interviews take place at home. The other is the Presidential Office's customary
failure to issue official English transcripts of interviews.</P>
      <P>As the head of state, Ma should speak the country's official language while
meeting with foreign dignitaries or journalists to express his patriotism  and
loyalty to the country and avoid misquotes.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Presdiential Office is obliged to issue formal press releases on
international media interviews because he is speaking on behalf of the country
rather than expressing his personal views.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office should remember that it is obligated to keep the public
informed on what the president has said to foreign news media and both the
Chinese and English versions of such interviews are official documents and
historical records.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Communists' role in Sino-Japanese war exaggerated: Chinese historians</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Chinese historians said Friday that misconceptions on the mainland
about the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese War tend to overemphasize the role of the
Chinese Communists in the resistance against the Japanese invasion.</P>
      <P>The historians said this view is an exaggeration that is misleading, because the
Kuomintang (KMT), which was ruling China at the time, was actually the principal
player in the war.</P>
      <P>The issue was raised at a conference held in Zaozhuang City, Shandong province
to review the history of the Battle of Taierzhuang in 1938, during the Sino-
Japanese War, in which the Chinese scored a major victory under the leadership
of Li Tsung-jen, supreme commander of the KMT's fifth War Zone.</P>
      <P>Some participants at the conference, however, argued that the victory could be
credited to collaboration between the KMT and the Chinese Communists to fight
the Japanese.</P>
      <P>This perception of the battle, which gives credit to the Communists, is common
in Chinese TV dramas on the Sino-Chinese War. These dramas often play up the
prowess of the Communist troops and depict the KMT soldiers as a band of
cowards.</P>
      <P>Ma Zhonglian, former curator of the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum,
said it would be too much of a generalization to simply attribute the victory to
a KMT-Communist alliance.</P>
      <P>If that argument is to be convincing, there must be supporting evidence, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Han Xinfu, a research fellow in modern history at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said he disagrees with the idea of accentuating the role of a certain
party in the war for political purposes.</P>
      <P>Calling for a fair assessment of the war based on facts, Han said the KMT troops
were undoubtedly responsible for the victory in the Battle of Taierzhuang, as
they were the dominant force in the resistance against the Japanese.</P>
      <P>According to Han, there is still a long way to go before Chinese academia can
shed its political shackles and fairly judge the contributions of the KMT and
the Communists in the war.</P>
      <P>Wang Juying, a member of a society that studies the history of the Sino-Japanese
War, said the KMT and the Communists should stop denying each other's role in
the war and should seek to achieve a more consistent perception on this chapter
in history.</P>

      <P>Siza will design and build structures on the golf course that will merge with
their natural surroundings and help commemorate the 100th anniversary of the
Republic of China in 2011, according to Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan.</P>
      <P>Cho said he believes the structure will help raise the county's visibility and
become one of its new landmarks that can attract tourists from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as a place that possesses both natural and spiritual beauty,
Siza pointed to the county's Lugang old street and the Lungshan Temple as
representing local artisans' creations and traditional art forms.</P>
      <P>The contemporary architect said he will incorporate some of those traditional
art elements into the small hall, resort buildings and other works he will
create on the course.</P>
      <P>The golf club, established in 1981, is one of several courses built relatively
early in central Taiwan and the only one that hosts two international

      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Friday that a Taiwanese firm reported to
have illegally sold components to help Iran with its nuclear program did not
breach international rules on the proliferation of nuclear arms.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that after a thorough investigation, it was found that the
company did not violate international regulations when it sold 108 pressure
transducers to Iran in March, because the item was not included on a list of
strategic high-tech commodities (SHTC) in Taiwan at the time.</P>
      <P>The BOFT has reported  the result  of its probe  to the international body in
charge of the issue, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The investigation came after the London-based Daily Telegraph reported in early
December that a Taiwan-based company had sold Iran 100 pressure transducers that
the Middle East country could use to enrich uranium to weapons grade.</P>
      <P>The report added that the equipment, which it said was banned for sale to Iran
by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, was believed to have been originally
manufactured in Europe, but then sold to Iran through intermediaries based in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the BOFT officials, the Taiwan company imported the 108 pressure
transducers from Switzerland and then sold them with MOEA approval to Iran in
March, before the world body issued an advisory saying that the item had been
listed on the SHTC control list.</P>

      <P>The TRI forecast the quarterly economy in 2010 will grow by 8.48 percent in Q1,
5.53 percent in Q2, 3.59 percent in Q3, and 0.99 percent in Q4.</P>
      <P>The Q4 economy in 2009 is forecast to grow 6.76 percent, according to the TRI.</P>
      <P>Private consumption will increase 1.82 percent next year, ,thanks to the
recovery in the stock and labor markets, and private investment is expected to
increase by 7.56 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>Other economic research institutes have also predicted growth for Taiwan in
2010, with a growth rate of 4.66 percent forecast by the Chung-Hua Institution

interest incomes, frustrating private consumption.</P>
      <P>The decline has become a big challenge to the country's economic recovery, Lin

    <HEADLINE>Without ECFA, Taiwan could face more difficult situation: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 18 (CNA)
12/18/09  20:08:25
(By Hsu Rei-ting and Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy will face a more difficult situation if the proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China is not signed, a Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade, argued
that the trade pact would prevent Taiwan from being marginalized in the region
after a free trade agreement between China and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries takes effect Jan. 1 and similar pacts
between ASEAN and other countries in the region are put in place by 2018.</P>
      <P>While the economic pact might affect certain industries, Huang said the overall
benefits of signing an ECFA with China outweigh its negatives, and he promised
that the government will continue to communicate  with the public and help
companies in vulnerable industries upgrade or transform their operations.</P>
      <P>"A lot of decisions need to be made through compromise by many parties. The
government will go on with ECFA talks and report regularly to the legislature
without sacrificing the interests of certain groups, " pledged Huang, who serves
as the MOEA's contact with China's Ministry of Commerce.</P>
      <P>Huang was speaking at a public hearing on ECFA's impact on Taiwan held Friday by
Democratic Progressive Party legislator Pan Men-an and attended  by  government
officials,  scholars  and  business representatives.</P>
      <P>Woo Rhung-jieh, a professor in National Taiwan University's Department of
Agricultural Economics, said that based on trade theory, Taiwan's workers will
suffer the most if the trade pact is signed because trade liberalization usually
leads to a narrowing in price and wage differences between the trade partners.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wage rates would therefore fall if a deal with China were signed, Woo
contended.</P>
      <P>Lee Chung-hang, executive director of the Pingtung Agricultural Development
Association, contended that farmers already believe that Taiwan's agricultural
sector would suffer a blow if the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>He accused the government of not clearly explaining to farmers what the trade
deal's impact would be, at what level "stop-loss" points would be set, and the
direction of future agricultural policies.</P>
      <P>Defending the potential deal, Chang Su-san, head of the Council of Agriculture's
International Affairs Department, reiterated the government's pledge that the
830 agricultural products that cannot be imported from China at present would
continue to be barred under the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Also, aside from establishing an information channel on animal and plant
diseases, Taiwan and China could discuss how to label agricultural products to
avoid infringements of the intellectual property rights of Taiwan's agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>Wang Liang,  director-general of the Ministry of Finance's Department of Customs
Administration, said that after the ECFA is signed,  the government could
introduce anti-dumping  or other defensive measures to protect products made in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been pushing for the signing of ECFA, which is aimed at expanding
economic and trade cooperation and removing barriers.</P>
      <P>Critics have said the deal will allow China to flood Taiwan with cheaper
products and threaten Taiwanese businesses, putting many people out of work.</P>
      <P>Proponents of the agreement, including President Ma Ying-jeou, have insisted  it
is necessary  to help Taiwan maintain  its competitiveness in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fourth round of Chiang-Chen talks to take place next week</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) will open
their fourth round of talks in Taichung Monday, a day after the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) launches a large-scale protest.</P>
      <P>Led by Taiwan's chief negotiator SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart, ARATS President Chen Yunlin, the negotiations are expected to
result in agreements on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine
inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the
avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations designated by the
governments of Taiwan and China, respectively, to handle cross-strait dealings
in the absence of official contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The three-day meeting, from Dec. 21-23, represents the fourth round of the
biannual talks over the past two years since the two organizations resumed
discussions in June 2008 after a 13-year hiatus, ending years of tension.</P>
      <P>In a press briefing on Thursday, SEF Chairman Chiang said that the nine
agreements reached during the past three rounds have benefited Taiwanese
businesses by helping them reduce their operating expenses and improving
efficiency.</P>
      <P>He suggested that a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ,
which aims to normalize trade between the two countries and eventually lead to
the reduction of tariff barriers, will be on the agenda of the next round of
talks, which will be held in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition DPP and more than 10 civil groups are expected to hold
a major protest against the ECFA, even though it is not on the agenda of this
round of talks.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, secretary-general of the Taiwan Society, one of the civil groups
to participate in the Sunday protest, said his group was against the lack of
transparency in the ECFA negotiations and advocated holding a referendum on the
proposed trade pact before the start of the negotiation process.</P>
      <P>Other smaller scale protests are expected to be held throughout Chen's stay in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang as host of this round of talks, called on the protesters to be peaceful,
rational and law-abiding.</P>
      <P>The DPP hopes to mobilize 100,000 demonstrators for Sunday's rally, while the
Ministry of the Interior plans to mobilize 200 police officers to patrol the
negotiating venue in Taichung and a total of 1,000 to share the task of
providing security for Chen when he travels outside the venue, according to
Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah.</P>

      <P>The head of Taiwan's government agency tasked with handling China affairs
expressed hope Friday that consensus can be reached in Taiwanese society over
controversial issues arising ahead of Taiwan and China's new round of talks next
week.</P>
      <P>As the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is planning rallies against
China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin, Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said Friday that the government highly respects freedom
of speech expressed in a legitimate manner.</P>
      <P>Previous similar round of talks in Taipei sparked fierce protests from the DPP
and pro-independence activists who accused the government headed by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) party of leaning toward China.</P>
      <P>Lai urged all sectors  within  Taiwan  to rationally  and realistically look at
the negotiations between Taiwan and China, while calling for people to back the
government's efforts.</P>
      <P>She said she hopes that the new round of Taiwan-China talks to be held in
Central Taiwan's Taichung City from Dec. 21-23 could be a new starting point for
reaching consensus at home.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China used to be long-time political rivals, but they resumed talks
aimed at strengthening the two sides' economic cooperation after Taiwan's
President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May last year.</P>
      <P>Representatives from Taiwan and China in the coming Taichung talks will sign
agreements on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection,
industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the avoidance of
double taxation.</P>
      <P>Opponents however will target the government's plans to sign a controversial
trade agreement with China, saying it will flood Taiwan with cheaper Chinese
products, cause job losses and ultimately hurt Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent controversy surrounding President Ma Ying-jeou's interview with the
Wall Street Journal Asia is a typical example of "trivial matters shifting the
focus on key policy initiatives" that have often hindered his administration's
achievements over its 18 months in power.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Ma tried to remind Chinese leaders that political  freedom
and  democracy  are  crucial  to achieving reunification as expected by China.</P>
      <P>Ma's actual and complete wording was: "Whether there will be reunification as
expected by the mainland side depends very much on what is going to unfold in
the next decades, " but the Journal wrote "next decade" -- which triggering
criticism from pro-independence groups that Ma was setting a 10-year timetable
for unification.</P>
      <P>It was not the first time that he has been misquoted by foreign news media. Why
have similar situations repeated themselves? It can be attributed to two causes.</P>
      <P>One factor lies in Ma's preference to give interviews in English, even when such
interviews take place at home. The other is the Presidential Office's customary
failure to issue official English transcripts of interviews.</P>
      <P>As the head of state, Ma should speak the country's official language while
meeting with foreign dignitaries or journalists to express his patriotism  and
loyalty to the country and avoid misquotes.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Presdiential Office is obliged to issue formal press releases on
international media interviews because he is speaking on behalf of the country
rather than expressing his personal views.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office should remember that it is obligated to keep the public
informed on what the president has said to foreign news media and both the
Chinese and English versions of such interviews are official documents and
historical records.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Communists' role in Sino-Japanese war exaggerated: Chinese historians</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shandong, China, Dec. 18 (CNA)
12/18/09  21:02:12
(By Chang Ming-kun and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Chinese historians said Friday that misconceptions on the mainland
about the 1937-1945 Sino-Japanese War tend to overemphasize the role of the
Chinese Communists in the resistance against the Japanese invasion.</P>
      <P>The historians said this view is an exaggeration that is misleading, because the
Kuomintang (KMT), which was ruling China at the time, was actually the principal
player in the war.</P>
      <P>The issue was raised at a conference held in Zaozhuang City, Shandong province
to review the history of the Battle of Taierzhuang in 1938, during the Sino-
Japanese War, in which the Chinese scored a major victory under the leadership
of Li Tsung-jen, supreme commander of the KMT's fifth War Zone.</P>
      <P>Some participants at the conference, however, argued that the victory could be
credited to collaboration between the KMT and the Chinese Communists to fight
the Japanese.</P>
      <P>This perception of the battle, which gives credit to the Communists, is common
in Chinese TV dramas on the Sino-Chinese War. These dramas often play up the
prowess of the Communist troops and depict the KMT soldiers as a band of
cowards.</P>
      <P>Ma Zhonglian, former curator of the Chinese People's Revolution Military Museum,
said it would be too much of a generalization to simply attribute the victory to
a KMT-Communist alliance.</P>
      <P>If that argument is to be convincing, there must be supporting evidence, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Han Xinfu, a research fellow in modern history at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, said he disagrees with the idea of accentuating the role of a certain
party in the war for political purposes.</P>
      <P>Calling for a fair assessment of the war based on facts, Han said the KMT troops
were undoubtedly responsible for the victory in the Battle of Taierzhuang, as
they were the dominant force in the resistance against the Japanese.</P>
      <P>According to Han, there is still a long way to go before Chinese academia can
shed its political shackles and fairly judge the contributions of the KMT and
the Communists in the war.</P>
      <P>Wang Juying, a member of a society that studies the history of the Sino-Japanese
War, said the KMT and the Communists should stop denying each other's role in
the war and should seek to achieve a more consistent perception on this chapter
in history.</P>

      <P>A local golf course operator and world renowned Portuguese architect Ivaro Siza
signed an agreement recently to create landscape architecture works that will

Friday.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed last month by Tai Hong Golf Club Chairman Lin Por-shih
and Siza, who has won a number of architecture awards, including the Pritzker
Prize in 1992, and was named as the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)
's 2009 Royal Gold Medalist.</P>
      <P>Siza will design and build structures on the golf course that will merge with
their natural surroundings and help commemorate the 100th anniversary of the
Republic of China in 2011, according to Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan.</P>
      <P>Cho said he believes the structure will help raise the county's visibility and
become one of its new landmarks that can attract tourists from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan as a place that possesses both natural and spiritual beauty,
Siza pointed to the county's Lugang old street and the Lungshan Temple as
representing local artisans' creations and traditional art forms.</P>
      <P>The contemporary architect said he will incorporate some of those traditional
art elements into the small hall, resort buildings and other works he will
create on the course.</P>
      <P>The golf club, established in 1981, is one of several courses built relatively
early in central Taiwan and the only one that hosts two international
tournaments a year.</P>
      <P>The golf club project is just one of many deals clinched by the central county

      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Friday that a Taiwanese firm reported to
have illegally sold components to help Iran with its nuclear program did not
breach international rules on the proliferation of nuclear arms.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that after a thorough investigation, it was found that the
company did not violate international regulations when it sold 108 pressure
transducers to Iran in March, because the item was not included on a list of
strategic high-tech commodities (SHTC) in Taiwan at the time.</P>
      <P>The BOFT has reported  the result  of its probe  to the international body in
charge of the issue, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The investigation came after the London-based Daily Telegraph reported in early
December that a Taiwan-based company had sold Iran 100 pressure transducers that
the Middle East country could use to enrich uranium to weapons grade.</P>
      <P>The report added that the equipment, which it said was banned for sale to Iran
by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, was believed to have been originally
manufactured in Europe, but then sold to Iran through intermediaries based in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the BOFT officials, the Taiwan company imported the 108 pressure
transducers from Switzerland and then sold them with MOEA approval to Iran in
March, before the world body issued an advisory saying that the item had been

      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Friday that a Taiwanese firm reported to
have illegally sold components to help Iran with its nuclear program did not
breach international rules on the proliferation of nuclear arms.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that after a thorough investigation, it was found that the
company did not violate international regulations when it sold 108 pressure
transducers to Iran in March, because the item was not included on a list of
strategic high-tech commodities (SHTC) in Taiwan at the time.</P>
      <P>The BOFT has reported  the result  of its probe  to the international body in
charge of the issue, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The investigation came after the London-based Daily Telegraph reported in early
December that a Taiwan-based company had sold Iran 100 pressure transducers that
the Middle East country could use to enrich uranium to weapons grade.</P>
      <P>The report added that the equipment, which it said was banned for sale to Iran
by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, was believed to have been originally
manufactured in Europe, but then sold to Iran through intermediaries based in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the BOFT officials, the Taiwan company imported the 108 pressure
transducers from Switzerland and then sold them with MOEA approval to Iran in
March, before the world body issued an advisory saying that the item had been
listed on the SHTC control list.</P>
      <P>The deal at that time did not violate either Taiwan's export regulations or
international norms, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Danish-based Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipper, is planning to
have at least one of its vessels registered in Taiwan to get in on the booming
direct shipping services across the Taiwan Strait, a Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>This will make Maersk the first foreign shipping company to register in the
country, according to deputy minister Yeh Kuang-shih.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait route, which was inaugurated in December 2008, is open only to
Taiwanese and Chinese vessels or foreign-registered vessels owned by Taiwanese
or Chinese shippers. Other ships must detour through a third area when sailing
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>In the year since the direct shipping links were launched, 10 vessels that were
previously registered overseas have now been registered in Taiwan by Taiwanese
shippers, MOTC data show.</P>
      <P>The direct route is highly attractive to shippers because it reduces their
travel time and costs considerably.</P>
      <P>Compared with the past when a detour was required, a voyage between Keelung and
Shanghai is now eight to nine hours faster, and one between  Keelung  and Fuzhou
is 11 to 12 hours faster. Transportation costs, meanwhile, are 15-30 percent
less.</P>
      <P>MOTC statistics show that between Dec. 15, 2008 and Nov. 20, 2009, a total of
161 ships were permitted by Taiwan to operate the cross-strait route.</P>
      <P>During that period, there were 10,533 voyages between Taiwan and China carrying
more than 1.22 million standard containers and 22.99 million tons of cargo, the
statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait container volume accounted for 10 percent of Taiwan's total
container volume during the period.</P>
      <P>The MOTC predicted that cross-strait container volume will increase
significantly in 2010 as the world economy gradually recovers from a recession
triggered by the global financial crisis.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau,  in collaboration with cable TV station LA 18 -- the
largest Asian language TV station in the United States -- will produce shows on
the travels of four Asian American groups in Taiwan to help promote local
tourism to United States audiences.</P>
      <P>The bureau has invited LA 18 anchors who speak Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and
Filipino to lead the groups to interesting spots around Taiwan early next year,
and their tours will be filmed and turned into programs to be aired on the cable
station.</P>
      <P>Lin Shing-jen, tourism section chief at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office

more Asian Americans to Taiwan's natural beauty and its potential as a tourism
destination.</P>
      <P>LA 18 offers news and other programming in 13 different Asian languages. The
Tourism Bureau initially chose four languages based on the number of people that
speak them in the Los Angeles area.</P>
      <P>The TV station reaches 6.2 million TV equipped households and 2.9 million cable

    <TEXT>
      <P>With reservoirs in southern Taiwan currently holding 50 percent less water than
in years past, President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that the severe water
shortage loom and need to be dealt with as a national security issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan suffered from a drought in the first half of the year, Ma said, and water
saving measures were about to be implemented when Typhoon Morakot drenched the
country in August. But since then, there has been 70 percent less rainfall than
past averages, leaving the country vulnerable to water shortages once again.</P>
      <P>Because the next rainy season will not come until next May, the water shortage
will worsen over the next five to six months and "should be elevated to the
level of a national security issue, " Ma said at an anti-drought meeting held at
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed that the government needs to take effective water conservation
measures and help people endure the crisis.</P>
      <P>Reducing consumption and saving water represent the only real solution, Ma said,
because it will be difficult to deliver water from the north to the south or dig
wells to increase water supply.</P>
      <P>The president said the government's first priority is to solve the pressing
issue and then plan for long-term  comprehensive measures.</P>
      <P>Ma recalled that he was mayor of Taipei City when it encountered a water
shortage in March 2002 and said that experience had left him with a lingering
fear of a lack of water.</P>
      <P>Last week, Premier Wu Den-yih asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs to work out
a comprehensive plan to deal with the worsening water shortage.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency said early this month that water rationing might be
imposed by the end of February if no rain falls from now until next spring.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been affected by a continuing drought since the beginning of this
year, except for August, when Morakot hit the country, according to a climate
change monitoring center at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>During the first 10 months of 2009, it rained on only 52 days, some 90 days
fewer than the average level, the center said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Science park focuses on green energy, biomedical tech development</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park, known as Taiwan's "silicon valley, " has targeted the
green energy and biomedical sectors as key industries that will propel the
park's development over the next 10 years and complement its strength in
semiconductors and flat panels.</P>
      <P>In  an interview  with  the  Central  News  Agency,  Park Director-General Yen
Tzong-ming expressed confidence in Taiwan's ability to maintain its edge in the
global semiconductor and flat panel markets, which he said "will continue to be
the park's two major industrial pillars."</P>
      <P>Yen attributed that success to the park's ability over its 29-year history to
build a complete industrial cluster and cultivate specialized technologies in
the semiconductor sector, and now it hopes to do the same in the green energy
field as concerns over climate change mount.</P>
      <P>In the solar energy sector, for example, upstream producers of solar cell wafer
materials and midstream manufacturers of solar cells have already moved into the
park, Yen said.</P>
      <P>As to light emitting diode (LED) technologies, seen as having huge potential in
saving energy used in lighting, production lines in the park have been upgraded
from simply making LED chips to the production of ultra bright LED epitaxial
wafers.</P>
      <P>Efforts are now being made to develop technologies related to long wavelength
communication and advanced laser diodes, Yen noted.</P>
      <P>He revealed that the park administration plans to position its Tongluo park as
an environmental science zone for the planned green energy cluster.</P>
      <P>Turning to the biomedical industry, Yen said the administration is planning to
develop the Hsinchu Biomedical Science Park, located in Jhubei in northern
Hsinchu County, into a cradle of knowledge innovation  and cultivation
featuring an international-standard medical center and biotech businesses.</P>
      <P>It will host factories, a medical center, a center for the development and
testing of medical equipment and devices, and an industrial innovation center.
Yen said the facilities should be completed by 2015.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park, the first of its kind in Taiwan, was established on
Dec. 15, 1980 to introduce high-tech industries and attract talent to Taiwan,
promote the upgrading of Taiwanese industries, balance regional development and
drive national economic development.</P>
      <P>It is currently comprised of zones in Hsinchu, Jhunan, Tongluo, Longtan, and
Yilan and also includes the biomedical science park.</P>
      <P>As of Aug. 31, the 451 high-tech companies operating the park employed  128,585
people and had paid-in capital of NT$11.457 trillion.</P>
      <P>Park companies generated revenues of NT$524.2 billion between January and August
this year, down 28.8 percent from the same period a year ago.</P>
      <P>But combined revenue in July and August of NT$166.3 billion was 15.6 percent
higher than in the previous two months, an indication that Taiwan's economy was
recovering from the severe global slump that hit earlier in the year, the park
said.</P>

      <P>Zheng Lizhong, vice president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , said Saturday that there is no reason to protest against next
week's cross-Taiwan Strait talks because they are in the interest of people.</P>
      <P>Zheng, who arrived in Taiwan Friday afternoon to prepare for the meeting between
the top negotiators of the two sides,  later encountered protests from several
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Taichung city councilors, who
yelled "one country on each side" in the lobby of the Windsor Hotel where the
Chinese delegation will stay and negotiations will be held.</P>
      <P>"People can express their opinions, but everything we are going to discuss in
the talks are in the interests of the people from the two sides, " Zheng said
Saturday morning when asked about the protest. "There is no reason to protest
against us."</P>
      <P>He later added, "I believe that other Taiwanese should not be like (the
protesters)."</P>
      <P>After holding a preparatory meeting with Taiwan representatives Saturday
morning, Zheng visited nearby Miaoli County -- which may also welcome the ARATS
head, who will arrive in Taiwan Monday.</P>
      <P>The 20-member delegation, led by Zheng, arrived ahead of ARATS President Chen
Yunlin, who will meet for the fourth time with Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), from Dec. 22-23 in Taichung
City, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Four pacts, covering the avoidance of double taxation, inspection and quarantine
of agricultural produce, fishing crew cooperation, and industrial product
standards, inspection and certification, are expected to be signed during the
meeting, but the two sides will not ink a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>The DPP has planned a series of protests right before Chen's arrival and during
his stay in the central city, including a march and rally Dec. 20 on Jhonggang

      <P>There are 300,000 fewer people in Taiwan who smoke since the implementation of a
smoking ban early this year, which helped create an anti-smoking mood in
society, according to a report released Friday by the Department of Health
(DOH).</P>
      <P>Based on the results of an annual survey on adult smoking behavior, the DOH's
Bureau of Health Promotion (BHP) estimated that there were 3.61 million smokers
aged 18 or older in Taiwan in 2009, down from 3.93 million in 2008.</P>
      <P>The bureau said the findings were consistent with the results of another BHP-
commissioned survey conducted by Shih Hsin University between July 2008 and
December 2009, which showed that a collective anti-smoking spirit is gradually
taking shape.</P>
      <P>The BHP survey also found that more than 90 percent  of respondents interviewed
in December 2009 were aware that under the terms of the ban that took effect
Jan. 11, smoking is not allowed in offices manned by three or more people, on
public transport, or in indoor areas of most public premises.</P>
      <P>That marks a significant increase from July 2008, when fewer than 60 percent of
respondents were aware of the ban.</P>
      <P>Compared with 2008, the frequency of secondhand smoke exposure, both indoors and
outdoors, has also been on the decline, the results revealed.</P>
      <P>Secondhand smoke exposure at home, however, has worsened.</P>
      <P>While the DOH welcomed the decline in the number of smokers, it acknowledged
that the trend was cutting into its revenues.</P>
      <P>The DOH had predicted that after the health surcharge on cigarettes was
increased from NT$10 per pack of cigarettes to NT$20 in June, revenue from the
tax would reach NT$20 billion this year, but only NT$15 billion has been
collected so far.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-China pact to hit Taiwan investors in Southeast Asia: expert</HEADLINE>

12/19/09  18:05:11

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese scholar warned Saturday that the signing of a proposed trade pact
between Taiwan and China will negatively impact Taiwanese invested businesses in
Southeast Asia, notably those in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is intent on negotiating an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, which will lay down the principles for more liberalized trade
between the two countries in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-chang, dean of the Management Institute in Taipei, told the Central
News Agency in a telephone interview that after the pact is inked, some of the
Chinese products that had been barred from entering Taiwan would gradually be
allowed in, "offering traders in Taiwan another option."</P>
      <P>In addition, the signing of the ECFA would make Chinese products that are
already allowed into Taiwan more competitive, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>"As the tariffs (on Chinese goods) will drop, Chinese goods will be quite
attractive to Taiwanese traders, " he said, referring to products in
conventional industries, such as shoes, umbrellas, towels and clothes.</P>
      <P>That would deliver a blow to Taiwanese-invested companies in Southeast Asia, and
"particularly those in Vietnam, " where there are a great many Taiwanese
investors and major Taiwanese companies, Chen contended.</P>
      <P>The warning came as many Taiwanese manufacturers that had been active in China
have relocated to Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia following China's
implementation of a labor law from the start of last year, which raised labor
costs.</P>
      <P>The influx of Taiwanese investment in Vietnam, however, has led to the demand
for labor outstripping supply, prompting workers there to ask for higher wages,
according to Chen, who served as an economic official with the Mainland Affairs
Council in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The growing  number of strikes  and the lack of adequate infrastructure in the
Southeast Asian country are now actually discouraging some companies from moving
there, Chen observed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the largest foreign investor in Vietnam between 1988 and 2009, with
investment exceeding US$21 billion, according to Vietnam's economic and cultural
office in Taipei.</P>

mobilization.</P>
      <P>We want to stress the righteousness of the rallies, as the people are applying
their constitutional rights of freedom of speech and assembly to protest the
nation's deteriorating economy and endangered sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The administration of Ma Ying-jeou claimed that its leaning toward China could
help revive the economy and bring peace. However, while none of these have been
achieved, the nation's sovereignty has been weakened.</P>
      <P>Taking the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China
as an example, while the Ma administration suggests that with the signing of
such an agreement, it is expected that China will not voice its objection when
other countries negotiate free trade agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan. But China
has openly declared that it will not give way on this matter since FTAs are
agreements between sovereign countries.</P>
      <P>From the experiences of other countries, the signing of FTAs remains an economic
as well as political issue. The resistance reflected in Taiwanese society can be
used by Taiwan as leverage in the negotiations. While the government fails to
take the advice from the people, there is no other way but to take to the
streets to make a show of protest.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has seen significant growth in the number of foreign visitors  this year
despite  a decline  in international tourism caused by the global economic slump
and the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, the Tourism Bureau said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Boosted by the Tourism Bureau's global management strategy and diversified
marketing approaches, the number of foreign visitors to Taiwan broke the 4
million barrier for the first time in its history on Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>Total arrivals are expected to grow to 4.2 million by the end of the year, about
10 percent more than the 3.85 million foreign visitors who came to Taiwan in
2008, the bureau said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of the few countries in Asia that will post growth in foreign
arrivals this year, the bureau said, citing the United Nations' World Tourism
Organization, which estimated that global tourist numbers would fall 4-6 percent
in 2009.</P>
      <P>As of August 2009, only Taiwan (11.63 percent) , South Korea (14.88 percent) and
Malaysia (4.41 percent) had recorded gains among Asian countries in foreign
arrivals for the year, the U.N. tourism body reported.</P>
      <P>In contrast, visitor numbers to Japan, Thailand, and Singapore had fallen by
25.34 percent,  12.39 percent and 9.22 percent respectively, according to the
U.N. tourism body's figures.</P>
      <P>"The most important goal in promoting Taiwan's tourism is to put the country on
the international tourism map, " Taiwan's Tourism Bureau said in its statement.</P>
      <P>"Once we adopted customized marketing strategies for tourists from different
markets, we started to see good results, " the statement added.</P>
      <P>According to the Tourism Bureau, Taiwan drew 3,945,198 foreign visitors between
January and November, a 12.94 percent increase compared to the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Among them, a record 2.03 million, or 51 percent, were tourists, a 28.46 percent
rise from the first 11 months of 2008, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Breaking down the tourist figures, European tourist arrivals grew 18.27 percent
year-on-year, the fifth consecutive year of positive growth.</P>
      <P>Also, arrivals from Hong Kong have risen by 26.70 percent, from the United
States by 4.99 percent, from New Zealand and Australia by 5.46 percent, and from
Malaysia by 6.88 percent in 2009, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan previously placed little emphasis on developing its tourism industry but
has recognized in recent years that its natural beauty and cultural assets could
be attractive to tourists and has more aggressively promoted the sector.</P>
      <P>It has invested NT$1 billion (US$30.9 million) to boost foreign tourist arrivals
as part of its "Tour Taiwan Years 2008-2009" program that kicked off Feb. 15,
2008.</P>
      <P>Much of the growth in overseas tourist numbers has been due to visitors from
China, who were allowed to come to Taiwan in large numbers for the first time
last year. Expanded direct flights between Taiwan and China this year have also
boosted arrival numbers.</P>
      <P>Noting that a total of 880,000 Chinese have visited Taiwan between July 2008,
when the opening to Chinese tourists began, and November 2009, the Tourism
Bureau said it is optimistic about the future of cross-Taiwan Strait tourism,
because Taiwan has done a much better job in attracting Chinese tourists than
other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>It took Japan five years to draw 650,000 Chinese tourists, seven years for South
Korea to draw 700,000, 18 years for Malaysia to attract 680,000, and 10 and 12
years, respectively, for Thailand and Singapore to draw 600,000, the bureau
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan's animation and comics industry called for more
government assistance Saturday to help them break into the vast Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Of the approximately 100 animation and comics companies in Taiwan, only 22
percent have paid-in capital of NT$30 million or above, Dan Yu-li, president of
the Animation and Comic Creative Association, said at an industry seminar held
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>That means that most of the companies in the sector are operating with very
limited resources and require more guidance from the government in training
talent, devising marketing strategies, and raising capital, Dan said.</P>
      <P>According to the Institute for Information Industry (III), one of the organizers
of the seminar, China's animation and comics market, worth 100 billion Chinese
yuan a year, offers a great opportunity for Taiwan, especially in light of the
gaping shortage of animated products on the mainland.</P>
      <P>In 2008, domestic animation makers in China produced 249 animated films with
total running time of 131,000 minutes, which accounted for only 4.49 percent of
total demand for the year, the III said.</P>
      <P>Wu Chu, CEO of Taiwan-based Yaox Edutainment Co., which has been operating in
China for 10 years, said in addition to reputation, branding and local
connections, the most important requirement for animated filmmakers to survive
in China is to control the channels of distribution.</P>
      <P>Yaox, for example, has succeeded in gaining access to China's domestic market by
building and operating its own theaters, Wu said.</P>
      <P>With Yaox becoming an increasingly prominent brand in China, the company has won
the contracts to design and operate the China Pavilion and Taiwan Pavilion at
the World Expo 2010 Shanghai, she said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and the United States have markedly improved their fishery cooperation in
recent years, and thanks to U.S. assistance, Taiwan succeeded in joining a new
fisheries  management  body  last  month,  Fisheries  Agency Director-General
James Sha said Friday.</P>
      <P>Sha, who is visiting the U.S. capital, said that through U.S.-Taiwan cooperation
over the years, Taiwan has been able to join many international fishing
management organizations as a "fishing entity."</P>
      <P>Its latest success, achieved with the help of the United States and other
friends such as the European Union, New Zealand and Australia,  was to join the
South Pacific Regional  Fisheries Management Organization (SPRFMO) as a "fishing
entity" under the name "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>The organization was created in Auckland, New Zealand, on Nov. 14, 2009,
following the 8th round of international consultations on the group's
establishment, during which the Convention on the Conservation and Management of
High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean was adopted.</P>
      <P>Once the convention takes effect, there will no longer be gaps in the
international conservation and management of non-highly migratory fisheries and
the protection of biodiversity from the eastern part of the southern Indian
Ocean across the Pacific to the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of South
America.</P>
      <P>Concrete cooperation between Taiwan and the United States has also been seen in
substantive fishing operations, evidenced by several bilateral  joint ventures
that have been formed,  Sha explained.</P>
      <P>For instance, Taiwan-U.S joint venture fishing vessels now form the bulk of the
U.S. fleet operating in the western and central Pacific Ocean, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as a major global fishing power, has actively sought to enter
international fishery resources conservation and management organizations for
many years, he added</P>
      <P>The country has been a member of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries
Commission  since 2005,  and it plans to join the Inter-American Tropical Tuna
Commission (IATTC) next year.</P>

      <P>The signing of the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China will benefit Taiwan's  film  industry  by facilitating  cross-Taiwan
Strait cooperation and providing a broader market for local filmmakers, a
Legislative Yuan report has concluded.</P>
      <P>A report released Saturday by the Legislative Research Bureau (LRB) argued that
China is the biggest market in the Greater China region and therefore Taiwan and
China should cooperate more on producing major motion pictures.</P>
      <P>Signing  the economic  pact with China  could bring  more opportunities for
Taiwan's filmmakers to obtain co-production rights and broadcasting rights in
China, the report said.</P>
      <P>It argued that cross-border reciprocal investment is a trend among international
film industries because it can lower risk and expand markets and said the big
China market should not be ignored.</P>
      <P>The LRB mentioned  that  the closer  economic  partnership arrangement (CEPA)
between Hong Kong and China, signed in 2003, has helped open up the Chinese
market to Hong Kong's movie industry and give Hong Kong's directors more space
to create movies.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese director Leon Dai, a Golden Horse Award winner, said Thursday at a
forum that the government needs to put effort into reviving Taiwan's film
industry.</P>
      <P>Dai said it would be too late to do so three to five years from now, when
China's film industry becomes more stable.</P>

      <P>A solemn memorial ceremony for legendary journalist Yeh Ming-hsun, was held
Saturday and attended by many leading politicians  and journalists,  including
President  Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Ma presented a state citation during the ceremony in recognition of Yeh's
contribution to the development of journalism in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also participating in the ceremony were Vice President Vincent Siew, Kuomintang
(KMT) honorary Chairman Lien Chan, former Premier Hau Pei-tsun and Central News
Agency (CNA) Chairman Joe Hung, as well as Yeh's widow, son and three daughters.</P>
      <P>Yeh passed away on Nov. 21 at the age of 96.</P>
      <P>Born in 1913 in China's Fujian Province, Yeh was the first correspondent
dispatched by CNA in China to Taiwan in 1945. In that same year, he was tasked
in Taipei to take over the office of Domei Tsushinsha, the official news agency
of the Empire of Japan.</P>
      <P>Yeh served as president of CNA's Taipei branch until 1950, when the agency moved
its headquarters to Taipei. In the following year, he began his career in
newspapers as president of the KMT-owned Chunghwa Daily.</P>
      <P>From 1959 to 1965 he served as the president of the Independence Evening Post,
and after working in television and setting up one of Taiwan's most important
advertising  agencies in the following decades. He returned to the newspaper
business as acting chairman of the Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News between 1998 and
1999.</P>
      <P>In the late 1950s, Yeh and Cheng She-wo jointly established the Shih Hsin School
of Journalism -- the predecessor of Shin Hsin University (SHU) -- and he served
as vice president of the school in 1966 and then as chairman of the university
between 1991 and 2006.</P>
      <P>He was also named by the government in 1990 as one of the members of a special
task force in charge of investigating the 228 Incident, also known as the 228
Massacre -- an anti-government uprising in Taiwan that began on Feb. 27, 1947
and was violently suppressed by the KMT government.</P>
      <P>Regarded as a legendary figure in Taiwan's journalistic circles, Yeh was awarded
an honorary doctorate by SHU in 2008.</P>

      <P>There have been 47 times more requests for legal assistance between Taiwan and
China in the five months after a mutual assistance pact took effect in June than
between Taiwan and the United States in seven years, according to government
figures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China asked each other for help 3,452 times between June 25 and Nov.
30, compared to only 73 cases between Taiwan and the United States over the past
seven years, according to the latest figures obtained by the Central News Agency
from the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>Mutual legal assistance cases cover repatriating criminals, collecting evidence,
exchanging intelligence, and sending alerts on major events.</P>
      <P>Of the above cases, 93 were requests to repatriate wanted persons, 243 were to
exchange intelligence, 61 were for investigations and collecting evidence, 64
were for picking up criminals returned by either side, 264 were for sending
important alerts, 22 were for exchanging ideas on specialized fields, and 2,705
were related to the delivery of legal documents.</P>
      <P>The exchange of requests was made possible after the two countries signed an
agreement on crime fighting and mutual legal assistance during talks in April
2009.</P>
      <P>Despite the agreement, however, China has failed to hand over most of the wanted
Taiwanese fugitives who are living on its soil, many of whom have committed
major economic crimes, a ministry official said on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official said Chinese authorities are willing to hunt down criminal
offenders and repatriate them, because they may hook up with local gangsters in
China and commit more crimes there, but many economic criminals avoid arrest by
keeping a low profile or exerting political or financial influence.</P>
      <P>The same goes for the U.S., where no major Taiwanese economic criminal has been
repatriated so far, the official said.</P>
      <P>The source  said Chinese  officials  told their  Taiwanese counterparts after
the pact took effect that nabbing economic criminals would have a major adverse
impact on the economies of Taiwan and China as such arrests might create a panic
among Taiwanese-invested businesses.</P>
      <P>The official said he is hoping for further development in Taiwan-China
cooperation in this area, saying it would create a new milestone if judicial
authorities on either side was allowed to conduct investigations on each other's
territories in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An agreement on cross-strait taxation is expected to be signed during the fourth
round of negotiations between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Strait Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , in the coming week. Finance Minister Lee
Sush-der said the agreement will help protect Taiwanese businessmen operating in
China, lowering the burden of taxpayers and increasing the government's tax
revenues.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue: China Times:</P>
      <P>While four agreements are expected to be signed during the Chiang-Chen
negotiations next week,  some Taiwanese businessmen believe that the signing of
a cross-strait investment protection agreement should have been the priority,
and it is regretful that the negotiation of such an agreement was not included.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Sheng-chung said that although an investment
protection agreement will not be included in the fourth round of the Chen-Chiang
negotiations, it doesn't mean that it will be excluded in future negotiations.
As long as the policy of opening Chinese investment in Taiwan is effectively
implemented, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will make the discussion of an
investment protection agreement one of the priorities on the agenda of the next
round of talks.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that no discussion on an investment protection agreement has
been held, because up to date cross-strait investment has remained unbalanced,
with far more Taiwanese investment in China than vice versa. Economic Daily
News:</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der emphasized that the cross-strait taxation
agreement will be signed next week based on the principles of equality,
reciprocity, and mutual benefit and the safeguarding of Taiwanese businessmen's
rights and welfare.</P>
      <P>Lee maintained that the more a country relies on trade, the more it needs to
conclude taxation agreements with other countries. By signing a cross-strait
taxation agreement, it is expected Taiwan will be able to conclude such
agreements with more countries, thus improving its competitiveness in
international trade, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Israel became the 17th country to have signed a taxation agreement
with Taiwan by signing a bilateral double taxation avoidance agreement on Dec.
18, Lee said, adding that there are three similar agreements still under
negotiation. Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>As a cross-strait taxation agreement is expected to be signed during the fourth
round Chiang-Chen negotiations next week, some Taiwanese businessmen are worried
that they will be prodded for their tax records.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der has suggested that signing taxation agreements
with other countries  would help improve  Taiwan's competitiveness in
international trade, and he didn't think local businessmen should worry about
being harassed over taxation.</P>
      <P>However, Professor Norman Yin of National Chengchi University said that the
concerns of the Taiwanese businessmen should be noted. He suggested that before
signing the agreement, the negotiators must clarify its content and make known
that the agreement is specifically for the avoidance of double taxation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The gap in exports and average wages between Taiwan and South Korea doubled over
the past 10 years, reflecting the country's loss of competitiveness during the
"lost decade, " a former government official said Saturday at a forum on Taiwan
and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, a former minister without portfolio and now a professor in
National Central University's (NCU's) Department of Economics, said Taiwan has
fallen behind South Korea in a number of economic indicators because of a "lost
decade" that resulted from the government's politically oriented decision making
starting in the mid-1990s.</P>
      <P>In 1993, Taiwan exported more than South Korea, but in June 2009, Taiwan
exported US$16.95 billion in goods compared to South Korea's 33 billion, Chu
said.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  in 2007,  South  Korea's  average  wage in the manufacturing sector
was US$18.4 per hour, more than double the US$8.2 per hour in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chu argued that the gap was still too big even after taking inflation into
account, not to mention that over the past 10 years, the average starting
monthly salary for first-time workers in Taiwan has stagnated at the same level.</P>
      <P>Another difference between the two countries lies in the fact that while South
Korea had two brands -- Samsung and Hyundai -- ranked among the world's top 100
brands by Business Week in 2008, no Taiwanese companies made it onto the list,
Chu said.</P>
      <P>After a free trade agreement (FTA) between China and member countries of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) takes effect Jan. 1, 2010,
Taiwanese companies will be at an even greater competitive  disadvantage
because  95 percent of the products manufactured by ASEAN countries will be
allowed into China duty free, Chu said.</P>
      <P>South Korea and Japan have also started FTAs negotiations with many other
countries, which would also seriously impact Taiwan's trade competitiveness, he
added.</P>
      <P>"However, this urgent situation has not created a sense of unity in Taiwan, "
said Chu, referring to the controversy over the signing of a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been pushing for the signing of ECFA, which is aimed at expanding
economic and trade cooperation and removing barriers.</P>
      <P>Critics have said the deal will allow China to flood Taiwan with cheaper
products and threaten Taiwanese businesses, putting many people out of work,
while proponents of the agreement, including President Ma Ying-jeou, have
insisted it is necessary to help Taiwan maintain its competitiveness in the
region.</P>
      <P>Chu argued that instead of taking ECFA as a "cure-all, " Taiwanese companies
have to develop their brand names and key technologies to ensure profitability
and continue to develop the service sector to improve the employment situation.</P>

      <P>To address the growing specter of water shortages, particularly in southern
Taiwan, the government has decided to earmark NT$34 billion (US$1.05 billion) to
dredge two reservoirs in Tainan and Chiayi counties, Executive Yuan spokesman Su
Jun-pin said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made after President Ma Ying-jeou called an anti-drought
meeting earlier the same day at the Presidential Office with Vice President
Vincent Siew, Premier Wu Den-yih and others in attendance.</P>
      <P>While Ma described the mounting water crisis as a national security issue and
demanded a national campaign to counter the worsening situation, Siew called for
setting up a sound system to deal with such problems over the long term in view
of the growing impact of global warming, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Su said the government will allocate NT$26 billion to desilt the Tsengwen
Reservoir over the next six years and NT$8 billion to clean the Nanhua
Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Tsengwen reservoir, Taiwan's largest, is in Chiayi County, while Nanhua
Reservoir is in Tainan County. Both supply water to residents in Tainan and
Kaohsiung counties.</P>
      <P>After Typhoon Morakot hit southern Taiwan in August, the two reservoirs suffered
major buildups of sand, mud and driftwood.</P>
      <P>Since then, no rain has fallen in southern Tainan and the two reservoirs have
not collected any more water, exacerbating the threat of water shortages.</P>
      <P>At current levels of reserves, tap water for households in southern Taiwan will
only last until next March or April. In northern Taiwan, there is enough water
to last into May if water for agricultural use is suspended for the first
harvest next spring, Su quoted Wu as saying.</P>
      <P>In line with a central government water rationing plan, the Chianan irrigation
association announced earlier this month that some 18,000 hectares of rice
paddies in the Chianan area of Chiayi and Tainan counties will be left fallow
for the first harvest next year due to the emerging drought.</P>
      <P>According to experts, not much help can be expected early next year, with the
rainfall forecast noticeably lower than previous averages for the period.</P>

      <P>The "pan-green" alliance headed by Taiwan's largest opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) reiterated Saturday that its planned protest march and
rally Sunday in central Taiwan's Taichung City will be held in a peaceful
manner.</P>
      <P>The DPP will "uphold the principles of rationality, peace and non-violence" in
carrying out the "Break the Black Box, Protect our Rice Bowl" protest, DPP
spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said.</P>
      <P>He also expressed  confidence  that 100,000  people  would participate in the
march "if the weather is not too wet and cold."</P>
      <P>Temperatures are expected to drop to 9-12 degrees Celsius in Taichung late
Saturday and climb to 10-16 degrees Sunday, the Central Weather Bureau forecast.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman  Tsai Ing-wen  and most party heavyweights, including former Vice
President Annette Lu, former Premier Su Tseng-chang and former Premier Frank
Hsieh, will join Sunday's march.</P>
      <P>The DPP has accused President Ma Ying-jeou's administration of negotiating an
economic cooperation framework agreement with China without any transparency and
believes the deal would hurt Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>It has therefore organized a series of protests even though the issue has not
been formally placed on the agenda of talks between Taiwan and China to be held
this coming week.</P>
      <P>Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin
will meet on Dec. 22 to sign agreements on fishing crew cooperation,
agricultural  quarantine  inspection, industrial product standards, inspection
and certification, and the avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>In 2008 when Chen was in Taipei City for the second round of cross-strait talks,
bloody squabbles erupted between policemen and DPP supporters.</P>
      <P>Other planned demonstrations will be held Dec. 21-23 during Chen's stay in

to security and public order during the ARATS president's negotiations with
Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation, from Dec.
21-23 in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The DPP and some civil groups have mobilized their followers to launch a large-
scale rally in Taichung Sunday and other protest activities on the following
days to express their appeal for transparency in cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Su told the Taichung mayor that the DPP will not be involved in any "sabotaging"
behavior.</P>
      <P>Over the past few days, Hu has repeatedly called on the DPP to prevent a repeat
of the violent confrontation between protesters and the police that occurred
last year during the second round of Chiang-Chen negotiations in Taipei.</P>
      <P>He has also cautioned policemen not to overreact when facing the protesting
crowds.</P>
      <P>Expressing confidence in the mayor's wisdom to manage the situation, Su said the
DPP, for its part, has set up a command center in Taichung  City and party
officials  on duty will maintain communications with the city government to
reduce the possibility of confrontation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Defendant may refuse night interrogation starting Jan. 1</HEADLINE>

      <P>A recently promulgated amendment to the Criminal Procedure Law, to take effect
Jan. 1, will better protect the human rights of defendants or arrested suspects
because it empowers them to refuse to attend detention hearings after 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>The amendment to Article 93 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that when
the court begins deliberations late at night on a request to detain a suspect or
defendant that is filed after 11 p.m., a party, lawyer or representative may ask
the court to postpone the hearing until the next morning.</P>
      <P>The court cannot deny the defendant's request without proper reasons and should
provide the defendant a proper place to rest, it adds.</P>
      <P>According  to  existing  regulations,  defendants  must  be interrogated
immediately whenever the court decides to proceed with a detention request.</P>
      <P>This often results in a situation where the defendant, who might already be worn
out after being interrogated  by the police, investigation bureaus and
prosecutors, still has to appear in court overnight.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the year, the Judicial Yuan requested all courts to set up waiting
rooms with bedding, a pillow, and disposable bathroom kits for defendants and to
provide them with breakfast.</P>
      <P>"Although most defendants will choose to get the interrogation over with as soon
as possible, and the trial waiting rooms might not be used as often, we still
have to ask all the courts to have such rooms based the need to protect human
rights, " said Hsieh Wen-ting, secretary-general of the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the newly renovated trial waiting chambers at the Taiwan
Taipei District Court, for instance,  are properly furnished similar to budget
hotels. He said the court will display the rooms before the end of the year</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, also as part of the efforts to better protect the defendant's
rights,  the Taipei  district  court has specific regulations that require
alarms and monitoring equipment to be installed in the trial waiting rooms and
that the recordings be preserved for six months.</P>
      <P>Should the defendant feel ill and need medical attention, he will be admitted
into Taipei City Hospital's Heping Branch, and the judicial police will have to
record the entire process and report to the courts on a regular basis by radio,
according to the regulations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taipei district court held a drill last week regarding related
procedures, Huang Chun-ming, a presiding judge at the Taipei district court,
said footage of the defendant when he or she is in the bathroom will be blurred.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An agreement on cross-strait taxation is expected to be signed during the fourth
round of negotiations between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Strait Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , in the coming week. Finance Minister Lee
Sush-der said the agreement will help protect Taiwanese businessmen operating in
China, lowering the burden of taxpayers and increasing the government's tax
revenues.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue: China Times:</P>
      <P>While four agreements are expected to be signed during the Chiang-Chen
negotiations next week,  some Taiwanese businessmen believe that the signing of
a cross-strait investment protection agreement should have been the priority,
and it is regretful that the negotiation of such an agreement was not included.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Sheng-chung said that although an investment
protection agreement will not be included in the fourth round of the Chen-Chiang
negotiations, it doesn't mean that it will be excluded in future negotiations.
As long as the policy of opening Chinese investment in Taiwan is effectively
implemented, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will make the discussion of an
investment protection agreement one of the priorities on the agenda of the next
round of talks.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that no discussion on an investment protection agreement has
been held, because up to date cross-strait investment has remained unbalanced,
with far more Taiwanese investment in China than vice versa. Economic Daily
News:</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der emphasized that the cross-strait taxation
agreement will be signed next week based on the principles of equality,
reciprocity, and mutual benefit and the safeguarding of Taiwanese businessmen's
rights and welfare.</P>
      <P>Lee maintained that the more a country relies on trade, the more it needs to
conclude taxation agreements with other countries. By signing a cross-strait
taxation agreement, it is expected Taiwan will be able to conclude such
agreements with more countries, thus improving its competitiveness in
international trade, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Israel became the 17th country to have signed a taxation agreement
with Taiwan by signing a bilateral double taxation avoidance agreement on Dec.
18, Lee said, adding that there are three similar agreements still under
negotiation. Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>As a cross-strait taxation agreement is expected to be signed during the fourth
round Chiang-Chen negotiations next week, some Taiwanese businessmen are worried
that they will be prodded for their tax records.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der has suggested that signing taxation agreements
with other countries  would help improve  Taiwan's competitiveness in
international trade, and he didn't think local businessmen should worry about
being harassed over taxation.</P>
      <P>However, Professor Norman Yin of National Chengchi University said that the
concerns of the Taiwanese businessmen should be noted. He suggested that before
signing the agreement, the negotiators must clarify its content and make known
that the agreement is specifically for the avoidance of double taxation.</P>

      <P>The Asia Pacific Film Festival took to the stage in southern Taiwan Saturday
after a two-year hiatus, with Taiwan taking home five awards, including those
for best director and best actress.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese filmmaker Leon Dai won the best director award for his film No Puedo
Vivir Sin Ti, which was a five-time winner at this year's Golden Horse Awards,
Taiwan's version of the Oscars.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsiang-yu, who had never before helped produce a film, won the best
cinematography award for his work on Dai's film. It was also the first award
that Taiwan won on the night.</P>
      <P>The best documentary award went to Baseball Boy, a Taiwanese film that has been
sold to France and South Korea, according to a representative from the Public
Television Service station, which partially funded the film.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese-French actress Sandrine Pinna won the best actress award for her work
in the film Yang Yang, while Hopscotch, a 28-minute drama, earned another honor
for Taiwan by winning the best short film award.</P>
      <P>World-renowned filmmaker John Woo of Hong Kong received the lifetime achievement
award. "When I use these eyeglasses (reading glasses) , " he said, "it is about
time to get a life achievement award."</P>
      <P>Halfway through the ceremony, an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richer scale
rocked Taiwan for around 20 seconds and created a panic among the audience,
including those from abroad who had never experienced an earthquake before. It
did not disrupt the ceremony, however.</P>
      <P>This year's awards presentation also featured Azharuddin Ismail and Rubina Ali,
child stars in the Oscar-winning Indian film Slumdog Millionaire, as well as
South Korean pop group Super Junior-M.</P>
      <P>The festival saw 16 member countries taking part, along with 58 films competing
for a total of 15 awards. The festival has a total of 18 members.</P>
      <P>The film festival was suspended for two years due to the global economic crisis.
It is the annual event of the Federation of Motion Picture Producers in Asia
Pacific, and its secretariat is based in Taipei.</P>

      <P>A recently promulgated amendment to the Criminal Procedure Law, to take effect
Jan. 1, will better protect the human rights of defendants or arrested suspects
because it empowers them to refuse to attend detention hearings after 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>The amendment to Article 93 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that when
the court begins deliberations late at night on a request to detain a suspect or
defendant that is filed after 11 p.m., a party, lawyer or representative may ask
the court to postpone the hearing until the next morning.</P>
      <P>The court cannot deny the defendant's request without proper reasons and should
provide the defendant a proper place to rest, it adds.</P>
      <P>According  to  existing  regulations,  defendants  must  be interrogated
immediately whenever the court decides to proceed with a detention request.</P>
      <P>This often results in a situation where the defendant, who might already be worn
out after being interrogated  by the police, investigation bureaus and
prosecutors, still has to appear in court overnight.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the year, the Judicial Yuan requested all courts to set up waiting
rooms with bedding, a pillow, and disposable bathroom kits for defendants and to
provide them with breakfast.</P>
      <P>"Although most defendants will choose to get the interrogation over with as soon
as possible, and the trial waiting rooms might not be used as often, we still
have to ask all the courts to have such rooms based the need to protect human
rights, " said Hsieh Wen-ting, secretary-general of the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the newly renovated trial waiting chambers at the Taiwan
Taipei District Court, for instance,  are properly furnished similar to budget
hotels. He said the court will display the rooms before the end of the year</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, also as part of the efforts to better protect the defendant's
rights,  the Taipei  district  court has specific regulations that require
alarms and monitoring equipment to be installed in the trial waiting rooms and
that the recordings be preserved for six months.</P>
      <P>Should the defendant feel ill and need medical attention, he will be admitted
into Taipei City Hospital's Heping Branch, and the judicial police will have to
record the entire process and report to the courts on a regular basis by radio,
according to the regulations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taipei district court held a drill last week regarding related
procedures, Huang Chun-ming, a presiding judge at the Taipei district court,
said footage of the defendant when he or she is in the bathroom will be blurred.</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan suggested
Saturday that Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS), must not travel around while in Taiwan to avoid giving
the impression of "conducting an inspection," which could be provocative.</P>
      <P>Chen had previously expressed his desire to visit some victims of Typhoon
Morakot while in Taiwan, but it remains unclear if any such trip has been
arranged or if Su's advice will be taken.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by party officials from the DPP's branches in Taichung City and
Taichung County, Su called on Taichung Mayor Jason Hu to discuss issues related

Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation, from Dec.
21-23 in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The DPP and some civil groups have mobilized their followers to launch a large-

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day - News digest of local media - Street protest</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/20/09  16:08:01
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of the arrival of China's top negotiator with Taiwan for a new round
of high-level talks, pro-independence activists, led by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , are taking to the streets in the central
city of Taichung Sunday to protest what they call the President Ma Ying-jeou
administration's pandering to China at the expense of Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>While organizers have guaranteed that street protests will be peaceful and
rational, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu has also vowed not to treat the protesters as
rioters. Hu also said he would take full responsibility if the police abused
their power and hurt civilians during demonstrations.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits is scheduled to arrive in Taichung Monday for a second visit.
During his Dec. 21-25 stay, he will sign with his Taiwanese counterpart, Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, four agreements covering
cooperation on fishing crew issues, double taxation, industrial product
standards and agricultural quarantine.</P>
      <P>Like  the nine  agreements  that President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration has
signed with China in the past 18 months without popular consent, the soon-to-be-
signed four agreements have also not been approved or screened by the
Legislature.</P>
      <P>With that in mind, the DPP and other civic groups are organizing street marches
in Taichung to voice their opposition to the Ma administration's China-leaning
policy. DPP officials said all those who are concerned  about Taiwan's political
future,  economic well-being and their own job prospects and welfare rights are
welcome to join the protests.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>As in the past, the DPP is welcoming the latest round of Chiang-Chen talks with
a mass movement.</P>
      <P>During Chen's first visit to Taiwan in 2008, bloody clashes erupted between DPP
supporters  and law enforcement  officers, tarnishing the country's image.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen is clearly aware that if the street protests get out
of hand, the party will have to pay the price in the upcoming legislative by-
elections and even in elections for mayors of five municipalities to be held
late next year.</P>
      <P>Sunday's street rally will just be a prelude. The real test to Tsai's leadership
will come in the next five days with the presence of China's top envoy in
Taiwan. Her political career will see a breakthrough only if the DPP can cut a
balance between making its political stance heard and applying heat on Taiwanese
and Chinese authorities with a mass movement.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan paid a visit to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
Saturday to convey his party's hope that during Sunday's "100,000-persons
protest march,  " there would be no recurrence of incidents seen in Chen
Yunlin's first visit to Taipei last year, in which police officers forcibly took
away national flags held by demonstrators and tried to stop a music CD shop from
playing Taiwanese folk songs.</P>
      <P>Su also assured Hu that the party has set up an emergency response center and
will do its utmost to keep the protest march orderly and peaceful.</P>
      <P>In response, Hu said he is confident of the DPP's sincerity to avoid violence in
street rallies.</P>
      <P>Describing the planned protests as "typhoons, " Hu said it would be best if
typhoons never hit. "Our democracy will take a stride forward if 'typhoons'
become 'breezes,'" he added.</P>

12/20/09  16:21:40

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's high court ruled Saturday that S$2.1 million (US$1.49 million) in a
Singapore bank account held by Wu Shih-tsai, a key figure in a diplomatic fraud
scandal that rocked the previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government,
be returned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The sum that had been in Wu's OCBC Bank account since 2006 was only a small part
of the US$29.8 million that Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) wired
into a joint account held by Wu and Ching Chi Ju at the same bank on Sept. 15,
2006.</P>
      <P>The money was meant to help the two middlemen broker the establishment of
diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Papua New Guinea, but most of it later
disappeared without any progress in relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to the Singapore court's ruling, Taiwan's government can continue to
retrieve the balance of the payment from Wu over the next 12 years.</P>
      <P>Wu is presently doing time in a Taiwan jail after he was convicted in October
2008 of forgery and making false accusations and sentenced to 28 months in jail.
He began serving time in May 2009.</P>
      <P>Wu was indicted on the charges by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office after
it discovered that Wu gave the MOFA a false bank statement to account for the
money.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also asserted that Wu falsely claimed, after the scandal became
public in May 2008, that he had been threatened at gunpoint.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ching, who was commissioned by the MOFA in 2006 to help broker the
diplomatic initiative, allegedly embezzled most of the US$29.8 million that was
intended as aid to the Pacific nation to help smooth the way in establishing
formal ties.</P>
      <P>Ching, whose whereabouts are unknown, had his lawyer tell the Singapore High
Court that he had not embezzled the money and that it could not be returned
because most of it had been spent as "grease money" to help advance the
diplomatic initiative.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over 100 aftershocks reported after Saturday's strong quake</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 129 aftershocks have been recorded as of noon Sunday after a
magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit Taiwan Saturday at 9:02 p.m., the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) said.</P>
      <P>Kuo Kai-wen, director of CWB's Seismology Center, said the strong quake and
later aftershocks are normal seismic energy release, and he urged the public "to
be on guard" but said there was no need to panic.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Saturday's quake, whose epicenter was 25.5 kilometers southeast of
Hualien City off the coast of Hualien County in eastern Taiwan, resulted from
friction between the Eurasian Plate and Philippine plate, which converge off
Taiwan's east coast.</P>
      <P>Because it struck at a depth of 45.9 kilometers, its impact was less than if it
had been shallower, Kuo said, but he expected seismic energy to continue to be
released.</P>
      <P>"It is estimated that there will be aftershocks with magnitudes of less than 6.8
in the next few days," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Kuo also said that compared with the more than 1,000 aftershocks that occurred
within 24 hours after a magnitude 7.3 temblor hit Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, the
aftershocks after Saturday's quake were relatively mild.</P>
      <P>Eleven people suffered minor injuries in Hualien, and other minor damage was
reported elsewhere after Saturday's quake.</P>
      <P>Yuching Bridge in northern Taiwan's Miaoli City was sealed off for inspection
Sunday after its expansion joint opened wider because of the earthquake.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli County government said the bridge poses no immediate danger, but it
decided to close out of safety considerations.</P>
      <P>Among the 11 injured in Hualien Saturday, 10 were tourists at a Hualien City
hotel whose discomfort may have been caused by chlorine leaking from a pipe that
ruptured during the earthquake.</P>
      <P>The other injured person, a 16-year-old boy, was hit by a falling rock in Siulin
Township, Hualien County.</P>
      <P>Provincial Highway 11 was disrupted by landslides at its 40 kilometer marker,
but the road was later cleared and traffic returned to normal.</P>
      <P>Also, some 9,000 households were left without electricity after the Rueisuei
transformer station in Hualien County's Kuangfu Township broke down, but power
has since been restored in the area.</P>

      <P>Delegations of travel agency managers from Hangzhou and Ningbo in China's
Zhejiang province will visit tourist destinations in Kaohsiung and Pingtung in
southern Taiwan next spring, a Kaohsiung City government official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The planned tours, resulting from a recent tourism promotion trip to the two
Chinese cities by a tourism industry alliance from Kaohsiung City and County and
Pingtung County, are expected to give a boost to southern Taiwan's tourism
sector, said Lai Jui-long, chief secretary of the Kaohsiung City Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>A number of Chinese tour groups reportedly canceled trips to Kaohsiung City
following a controversial visit by exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai
Lama in late August and the screening of a documentary about the exiled leader
of China's Uighur minority, Rebiya Kadeer, in the city in September.</P>
      <P>The city government has since come under pressure to work out measures to
respond to speculation  that Chinese tourists are boycotting Kaohsiung over the
issues.</P>
      <P>As part of their efforts to save local tourism, Lai and Pingtung County and
Kaohsiung County officials joined the industry alliance in traveling to Hangzhou
and Ningbo, where they held two tourism promotion events to spark interest in
southern Taiwan as a travel destination among Chinese tour operators, Lai said.</P>
      <P>During their visit, the delegation interacted positively with Zhejiang tourism
officials and exchanged views on boosting city tourism on both sides, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Zhejiang tourism officials said that visitors from their province account for
one-fifth of total Chinese arrivals in Taiwan and told Lai they hoped the
promotional campaigns would help attract more Zhejiang natives to southern
Taiwan and give the tourism sector there a lift.</P>
      <P>Lai said travel agencies in Hangzhou and Ningbo were well positioned to arrange
convenient five-day packages to southern Taiwan because there are seven weekly
nonstop flights between Kaohsiung International Airport and the two Chinese
cities.</P>
      <P>Tour operators have begun devising customized tours for the two Chinese travel
agent delegations, and Lai said the Kaohsiung City government in particular will
offer them special deals, including giving them free admission to sightseeing
cruises around Kaohsiung's port.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will continue to track down nearly US$30 million that was allegedly
stolen by two diplomatic brokers three years ago, the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office vowed Sunday.</P>
      <P>Local prosecutors have maintained contact with their counterparts in Singapore
and the United States in a bid to recover the US$29.8 million (NT$965 million)
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) wired to a Singapore bank on Sept.
15, 2006, ostensibly to facilitate the establishment of diplomatic ties with
Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The money was remitted to an account at Singapore's OCBC Bank jointly held by
the two brokers, Wu Shih-Tsai, a Singaporean national, and his partner Ching Chi
Ju, a Taiwanese with a U.S. passport who was commissioned by the MOFA in 2006 to
help facilitate a deal to establish diplomatic ties with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The MOFA asked Wu and Ching for a statement of account early last year after
finding that by Dec. 1, 2006, the money in the joint account had disappeared
without any progress being made on the initiative with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>Wu, without knowing that the MOFA had been aware of the fraud, produced a false
bank statement from his own notebook computer and gave it to the ministry.</P>
      <P>He was taken into custody by prosecutors in May 2008 and indicted for forging
the bank statement and making false accusations in September 2008. He was found
guilty of the charges a month later and sentenced to 28 months in prison.</P>
      <P>The scandal came to light May 1, 2008, when a Singaporean daily reported that
the Singapore  High Court had approved Taiwan's application for an injunction to
freeze the joint bank account held by Wu and Ching.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, Taiwan has had NT$300 million worth of bank
accounts held by Wu and Ching and property Wu bought in Taipei City frozen. Some
NT$70 million of the assets are in Wu's name.</P>
      <P>The Singapore High Court ruled Saturday that the S$2.1 million (US$1.49 million)
that had been in another of Wu's accounts at Singapore OCBC Bank be returned to
Taiwan's authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei prosecutors listed Ching, who is said to be living at his home
in California, as one of Taiwan's most wanted fugitives last May as they
continued their investigation into the case.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office said it had asked for judicial assistance
from the U.S. government in the investigation and suggested having U.S.
prosecutors interrogate Ching on Taiwan's behalf or sending their own people to
California to question Ching themselves.</P>
      <P>They have yet to receive a response from the U.S. government.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will preside over a briefing on security and police
preparedness in Taichung on Monday, the day when China's top negotiator with
Taiwan is scheduled to arrive for the latest round of high-level cross-strait
talks, the Presidential Office said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The president will listen to officials' reports and issue directives regarding
public order in the central Taiwan city, where the fourth  meeting  between
Chen Yunlin,  president  of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits, and his Taiwan counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
Straits Exchange  Foundation,  will take place,  said Paul K.  Chang, director-
general of the Presidential Office's Department of Public Affairs.</P>
      <P>Highly concerned about public order in Taichung because of plans by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to stage protests during Chen's
stay there from Dec. 21-25, President Ma will preside in person over the meeting
on public order, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office meetings on public order are usually overseen by the deputy
secretary of the office, he added.</P>
      <P>Ranking officials from the National Security Council,  the National Police
Agency and the Government Information Office are also expected to attend.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Presidential Office believes Chen and his group are guests and
are entitled to safety, comfort and dignity during their visit.</P>
      <P>"We should behave ourselves with grace as hosts," Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to a ruling Kuomintang heavyweight who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Ma presided over a similar security meeting in early November 2008
before Chen Yunlin set foot on Taiwan's soil for the first time.</P>
      <P>The DPP, however, held massive protests outside the Grand Hotel in Taipei City
where Chen and his group stayed. One of the protests, staged outside the Grand
Formosa Regent where Chen was having dinner, forced the Chinese diplomat to stay
in the hotel until the early hours of the morning.</P>
      <P>Ma will remind those attending  Monday's  meeting that if undesirable scenarios
occur during Chen's visit in Taichung, law enforcement authorities should handle
the situations and respond in real time, according to Chang.</P>

      <P>Large crowds took to the streets in Taichung to protest the government's China
policy a day before China's top negotiator on Taiwan affairs was to arrive for
another round of talks on bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>The massive protest march in central Taiwan was organized by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and pro-independence civic groups to drive
home their belief that the government's strengthening of economic ties with
China is undermining Taiwan's sovereign status and threatening its people's
economic well-being.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said DPP supporters have turned out in droves to
oppose the President Ma Ying-jeou administration's lack of transparency in
negotiating deals with China, which prevents any form of supervision by the
people and puts the country's interests at risk.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits, is expected to sign four agreements  with his Taiwanese
counterpart,  Straits  Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, during his
stay from Dec. 21-25.</P>
      <P>The accords will cover cooperation on fishing crew issues, double taxation,
industrial product standards and agricultural quarantine.</P>
      <P>Dubbing Sunday's protest as a march to "break the black box and protect the rice
bowl, " DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan said an estimated 100,000 people
were expected to join an evening rally near the city's open-air circular
theater.</P>
      <P>DPP supporters began to converge at Taichung's Anhe Road and Mincyuan Road,
respectively, and long lines had formed at the two gathering points by 2:30 p.m.
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Demonstrators from central Taiwan gathered at the intersection of Jhonggang Road
and Mincyuan Road and started to walk toward the rally site at 3: 30 p.m. under
the leadership of Su and Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Kun-huei.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, protesters from northern and southern Taiwan, headed by
Tsai and other DPP bigwigs, also began the march from the intersection of Anhe
Road and Chaoma Road.</P>
      <P>Both marches proceeded in an orderly fashion, with police officers and DPP
members helping keep traffic flowing along the thoroughfares where the
processions passed.</P>
      <P>Braving chilly weather, demonstraters waved brightly colored anti-China and
anti-government banners and placards, and in some spots the parades resembled
street carnivals.</P>
      <P>Chen Ta-chun, head of the DPP's Taichung chapter, led the demonstrators in
chanting pro-independnece slogans such as "Taiwan and China, one side one
country" and "Cross-Strait Affairs, Listen to the People's Voices" to boost
morale.</P>
      <P>He said he was confident that the number of protesters would reach the party's
target of 100,000 when the evening rally began later in the day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT will sort out principles on handling its assets by year end</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly appointed secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , King Pu-
tsung, said Sunday that the direction and principles the party will follow in
handling its assets will be determined by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>King made the pledge during a visit to the eastern city of Taitung, where a
grassroots KMT worker urged him to boldly and resolutely deal with the
controversial party asset issue.</P>
      <P>The opposition contends that the KMT's assets were illegally obtained during its
decades of authoritarian rule in the second half of the 20th century when the
lines between state and party were blurred.</P>
      <P>King was also told that the KMT has suffered from a shortage of workers in the
Taitung area and that the roles of those working for the party were ill-defined.</P>
      <P>He replied that the roles of grassroots party workers have changed with the
political environment.</P>
      <P>"In the past, their jobs focused on providing services and seeking help for
constituents, but now they should help reflect the people's plight and search
for problems," he said.</P>
      <P>Fielding complaints about President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman,
King said that nobody is perfect and that if Ma has some shortcomings, the
people around him, including King himself, will fill in the gaps.</P>
      <P>"Chairman Ma is a man who is willing to reflect on his behavior," King told his
audience.</P>
      <P>King had been a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution, a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, since September before being tapped to take over the
party's day-to-day affairs.</P>
      <P>While King is expected to dedicate  much of his time to legislative by-elections
scheduled for Jan. 9 and Feb. 27 and mayoral elections in five special
municipalities in December, the party asset issue, which is often used by the
opposition to attack the KMT, will also be a priority, according to King's
predecessor, Chan Chuen-po.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President vows to strive for FTAs after inking ECFA with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Changhua,  Taiwan,  Dec.  20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday the government will continue its efforts to
seal free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries after signing a proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Ma also said during a meeting with representatives of stockings manufacturers in
the central county of Changhua that the government will negotiate the ECFA with
China based on the principle that Taiwan is the focus and that the interests of
the public come first, and he also said the document will be subject to
legislative review.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated that only Taiwan and North Korea among Asia Pacific
countries have not signed FTAs with other countries in the region, which
threatens to marginalize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that after the ECFA is signed, the administration will try to seal FTAs
with other countries and will not ask China for its approval to sign them
"because Taiwan is a sovereign independent country."</P>
      <P>Free trade deals can only be signed if both sides are willing to do so, Ma said,
but he argued that once an ECFA is signed with China, other countries will be
more willing to sign FTAs with Taiwan because China's suppression of such deals
would be reduced.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, Ma told farmers during a tour of an eustoma flower export
production zone in Changhua that he has honored his pledge not to further open
Taiwan's market to Chinese agricultural products since assuming office in May
2008.</P>
      <P>He noted that of the 1,415 Chinese agricultural products allowed to be imported
into Taiwan, 479 items were approved by the previous Kuomintang administration
and the other 936 were approved by the Democratic Progressive Party when it was
in power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>17 local chiefs assume posts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The individuals elected on Dec. 5 to head 17 cities and counties in Taiwan
assumed their posts Sunday with varying levels of creativity and articulated
their visions for their four-year terms.</P>
      <P>Of the 17 local chiefs, 12 are from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), four are from
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and one is an independent,
who quickly installed his ex-wife as his deputy.</P>
      <P>In perhaps the most stunning debut of any of the newly elected magistrates,
independent Fu Kun-chi appointed his ex-wife Hsu Chen-wei, who he apparently
recently divorced, as his deputy in his inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>Fu said the appointment was in line with regulations and stressed that his
family "has made preparations to sacrifice for the sake of Hualien's
development."</P>
      <P>Fu said Deputy Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang inquired about his decision in
the evening, and he clearly explained to him that he had completed divorce
proceedings and that the appointment was legal.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's laws, a married couple cannot serve as the magistrate and deputy
magistrate of a county.</P>
      <P>Fu represented the KMT as a legislator, but the party did not nominate him as
its candidate in the Hualien County magistrate election because he is currently
being tried in separate cases for violating securities transaction laws.</P>
      <P>He has already been convicted of one crime, and if his appeal is rejected, he
will have to relinquish his post.</P>
      <P>Despite his legal problems, Fu ran as an independent and handily defeated the
KMT's official nominee and one other rival.</P>
      <P>He complained Sunday that the central government had tried to smear his
reputation before and after the election but insisted on his innocence and vowed
to do everything he could for Hualien residents.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching began his second term in office by
offering a cash award of NT$1 million (US$30,960) to anyone who could provide a
good idea on how the county's most scenic spot -- Sun Moon Lake -- could tie the
knot with the West Lake in Hangzhou, in China's Zhejiang province.</P>
      <P>Lee said that when he first assumed office four years ago, he promoted the plan
without success.</P>
      <P>"I hope all residents of the county can help me in coming with a good way or
idea to stage the marriage so as to draw international attention and
participation and promote the status and development of Sun Moon Lake," he said.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan County, former Legislator John Chih-yang Wu greeted wellwishers,
including Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, his father and KMT honorary Chairman Wu
Poh-hsiung, past magistrates and hundreds of political and business figures, in
Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka and aboriginal dialects.</P>
      <P>Wu said that he hopes to become the most tolerant and loving magistrate in
Taoyuan County's history, and vowed to complete major infrastructure projects,
including turning the area around its international airport into an aviation
city and building a mass rapid transit system, while also pushing to upgrade the
county into a municipality.</P>
      <P>Chu, who served as Taoyuan County magistrate before leaving to become vice
premier in September, lauded Wu for his dynamism, expertise and ideals.</P>
      <P>In Hsinchu County, former Legislator Chiu Ching-chun, who emerged victorious
from a fierce election battle, vowed to solicit more private sector investment
in the county to help improve its finances.</P>
      <P>In Taitung County,  newly elected magistrate  Justin Huang reaffirmed his focus
on tourism, the economy, culture, education, agriculture and care for
underprivileged groups.</P>
      <P>The former KMT legislator vowed to make the eastern Taiwan county more
progressive and prosperous, before heading to a settlement center in Dawu
Township to visit people who were displaced from their homes by Typhoon Morakot
in August.</P>
      <P>In Chiayi City, Huang Ming-hui began her second term in office, saying that she
will focus on improving the southern Taiwan city's infrastructure and seek out
opportunities to host major events to help market Chiayi and stimulate the local
economy.</P>
      <P>In Keelung City, incumbent mayor Chang Tung-jung noted that a marine science
museum will open in 2012, which is expected to bring 2 million tourists to the
northern Taiwan city every year.</P>
      <P>Chang said the city will now engage in peripheral traffic network planning.</P>
      <P>In outlying Kinmen County, which lies just kilometers from China's coast, newly
elected magistrate Lee Wo-shih hopes to bring world-class infrastructure to the
county so that its residents will have higher incomes, excellent environmental
quality and health protection.</P>
      <P>In Matsu, the county's new magistrate Yang Sui-sheng vowed to overcome its
difficulties as an outlying island by making it a duty-free area to attract
tourists from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa said Sunday that although the county's
financial situation is dire, he will continue to push for a strong social
welfare policy in his second term.</P>
      <P>Among the four counties headed by DPP politicians, Yilan County Magistrate Lin
Tsung-hsien vowed to push the county's anti-flooding efforts and sponsor the
Yilan Green Expo and children's festival in the next half year.</P>
      <P>Chiayi County has its first female magistrate, with former DPP Legislator Chang
Hwa-kuan taking the helm from her predecesor Chen Ming-wen.</P>
      <P>Chang hoped that county's administrative team will improve services and upgrade
its efficiency. She also hoped that the central government will help narrow the
urban-rural gap seen in the county.</P>
      <P>In Yunlin County, Su Chih-fen said that in her second term, she will continue to
push to make the county into an agriculture stronghold.</P>
      <P>Considering the close relationship between water and people's lives,  she said
she will  craft  ecological,  environmental, agricultural,  water control,  and
education policies from the perspective of their impact on the county's water
resources.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung County, incumbent Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung launched a "Pingtung
taking off" remote-control airplane to symbolize the taking off of the southern
Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Tsao said he would work to develop the solar power industry and turn
Siaoliouchiou into a low-carbon islet. With the bicycle network in the county
nearing completion, he said Pingtung will be the county that puts the most
effort into energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tens of thousands march to protest trade pact with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
12/20/09  22:04:22
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tens of thousands of Taiwanese marched in the central Taiwan city of Taichung to
protest the government's plan to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The rally took place one day before Chen Yunlin, chairman of China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , arrives here to sign four
economic agreements with his Taiwan counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), but the ECFA is not on the meeting's
formal agenda.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and local civic groups said
the purpose of the protest was to call attention to the poor overall performance
of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration and the lack of transparency in its
negotiations on the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>Braving strong winds in temperatures of around 10 degrees Celsius,  pro-
independence  protesters  from across the country assembled in downtown Taichung
for the rally after marching in two separate legs in the city.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is facing three problems. The first problem is Ma, the second problem is
Ma. The third problem is still Ma, " DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen told the crowd.</P>
      <P>Polls show that the president is leading Taiwan to unification (with China), she
said, adding that "the biggest problem is that we have a president who is only
focused on unifying with China."</P>
      <P>Tsai said people gathered because no one knows what the president is doing,
especially on the ECFA, which Ma argues Taiwan must sign or it will be
marginalized.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is expected to be included in the next round of talks between both
sides, which is scheduled to take place in the first half of 2010 in China.</P>
      <P>Tsai accused Ma of never explaining the ECFA clearly and of refusing to
communicate with the people, the Legislative Yuan or the opposition on its
contents.</P>
      <P>The only beneficiaries from the ECFA are big corporations, while many ordinary
people will lose their jobs because of it, Tsai contended,  adding that the
president has never disclosed its potential adverse impact on Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>An economic model run by the Ministry of Economic Affairs found that Taiwan
would gain a net 260,000 jobs if an ECFA was signed, while the Council of Labor
Affairs estimated it would create a net 105,000 to 125,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Both models acknowledged,  however,  that some workers  in vulnerable industries
could lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>Almost all the DPP heavyweights showed up and spoke to the gathered crowd.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan signs the ECFA with China, President Ma should also ask China to help
Taiwan sign FTAs with other countries, such as Japan and South Korea, so Taiwan
will be able to trade with others as well, " said former Vice President Annette
Lu.</P>
      <P>In the days leading up to Sunday's protest rally, the DPP said it hoped to
mobilize 100,000 people, and the party estimated after the event that the
turnout had surpassed its goal. The Taichung City government, on the other hand,
put the turnout at 31,000.</P>
      <P>Fears that clashes would break out never materialized. Taichung City government
spokesperson Tsou Mei-liang earlier said that no confrontations took place
Sunday, and it was not a surprise since "the protest was legally applied for and
all arrangements had been implemented beforehand."</P>
      <P>Prior to the main rally, the protesters marched for more than two hours in
Taichung's streets, and made the most noise when they walked past the Windsor
Hotel, where Chen will stay during his five-day stay, to express their
displeasure over the Chinese negotiator's visit.</P>
      <P>The crowds chanted slogans such as "Taiwan and China; one country on each side"
as they marched, while others expressed their views in more colorful ways.</P>
      <P>A senior citizen from Chiayi City showed everyone a picture of Ma wearing only a
swimming suit and said "this is all he does -- swim."</P>
      <P>A protester surnamed Hsu, who came from the southern city of Tainan complained
not only about the government's China policy but also security precautions taken
for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>"We don't want a trade agreement with China. And all these barricades, security
deployments and traffic controls for a Chinese representative are outrageous.
The Taichung City police should remove them all."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Restrictions on hiring foreign caregivers should remain: foundation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should reconsider its plan to ease restrictions on hiring foreign
caregivers or maids because such a move could deprive local middle-aged and
older women of job opportunities, an advocacy group said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is considering allowing families that have
two members in their 80s or one member older than 90 plus a toddler under one
year of age to apply to hire foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>"On the surface, the proposed liberalization is not large, but in effect, its
impact on local women, particularly those in middle or senior age groups, would
be great, " said Lin Shih-chia, chairman of the Peng Wan-ju Foundation.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, foreign caregivers who have come to Taiwan on caregiving
contracts usually have to do all sorts of household chores, such as cleaning the
house, washing clothes, and cooking, the jobs that in many cases are currently
done by middle-aged local women.</P>
      <P>"As a result, middle-aged and senior women's job opportunities could be
affected, " Lin explained.</P>
      <P>An initial estimate shows that at least 10,000 local women could fall victim to
the proposed measure, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the foundation has offered training courses for local women who
want to work as maids. In 2009 alone, Lin said, the foundation successfully
helped mediate 13,442 maid contracts worth more than NT$900 million.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Lin said, the in-home service market has grown steadily.</P>
      <P>"The Cabinet-level CLA should not ignore potential market demand and should
instead adopt measures to boost the development of this line of service which is
especially suitable for middle-  or senior-aged women to undertake," Lin said.</P>
      <P>With an average service charge ranging between NT$180 and NT$250 per hour, a
well-trained or trusted live-in maid can earn more than NT$30,000 a month, Lin
said.</P>

      <P>Leon Dai showed no sign of happiness Saturday evening after accepting the best
director award for his film No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti at the 53rd Asian Pacific Film
Festival, as he criticized ruthless newspapers that failed to respect the
positions of others.</P>
      <P>"I am afraid that I have opened a 'Pandora's Box, '" said Dai, referring to his
movie which was based on the true story of a single father's frustration over
his efforts to maintain legal custody of his daughter.</P>
      <P>The film won five awards, including best director, at Taiwan's Golden Horse Film
Festival last month.</P>
      <P>After accepting his award, the director mentioned that he was sorry to find that
two newspapers played on his movie's name to call attention to stories published
Saturday about single fathers who had abused their daughters, a far cry from the
film's narrative of a father's devotion to his daughter.</P>
      <P>The director said that he was in no mood to be happy about receiving another
award because he found some media had manipulated the theme of his film and that
society had little sympathy for others.</P>
      <P>"I spent three years to produce a film with an intention to provide some
positive energy to society, and I am afraid that I have opened a 'Pandora's box'
and incurred negativity instead, " he said.</P>

      <P>The Asia Pacific Film Festival took to the stage in southern Taiwan Saturday
after a two-year hiatus, with Taiwan taking home five awards, including those
for best director and best actress.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese filmmaker Leon Dai won the best director award for his film No Puedo
Vivir Sin Ti, which was a five-time winner at this year's Golden Horse Awards,
Taiwan's version of the Oscars.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsiang-yu, who had never before helped produce a film, won the best
cinematography award for his work on Dai's film. It was also the first award
that Taiwan won on the night.</P>
      <P>The best documentary award went to Baseball Boy, a Taiwanese film that has been
sold to France and South Korea, according to a representative from the Public
Television Service station, which partially funded the film.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese-French actress Sandrine Pinna won the best actress award for her work
in the film Yang Yang, while Hopscotch, a 28-minute drama, earned another honor
for Taiwan by winning the best short film award.</P>
      <P>World-renowned filmmaker John Woo of Hong Kong received the lifetime achievement
award. "When I use these eyeglasses (reading glasses) , " he said, "it is about
time to get a life achievement award."</P>
      <P>Halfway through the ceremony, an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richer scale
rocked Taiwan for around 20 seconds and created a panic among the audience,
including those from abroad who had never experienced an earthquake before. It
did not disrupt the ceremony, however.</P>
      <P>This year's awards presentation also featured Azharuddin Ismail and Rubina Ali,
child stars in the Oscar-winning Indian film Slumdog Millionaire, as well as
South Korean pop group Super Junior-M.</P>
      <P>The festival saw 16 member countries taking part, along with 58 films competing
for a total of 15 awards. The festival has a total of 18 members.</P>
      <P>The film festival was suspended for two years due to the global economic crisis.
It is the annual event of the Federation of Motion Picture Producers in Asia
Pacific, and its secretariat is based in Taipei.</P>

      <P>A recently promulgated amendment to the Criminal Procedure Law, to take effect
Jan. 1, will better protect the human rights of defendants or arrested suspects
because it empowers them to refuse to attend detention hearings after 11 p.m.</P>
      <P>The amendment to Article 93 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that when
the court begins deliberations late at night on a request to detain a suspect or
defendant that is filed after 11 p.m., a party, lawyer or representative may ask
the court to postpone the hearing until the next morning.</P>
      <P>The court cannot deny the defendant's request without proper reasons and should
provide the defendant a proper place to rest, it adds.</P>
      <P>According  to  existing  regulations,  defendants  must  be interrogated
immediately whenever the court decides to proceed with a detention request.</P>
      <P>This often results in a situation where the defendant, who might already be worn
out after being interrogated  by the police, investigation bureaus and
prosecutors, still has to appear in court overnight.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the year, the Judicial Yuan requested all courts to set up waiting
rooms with bedding, a pillow, and disposable bathroom kits for defendants and to
provide them with breakfast.</P>
      <P>"Although most defendants will choose to get the interrogation over with as soon
as possible, and the trial waiting rooms might not be used as often, we still
have to ask all the courts to have such rooms based the need to protect human
rights, " said Hsieh Wen-ting, secretary-general of the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the newly renovated trial waiting chambers at the Taiwan
Taipei District Court, for instance,  are properly furnished similar to budget
hotels. He said the court will display the rooms before the end of the year</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, also as part of the efforts to better protect the defendant's
rights,  the Taipei  district  court has specific regulations that require
alarms and monitoring equipment to be installed in the trial waiting rooms and
that the recordings be preserved for six months.</P>
      <P>Should the defendant feel ill and need medical attention, he will be admitted
into Taipei City Hospital's Heping Branch, and the judicial police will have to
record the entire process and report to the courts on a regular basis by radio,
according to the regulations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taipei district court held a drill last week regarding related
procedures, Huang Chun-ming, a presiding judge at the Taipei district court,
said footage of the defendant when he or she is in the bathroom will be blurred.</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan suggested
Saturday that Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS), must not travel around while in Taiwan to avoid giving
the impression of "conducting an inspection," which could be provocative.</P>
      <P>Chen had previously expressed his desire to visit some victims of Typhoon
Morakot while in Taiwan, but it remains unclear if any such trip has been
arranged or if Su's advice will be taken.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by party officials from the DPP's branches in Taichung City and

Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation, from Dec.
21-23 in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The DPP and some civil groups have mobilized their followers to launch a large-

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day - News digest of local media - Street protest</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/20/09  16:08:01
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of the arrival of China's top negotiator with Taiwan for a new round
of high-level talks, pro-independence activists, led by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , are taking to the streets in the central
city of Taichung Sunday to protest what they call the President Ma Ying-jeou
administration's pandering to China at the expense of Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>While organizers have guaranteed that street protests will be peaceful and
rational, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu has also vowed not to treat the protesters as
rioters. Hu also said he would take full responsibility if the police abused
their power and hurt civilians during demonstrations.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits is scheduled to arrive in Taichung Monday for a second visit.
During his Dec. 21-25 stay, he will sign with his Taiwanese counterpart, Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, four agreements covering
cooperation on fishing crew issues, double taxation, industrial product
standards and agricultural quarantine.</P>
      <P>Like  the nine  agreements  that President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration has
signed with China in the past 18 months without popular consent, the soon-to-be-
signed four agreements have also not been approved or screened by the
Legislature.</P>
      <P>With that in mind, the DPP and other civic groups are organizing street marches
in Taichung to voice their opposition to the Ma administration's China-leaning
policy. DPP officials said all those who are concerned  about Taiwan's political
future,  economic well-being and their own job prospects and welfare rights are
welcome to join the protests.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>As in the past, the DPP is welcoming the latest round of Chiang-Chen talks with
a mass movement.</P>
      <P>During Chen's first visit to Taiwan in 2008, bloody clashes erupted between DPP
supporters  and law enforcement  officers, tarnishing the country's image.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen is clearly aware that if the street protests get out
of hand, the party will have to pay the price in the upcoming legislative by-
elections and even in elections for mayors of five municipalities to be held
late next year.</P>
      <P>Sunday's street rally will just be a prelude. The real test to Tsai's leadership
will come in the next five days with the presence of China's top envoy in
Taiwan. Her political career will see a breakthrough only if the DPP can cut a
balance between making its political stance heard and applying heat on Taiwanese
and Chinese authorities with a mass movement.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan paid a visit to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
Saturday to convey his party's hope that during Sunday's "100,000-persons
protest march,  " there would be no recurrence of incidents seen in Chen
Yunlin's first visit to Taipei last year, in which police officers forcibly took
away national flags held by demonstrators and tried to stop a music CD shop from
playing Taiwanese folk songs.</P>
      <P>Su also assured Hu that the party has set up an emergency response center and
will do its utmost to keep the protest march orderly and peaceful.</P>
      <P>In response, Hu said he is confident of the DPP's sincerity to avoid violence in
street rallies.</P>
      <P>Describing the planned protests as "typhoons, " Hu said it would be best if
typhoons never hit. "Our democracy will take a stride forward if 'typhoons'
become 'breezes,'" he added.</P>

12/20/09  16:21:40

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's high court ruled Saturday that S$2.1 million (US$1.49 million) in a
Singapore bank account held by Wu Shih-tsai, a key figure in a diplomatic fraud
scandal that rocked the previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government,
be returned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The sum that had been in Wu's OCBC Bank account since 2006 was only a small part
of the US$29.8 million that Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) wired
into a joint account held by Wu and Ching Chi Ju at the same bank on Sept. 15,
2006.</P>
      <P>The money was meant to help the two middlemen broker the establishment of
diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Papua New Guinea, but most of it later
disappeared without any progress in relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to the Singapore court's ruling, Taiwan's government can continue to
retrieve the balance of the payment from Wu over the next 12 years.</P>
      <P>Wu is presently doing time in a Taiwan jail after he was convicted in October
2008 of forgery and making false accusations and sentenced to 28 months in jail.
He began serving time in May 2009.</P>
      <P>Wu was indicted on the charges by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office after
it discovered that Wu gave the MOFA a false bank statement to account for the
money.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also asserted that Wu falsely claimed, after the scandal became
public in May 2008, that he had been threatened at gunpoint.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ching, who was commissioned by the MOFA in 2006 to help broker the
diplomatic initiative, allegedly embezzled most of the US$29.8 million that was
intended as aid to the Pacific nation to help smooth the way in establishing
formal ties.</P>
      <P>Ching, whose whereabouts are unknown, had his lawyer tell the Singapore High
Court that he had not embezzled the money and that it could not be returned
because most of it had been spent as "grease money" to help advance the
diplomatic initiative.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 129 aftershocks have been recorded as of noon Sunday after a
magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit Taiwan Saturday at 9:02 p.m., the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) said.</P>
      <P>Kuo Kai-wen, director of CWB's Seismology Center, said the strong quake and
later aftershocks are normal seismic energy release, and he urged the public "to
be on guard" but said there was no need to panic.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Saturday's quake, whose epicenter was 25.5 kilometers southeast of
Hualien City off the coast of Hualien County in eastern Taiwan, resulted from
friction between the Eurasian Plate and Philippine plate, which converge off
Taiwan's east coast.</P>
      <P>Because it struck at a depth of 45.9 kilometers, its impact was less than if it
had been shallower, Kuo said, but he expected seismic energy to continue to be
released.</P>
      <P>"It is estimated that there will be aftershocks with magnitudes of less than 6.8
in the next few days," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Kuo also said that compared with the more than 1,000 aftershocks that occurred
within 24 hours after a magnitude 7.3 temblor hit Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, the
aftershocks after Saturday's quake were relatively mild.</P>
      <P>Eleven people suffered minor injuries in Hualien, and other minor damage was
reported elsewhere after Saturday's quake.</P>
      <P>Yuching Bridge in northern Taiwan's Miaoli City was sealed off for inspection
Sunday after its expansion joint opened wider because of the earthquake.</P>
      <P>The Miaoli County government said the bridge poses no immediate danger, but it
decided to close out of safety considerations.</P>
      <P>Among the 11 injured in Hualien Saturday, 10 were tourists at a Hualien City
hotel whose discomfort may have been caused by chlorine leaking from a pipe that
ruptured during the earthquake.</P>
      <P>The other injured person, a 16-year-old boy, was hit by a falling rock in Siulin
Township, Hualien County.</P>
      <P>Provincial Highway 11 was disrupted by landslides at its 40 kilometer marker,
but the road was later cleared and traffic returned to normal.</P>
      <P>Also, some 9,000 households were left without electricity after the Rueisuei
transformer station in Hualien County's Kuangfu Township broke down, but power
has since been restored in the area.</P>

      <P>Delegations of travel agency managers from Hangzhou and Ningbo in China's
Zhejiang province will visit tourist destinations in Kaohsiung and Pingtung in
southern Taiwan next spring, a Kaohsiung City government official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The planned tours, resulting from a recent tourism promotion trip to the two
Chinese cities by a tourism industry alliance from Kaohsiung City and County and
Pingtung County, are expected to give a boost to southern Taiwan's tourism
sector, said Lai Jui-long, chief secretary of the Kaohsiung City Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>A number of Chinese tour groups reportedly canceled trips to Kaohsiung City
following a controversial visit by exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai
Lama in late August and the screening of a documentary about the exiled leader
of China's Uighur minority, Rebiya Kadeer, in the city in September.</P>
      <P>The city government has since come under pressure to work out measures to
respond to speculation  that Chinese tourists are boycotting Kaohsiung over the
issues.</P>
      <P>As part of their efforts to save local tourism, Lai and Pingtung County and
Kaohsiung County officials joined the industry alliance in traveling to Hangzhou
and Ningbo, where they held two tourism promotion events to spark interest in
southern Taiwan as a travel destination among Chinese tour operators, Lai said.</P>
      <P>During their visit, the delegation interacted positively with Zhejiang tourism
officials and exchanged views on boosting city tourism on both sides, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Zhejiang tourism officials said that visitors from their province account for
one-fifth of total Chinese arrivals in Taiwan and told Lai they hoped the
promotional campaigns would help attract more Zhejiang natives to southern
Taiwan and give the tourism sector there a lift.</P>
      <P>Lai said travel agencies in Hangzhou and Ningbo were well positioned to arrange
convenient five-day packages to southern Taiwan because there are seven weekly
nonstop flights between Kaohsiung International Airport and the two Chinese
cities.</P>
      <P>Tour operators have begun devising customized tours for the two Chinese travel
agent delegations, and Lai said the Kaohsiung City government in particular will
offer them special deals, including giving them free admission to sightseeing
cruises around Kaohsiung's port.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will continue to track down nearly US$30 million that was allegedly
stolen by two diplomatic brokers three years ago, the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office vowed Sunday.</P>
      <P>Local prosecutors have maintained contact with their counterparts in Singapore
and the United States in a bid to recover the US$29.8 million (NT$965 million)
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) wired to a Singapore bank on Sept.
15, 2006, ostensibly to facilitate the establishment of diplomatic ties with
Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The money was remitted to an account at Singapore's OCBC Bank jointly held by
the two brokers, Wu Shih-Tsai, a Singaporean national, and his partner Ching Chi
Ju, a Taiwanese with a U.S. passport who was commissioned by the MOFA in 2006 to
help facilitate a deal to establish diplomatic ties with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The MOFA asked Wu and Ching for a statement of account early last year after
finding that by Dec. 1, 2006, the money in the joint account had disappeared
without any progress being made on the initiative with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>Wu, without knowing that the MOFA had been aware of the fraud, produced a false
bank statement from his own notebook computer and gave it to the ministry.</P>
      <P>He was taken into custody by prosecutors in May 2008 and indicted for forging
the bank statement and making false accusations in September 2008. He was found
guilty of the charges a month later and sentenced to 28 months in prison.</P>
      <P>The scandal came to light May 1, 2008, when a Singaporean daily reported that
the Singapore  High Court had approved Taiwan's application for an injunction to
freeze the joint bank account held by Wu and Ching.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, Taiwan has had NT$300 million worth of bank
accounts held by Wu and Ching and property Wu bought in Taipei City frozen. Some
NT$70 million of the assets are in Wu's name.</P>
      <P>The Singapore High Court ruled Saturday that the S$2.1 million (US$1.49 million)
that had been in another of Wu's accounts at Singapore OCBC Bank be returned to
Taiwan's authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei prosecutors listed Ching, who is said to be living at his home
in California, as one of Taiwan's most wanted fugitives last May as they
continued their investigation into the case.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office said it had asked for judicial assistance
from the U.S. government in the investigation and suggested having U.S.
prosecutors interrogate Ching on Taiwan's behalf or sending their own people to
California to question Ching themselves.</P>
      <P>They have yet to receive a response from the U.S. government.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will preside over a briefing on security and police
preparedness in Taichung on Monday, the day when China's top negotiator with
Taiwan is scheduled to arrive for the latest round of high-level cross-strait
talks, the Presidential Office said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The president will listen to officials' reports and issue directives regarding
public order in the central Taiwan city, where the fourth  meeting  between
Chen Yunlin,  president  of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits, and his Taiwan counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
Straits Exchange  Foundation,  will take place,  said Paul K.  Chang, director-
general of the Presidential Office's Department of Public Affairs.</P>
      <P>Highly concerned about public order in Taichung because of plans by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to stage protests during Chen's
stay there from Dec. 21-25, President Ma will preside in person over the meeting
on public order, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office meetings on public order are usually overseen by the deputy
secretary of the office, he added.</P>
      <P>Ranking officials from the National Security Council,  the National Police
Agency and the Government Information Office are also expected to attend.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Presidential Office believes Chen and his group are guests and
are entitled to safety, comfort and dignity during their visit.</P>
      <P>"We should behave ourselves with grace as hosts," Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to a ruling Kuomintang heavyweight who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Ma presided over a similar security meeting in early November 2008
before Chen Yunlin set foot on Taiwan's soil for the first time.</P>
      <P>The DPP, however, held massive protests outside the Grand Hotel in Taipei City
where Chen and his group stayed. One of the protests, staged outside the Grand
Formosa Regent where Chen was having dinner, forced the Chinese diplomat to stay
in the hotel until the early hours of the morning.</P>
      <P>Ma will remind those attending  Monday's  meeting that if undesirable scenarios
occur during Chen's visit in Taichung, law enforcement authorities should handle
the situations and respond in real time, according to Chang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Large crowds took to the streets in Taichung to protest the government's China
policy a day before China's top negotiator on Taiwan affairs was to arrive for
another round of talks on bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>The massive protest march in central Taiwan was organized by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and pro-independence civic groups to drive
home their belief that the government's strengthening of economic ties with
China is undermining Taiwan's sovereign status and threatening its people's
economic well-being.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said DPP supporters have turned out in droves to
oppose the President Ma Ying-jeou administration's lack of transparency in
negotiating deals with China, which prevents any form of supervision by the
people and puts the country's interests at risk.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits, is expected to sign four agreements  with his Taiwanese
counterpart,  Straits  Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, during his
stay from Dec. 21-25.</P>
      <P>The accords will cover cooperation on fishing crew issues, double taxation,
industrial product standards and agricultural quarantine.</P>
      <P>Dubbing Sunday's protest as a march to "break the black box and protect the rice
bowl, " DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan said an estimated 100,000 people
were expected to join an evening rally near the city's open-air circular
theater.</P>
      <P>DPP supporters began to converge at Taichung's Anhe Road and Mincyuan Road,
respectively, and long lines had formed at the two gathering points by 2:30 p.m.
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Demonstrators from central Taiwan gathered at the intersection of Jhonggang Road
and Mincyuan Road and started to walk toward the rally site at 3: 30 p.m. under
the leadership of Su and Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Kun-huei.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, protesters from northern and southern Taiwan, headed by
Tsai and other DPP bigwigs, also began the march from the intersection of Anhe
Road and Chaoma Road.</P>
      <P>Both marches proceeded in an orderly fashion, with police officers and DPP
members helping keep traffic flowing along the thoroughfares where the
processions passed.</P>
      <P>Braving chilly weather, demonstraters waved brightly colored anti-China and
anti-government banners and placards, and in some spots the parades resembled
street carnivals.</P>
      <P>Chen Ta-chun, head of the DPP's Taichung chapter, led the demonstrators in
chanting pro-independnece slogans such as "Taiwan and China, one side one
country" and "Cross-Strait Affairs, Listen to the People's Voices" to boost
morale.</P>
      <P>He said he was confident that the number of protesters would reach the party's
target of 100,000 when the evening rally began later in the day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT will sort out principles on handling its assets by year end</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly appointed secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , King Pu-
tsung, said Sunday that the direction and principles the party will follow in
handling its assets will be determined by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>King made the pledge during a visit to the eastern city of Taitung, where a
grassroots KMT worker urged him to boldly and resolutely deal with the
controversial party asset issue.</P>
      <P>The opposition contends that the KMT's assets were illegally obtained during its
decades of authoritarian rule in the second half of the 20th century when the
lines between state and party were blurred.</P>
      <P>King was also told that the KMT has suffered from a shortage of workers in the
Taitung area and that the roles of those working for the party were ill-defined.</P>
      <P>He replied that the roles of grassroots party workers have changed with the
political environment.</P>
      <P>"In the past, their jobs focused on providing services and seeking help for
constituents, but now they should help reflect the people's plight and search
for problems," he said.</P>
      <P>Fielding complaints about President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman,
King said that nobody is perfect and that if Ma has some shortcomings, the
people around him, including King himself, will fill in the gaps.</P>
      <P>"Chairman Ma is a man who is willing to reflect on his behavior," King told his
audience.</P>
      <P>King had been a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution, a Washington,
D.C.-based think tank, since September before being tapped to take over the
party's day-to-day affairs.</P>
      <P>While King is expected to dedicate  much of his time to legislative by-elections
scheduled for Jan. 9 and Feb. 27 and mayoral elections in five special
municipalities in December, the party asset issue, which is often used by the
opposition to attack the KMT, will also be a priority, according to King's
predecessor, Chan Chuen-po.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President vows to strive for FTAs after inking ECFA with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Changhua,  Taiwan,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
12/20/09  20:14:51
(By Wu Jhe-hao and Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday the government will continue its efforts to
seal free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries after signing a proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Ma also said during a meeting with representatives of stockings manufacturers in
the central county of Changhua that the government will negotiate the ECFA with
China based on the principle that Taiwan is the focus and that the interests of
the public come first, and he also said the document will be subject to
legislative review.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated that only Taiwan and North Korea among Asia Pacific
countries have not signed FTAs with other countries in the region, which
threatens to marginalize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that after the ECFA is signed, the administration will try to seal FTAs
with other countries and will not ask China for its approval to sign them
"because Taiwan is a sovereign independent country."</P>
      <P>Free trade deals can only be signed if both sides are willing to do so, Ma said,
but he argued that once an ECFA is signed with China, other countries will be
more willing to sign FTAs with Taiwan because China's suppression of such deals
would be reduced.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, Ma told farmers during a tour of an eustoma flower export
production zone in Changhua that he has honored his pledge not to further open
Taiwan's market to Chinese agricultural products since assuming office in May
2008.</P>
      <P>He noted that of the 1,415 Chinese agricultural products allowed to be imported
into Taiwan, 479 items were approved by the previous Kuomintang administration
and the other 936 were approved by the Democratic Progressive Party when it was
in power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>17 local chiefs assume posts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
12/20/09  21:36:50
(By Andrew J. T. Liu, Lin Heng-li and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The individuals elected on Dec. 5 to head 17 cities and counties in Taiwan
assumed their posts Sunday with varying levels of creativity and articulated
their visions for their four-year terms.</P>
      <P>Of the 17 local chiefs, 12 are from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), four are from
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and one is an independent,
who quickly installed his ex-wife as his deputy.</P>
      <P>In perhaps the most stunning debut of any of the newly elected magistrates,
independent Fu Kun-chi appointed his ex-wife Hsu Chen-wei, who he apparently
recently divorced, as his deputy in his inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>Fu said the appointment was in line with regulations and stressed that his
family "has made preparations to sacrifice for the sake of Hualien's
development."</P>
      <P>Fu said Deputy Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang inquired about his decision in
the evening, and he clearly explained to him that he had completed divorce
proceedings and that the appointment was legal.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's laws, a married couple cannot serve as the magistrate and deputy
magistrate of a county.</P>
      <P>Fu represented the KMT as a legislator, but the party did not nominate him as
its candidate in the Hualien County magistrate election because he is currently
being tried in separate cases for violating securities transaction laws.</P>
      <P>He has already been convicted of one crime, and if his appeal is rejected, he
will have to relinquish his post.</P>
      <P>Despite his legal problems, Fu ran as an independent and handily defeated the
KMT's official nominee and one other rival.</P>
      <P>He complained Sunday that the central government had tried to smear his
reputation before and after the election but insisted on his innocence and vowed
to do everything he could for Hualien residents.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-ching began his second term in office by
offering a cash award of NT$1 million (US$30,960) to anyone who could provide a
good idea on how the county's most scenic spot -- Sun Moon Lake -- could tie the
knot with the West Lake in Hangzhou, in China's Zhejiang province.</P>
      <P>Lee said that when he first assumed office four years ago, he promoted the plan
without success.</P>
      <P>"I hope all residents of the county can help me in coming with a good way or
idea to stage the marriage so as to draw international attention and
participation and promote the status and development of Sun Moon Lake," he said.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan County, former Legislator John Chih-yang Wu greeted wellwishers,
including Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, his father and KMT honorary Chairman Wu
Poh-hsiung, past magistrates and hundreds of political and business figures, in
Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka and aboriginal dialects.</P>
      <P>Wu said that he hopes to become the most tolerant and loving magistrate in
Taoyuan County's history, and vowed to complete major infrastructure projects,
including turning the area around its international airport into an aviation
city and building a mass rapid transit system, while also pushing to upgrade the
county into a municipality.</P>
      <P>Chu, who served as Taoyuan County magistrate before leaving to become vice
premier in September, lauded Wu for his dynamism, expertise and ideals.</P>
      <P>In Hsinchu County, former Legislator Chiu Ching-chun, who emerged victorious
from a fierce election battle, vowed to solicit more private sector investment
in the county to help improve its finances.</P>
      <P>In Taitung County,  newly elected magistrate  Justin Huang reaffirmed his focus
on tourism, the economy, culture, education, agriculture and care for
underprivileged groups.</P>
      <P>The former KMT legislator vowed to make the eastern Taiwan county more
progressive and prosperous, before heading to a settlement center in Dawu
Township to visit people who were displaced from their homes by Typhoon Morakot
in August.</P>
      <P>In Chiayi City, Huang Ming-hui began her second term in office, saying that she
will focus on improving the southern Taiwan city's infrastructure and seek out
opportunities to host major events to help market Chiayi and stimulate the local
economy.</P>
      <P>In Keelung City, incumbent mayor Chang Tung-jung noted that a marine science
museum will open in 2012, which is expected to bring 2 million tourists to the
northern Taiwan city every year.</P>
      <P>Chang said the city will now engage in peripheral traffic network planning.</P>
      <P>In outlying Kinmen County, which lies just kilometers from China's coast, newly
elected magistrate Lee Wo-shih hopes to bring world-class infrastructure to the
county so that its residents will have higher incomes, excellent environmental
quality and health protection.</P>
      <P>In Matsu, the county's new magistrate Yang Sui-sheng vowed to overcome its
difficulties as an outlying island by making it a duty-free area to attract
tourists from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa said Sunday that although the county's
financial situation is dire, he will continue to push for a strong social
welfare policy in his second term.</P>
      <P>Among the four counties headed by DPP politicians, Yilan County Magistrate Lin
Tsung-hsien vowed to push the county's anti-flooding efforts and sponsor the
Yilan Green Expo and children's festival in the next half year.</P>
      <P>Chiayi County has its first female magistrate, with former DPP Legislator Chang
Hwa-kuan taking the helm from her predecesor Chen Ming-wen.</P>
      <P>Chang hoped that county's administrative team will improve services and upgrade
its efficiency. She also hoped that the central government will help narrow the
urban-rural gap seen in the county.</P>
      <P>In Yunlin County, Su Chih-fen said that in her second term, she will continue to
push to make the county into an agriculture stronghold.</P>
      <P>Considering the close relationship between water and people's lives,  she said
she will  craft  ecological,  environmental, agricultural,  water control,  and
education policies from the perspective of their impact on the county's water
resources.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung County, incumbent Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung launched a "Pingtung
taking off" remote-control airplane to symbolize the taking off of the southern
Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Tsao said he would work to develop the solar power industry and turn
Siaoliouchiou into a low-carbon islet. With the bicycle network in the county
nearing completion, he said Pingtung will be the county that puts the most
effort into energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tens of thousands march to protest trade pact with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
12/20/09  22:04:22

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tens of thousands of Taiwanese marched in the central Taiwan city of Taichung to
protest the government's plan to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The rally took place one day before Chen Yunlin, chairman of China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , arrives here to sign four
economic agreements with his Taiwan counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), but the ECFA is not on the meeting's
formal agenda.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and local civic groups said
the purpose of the protest was to call attention to the poor overall performance
of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration and the lack of transparency in its
negotiations on the ECFA with China.</P>
      <P>Braving strong winds in temperatures of around 10 degrees Celsius,  pro-
independence  protesters  from across the country assembled in downtown Taichung
for the rally after marching in two separate legs in the city.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is facing three problems. The first problem is Ma, the second problem is
Ma. The third problem is still Ma, " DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen told the crowd.</P>
      <P>Polls show that the president is leading Taiwan to unification (with China), she
said, adding that "the biggest problem is that we have a president who is only
focused on unifying with China."</P>
      <P>Tsai said people gathered because no one knows what the president is doing,
especially on the ECFA, which Ma argues Taiwan must sign or it will be
marginalized.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is expected to be included in the next round of talks between both
sides, which is scheduled to take place in the first half of 2010 in China.</P>
      <P>Tsai accused Ma of never explaining the ECFA clearly and of refusing to
communicate with the people, the Legislative Yuan or the opposition on its
contents.</P>
      <P>The only beneficiaries from the ECFA are big corporations, while many ordinary
people will lose their jobs because of it, Tsai contended,  adding that the
president has never disclosed its potential adverse impact on Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>An economic model run by the Ministry of Economic Affairs found that Taiwan
would gain a net 260,000 jobs if an ECFA was signed, while the Council of Labor
Affairs estimated it would create a net 105,000 to 125,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Both models acknowledged,  however,  that some workers  in vulnerable industries
could lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>Almost all the DPP heavyweights showed up and spoke to the gathered crowd.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan signs the ECFA with China, President Ma should also ask China to help
Taiwan sign FTAs with other countries, such as Japan and South Korea, so Taiwan
will be able to trade with others as well, " said former Vice President Annette
Lu.</P>
      <P>In the days leading up to Sunday's protest rally, the DPP said it hoped to
mobilize 100,000 people, and the party estimated after the event that the
turnout had surpassed its goal. The Taichung City government, on the other hand,
put the turnout at 31,000.</P>
      <P>Fears that clashes would break out never materialized. Taichung City government
spokesperson Tsou Mei-liang earlier said that no confrontations took place
Sunday, and it was not a surprise since "the protest was legally applied for and
all arrangements had been implemented beforehand."</P>
      <P>Prior to the main rally, the protesters marched for more than two hours in
Taichung's streets, and made the most noise when they walked past the Windsor
Hotel, where Chen will stay during his five-day stay, to express their
displeasure over the Chinese negotiator's visit.</P>
      <P>The crowds chanted slogans such as "Taiwan and China; one country on each side"
as they marched, while others expressed their views in more colorful ways.</P>
      <P>A senior citizen from Chiayi City showed everyone a picture of Ma wearing only a
swimming suit and said "this is all he does -- swim."</P>
      <P>A protester surnamed Hsu, who came from the southern city of Tainan complained
not only about the government's China policy but also security precautions taken
for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>"We don't want a trade agreement with China. And all these barricades, security
deployments and traffic controls for a Chinese representative are outrageous.
The Taichung City police should remove them all."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Restrictions on hiring foreign caregivers should remain: foundation</HEADLINE>

(By Chen Shun-hsieh and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should reconsider its plan to ease restrictions on hiring foreign
caregivers or maids because such a move could deprive local middle-aged and
older women of job opportunities, an advocacy group said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is considering allowing families that have
two members in their 80s or one member older than 90 plus a toddler under one
year of age to apply to hire foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>"On the surface, the proposed liberalization is not large, but in effect, its
impact on local women, particularly those in middle or senior age groups, would
be great, " said Lin Shih-chia, chairman of the Peng Wan-ju Foundation.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, foreign caregivers who have come to Taiwan on caregiving
contracts usually have to do all sorts of household chores, such as cleaning the
house, washing clothes, and cooking, the jobs that in many cases are currently
done by middle-aged local women.</P>
      <P>"As a result, middle-aged and senior women's job opportunities could be
affected, " Lin explained.</P>
      <P>An initial estimate shows that at least 10,000 local women could fall victim to
the proposed measure, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the foundation has offered training courses for local women who
want to work as maids. In 2009 alone, Lin said, the foundation successfully
helped mediate 13,442 maid contracts worth more than NT$900 million.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Lin said, the in-home service market has grown steadily.</P>
      <P>"The Cabinet-level CLA should not ignore potential market demand and should
instead adopt measures to boost the development of this line of service which is
especially suitable for middle-  or senior-aged women to undertake," Lin said.</P>
      <P>With an average service charge ranging between NT$180 and NT$250 per hour, a
well-trained or trusted live-in maid can earn more than NT$30,000 a month, Lin
said.</P>

independence  protesters  from across the country assembled in downtown Taichung
for the rally after marching in two separate legs in the city.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is facing three problems. The first problem is Ma, the second problem is
Ma. The third problem is still Ma, " DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen told the crowd.</P>
      <P>Polls show that the president is leading Taiwan to unification (with China), she
said, adding that "the biggest problem is that we have a president who is only
focused on unifying with China."</P>
      <P>Tsai said people gathered because no one knows what the president is doing,
especially on the ECFA, which Ma argues Taiwan must sign or it will be
marginalized.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is expected to be included in the next round of talks between both
sides, which is scheduled to take place in the first half of 2010 in China.</P>
      <P>Tsai accused Ma of never explaining the ECFA clearly and of refusing to
communicate with the people, the Legislative Yuan or the opposition on its
contents.</P>
      <P>The only beneficiaries from the ECFA are big corporations, while many ordinary
people will lose their jobs because of it, Tsai contended,  adding that the
president has never disclosed its potential adverse impact on Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>An economic model run by the Ministry of Economic Affairs found that Taiwan
would gain a net 260,000 jobs if an ECFA was signed, while the Council of Labor
Affairs estimated it would create a net 105,000 to 125,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Both models acknowledged,  however,  that some workers  in vulnerable industries
could lose their jobs.</P>
      <P>Almost all the DPP heavyweights showed up and spoke to the gathered crowd.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan signs the ECFA with China, President Ma should also ask China to help
Taiwan sign FTAs with other countries, such as Japan and South Korea, so Taiwan
will be able to trade with others as well, " said former Vice President Annette
Lu.</P>
      <P>In the days leading up to Sunday's protest rally, the DPP said it hoped to
mobilize 100,000 people, and the party estimated after the event that the
turnout had surpassed its goal. The Taichung City government, on the other hand,
put the turnout at 31,000.</P>
      <P>Fears that clashes would break out never materialized. Taichung City government
spokesperson Tsou Mei-liang earlier said that no confrontations took place
Sunday, and it was not a surprise since "the protest was legally applied for and
all arrangements had been implemented beforehand."</P>
      <P>Prior to the main rally, the protesters marched for more than two hours in
Taichung's streets, and made the most noise when they walked past the Windsor
Hotel, where Chen will stay during his five-day stay, to express their
displeasure over the Chinese negotiator's visit.</P>
      <P>The crowds chanted slogans such as "Taiwan and China; one country on each side"
as they marched, while others expressed their views in more colorful ways.</P>
      <P>A senior citizen from Chiayi City showed everyone a picture of Ma wearing only a
swimming suit and said "this is all he does -- swim."</P>
      <P>A protester surnamed Hsu, who came from the southern city of Tainan complained
not only about the government's China policy but also security precautions taken
for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>"We don't want a trade agreement with China. And all these barricades, security
deployments and traffic controls for a Chinese representative are outrageous.
The Taichung City police should remove them all."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Restrictions on hiring foreign caregivers should remain: foundation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should reconsider its plan to ease restrictions on hiring foreign
caregivers or maids because such a move could deprive local middle-aged and
older women of job opportunities, an advocacy group said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is considering allowing families that have
two members in their 80s or one member older than 90 plus a toddler under one
year of age to apply to hire foreign caregivers.</P>
      <P>"On the surface, the proposed liberalization is not large, but in effect, its
impact on local women, particularly those in middle or senior age groups, would
be great, " said Lin Shih-chia, chairman of the Peng Wan-ju Foundation.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, foreign caregivers who have come to Taiwan on caregiving
contracts usually have to do all sorts of household chores, such as cleaning the
house, washing clothes, and cooking, the jobs that in many cases are currently
done by middle-aged local women.</P>
      <P>"As a result, middle-aged and senior women's job opportunities could be
affected, " Lin explained.</P>
      <P>An initial estimate shows that at least 10,000 local women could fall victim to
the proposed measure, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the foundation has offered training courses for local women who
want to work as maids. In 2009 alone, Lin said, the foundation successfully
helped mediate 13,442 maid contracts worth more than NT$900 million.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Lin said, the in-home service market has grown steadily.</P>
      <P>"The Cabinet-level CLA should not ignore potential market demand and should
instead adopt measures to boost the development of this line of service which is
especially suitable for middle-  or senior-aged women to undertake," Lin said.</P>
      <P>With an average service charge ranging between NT$180 and NT$250 per hour, a
well-trained or trusted live-in maid can earn more than NT$30,000 a month, Lin
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi, who was elected on Dec. 5, assumed his post
Sunday with a bomb said to be stronger than the magnitude 6.8 earthquake that
struck Taiwan the day before by appointing his "ex-wife" as his deputy.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the incident:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>In perhaps the most stunning debut of any of the 17 newly elected local chiefs
who assumed their posts en masse Sunday, Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi appointed
his wife Hsu Chen-wei as his deputy at his inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>Fu was a Kuomintang legislator who ran for the Hualien County magistrate seat on
an independent ticket after the party failed to nominate him because he was
being tried in court on several counts of violating securities transaction laws.</P>
      <P>Fu's surpise nomination of his wife is believed to be a well-planned
precautionary scheme, as he has already been convicted in one case and if he
loses the appeal, he will have to relinquish his post.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) issued a news release at 6: 47 p.m. Sunday
saying that Fu's nomination of his wife as his deputy is "invalid."</P>
      <P>However, shortly after, at 9 p.m. the MOI issued another news release
discounting what it had said earlier, apparently after being informed by Fu that
he had divorced his wife three days ago.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan law, a married couple cannot serve as magistrate and deputy
magistrate of a county. (Dec. 21, 2009)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Fu has planned his scheme well and it seems that it cannot be dealt with under
the country's laws, but will the voters be fooled by him in the long run?</P>
      <P>His nomination of his "ex-wife" as his deputy was blatant political maneuvering
aimed solely at consolidating power in the eastern county.</P>
      <P>"How can Hualien constituents bear to be fooled by Fu like monkeys?" (Dec. 21,
2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>MOI officials have said that they would look into whether Fu has indeed divorced
his wife and whether they are still living under one roof.</P>
      <P>"There is indeed a legal 'grey area' in the nomination (of Fu's deputy)," said
Deputy Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang Sunday.</P>
      <P>Fu said the appointment was in line with the law and stressed that his family
"is prepared to make some sacrifices for the sake of Hualien's development."</P>
      <P>Fu said he clearly explained to Chien that he had completed divorce proceedings
and that the appointment was legitimate. (Dec. 21, 2009)</P>

      <P>China's Taiwan affairs chief dismissed allegations of a lack of transparency in
the upcoming new round of trade negotiations with Taiwan, as China's top
negotiator left Beijing for the island Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at
the Beijing Capital International Airport prior to the Chinese delegation's
departure that the agenda for the fourth round of China-Taiwan trade talks was
determined by both sides and that there were no secret meetings.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the people of Taiwan would understand the real situation and get
the correct information," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks came one day after Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) staged a large-scale rally to protest the Chinese delegation's
visit.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, chairman of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , was scheduled to arrive in Taiwan later in the day for talks
with his Taiwanese counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, Chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations designated by the governments
of Taiwan and China,  respectively, to handle cross-strait dealings in the
absence of official contact between the two sides.</P>
      <P>During the meeting this week, Taiwan and China are expected to sign  four
economic  agreements  on fishing  crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine
inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the

      <P>Taiwan is braced for a new round of high-level talks with China, as Chen Yunlin,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits, is scheduled to arrive later Monday.</P>
      <P>To avoid a recurrence of the chaos and clashes that occurred during Chen's
first-ever visit to Taipei for a similar meeting last year, security authorities
are on heightened alert and have made meticulous preparations.</P>
      <P>On the eve of Chen's arrival,  the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
staged a massive protest march in Taichung where the talks will take place this
time around. Because of comprehensive prior arrangements, the march was more
like a carnival, in contrast to the heavy police deployment.</P>
      <P>But observers have said the real test may be just beginning as some pro-
independence activists have vowed to trail Chen throughout his Dec.21-25 stay in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times: President Ma Ying-jeou called a meeting Monday morning, with
National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi, Premier Wu Den-yih, National
Police Agency and Government Information Office officials among those attending
for a briefing on security arrangements and police preparedness in Taichung.</P>
      <P>Ma is concerned about the security in this latest round of cross-strait talks
Dec. 21-25, in view of the serious clashes that occurred between police and DPP
protesters during last year's meeting in Taipei. (Dec. 21, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News: The Taichung City government has kept secret Chen Yunlin's
itinerary during his stay in Taiwan. The Government Information Office will
arrange for vehicles to transport reporters to the venues and the media will not
know the locations until arrival there. (Dec. 21, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said even if the DPP's march ended
peacefully Sunday, he wouldn't say that "the typhoon has passed," and that he
will celebrate only after Chen Yunlin's safe departure from Taiwan on Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>Hu reaffirmed that he would not interfere with the talks taking place in his
city, and that he also would not prevent protesters from expressing their views.
He provided shuttle buses at major transportation depots to take demonstrators
to the protest areas, winning kudos for that arrangement.</P>
      <P>He made great effort to coordinate among the various forces and tried not to
lose face as the host of the meeting or to tarnish the image of Taichung. (Dec.
21, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: An action alliance of local civic groups announced Sunday that it
will stage a series of protests after Chen's arrival.</P>
      <P>The alliance will raise a Taiwan national flag in front of Chen's hotel Monday
afternoon and will march from a church to the hotel for a rally that evening to
demonstrate to Chen the will of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>The alliance said it will trail Chen like a shadow during his stay in Taiwan.

    <TEXT>
      <P>A documentary featuring the climate crisis in Taiwan as a result of global
warming will premiere Feb. 22.</P>
      <P>Inspired by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's documentary "An Inconvenient
Truth, " local media celebrity Sisy Chen initiated the proposal to produce the
film that documents for the first time the impact of global warming on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The film, produced from a Taiwan perspective, also documents climatic and
environmental challenges faced by the country.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the announcement of the
plan to make the documentary:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Global warming is a fact that Taiwanese cannot avoid. "An Inconvenient truth, "
produced by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore in 2006, forced the world to face
the problem of global warming.</P>
      <P>TV commentator Sisy Chen said she hopes to present a similar documentary
featuring the impact of climate change "on Taiwan's future prospects." The film,
titled "Plus or Minus 2 Degrees Celsius, " begins with the devastating flooding
in southern Taiwan caused by Typhoon Morakot in August.</P>
      <P>Days after the global climate change meeting ended in Copenhagen, Denmark, many
of Taiwan's business tycoons -- including Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Goo,
Quanta Computer Chairman Barry Lam and Yulon Group Chairman Kenneth Yen --
appeared at a press conference in Taipei on Dec. 20 to pledge their full
financial and other support for Chen's documentary.</P>
      <P>The documentary production team is trying to obtain images from a state
satellite to show how severely the recent floods damaged the mountain areas.
Singer and composer Kimbo Hu, known as Taiwan's father of folksong, will be shot
performing the song "Beautiful Island" in scenes of a land devastated by floods.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that if the sea level rises one meter, 11 percent of the land in
Taiwan would become unusable, which she said is a reminder that climate change
is not just a movie scene, but a visible "truth." (Dec. 21, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Preliminarily clips of the documentary show data provided by Director of the
Global Change Research Center at National Taiwan University Liu Chung-ming,
which puts Taiwan on a United Nations draft list of the world's first group of
climate change victims, among Vietnam, Bangladesh and the South Pacific island
countries.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan is not a U.N. member and will therefore not be invited to join
U.N. meetings on global warming, Sisy Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the documentary will be distributed to media outlets for broadcast
free of charge, and also to schools, in the hope that children would be able to
understand the crisis that Taiwan is facing. (Dec. 21, 2009)</P>

      <P>As the new Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi is apparently trying to manipulate the
law by first divorcing his wife and then appointing her as his deputy, the
Ministry of the Interior is investigating whether the couple is still living
under the same roof, which would disqualify her for the post.</P>
      <P>Fu, an expelled Kuomintang member who garnered 56.37 percent of the vote, or
over 85,000, to win the Dec. 5 magistrate election as an independent, shocked
government officials as well as the media by announcing at his swearing in
ceremony Sunday that he was appointing his "ex-wife" Hsu Chen-wei as his deputy.</P>
      <P>The couple completed divorce proceedings three days before the appointment,
according to Fu. In Taiwan, the divorce process can be completed at the
household registration office once the couple presents an agreement signed by
two witnesses.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Chien Tai-lang, said that he had called Fu Sunday
evening and the divorce was confirmed. Admitting that Fu might be playing with a
"grey area" of the law, Chien said that the authorities would look into whether
Fu and his "ex-wife" are still living under the same roof.</P>
      <P>Chien pointed out that it is against the law for the holder of a public office
to appoint a spouse or a member of the family living under the same roof as his
or her deputy. The regulation is meant to avoid conflict of interest, he added.</P>
      <P>Article 1123 of the Civil Law rules that a person living permanently under the
same roof as the head of the family will be legally recognized as a member of
the family, even if the person is not a relative.</P>
      <P>Chien said that as long as Hsu is still living with the Fu family, she would not
qualify for the post.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, the relevant authorities will decide on the case based on

      <P>The budget to fund energy research and development in Taiwan will be doubled in
four years time and the country will strive to cut greenhouse gas emissions to
the 2000 level by 2025, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a report to the Legislative Yuan on the formulation and implementation of new
national energy policies, MOEA officials said the energy R&amp;D budget will be
increased to NT$10 billion (US$308.64 million) in four years time.</P>
      <P>Under the new plan, the country's carbon dioxide emissions will be gradually
reduced to the 2008 level by 2020 and hopefully even earlier, by 2016, the MOEA
said.</P>
      <P>The plan calls for the aggressive development of clean energy that will account
for about 15 percent of the country's total electricity capacity by 2025.</P>
      <P>It also calls for a reduction in gasoline consumption by public offices and
schools, hopefully by 7 percent by 2015.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said it will continue to push for the upgrade of energy resources and
production facilities to achieve greater efficiency. This will involve replacing
old power generators with new models that use Best Available Technology (BAT)
and complying with regulations on limiting emissions, in line with the overall
strategy, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it will also seek to enter international energy cooperation
agreements  on the import of clean coal and the development of carbon capture
and storage technology and facilities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOEA said its incentive measures to encourage less electricity
consumption have born fruit -- as evidenced by the fact that some 3.44 billion
kilowatt-hours of electricity was saved nationwide in the first 11 months of
this year.</P>
      <P>"That figure is roughly equivalent  to half of the total electricity consumed by
Kaohsiung City residents in a year, " an MOEA official said.</P>

      <P>China's top cross-strait negotiator made a goodwill gesture to a crowd that was
protesting against his visit to Taiwan, after he arrived on the island Monday
for a new round of negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, chairman of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , waved amicably to a group of protesters before entering his
hotel.</P>
      <P>Chen also said at a welcoming ceremony that he "completely respects those who
are voicing different opinions."</P>
      <P>The Chinese negotiator arrived in central Taiwan 40 minutes later than scheduled
as confrontations broke out among supporters of his visit and protesters at the
airport.</P>
      <P>Chen exited from one of the three main gates at the airport, avoiding pro-Taiwan
independence activists who had assembled at another gate.</P>
      <P>Chen was trapped in a Taipei hotel that was surrounded by large numbers of
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and other pro-independence
supporters last year when he first visited Taiwan for similar negotiations.</P>
      <P>During this visit, the envoy will sign four economic agreements with his
Taiwanese counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine
inspection, industrial product standards, inspection and certification, and the
avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Pro-independence and civic groups have vowed to stage more protests against what
they described the "China-leaning" policies of President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration.</P>
      <P>Practitioners of Falun Gong, a spiritual group that has suffered heavy
suppression in China, also staged a relatively quiet protest in an area across
from Chen's hotel.</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation is scheduled to leave Taiwan Dec. 25 after completing its
negotiations with the SEF and touring local tourist attractions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A year ago, China-bashers laid seige to a Taipei hotel to protest a visit by
China's top negotiator with Taiwan, and once again, pro-independence activists
staged massive street protests Sunday on the eve of a new round of high-level
cross-Taiwan Strait talks.</P>
      <P>It seems that the institutionalized cross-strait talks, known as the Chiang-Chen
meetings, have become a rite of expression of social sentiments and emotions.</P>
      <P>On the surface, the massive street march in Taichung the day before seemed to
heighten partisan standoff, but in essence, the event mainly reflected Taiwan's
common anxiety.</P>
      <P>The core issues to be addressed at the Dec. 22-23 meeting between Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Chen Yunlin, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, have nothing
to do with partisan, ethnic and regional differences, but rather are related to
the predicament of Taiwan being gradually marginalized as a result of
globalization.</P>
      <P>No matter which party is in power, the challenges Taiwan must tackle are the
same -- how to grapple with East Asia economic integration and how to protect
agricultural, fishery and traditional industrial sectors that have been hardest-
hit by the waves of globalization.</P>
      <P>It is time to end the relentless accusations tossed back and forth between the
ruling and opposition parties. Too much partisan confrontation only blinds us to
seeing opportunities for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The chaos and clashes that marred last year's Chiang-Chen talks should not
recur.</P>
      <P>Smart and conscientious political parties and politicians should not only win
the hearts and minds of their supporters but should also earn the respect of
their opponents.</P>
      <P>Both the ruling Kuomintang  and the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
should take this round of Chiang-Chen talks as an opportunity to give more local
people an understanding of the plight Taiwan faces and rationally hammer out
strategies for the country's survival under the premise of globalization.</P>

      <P>Taiwan used to be known as Asia's anime-comic talent bank. Many riveting,
stunning and highly acclaimed Hollywood computer animated special effects have
been partly produced in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although we have a lot of animation and comic talent, the government has paid
little attention to this promising sector.</P>
      <P>As a result, many of our outstanding cartoon and comic artists can only work as
OEM contractors.</P>
      <P>While government disregard has led to a decline of our animation and comic
industry, China and South Korea have been very actively cultivating talent in
this field. Despite its late start, South Korea is catching up with Japan, a
world power in the field. China has built 17 hubs to bolster its anime-comic
industry development.</P>
      <P>Lured by the sector's lucrative market potential, Hollywood has been busy
churning out blockbusters featuring computer animated special effects. Films
such as 2012, District 9 and Avatar have proved to be worldwide box-office hits.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the government should take a cue from the Chinese and South
Korean governments. As the first step, the government should help set up an
anime-comic industry park that will facilitate the integration of education,
production, capital and marketing  in one shot and open  up new frontiers  for
this knowledge-based software industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>288 foundation urges eligible families to file compensation claims</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are still over 4,000 cases in which claims have not been filed by families
who may be entitled to compensation in relation to the February 28 Incident in
1947, according to the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation Monday.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Tsay Ching-yen called for those families to move fast to
apply for the cash compensation being offered, as the application period will
expire at the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>"The foundation itself will be dissolved by March 2012, " Tsay noted.</P>
      <P>Tsay made the call at a hearing at the Legislative Yuan, during which ruling
Kuomintang (KMT)  Legislator Liu Sheng-liang  and opposition Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator Huang Wei-cheh urged the foundation to step up
efforts to contact the affected families to allow them to file compensation
claims as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Feb. 28 Incident refers to a series of events in 1947 that led to a brutal
crackdown by the then KMT government against the local population, particularly
the intelligentsia.</P>
      <P>In 1990, the Executive Yuan set up a task force of scholars and other experts to
study the 228 Incident. The "Report of the 228 Incident" was published in 1992,
and a memorial was set up in 1995 in the 228 Peace Park in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>In October 1995, the non-profit 228 Incident Memorial Foundation was established
to deal with matters relating to compensation and rehabilitation of 228 Incident
victims.</P>
      <P>Since its inception, the foundation has acknowledged a total of 7,067
compensation  cases involving  deaths,  missing  people, incarceration and
defamation, Tsay said.</P>
      <P>The foundation has so far disbursed more than NT$18.7 billion (US$577 million)
in compensation to the families of the victims in over 3,000 cases, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsay said he believes that some 4,000 families did not file claims because in
most cases the notices were sent to wrong or inaccessible addresses, or the
victims and their families could not be located.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  KMT Legislator Chiang Yi-hsiung said that some Taiwanese residents
were indicted on charges of rebellion, but in the end were convicted for
engaging in illegal arms deals, which would have disqualified them from applying
for compensation.</P>
      <P>"I therefore propose an amendment to the law to allow an expansion of the
compensation criteria to allow more victims to receive compensation," Chiang
said at the hearing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed
concern Monday that shoddy goods from China will flood the Taiwan market after
the two sides ink an agreement this week on product inspection.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei said at a press conference that China's product
inspection mechanism lacks credibility and that a bilateral agreement on
industrial product standards, inspection and certification will allow flawed
Chinese products to flow into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen
Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) , are holding the fourth round of cross-strait negotiations in Taichung
City Dec. 21-23.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, four main agreements are expected to be signed on fishery
cooperation,  avoidance  of double taxation, inspection, certification of the
standards of industrial products, and the inspection and quarantine of
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the agreement on cross-strait
industrial  product  standards  inspection  and certification will cut time and
costs and will benefit Taiwanese companies that export their products to China.</P>
      <P>However, Chen argued that the agreement will also allow in Chinese products,
which she said are of poor quality, citing a recent report by the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission that said from June to December, a total of 66 Chinese
products, including baby strollers, baby cribs, and toys, were listed as flawed
goods.</P>
      <P>Moreover, from November to December alone, 24 Chinese products, including
erasers, children clothes and sports shoes, were also identified by the European
Union as shoddy products, she noted.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Su Chen-ching said that while Taiwan and China have signed
agreements on attacking crime, expanding cooperation on food safety issues,
communicable disease reporting and other issues, several crime and food safety-
related issues have yet to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to the fact that some economic criminals including Chen Yu-hao,
former head of the Tuntex Group, are still hiding in China and that no
provisions have yet been made to compensate Taiwanese victims of the melamine-
tainted milk powder scare that erupted in China last year.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) held a meeting Monday to
prepare for a rapid response to any emergency  situation  that might crop up
during talks between negotiators from Taiwan and China between Monday and
Wednesday in central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan said after the meeting that as a democratic
and free country, Taiwan should ensure that room is given for freedom of
expression and that it is inappropriate and unnecessary for the police to expand
the areas in which security will be tightened during the talks.</P>
      <P>Su gave his assurance that the protests the DPP is planning to stage in Taichung
against the government's China policy in the next few days will be peaceful and
rational. "They will be based on the principle that our voices will be loud but
our actions will be peaceful," Su said.</P>
      <P>He also warned those who want to protest against the visit by Chen Yunlin,
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) ,
that they should protect their personal safety and avoid being provoked by
others during demonstrations.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Taiwan that same day for the fourth round of talks with Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Su also accused a police officer of using pepper spray on two pro-independence
protesters earlier that day outside a hotel in Taichung City where Chiang and
Chen were set to meet. The protesters also included several Taichung city
councilors.</P>
      <P>The two protesters were reportedly taken to a hospital but suffered no serious
injuries, while the police officer was punished for using non-standard-issue
equipment.</P>
      <P>Over the coming days, the city councilors will hold several demonstrations  to
express their opposition to the closed-door Chiang-Chen talks.</P>
      <P>During a Dec. 19 visit to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, Su told him that the DPP's
protests will not involve any "sabotaging" behavior, to which Hu responded that
while the city government respects the people's right to protest, the
demonstrations should remain peaceful.</P>
      <P>He also said he had warned the police not to overreact when facing the
protesters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Improving relations between Taiwan and China in 2010 will be one of a number of
factors that will help attract more foreign investment in Taiwan, researchers of
a leading global investment bank wrote recently.</P>
      <P>In the report published in Barclays Capital's Emerging Markets Quarterly
Outlook, researchers of the investment bank forecast that warming  cross-Taiwan
Strait ties would trigger  more foreign institutional investor interest in
Taiwan markets, particularly its equity and real estate markets.</P>
      <P>Three specific factors -- including two unrelated to Taiwan-China relations --
would lead to the influx of foreign capital, the report said.</P>
      <P>One is the interest rate disparity between Taiwan and the United States, which
is expected to widen because the U.S. is likely to maintain its low interest
rate policy for a longer period of time.</P>
      <P>Also, a possible revision by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) to
increase the weighting of Taiwanese shares in its equity indexes could give a
boost to local shares.</P>
      <P>The key factor related to relations with China, the signing of the financial
MOUs allowing banking, insurance, and securities firms in Taiwan and China to
invest in each other's markets, will likely attract more Chinese funds into
Taiwan, the report suggested.</P>
      <P>Barclays Capital said net capital inflows into Taiwan's bourse reached US$7.2
billion in the third quarter of this year and contended that the trend will
likely continue into the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>The report, titled Sharpen Your Pencil, analyzed the future economic development
of emerging markets in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.</P>
      <P>In its assessment of global markets, the report concluded that the pace of
economic recovery in emerging markets will slow in the near future as their
respective economic stimulus packages wind down and the manufacturing sector
continues its sluggish rebound.</P>
      <P>Asia's emerging economies, however, will steadily recover buoyed by the moderate
global economic upturn and strong domestic demand, leading to the slight
appreciation of Asian currencies next year, the report predicted.</P>
      <P>The South Korean won and the Indian rupee are likely to be the Asian currencies
that will strengthen the most in the first quarter of 2010, and the Chinese yuan
will also start a new round of appreciation, the report said.</P>

      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der expressed support  Monday for the notion of
imposing  a tax on luxury commodities.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a bill-screening session at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said the
imposition of such a tax would be the "right direction," but added that doing so
might involve a law amendment.</P>
      <P>Lee said he did not think the luxury tax can be imposed from 2010 because it
would be a new law and would therefore take longer for the country to prepare
for its enactment and implementation.</P>
      <P>However, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyh-bao rebutted him, saying
that the levying of a luxury tax would not require an amendment by the
legislature.</P>
      <P>"The luxury tax can be levied with just an administrative decree from the
Executive Yuan," Lai argued.</P>
      <P>In California, luxury tax is imposed on goods such as perfume, tobacco, deluxe
cars, alcohol, jewelry and many other items. As it is levied only when the
luxury product is purchased, it is also known as an excise tax.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to a question raised by KMT Legislator Lin Teh-fu, Lee
also expressed support for the levying of higher taxes on luxurious and
expensive houses.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that since real estate tax is under the jurisdiction of local
governments,  the tax authorities should reevaluate the value of so-called
luxury mansions based on the land value and the market value of the buildings,
as well as construction costs, and adjust tax rates in accordance with the
reevaluation.</P>
      <P>The finance minister declined to confirm whether higher taxes will be imposed on
luxurious homes from next year.</P>
      <P>"It depends on how fast the local governments work in this regard," Lee told
Lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Flat panel shares rise on arrival of Chinese negotiator</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The arrival of China's top negotiator with Taiwan lifted a number of shares
Monday that stand to benefit from liberalized economic ties with China,
including Taiwan's top flat panel maker AU Optronics (AUO), which rose to a
five-month high.</P>
      <P>The arrival of Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), in Taiwan Monday renewed speculation that Taiwan's
flat panel makers would be allowed to invest in flat panel production facilities
in China early next year.</P>
      <P>With AUO likely to be the main beneficiary of the new policy, investors sent its
shares higher in early trading by the maximum 7 percent limit to a five-month
intraday of NT$38.4. The stock retreated slightly later in the session to close
at NT$37.95, up NT$2.05, or 5.7 percent.</P>
      <P>It was the most traded stock on the Taiwan stock exchange Monday, with 141
million shares trading hands.</P>
      <P>Chi Mei Optoelectronics, Taiwan's No. 2 LCD maker, rose by NT$0.3, or 1.4
percent, to close at NT$21.25.</P>
      <P>The rise of flat panel makers shares pushed the optoelectronics sub-index higher
by 1.8 percent, beating the broader market. The Taiex, the market's key
barometer, edged up 33.64 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 7,787.27.</P>
      <P>The speculation was set off after the Commercial Times reported Monday that AUO
may be allowed to set up a 7.5 generation plant in eastern China's Jiangsu
Province, representing an investment of over NT$80 billion.</P>
      <P>The report said Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has noted that allowing
Taiwan's flat panel industry to invest in China is a higher priority than
allowing the semiconductor industry to do so.</P>
      <P>The arrival of Chen, who visited AUO's headquarters in the Hsinchu Science Park
when he was in Taiwan last year, also increased the possibility of AUO setting
up a flat panel facility in China, the paper said.</P>
      <P>AUO and Chi Mei both have assembly plants in China but have been barred from
producing flat panels there to date. They are concerned about losing market
share to foreign competitors that plan to set up advanced panel plants in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Glass was also a star performer on the day, as the market
speculated that Chinese industry executives who came with Chen would visit the
glass producer Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Glass shares rose by the maximum 7 percent, or NT$1.70, to close at
NT$26.45, on volume of around 10 million shares -- its highest in the past three
months.</P>
      <P>Glass shares rose the most of any product index, gaining 5.25 percent. Machinery
and electronics shares advanced 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>According to SinoPac Securities, Taiwan shares are expected to move higher in
the first half of 2010 as economic growth reaches a peak in Q1 and a proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is signed around mid-2010.</P>
      <P>This week's talk's between Chen and Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung are expected to boost China-concept and ECFA-related shares in the near
term, SinoPac said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA rebuts report on signing MOU on cross-strait fishery products</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Monday that the signing of a so-called
memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the exchange of information on the safety
of fishery products between Taiwan and China's Fujian Province is merely an
agreement between private individuals that is not legally binding.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times, a local daily, cited an online report carried by the China
News that the Fujian Entry-Exit  Inspection and Quarantine  Bureau  and a
Taiwanese  business  body named the "Cross-Strait Council on Fishery Product
Safety" inked in September what it described as the "Fujian-Taiwan MOU on
Information Exchanges of the Quality and Safety of Fishery Products."</P>
      <P>According to the report, the council was set up by a member of the Taiwan
Society for Promotion of the Guangcai Program -- a civic group that aims to
eliminate poverty and promote economic development through non-government
channels and enterprises.</P>
      <P>Luoh Hung-bin, chairman of the society, was quoted by the report as saying that
his organization never agreed to the establishment of the council and that the
signing of the agreement was purely the act of an individual member who has
since been expelled from the society.</P>
      <P>The COA issued a statement Monday saying that the agreement, which covers only
Fujian Province, has no legal effect and is purely acivil pact because the
signatory representing Taiwan is not an official agency or government-authorized
organization.</P>
      <P>The incident, however, highlights the need for the private sector to have a
better dialogue mechanism between Taiwan and China on the inspection and
quarantine of agricultural and fishery products, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>It said an agreement on cooperation in the inspection and quarantine of
agricultural products that is scheduled to be signed during the fourth round
cross-strait talks this week, will be the first legally binding official
cooperation mechanism covering the issue to be established by the authorities on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The agreement, which will govern every province of China, will strengthen the
authorities on both sides of the strait in terms of the inspection and
quarantine of agricultural products and bring transparency to the behavior of
the private sector on either side, " it added.</P>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kun and his Chinese counterpart,
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin, is
scheduled to take place in Taichung City Dec. 22-23.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, three main agreements are expected to be signed on fishery
cooperation,  certification of standards for industrial  products,  and  the
inspection  and quarantine  of agricultural products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT poses 5 questions to DPP chair about 'Chiang-Chen' talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.21 (CNA)
12/21/09  18:51:15

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang posed five questions to opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen Monday about her party's accusations against
the economic accords to be signed by Taiwan and China later this week.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung brought up the questions as China's top negotiator
with Taiwan -- Chen Yunlin,  president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- arrived in Taichung earlier in
the day for talks on the agreements.</P>
      <P>Chen was scheduled to sign the accords with his Taiwanese counterpart -- Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung -- Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The agreements were to cover cooperation on fishing crew issues, double
taxation,  industrial product standards and agricultural inspection and
quarantine, but as of Monday afternoon, the agreement on double taxation was
withdrawn  from the agenda because of "technical issues."</P>
      <P>On the eve of Chen's arrival, the DPP and pro-independence civic groups
organized a massive protest march in the central city of Taichung to voice their
opposition to the KMT administration's lack of transparency in negotiating deals
with China, which prevents any form of supervision by the people and puts the
country's interests at risk.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee asked Tsai to identify which of the accords or topics to be
addressed at the Taichung round of talks will undermine Taiwan's sovereign
status.</P>
      <P>Second, Lee asked Tsai whether the DPP had pushed for signing of a cross-strait
pact on avoidance of double taxation and cooperation on fishing crews when it
was in power from May 2000 to May 2008.</P>
      <P>"Why would the DPP oppose those policy initiatives that it itself had worked
for?" Lee asked.</P>
      <P>Third, Lee asked Tsai whether she had ever shown her trump card or bottom line
before any international negotiations during her years in public service or her
tenure as chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Fourth, Lee asked Tsai whether the DPP has any alternative to the KMT-proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , which the KMT hopes to sign
with China to protect Taiwan from being marginalized  amid a growing  trend
toward  regional  economic integration.</P>
      <P>While President Ma Ying-jeou has noted the urgency for Taiwan to reach an ECFA
with China to facilitate its talks with other countries on free trade
agreements, the DPP has voiced strong opposition to the proposal on concerns
that it will lead to Taiwan's further reliance on China economically and
eventually erode Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Fifth, Lee asked Tsai to clarify her accusations that Ma has refused to
communicate or have a dialogue with the opposition camp. Lee said he hoped Tsai
would offer evidence to back her allegations.</P>
      <P>Lee posed the questions after Tsai on Saturday asked Ma, who doubles as KMT
chairman, whether he dared to guarantee that signing an ECFA with China would
definitely enable his administration to reach FTAs with other major countries.</P>
      <P>She also asked whether Ma dared to push China to allow Taiwan to begin FTA talks
with ASEAN member states at the same time as ECFA negotiations are being held.</P>
      <P>Third, Tsai asked whether Ma would promise to have members of his cross-strait
policy planning and negotiating team publicly reveal their interests in China.</P>

      <P>An official of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) on Monday urged the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) not to shy away from its responsibility for
possible disturbances during a Chinese delegation's stay in Taiwan for the
latest round of cross-strait talks this week.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said the DPP is trying to give an impression
that after its large anti-China march, which drew tens of thousands of
demonstrators, ended peacefully Sunday, all ensuing activities will "have
nothing to do with the DPP."</P>
      <P>King said, however, that protests continued after China's top negotiator Chen
Yunlin's arrival Monday and that some protesters who took part in the march
Sunday had not really dispersed.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should not shy away from its responsibility and should not act
inconsistently before and after the talks begin," he added.</P>
      <P>King was referring to the DPP's repeated call for "peace and rationality" before
Sunday's march, which proceeded in a peaceful manner under the watchful eyes of
a heavy deployment of police.</P>
      <P>The fourth round of talks between Chen, the president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, and Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, open Tuesday, but Chen is expected to draw
protests throughout his visit in Taiwan, which ends Dec. 25.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT to invite U.S. experts to talk about beef safety issues</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) is scheduled to hold a video
conference Tuesday featuring U.S. experts who will talk about beef safety issues
that have been of grave concern in Taiwan since the government lifted a ban on
imports of U.S. bone-in beef.</P>
      <P>According to the AIT, the conference, titled "A Forum on U.S. Beef Safety, "
will feature presentations by American food safety experts including  Keith
Belk,  a professor at Colorado State University's Department of Animal Sciences,
and Melvin Kramer, a representative of the EHA Consulting Group, Inc.</P>
      <P>Daniel Engeljohn, deputy assistant administrator of the Office of Policy and
Program Development and Inspection Service under the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Food Safety, will also attend the conference, it added.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington signed a protocol Oct. 22 under which Taiwan agreed to
lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and certain other related products, including
ground beef and beef offal.</P>
      <P>The decision sparked controversy in Taiwan, with opposition parties and civic
groups led by the Consumers' Foundation and politicians contending that allowing
imports of high-risk beef products could put consumers at risk of contracting
the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>With their appeals for re-opening Taiwan-U.S. beef talks having been rejected by
the administration, the groups have decided to push for a referendum on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in order to better safeguard the public's health, the legislature
proposed amending the act governing food sanitation to introduce more stringent
checks on U.S. beef imports, but the amendment failed to clear the legislature
floor as scheduled because of continued boycotts by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, which wants its own draft of the amendment used rather than
the one put forward by the ruling Kuomintang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>When the motorcade carrying Chen Yunlin, China's top negotiator with Taiwan,
arrived at a Taichung hotel Monday, he was welcomed by loud air horns and chants
of "Taiwan, China -- one nation on each side."</P>
      <P>What he did not hear but could definitely see were numerous banners held high by
Falun Gong practitioners, who comprised the bulk of the protesters kept at a
distance by barricades.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong is a system of spiritual beliefs and practices founded in China by Li
Hongzhi in 1992. Before it was banned in China, there were 70 million to 100
million practitioners in China, according to the group's Web site.</P>
      <P>"This is not really a protest. We're here to voice our opinion and express our
views that Falun Gong practitioners are still being suppressed in China. And
it's a wrong thing to do, " said a protest leader surnamed Chen.</P>
      <P>Mr. Chen was among around 1,000 Falun Gong members who were scattered around
different intersections and open areas surrounding the Windsor Hotel where Chen
Yunlin is staying.</P>
      <P>Coming  from different  parts  of Taiwan,  the Falun Gong demonstrators  were
easily  differentiated  from the so-called "political protesters", who can be
identified by their loud chants.</P>
      <P>"We probably don't say much publicly, but our determination is strong, " the
Falun Gong's Chen said.</P>
      <P>The group remained silent for much of the day, standing roadside and holding
banners up to 10 meters long reading "Stop suppressing Falun Gong,  " "The world
needs truthfulness,  compassion and forbearance"  and "High-ranking  Chinese
Communist  Party (CCP) officials were prosecuted by a Spanish judge."</P>
      <P>A huge balloon also flew outside the hotel with an attached banner saying "stop
suppressing Falun Gong."</P>
      <P>On Nov. 18, a Spanish judge indicted five high-ranking CCP officials for their
role in crimes of torture and genocide committed against Falun Gong
practitioners.</P>
      <P>Among the defendants is former Communist Party boss Jiang Zemin, widely
acknowledged as the chief instigator of the campaign.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 17, an Argentine judge indicted and ordered the local Interpol branch to
seek the arrest of two high-ranking CCP officials -- Jiang and Luo Gan -- for
crimes against humanity committed against Falun Gong practitioners.</P>
      <P>"We were always peaceful in expressing our views. With our fellow practitioners
still being suppressed in China, the cases in Spain and Argentina and the
arrival of Chen Yunlin, we feel that this is a good time to get our messages
out, " the Falun Gong's Chen said.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of Falun Gong members practiced their rituals in a lot located across
the Windsor Hotel on Monday. Chen said they will remain there for 72 consecutive
hours.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong members will also gather at Sun Moon Lake, a well-known scenic spot
in the central Nantou County especially popular with Chinese tourists, when the
Chinese negotiator visits there Thursday, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Falun Gong spokesman also noted that the police have been friendly to its
group of demonstrators, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"They still asked a lot of questions, but that's their job. I understand that, "
he said, observing that the Falun Gong has seemingly become a sensitive issue
for the government because China is not happy with the group.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government should do more to support the group and condemn China's
persecution, said a practitioner surnamed Liao, who preferred not to reveal her
full name.</P>
      <P>Liao said she has been hoping for more support from the government, particularly
from President Ma Ying-jeou, who according to Liao never hesitated to show his
support for the group in the past but had failed to do so since assuming office
as president.</P>
      <P>"I thought this is a human rights issue and President Ma always advocated human
rights as a universal value, didn't he? On top of that, he signed two United
Nations human rights conventions this past year. Honestly, I'm disappointed with
him, " Liao lamented.</P>
      <P>The Falun Gong Web site says that more than 3,300 practitioners are confirmed to
have died in China as a result of abuse in police custody or other forms of
persecution since 1999.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S. State Department, there are 600,000 Falun Gong
practitioners in Taiwan, making it the largest contingent of practitioners
outside of China.</P>

      <P>Although electric automobiles wholly designed in Taiwan drew the limelight at
the Dubai International Motor Show last week, the producer, Yulon Motor Co.,
complained Sunday that the government is moving at snail's pace in making it
legal for the cars to be used on the roads.</P>
      <P>Kenneth Yen, CEO of the Yulon Group, which makes the world's first electric
7-passenger MPV under the Luxgen marque, made the complaint while expressing his
discontent with the government's policy on promoting the development of electric
automobiles.</P>
      <P>"On the issue of global warming, all I can do as a manufacturer is developing
electric cars as soon as possible," Yen said.</P>
      <P>"However, having now almost completed the development, I find that the cars
cannot be licensed because there are still sections of the tax system that are
imprecise when it comes to vehicles powered by electricity," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Executive Yuan officials, it is the license plate tax that has
blocked electric cars from being put on the road because the existing tax system
only specifies  taxes for traditional gasoline-powered automobiles, based on
engine size.</P>
      <P>Even though the Luxgen has acquired a license plate from the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) as it has passed all acquired safety
tests, it still cannot run on the road until the problem of the license tax is
resolved, an MOTC official said Monday.</P>
      <P>In response, an official of the Tax Agency under the Ministry of Finance told
CNA that the agency "is handling the issue in an active manner."</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu agreed last week to make electric cars the top
priority in the government's plan to promote the development of emerging
industrial sectors, instructing Minister without Portfolio Yiin Chii-ming to
coordinate relevant ministries and agencies in forming measures to carry out the
policy.</P>
      <P>Under a Ministry of Economic Affairs' preliminary plan, the government from 2010
on will subsidize state-run enterprises and public transport operators that opt
to purchase electric cars.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that 65,000 electric cars will be sold within six years, creating a
production value of around NT$200 billion (US$6.18 billion for the electric
automobile sector.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China decided at a preliminary meeting on Monday to remove the issue
of double taxation from the agenda of their formal talks this week, confounding
expectations that an agreement would be signed on the issue.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, however, before the decision was announced, legislators
urged the Ministry of Finance to set conditions for tax information exchanges
and ensure that the agreement could not be retroactively applied.</P>
      <P>It was not immediately clear if the issues they raised had anything to do with
the surprise withdrawal of the issue from the talks, but Finance Minister Lee
Sush-der said that around "70 to 80 percent" of the taxation agreement had been
discussed with some unidentified technical issues still to be solved.</P>
      <P>The two sides, therefore, decided not to sign the agreement this week but will
continue to negotiate on the issue, Lee said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>On Monday morning, the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee passed a provision
insisting on limiting tax information exchanges between the two sides, and
making sure the taxation agreement would not be applied retroactively.</P>
      <P>Lee told the committee that procedures would follow the rules stipulated in the
agreement and that all past cases would be deleted.</P>
      <P>"In practice, that's how it would be anyway because there is no way we would
pursue those cases," he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan earlier this month, Lee gave his assurance that
information on individuals and companies would not be revealed during tax
information exchanges between the two sides, in line with international tax
treaty protocols.</P>
      <P>Such information would only be supplied when there is a specific need to conduct
audits in major cases of tax evasion, he added.</P>
      <P>However, concerns lingered that the taxation agreement might enable China to
obtain more financial information about Taiwanese businessmen  operating there,
which could affect their future operations.</P>

Democratic Progressive Party stems partly from their lack of access to details
about the Chiang-Chen talks, and the government must work to mitigate their
misgivings.</P>
      <P>To strengthen the cross-strait negotiating framework, civic supervision and
evaluation should be included.</P>
      <P>With the ruling party controlling  both the executive and legislative branches,
legislative supervision is not sufficient to avert public criticism of the
government's lack of transparency in handling cross-strait deals and win public
trust.</P>
      <P>Crafting an assessment system to review the results and effects of cross-strait
agreements is equally important in winning social support for the government's
China policy.</P>
      <P>While pacts on tourism, air and shipping links and financial cooperation have
generated some positive effects, they may not fully live up to original
expectations. Such shortfalls require more mutual efforts in the future.</P>
      <P>As to the judicial aid agreement, only if China is willing to repatriate
notorious financial criminals, such as former Tuntex Chairman Chen Yu-hao, the
public will come to believe that Beijing is true to its words.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan inclined to allow panel makers to invest in China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is inclined to remove restrictions to allow local flat-panel
manufacturers and chip foundries to set up more advanced plants in China,
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Monday.</P>
      <P>No timetable has been set, however, for when large-size panel makers would be
allowed to set up panel factories across the Taiwan Strait, Shih said, though he
suggested a decision might come early next year.</P>
      <P>The government  will hold inter-agency  meetings to review regulations related
to the issue at the end of the month, Shih said Monday at a legislative hearing.
Any decisions made will be based on the premise that Taiwan's flat panel sector
should keep advanced core technologies at home, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese panel makers are currently barred from setting up such facilities in
China, although they do operate assembly plants there, and chipmakers can only
invest in less advanced fabs, for fear that Taiwan could lose its cutting-edge
technologies to its political rival.</P>
      <P>Shih was responding to speculation that the government has decided to lift the
ban after a local newspaper report said AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , the world's
third-largest flat- panel maker, will set up a 7.5-generation liquid-crystal-
display (LCD) plant in Jiangsu, China, to produce television screens bigger than
40 inches.</P>
      <P>The plant, requiring an investment of NT$80 billion, would reportedly produce
flat panels for televisions to meet growing demand in China.</P>
      <P>Last week, Shih said flat panel makers could begin setting up manufacturing
facilities in China in the first quarter of 2010, while chip foundries will be
allowed to do so in the second quarter of the year.</P>
      <P>The arrival of Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , in Taiwan Monday for formal talks with his Taiwan
counterpart also renewed speculation that Taiwan's flat panel makers would be
allowed to invest in China.</P>
      <P>The government's plans to ease the restrictions came after the world's two
largest flat panel makers,  South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Display
Co., said they plan to set up manufacturing facilities in China to take
advantage of strong demand there.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China will step up discussions on the signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), a local official involved in the
negotiations said Monday as the two countries prepared for formal talks on other
economic issues set to begin Tuesday.</P>
      <P>An ECFA will not necessarily be signed during the next round of talks, but both
sides are willing to intensively discuss the proposed trade pact in the near
future, Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits
Exchange Foundation, told the Central News Agency following a meeting earlier in
the day with his Chinese counterpart Zheng Lizhong.</P>
      <P>The SEF and Zheng's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
are quasi-official organizations designated by the governments of Taiwan and
China, respectively, to handle cross-strait communications in the absence of
official contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The trade pact and intellectual property rights will be the main issues on the
agenda for the fifth round of negotiations, he confirmed, but while the two
sides will hold intensive discussions, the signing of the ECFA will happen when
the time is ripe.</P>
      <P>From both theoretical and practical perspectives, the trade pact is likely to
provide greater benefit to a smaller economy, Kao said in defending the
controversial proposal.</P>
      <P>"It is quite clear which side of the Taiwan Strait is smaller, " he said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, critics, including Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), believe that the pact would allow in a flood of cheap Chinese
products, cause job losses and jeopardize the island's sovereignty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen in China are generally not enthusiastic about a proposed
cross-strait taxation agreement because they are not willing to reveal their
assets, a Taiwanese businessman in China said after the deal was temporarily
shelved.</P>
      <P>The businessman, who declined to be identified, told the Central News Agency
that as far as he knew, many Taiwanese investing in China operate in gray areas
of China's tax system to avoid paying taxes or reducing their tax burden.</P>
      <P>The agreement on double taxation avoidance was to have been signed at the fourth
round of negotiations between Chiang Pin- kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for the
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), from Dec. 22-23.</P>
      <P>Reluctance of Taiwanese businessmen to reveal their financial status was cited
as one of the main reasons that representatives of the two sides decided at a
preparatory meeting Monday afternoon that signing the taxation agreement  should
be put off until some "technical issues" are resolved.</P>
      <P>The businessman pointed out that the tax systems in Taiwan and China are quite
different. Tax collection arms of local governments in China might prey on
Taiwanese businesses to help meet their tax revenue targets, because the
underdeveloped system would give tax officials unlimited authority.</P>
      <P>"If you asked 100 Taiwanese businessmen, 100 of them would suggest that the
assets should not be revealed," he said.</P>
      <P>If personal assets are required to be disclosed in the future, the businessman
said he could not think of any benefits the pact would have for Taiwanese
businessmen in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Preliminary discussions on the signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) across the Taiwan Strait will be the "brightest spot" of the
current round of high-level cross-strait talks in central Taiwan's Taichung
City.</P>
      <P>Reaching such a deal -- a comprehensive accord that would cover market access,
economic cooperation in areas such as intellectual property enforcement, and an
early harvest program that would lower tariffs on some key commodities -- is one
of President Ma Ying-jeou's main goals in office.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, China's point man on cross-strait engagements in his capacity as
director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, told the Central News
Agency Monday that although the trade pact is not on the agenda of this week's
cross-strait talks, negotiators from both sides are expected to exchange views
on relevant topics.</P>
      <P>"Since experts from both sides have developed sound studies on the problems
involved and have also reached positive conclusions through joint research and
discussions, we hope the preliminary talks can create a good opportunity to
activate ECFA negotiations, " Wang said after seeing off China's delegation to
the talks Monday morning.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , will hold formal talks with his Taiwanese counterpart,
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, Tuesday on the
signing of three agreements that will cover cooperation on fishing crew issues,
industrial product standards and agricultural quarantine.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure for Taiwan, Chen said in Beijing last Friday that
although the two sides will not sign any documents on the proposed ECFA deal, he
is likely to exchange views with Chiang on the opening of expert-level ECFA
talks next year during their meeting in Taichung on Dec. 22.</P>
      <P>The statements by Chen and Wang clearly hinted that the Taichung round of the
Chiang-Chen talks will be critical to progress in the ECFA deal.</P>
      <P>Authoritative Chinese sources said expert-level talks refer to consultations
between officials from both sides to discuss issues under the SEF-ARATS
framework  in their private capacity  as specialists, as China is still
reluctant to accept direct official contacts, which it fears would imply its
recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the ECFA deal will be confined to economic issues and will
not touch on any sensitive or contentious political issues.</P>
      <P>As ECFA involves many complicated issues, inclduing market access, tariff
concessions and service trade, and Taiwan's ruling and opposition camps have not
yet reached a consensus on the deal, it remains to be seen when formal talks on
the topic can take off.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese prosecutors are taking civil action to retrieve the more than NT$200
million (US$8.58 million) frozen in several Singapore bank accounts held by
Ching Chi Ju, one of the two middlemen involved in Taiwan's abortive bid to buy
diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The move is the prosecutors latest effort to recover all of the US$29.8 million
that Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) wired into a joint account held
by Wu Shih-tsai and Ching in Singapore's OCBC Bank on Sept. 15, 2006 to
facilitate the diplomatic initiative.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese authorities found that the money had disappeared by December 2006
without any progress being made in developing ties with the Pacific country and
concluded that Wu and Ching embezzled most of the funds.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs filed a civil suit via its representative
office with Singapore's High Court against Wu and Ching last year to demand
repayment of the sum in full.</P>
      <P>The agency received good news on Saturday when Singapore's high court ordered
OCBC Bank to remit back to Taiwan the sum of S$2.1 million (US$1.49 million)
that had been frozen in an account held by Wu, a Singaporean national.</P>
      <P>Local prosecutors have also sought the help of their Singaporean counterparts to
investigate the flow of funds held by the two middlemen.</P>
      <P>At the same time, they have seized two houses Wu bought using the funds he
embezzled and frozen US$1.5 million in a Taiwan bank account he held and NT$70
million worth of structured notes and other financial instruments in his name,
according to the source.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors to date have frozen nearly NT$400 million worth of assets held by
the two suspects, the source added.</P>
      <P>Singapre's high court is scheduled to hold a hearing on Ching's case in February
2010.</P>
      <P>Wu is presently serving time in a Taiwan jail after he was convicted in October
2008 of forgery and making false accusations and sentenced to 28 months in jail.
He began serving the sentence in May 2009.</P>

      <P>We keenly hope that the peaceful and rational protest against the government's
China policy held by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Sunday will mark the
start of shift in the DPP's vision of cross-strait relations and a new pragmatic
attitude on the issue.</P>
      <P>The DPP's opposition  to the present mode of cross-strait interaction bucks
mainstream aspirations as most local people yearn to see cross-strait peace and
cooperation in creating prosperity and mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>The party could put its future at risk if it continues its opposition to cross-
strait engagements for opposition's sake.</P>
      <P>Here are some suggestions for the DPP leadership:</P>
      <P>--  The party should  consider  "critical  acceptance"  of institutionalized
cross-strait talks known as the Chiang-Chen while continuing to monitor and
criticize deficiencies and flaws in those engagements.</P>
      <P>-- The party should study the feasibility of DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen meeting
with China's Chen Yunlin. As Taiwan's largest opposition party, the DPP can
convey its perspective or vision on cross-strait relations to Chinese leaders
through such a meeting.</P>
      <P>--  The party should study the extent of the impact  of cross-strait issues to
its voter appeal. The DPP's strong protest against the current round of Taiwan-
China talks is believed to be related to its stronger-than-expected showing in
the Dec. 5 local elections, but it should cool-headedly examine whether its
anti-China policy is truly helpful to its electoral fate. Misperception could
misinform policy and ultimately stymie the party's development.</P>

      <P>A draft bill offering special tax incentives to businesses headquartered in
Taiwan is expected to pass the Legislative Yuan Tuesday and take effect starting
on Jan. 1, 2010.</P>
      <P>A Ministry of Economic Affairs spokesman said that with the implementation of
the new bill, Taiwanese businesses with their operating headquarters in Taiwan
will be eligible for tax breaks, including receiving tax exemptions for certain
categories of income.</P>
      <P>Business income from research and development projects and patent rights and
profits from investments in related overseas enterprises will not be taxed,
while income from other operations will be taxed at 20 percent, the standard
corporate income tax rate in Taiwan beginning in 2010.</P>
      <P>Multinational companies that establish their headquarters in Taiwan will receive
an even deeper tax break. Their corporate income will be taxed at a fixed 15
percent rate while enjoying the same tax exemptions for specific categories of
income.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the draft bill is aimed at attracting more multinational
companies to set up operational headquarters in Taiwan. He estimated that the
global or regional headquarters  of an international business could create at
least 1,000 job opportunities and contribute tax revenues of NT$3 billion
annually.</P>

      <P>A draft bill offering special tax incentives to businesses headquartered in
Taiwan is expected to pass the Legislative Yuan Tuesday and take effect starting
on Jan. 1, 2010.</P>
      <P>A Ministry of Economic Affairs spokesman said that with the implementation of
the new bill, Taiwanese businesses with their operating headquarters in Taiwan
will be eligible for tax breaks, including receiving tax exemptions for certain
categories of income.</P>
      <P>Business income from research and development projects and patent rights and
profits from investments in related overseas enterprises will not be taxed,
while income from other operations will be taxed at 20 percent, the standard
corporate income tax rate in Taiwan beginning in 2010.</P>
      <P>Multinational companies that establish their headquarters in Taiwan will receive
an even deeper tax break. Their corporate income will be taxed at a fixed 15
percent rate while enjoying the same tax exemptions for specific categories of
income.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the draft bill is aimed at attracting more multinational
companies to set up operational headquarters in Taiwan. He estimated that the
global or regional headquarters  of an international business could create at
least 1,000 job opportunities and contribute tax revenues of NT$3 billion
annually.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese prosecutors are taking civil action to retrieve the more than NT$200
million (US$8.58 million) frozen in several Singapore bank accounts held by
Ching Chi Ju, one of the two middlemen involved in Taiwan's abortive bid to buy
diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The move is the prosecutors latest effort to recover all of the US$29.8 million
that Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) wired into a joint account held
by Wu Shih-tsai and Ching in Singapore's OCBC Bank on Sept. 15, 2006 to
facilitate the diplomatic initiative.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese authorities found that the money had disappeared by December 2006
without any progress being made in developing ties with the Pacific country and
concluded that Wu and Ching embezzled most of the funds.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs filed a civil suit via its representative
office with Singapore's High Court against Wu and Ching last year to demand
repayment of the sum in full.</P>
      <P>The agency received good news on Saturday when Singapore's high court ordered
OCBC Bank to remit back to Taiwan the sum of S$2.1 million (US$1.49 million)
that had been frozen in an account held by Wu, a Singaporean national.</P>
      <P>Local prosecutors have also sought the help of their Singaporean counterparts to
investigate the flow of funds held by the two middlemen.</P>
      <P>At the same time, they have seized two houses Wu bought using the funds he
embezzled and frozen US$1.5 million in a Taiwan bank account he held and NT$70
million worth of structured notes and other financial instruments in his name,
according to the source.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors to date have frozen nearly NT$400 million worth of assets held by
the two suspects, the source added.</P>
      <P>Singapre's high court is scheduled to hold a hearing on Ching's case in February
2010.</P>
      <P>Wu is presently serving time in a Taiwan jail after he was convicted in October
2008 of forgery and making false accusations and sentenced to 28 months in jail.
He began serving the sentence in May 2009.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China's top negotiators formally opened their latest round of talks
Tuesday following a surprise announcement a day earlier that a planned agreement
on double taxation avoidance had been removed from the meeting's agenda.</P>
      <P>"Both sides had reached a consensus on the main content of the agreement on
avoiding double taxation, " said Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , in his opening remarks.</P>
      <P>"On the technical front, however, both sides believe that more time is needed,"
Chiang explained.</P>
      <P>Never in the previous three rounds of the carefully scripted Chiang-Chen talks
had the two sides put a planned agreement on hold just before the two
negotiators met formally to seal the deals.</P>
      <P>A number of factors were cited by local media as contributing to the last minute
snag. Some reports suggested the two sides succumbed to mounting pressure from
Taiwanese-invested companies in China that were worried they would have to pay
higher taxes under the new agreement.</P>
      <P>Others zeroed in on a possible sovereignty-related dispute.</P>
      <P>The proposed tax agreement is based on the OECD (Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development) standard, which uses a "state to state" framework,
and the two sides were reportedly unable to come up with language that papered
over wording in some clauses that touched on the sovereignty issue, according to
reports of the Economic Daily News.</P>
      <P>The negotiators are still expected to sign agreements on fishing crew
cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection, and industrial product
standards, inspection and certification.</P>
      <P>For his part, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
President Chen Yunlin, representing China, said that both sides will "exchange
ideas on the principle"  of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
during this round.</P>
      <P>The talks, which started at 9 a.m., are expected to conclude at 2:30 p.m., with
both sides holding separate press conferences on the outcome.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Last-minute negotiations on a double taxation avoidance agreement between Taiwan
and China broke down Monday because of "technical" issues, but both sides agreed
to restart talks as soon as possible and sign the agreement when "the time is
ripe."</P>
      <P>Negotiators representing Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) decided to
remove the double taxation issue from the agenda of their formal talks Dec.
22-23, confounding expectations that an accord would be signed on the issue.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the matter:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>SEF officials attributed the breakdown of the double taxation talks to the fact
that officials from certain Beijing offices had different voices at the last
minute and wanted some adjustments made to the previously reached consensus.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials, however, were skeptical that the changes would be
acceptable to Taiwan, prompting the Executive Yuan to decide to shelve the
talks.</P>
      <P>It was alleged that the crux of the breakdown was that Beijing officials wanted
Taiwanese businessmen operating in China to be excluded from the list for
preferential tax rates.</P>
      <P>But Finance Minister Lee Sush-der declined to confirm the rumors, saying only
that "some room should be left" for future talks. (Dec. 22, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The content of the cross-strait talks on the avoidance of double taxation was
not only blurred and ambiguous, a proposed agreement on the issue was removed
from the agenda at the last minute.</P>
      <P>Some ruling Kuomintang legislators said Monday that they did not understand the
content of a Ministry of Finance (MOF) advertisement run in local newspapers to
explain the tax deal and lashed out at the MOF for wasting taxpayer money by
spending NT$4 million on the ad campaign prior to the opening of the talks.
(Dec. 22, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The breakdown of the cross-strait taxation talks certainly was not good news for
law-abiding companies, while allowing firms with a knack for "tax manipulation"
to let out a sigh of relief.</P>
      <P>Rock Hsu, chairman of the Kinpo Group, which runs several high-tech
manufacturing operations in China, said the agreement on avoiding double
taxation needed to be signed in the long run to secure sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, a Shanghai-based Taiwanese businessman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, welcomed the breakdown, saying that with local tax laws in China
incomplete, leaving too much discretion to Chinese administrators, the agreement
would not help Taiwanese companies there.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese would be in big trouble once their assets and incomes were
exposed," he asserted. (Dec. 22, 2009)</P>

      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relation Across the Taiwan
Straits, arrived in Taichung, central Taiwan, Monday as scheduled for the latest
round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Different voices greeted the arrival of China's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the event:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>"The Communists have run away,  " blasted pro-independence "pan-green"
supporters who had waited for Chen outside the main entrance to Taichung's Ching
Chuang Kang Airport for hours in chilly winds.</P>
      <P>In contrast, supporters of the "pan-blue" camp inclined to favor Taiwan's
improving ties with China applauded the police's strategy of deception to deploy
massive personnel outside the airport terminal while ferrying Chen away on
another route. Both members of the two groups missed the motorcade that took
Chen and his entourage to Taichung's Windsor Hotel.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival, Chen said he " completely respects those who voice different
opinions." (Dec. 22, 2009)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou requested that Chen's itinerary in Taiwan be made public
and transparent in order to prevent misunderstandings or people to be misled. He
also highlighted protecting the people's right of assembly as the goal of law-
enforcement, reminding the police to avoid abusing power while maintaining
order. (Dec. 22, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Following President Ma's request to keep Chen's itinerary in Taiwan transparent,
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart ARATS finally
made public on Monday a rough itinerary that included some changes from the
reported original plan for Chen's visit.</P>
      <P>Chen will not visit the temporary shelter for Typhoon Morakot victims in Shueli
Township in central Taiwan's Nantou County as was planned but will instead visit
a bridge in the township destroyed in the typhoon.</P>
      <P>In addition, the plan to sail on popular Sun Moon Lake has also been canceled
out of safety concerns. (Dec. 22, 2009)</P>

      <P>Taiwan's postal service and its Chinese counterpart have reached agreement on a
framework of cooperation that opens the way for them to launch joint online
shopping services, an official at state-run Chunghwa Post Co. said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chin-hsiung, director of Chunghwa Post's Department of Mail Business, said
it is hoped that the company will be able to open its virtual shop on the
Beijing-based China Post Web site next year, and vice versa.</P>
      <P>The plan is for Chunghwa Post to feature a "China pavilion" on its Web site and
for the China Post Group to include a "Taiwan pavilion" on its site, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Products in the shops will all be carefully inspected to ensure that online
shoppers will not receive substandard goods, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post President Hu Sheue-yun said talks on e-business cooperation
between the two post offices have been conducted for years. The two sides
finally reached a consensus on setting up reciprocal shopping platforms, he
said, but some details still have to be finalized.</P>
      <P>Tseng explained that some technical issues, such as computer connections, also
remain unresolved.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Strict measures keep beef parts at bay, DOH asserts</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top health official assured the public Tuesday that strict measures,
known as the "three controls" and "five certifications, " have indeed been
effective in keeping potentially hazardous beef parts from the United States out
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Leading off the government's planned three-day public briefing on the issue of
U.S. beef imports, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said the
DOH also supports the inclusion of the "three controls" and "five
certifications" in a proposed amendment to the Act Governing Food Sanitation.</P>
      <P>The so-called three controls refer to setting controls on beef imports at the
source, at borders and in markets.</P>
      <P>The five certifications  refer  to verifying  certification documents, checking
that shipments are marked with detailed product information, opening a high
percentage of cartons of imported beef to check the product, conducting food
safety tests, and being able to get information on suspected problem products
immediately, according to DOH officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yaung said he respects efforts made by civic groups to push for a
nationwide referendum on whether Taiwan should restart beef talks with the
United States.</P>
      <P>Yaung's briefing came as the first of three briefings the government will hold
in the coming days to explain what it is doing to keep U.S. beef parts that
critics contend pose a health risk, such as ground beef and beef offal, at bay.</P>
      <P>The briefing comes in response to a public outcry in Taiwan over the lifting of
a ban against U.S. bone-in beef, offal and ground beef Nov. 2 based on a
protocol signed by Taipei and Washington in October.</P>
      <P>Other agencies, including the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, are scheduled to brief the media Wednesday and Thursday,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The campaign is the latest effort by an administration heavily maligned for its
poor public relations skills to explain its stance on a key issue. It has also
recently launched a public relations campaign to present its position on a
controversial proposed trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, legislators will continue to debate the U.S. beef issue Tuesday. The
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has boycotted an amendment that
would officially allow imports of bone-in beef and other U.S. beef products
since the ruling Kuomintang caucus put the bill up for consideration for the
first time on Nov. 17.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus insists that the law must prohibit the import of products such as
offal, ground beef, spinal cords, brains, and skulls, which critics of the U.S.
beef deal suggest are potentially hazardous to human health but Washington
argues are safe.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>UMC honorary chairman Robert Tsao ran large ads in major newspapers Monday
urging President Ma Ying-jeou to put aside his "three no's" policies -- no
unification, no de jure independence and no use of force -- and boldly and
courageously decide to actively promote the formulation of a law for cross-
strait peace.</P>
      <P>For too long, discussions on cross-strait issues have been polarized. But we
think it is futile to discuss unification or independence for Taiwan for it will
never come to any conclusion or consensus.</P>
      <P>Unification vs. independence should no longer be the focus. Rather,  we should
consider, under the premises of peace and democracy, which options or formulas
will build mutual trust and assistance.</P>
      <P>We know that in Taiwan's current political atmosphere, those initiating this
kind of discussion will be "branded" as "tilting toward China " "pro-
unification, " or "selling out Taiwan." But can the ruling  Kuomintang  (KMT)
and main opposition  Democratic Progressive Party avoid the debate on China
policy just because of the fear of being tagged?</P>
      <P>The KMT now controls over two-thirds of the seats in the legislature, and Ma was
elected into presidency by a big margin. The people did not expect an
administration rooted in procrastination.</P>
      <P>We believe that Ma has displayed a ruling style of "avoiding disputes or
controversy" since taking office in May 2008, but the result of such an attitude
will be to "give up management, " and to "forgo shouldering responsibility."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator complained about the lagging implementation of previous
agreements signed by Taiwan and China on tourist arrivals and nonstop flights at
the opening of the latest round of talks between Taiwan and China Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The average daily number of Chinese tourist arrivals has failed to meet the goal
set by both sides, said Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), in his opening remarks at the meeting being held in Taichung.</P>
      <P>He also expressed disappointment that the number of nonstop passenger flights
had failed to meet demand and voiced concerns over China's handling of
compensation  requests for melamine-tainted products shipped from China and its
failure to repatriate wanted Taiwanese economic criminals.</P>
      <P>Chinese milk products were found to be contaminated by the industrial chemical
last year, leading to heavy losses for Taiwanese importers who put in claims for
compensation.</P>
      <P>Offering a positive response, Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said he believed that the problems
can be solved based on the goodwill communications established over the past
year.</P>
      <P>"Some problems occurred after we signed the agreements. Some agreements have yet
to be realized or realized in full, " Chen said. "Everybody feels we need to
increase flights. We have already begun consultations on these issues."</P>
      <P>Despite lingering problems over past deals, the negotiators are expected to sign
agreements on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection, and
industrial product standards, inspection and certification.</P>
      <P>The opening remarks from both sides were followed by a round of closed-door
talks, which are expected to conclude Tuesday afternoon.</P>

      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday that he was glad to see that the
government has insisted on safeguarding Taiwan's sovereignty and the people's
welfare by not signing a cross-strait tax agreement before a dispute over tax
jurisdictions was resolved.</P>
      <P>The double taxation avoidance agreement was one of four pacts expected to be
signed between the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) during
negotiations being held this week in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But representatives of the two parties decided at a preparatory meeting Monday
afternoon that the proposed tax agreement needed to be shelved until lingering
"technical issues" were dealt with at a later date.</P>
      <P>Wang disclosed that he was told by Premier Wu Den-yih last week that the
proposed agreement might not be concluded at this week's meeting. According to
Wang, Wu said that no consensus on tax rates and how tax jurisidictions would be
defined had been reached.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that both sides have their respective positions, Wang said that it
is important to comply with international practice.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's position is more in line with international practice, "of course,
we should stand our ground," said Wang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, legislators of both the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) voiced their support for putting off the
signing of such an agreement, voicing concerns about problems related to the
different taxation systems and protection of personal information.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/22/09  15:16:44
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pan-blue supporters think the pan-green camp's support for disgraced former
President Chen Shui-bian is incredible, but it is also incredible to see them
support Fu Kun-chi, originally a member of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) who ran
as an independent to win the race for magistrate by a huge margin in Hualien
county.</P>
      <P>Chen was engulfed in corruption, but Fu has been implicated in two economic
crimes.  Fu's involvement in insider trading has seriously undermined the order
of financial markets and the interests of the public.</P>
      <P>We wonder why pan-blue voters in Hualien, a pan-blue stronghold, would condemn
Chen and condone Fu?</P>
      <P>If we look at pan-blue voters who support Fu and deep-green voters who support
Chen, we will see how similar they are. This is not an error of democracy, but a
tragedy of populist politics.</P>
      <P>Now Fu has unveiled his ace up his sleeve by appointing his ex-wife Hsu Chen-
wei, whom he divorced only days before his inauguration, as his deputy.</P>
      <P>The move has demonstrated that he is preparing to serve his term in jail after a
local court makes a final ruling on his appeal of an insider trading conviction
and that he will pull the strings from behind bars.</P>
      <P>Such a self-staged drama should not be allowed to pass, and the Interior
Ministry has no reason to accept such an outrageous appointment.</P>
      <P>The KMT should also engage in soul-searching. Both Taitung and Hualien have the
same drama being played out -- using divorce to manipulate the political
situation -- but the KMT has watched it happen and let it continue. How can it
face the simple people in the two counties and the support of pan-blue
supporters?</P>

    <HEADLINE>Academia Sinica predicts economic growth of 4.73% next year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will emerge from the pall cast by the global economic downturn to return
to positive growth in 2010, Academia Sinica, the country's top academic research
institute, said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica's Institute of Economics predicted that Taiwan's gross domestic
product (GDP) will grow 4.73 percent next year, the most optimistic forecast of
any made to date by a domestic economic research institution.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research has offered the next most
optimistic assessment, forecasting growth of 4.66 percent, followed by estimates
of 4.57 percent by the Polaris Research Institute, 4.45 percent by the Taiwan
Research Institute and 4.21 percent by the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
has forecast economic growth of 4.39 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to contract by 2.46 percent this year, Academia
Sinica said, but it cited a number of indicators pointing to a better 2010.</P>
      <P>Export growth turned positive in November, manufacturing growth rose by 8.04
percent in October, the strongest growth since May 2008, and GDP in the fourth
quarter of the year will rise 7.17 percent, the research institute noted.</P>
      <P>"The outlook for 2010 is expected to extend the current recovery that started in
the latter half of 2009, " Academia Sinica said in a statement summarizing the
report. "Stimulated by the expectation of global recovery, investment in Taiwan
is expected to increase by 7.81 percent."</P>
      <P>The anticipated economic growth, however, could be derailed by some
uncertainties, including the tenor of negotiations between Taiwan and China on a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), said Institute of
Economics researcher Ray Yeutien Chou.</P>
      <P>He explained that if talks on the controversial trade pact proceed in a peaceful
environment without vigorous opposition and protests, it could have a beneficial
impact on the economy.</P>
      <P>Chou also cited Taiwan's high unemployment rate, which stands at nearly 6
percent,  and sluggish domestic consumption as major challenges to the country's
economic development.</P>
      <P>The researcher also noted that although the Dubai financial crisis has been
defused, there are still some potential hidden bombs that could possibly trigger
a second wave of recession.</P>
      <P>Some Asian countries, particularly China, have major asset bubbles that could
burst, he warned.</P>
      <P>Despite these uncertainties, Chou said he believes investment in inventories
will help fuel growth as traders build up inventories in anticipation of higher
demand.</P>
      <P>If the current recovery maintains its pace and the government continues efforts
to help local businesses emerge from the economic slump, Chou said it was
conceivable that unemployment could drop to the government's target of 4.9
percent in 2010 and GDP growth could hit 4.8 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. experts give assurance of beef safety</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three U.S. experts gave the assurance Tuesday that beef products from their
country are safe, saying that the production process is subject to stringent
scientific inspection procedures.</P>
      <P>Their remarks came amid debate in Taiwan over the safety of U.S. beef since
Taipei and Washington signed a protocol Oct. 22 under which Taiwan agreed to
lift its ban on U.S. bone-in beef and certain other beef products, including
ground beef and beef offal.</P>
      <P>The decision sparked controversy in Taiwan, with opposition parties and civic
groups, led by the Consumers' Foundation and politicians, contending that
imports of high-risk beef products could put consumers at risk of contracting
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) -- the human form of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Daniel Engeljohn, deputy assistant administrator of the Office of Policy and
Program Development, and Inspection Service under the United States Department
of Agriculture Food Safety, said in a video conference that all U.S. beef
products are subject to rigorous inspection and test procedures to ensure that
no potentially risky beef parts reach the consumer market.</P>
      <P>He noted that roughly 8 million inspection procedures each year are conducted at
some 6,000 facilities and by 8,000 government inspectors to verify compliance
with food safety regulations.</P>
      <P>Keith Belk, a professor at Colorado State University's Department of Animal
Sciences, said that while there is no such a thing as "zero risk" regarding food
products, U.S. beef products are safe, as there have no cases of CJD illness in
the U.S linked to the consumption of beef products.</P>
      <P>Citing a risk assessment report conducted by Taiwan's Department of Health, Belk
said that U.S. beef and beef products pose a "negligible risk" to Taiwan
consumers.</P>
      <P>Melvin Kramer, an epidemiologist of EHA Consulting Group, Inc., argued that U.S.
beef is consumed not only by America's residents but by many others around the
world and is arguably risk free.</P>
      <P>"If I thought that there was a risk, with everything that I know, would I put my
family at risk? The answer is no. I'm not a real risk taker. This is not a real
risk," Kramer said.</P>
      <P>"Our risk today in the human population is zero. Can I guarantee you that it
will remain zero? No. Do I really believe scientifically that it will remain
zero? Yes," he added.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's  video conference  was organized by the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) as part of its efforts to allay public concerns in Taiwan over U.S. beef
products.</P>
      <P>In a letter published Dec. 18 in the Apple Daily, AIT Director William A.
Stanton also assured the Taiwanese public of the safety of U.S. beef, and
expressed hopes that Taiwan will understand why the U.S. is asking it to honor
the beef protocol.</P>
      <P>"We want our trade to grow on the basis of sound science and established
international standards," Stanton said in the letter.</P>
      <P>However, the controversy over the Taiwan government's relaxation of restrictions
on U.S. beef imports remains, as civil groups decided to push for a referendum
on the issue after their appeals for the re-opening Taiwan-U.S. beef
negotiations were rejected by Taiwanese authorities.</P>
      <P>In addition, the legislature has proposed an amendment to the act governing food
sanitation to introduce more stringent checks on U.S. beef imports, but the
amendment failed to clear the legislature floor as scheduled because of
continued  boycotts by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which wants
to pass its own version of the bill rather than the one put forward by the
ruling Kuomintang.</P>

      <P>The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) approved Tuesday a proposed merger between three
domestic liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturers -- Innolux Display Corp.,
Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. and TPO Displays Corp.</P>
      <P>The FTC ruled to allow the merger because it will not restrict competition in
the LCD market and will be beneficial to Taiwan's overall economy.</P>
      <P>The new company is unlikely to raise the prices of its products or the cost of
its services because it will still face competition from six other domestic
manufacturers and from foreign manufacturers in South Korea, Japan and China,
according to a statement released by the FTC.</P>
      <P>Innolux, an affiliate of the world's largest contract electronics maker Hon Hai
Group, reached a consolidation deal in November with Chi Mei, Taiwan's second-
largest and the world's fourth-largest LCD manufacturer, after sealing a similar
deal with TPO in October.</P>
      <P>Innolux will be the surviving company and will be renamed Chimei Innolux Corp.
after the merger, which is expected to take effect April 30, 2010.</P>
      <P>It is predicted that the new company could replace AU Optronics to become
Taiwan's largest LCD manufacturer.</P>

      <P>More young women in Taiwan are trying to start their own businesses, and some
online shops run by young female entrepreneurs have proved successful, according
to a survey conducted by the National Youth Commission.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan women entrepreneurs have traditionally been at a disadvantage
because of comparatively less professional training and fewer channels to
acquire funding and market information, they have learned to apply new
technology and to maximize their creativity in recent years, according to Hung
Ya-ling, secretary-general of the Taiwan Franchises Association.</P>
      <P>Not only are more young women breaking into the business world, some have also
successfully set up shop in cyber world, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The National Youth Commission in late May commissioned a survey team lead by Lu
Jui-yang, an associate professor at the Soochow University, to study the career
expectations of young women aged 20 to 45.</P>
      <P>The survey report released Tuesday indicated that the 4,032 of the respondents
were participants in a vocational assistance program run by the youth commission
between 2002 and 2008.</P>
      <P>Lu said that among the 4,032 respondents, about 20 percent said that they would
like to start their own businesses.</P>
      <P>Those young women who have already tried to start their own small businesses

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's rival legislative caucuses to face showdown over beef issue</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After a month-long deadlock over the controversial issue of U.S. beef imports,
legislative caucuses of Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties reached a
consensus Tuesday that they will meet for a "final showdown" over the issue on
Dec. 29.</P>
      <P>At a Legislative Yuan meeting Tuesday, the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) legislative caucus demanded that legislation of amendments to the
Act Governing Food Sanitation over the U.S. beef import issue should not be
delayed any longer.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsing-nan, a whip of the DPP caucus, challenged the KMT for a showdown, on
Dec. 29, for a final decision on the amendment issue.</P>
      <P>He told the Central News Agency that the DPP has proposed a DPP-version
amendment, which categorically prohibits the import of products such as offal,
ground beef, spinal cords, brains, and skulls, in order to "bar the beef imports
at the source and borders."</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus, meanwhile, said it will seek an
emergency consensus with the administration before Dec. 25 on how a KMT-version
amendment should be presented.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus has put up a bill for consideration for the first time on Nov. 17
that would officially allow imports of bone-in beef and other U.S. beef
procusts. The bill, however, has been boycotted by the DPP.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT legislative whip Lu Hsueh-chang said the caucus will invite
National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi to a caucus meeting on Dec.
25 to present the administration's discourse about its stance on a possible,
workable amendment.</P>
      <P>Lu said KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung will also be invited to attend the
meeting to offer the ruling party's opinions on the matter.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang assured the Taiwan public
Tuesday that strict measures, known as the "three controls" and "five
certifications, " have indeed been effective in keeping potentially hazardous
beef parts from the United States out of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the DOH also supports the inclusion of the "three controls" and "five
certifications" in a proposed amendment to the Act Governing Food Sanitation.</P>
      <P>The so-called three controls refer to setting controls on beef imports at the
source, at borders and in markets.</P>
      <P>The five certifications  refer  to verifying  certification documents, checking
that shipments are marked with detailed product information, opening a high
percentage of cartons of imported beef to check the product, conducting food
safety tests, and being able to get information on suspected problem product
immediately, according to DOH officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Doctor to sue DOH over son's post-immunization death</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A medical doctor said Tuesday that he plans to sue the Cabinet-level Department
of Health (DOH) over the death of his six-year-old son who had received an H1N1
flu vaccine 32 days before.</P>
      <P>Steve Kuo, director-general of the DOH Centers for Disease Control (CDC), said
the CDC respects the decision of the doctor, who is based in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the DOH has no plans to change the current nationwide influenza H1NI
immunization program, even amid doubts as to whether the six-year-old's death
was related to the vaccine.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo,  the boy's father called the 1922 H1N1 vaccination
consultation hotline on Dec. 2 after his son developed a high fever and a skin
rash. The boy had been given an H1N1 immunization shot on Nov. 19.</P>
      <P>Kuo said DOH Vice Minister Chang Shang-chun and CDC experts immediately called
an emergency telephone conference with the child's father in an attempt to offer
help, but the boy died Dec. 21.</P>
      <P>After preliminary discussions, the experts concluded that the boy's death was
unrelated to the H1N1 vaccine, Kuo said, adding that an immunity system problem
could have been one of the causes of death.</P>
      <P>"The boy's parents are welcome to file for a probe into the case to allow other
experts to make a more comprehensive, independent judgment," Kuo added.</P>
      <P>Since the nationwide immunization program was launched Nov. 1, a total of 22
people have filed for such probes and have sought redress for problems
experienced after receiving H1N1 shots, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuo said the total number of hospitalized H1NI patients in Taiwan
since the outbreak began this year has reached 817 as of Tuesday, with 35 of
them being fatal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taichung residents cold-shoulder protests against China-Taiwan talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung, Dec. 22 (CNA)
12/22/09  19:00:02
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some residents in central Taiwan's Taichung City, where the latest round of
China-Taiwan talks are being held, were indifferent toward the ongoing protests
against a visit by a top Chinese envoy and a proposed free-trade pact between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of people marched on the streets and rallied on Sunday ahead
of the Chinese negotiator Chen Yunlin's visit in a protest organized by the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Since Chen's arrival on Monday,
hundreds of people have demonstrated each day outside the hotel where he is
staying.</P>
      <P>The protesters are against the government's plans to sign the trade agreement --
known as the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA). They said they
fear it could flood the island with cheaper Chinese products, shut down small
and medium-size enterprises , cost jobs, and jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty in
the long run by making it too economically reliant on China.</P>
      <P>But some local residents in Taichung said they disagreed with the protesters.</P>
      <P>"No matter what they (the protesters) do, the government is still going to sign
(the ECFA) anyway, " said a cab driver surnamed Yang.</P>
      <P>"I say let President (Ma Ying-jeou) do his things. If you're not happy with his
performance, don't vote for him in the next election. It's that simple, " Yang
said, adding that business in Taichung was not good in the past few days because
of the protest and traffic controls.</P>
      <P>Another resident said Taiwan will be better off signing the agreement with
China.</P>
      <P>"Not signing the agreement means certain death, but signing the agreement does
not necessary mean death," said the resident, also surnamed Yang. "Taiwan is a
small island and China is so economically powerful. The protesters are stupid.
Our economy will improve as long as we have good economic cooperation with
China."</P>
      <P>He said he does not believe Taiwan's sovereignty would be jeopardized.</P>
      <P>"I don't think China is going to come in here and tell us what to do," he said.</P>
      <P>In Sunday's two-hour parade during which organizers shouted out the damage they
believe the economic agreement will cause through a large loudspeaker, onlookers
by the roads barely took notice of the protesters as most people chose to keep
doing what they were doing.</P>
      <P>Despite the lukewarm response, a DPP local representative Chen Da-chun said
Taichung City citizens have been very active in the protest.</P>
      <P>After Sunday's massive rally, smaller scale protests have been staged on Monday
and Tuesday. Pro-Taiwan independence supporters held a sit-in in a vacant lot
across the hotel Chen Yunlin is staying. Falungong practitioners lined the
streets outside the hotel, holding signs and banners to oppose China's
persecution against the spiritual group.</P>
      <P>While the Falungong protesters have made little noise, other groups have used
bullhorns, gas horns and loud speakers to make their views heard.</P>
      <P>A motorcade parade organized by a local branch office of the DPP roamed through
Taichung City Tuesday blaring anti-China and anti- trade pact messages on loud
speakers.</P>
      <P>Some local councilmen tried to enter the restricted area around the hotel at
night. This was widely seen as a self-promotional tactic for the upcoming
elections in five metropolitans in Taiwan, inclding Taichung.</P>
      <P>However, the protests during Chen's visit this year appeared to be different
from those during his visit last year. Local pro-independence groups and the
DPP, traditional partners which formed a united front, appeared to have
different mindset this time.</P>
      <P>Local groups said they feel that the DPP has intentionally kept a distance from
them because of what happened last year when some protesters clashed with the
police in violent protests that happened during that round of talks held in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>DPP officials have said they do not condone violence and wanted to avoid a
repeat of last year's clashes, for which it was criticized.</P>
      <P>In the march on Sunday, the DPP and its supporters marched down one route, while
the pro-independence groups went down the other, before joining for a final
rally.</P>
      <P>"It's obvious that the DPP is intentionally alienating local groups this time
over fears of things getting out of hand, " said Tsai Ting-kuei, Convener of
Alliance of Referendum for Taiwan, one of the groups.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government said signing the economic agreement with China will boost
the island's economic growth by 1.65 percent to 1. 72 percent and create more
job opportunities.</P>
      <P>The government has also said Taiwan will enjoy tariff-free trade with China and
greater access to the Chinese market. If it does not sign the agreement, it
could lose out to China's other trade partners which will ink free-trade
agreements with China, according to government officials.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China's negotiators stressed in their meeting Tuesday the urgency of
the two sides beginning talks on a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>The fourth round of cross-strait negotiations opened in Taichung City earlier in
the day, led by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman Taiwan's semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"It is of great urgency for the two sides to establish an economic cooperation
framework agreement," Chiang said in his opening address.</P>
      <P>However, in the formulation of the agreement, "the difference between the
economic systems and the size of the two sides should be taken into
consideration," he added.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chiang's call, Chen said he hopes the two sides will start negotiations
on the proposed ECFA as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is "purely an economic issue," Chen said, adding that China has been
very aggressive regarding this the matter.</P>
      <P>"Once it is good for cross-strait  relations and economic development on both
sides, (China) will try its best to achieve it," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that he and Chiang will "in principle exchange opinions" on the issue
during their talks.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are two intermediary bodies founded to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of formal ties.</P>

(By Y. S. Cheng and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the latest sign that Taiwan's economy is recovering, 37 percent of local
firms have indicated they plan to raise salaries for their workers next year,
with the average pay raise at 5.84 percent, according to the results of a survey
released Tuesday by 1111 job bank.</P>
      <P>Many workers have already received pay hikes this year, as the island begins to
emerge from its worst recession in decades. The economy contracted 1.29 percent
in the third quarter -- the slowest rate in a year.</P>
      <P>Workers in the transportation  logistics,  real-estate  and manufacturing
sectors received the largest pay hike this year, while those in the real-estate,
transportation logistics and financial and business service sectors will see the
largest growth in their salaries next year, the survey by 1111 job bank found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile 58.08 percent of the companies said they do not have any plans to
raise salaries for their employees, while 2.62 percent said they would continue
cutting workers' salaries or simply adjust their workers' salary levels back up
to the level before the global economic crisis.</P>
      <P>The 1111 job bank carried out the survey of companies from Dec. 8-21, getting
687 valid responses.</P>
      <P>Another survey conducted by the executive research 104 job bank showed that some
85 percent of Taiwan's enterprises have plans to hire new workers in 2010, up by
36 percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The survey found that financial services and insurance companies, culture-
related and IT software businesses as well as those in the construction and
manufacturing sectors plan to recruit new blood next year, citing reasons such
as the need to fill key vacancies and to expand operations.</P>
      <P>Talent are mostly wanted for posts such as sales representatives, R&amp;D
engineers and skilled workers, according to the survey results. Job seekers who
have one-to-three years of experience in these fields are in strong demand as
such job positions account for over 60 percent of the total job openings to be
offered. Those with more than three years of experience and new college
graduates are also popular in the job market.</P>
      <P>104 job bank public relations manager Fang Kuang-wei said companies from almost
all sectors are set to employ new personnel at all levels amid a noticeable
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>While seeking to recruit new workers, enterprises are trying to offer better
incentives, including more handsome cash rewards, year- end bonuses and benefits
or more comprehensive training courses, to retain current staffers, the survey
found.</P>
      <P>The head hunting job bank conducted the survey from Nov. 23-30, collecting 800
valid samples. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.46 percentage
points.</P>
      <P>In another survey the 104 job bank conducted, it discovered that around 81.2
percent of Taiwan's white-collar office workers have thought about switching
jobs in the coming year -- the highest rate in three years.</P>
      <P>About 50 percent of them are thinking of making the move before getting their
year-end bonuses, while 30 percent said they plan to start looking for new jobs
after receiving  year-end bonuses, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Most of the white-collar office workers pondering how to find new jobs cited
major reasons such as "no promotion opportunities, " "unsatisfactory  salaries"
or "feeling  no identity  with the entrepreneurial culture."</P>
      <P>According to those who have recently found new employment, 32 percent said their
new salaries are 14.5 percent higher on average than their previous pay, while
47 percent said their salaries shrank by an average of 18.4 percent, the survey
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The 104 job bank made the survey on the willingness of Taiwan's office workers
from Nov. 23 - Nov. 30 and interviewed 3,514 employees. It had a margin of error
of 1.65 percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan decides not to tax gains on securities investment for now</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet's tax reform committee reached a consensus Tuesday to maintain for
the time being the existing taxation system under which gains obtained by
individuals and corporates from securities investment are tax-free.</P>
      <P>In the mid- to long term, however, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) should study
the possibility of taxing corporates for gains from securities, instead of for
securities transactions, the committee decided in a meeting held to discuss
issues concerning capital gains.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu told reporters after the meeting that the existing
securities transaction tax actually takes into consideration gains on
securities, and that he has required the MOF to release related data to allow
the public to better understand the situation.</P>
      <P>In the future, the securities transaction tax for corporates will probably be
changed to a securities gains tax, in which losses can be offset against gains,
Chu said.</P>
      <P>The committee has recommended that in the initial stages of the new system's
implementation, corporates should be able to choose whether to shift to
securities gains taxation.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der, the option will be offered to
corporates out of fairness.</P>
      <P>Citing analyses of the investment performance of more than 10 large companies in
Taiwan over the past three years, Lee said that although these companies made
gains in the first two years, their losses in the third year far exceeded their
previous gains.</P>
      <P>These companies nevertheless were still required to pay tax, which raises
questions about the fairness of the present system, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) dared the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Tuesday to publish information concerning investments in China by DPP
officials and public office holders.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman  Lee Chien-jung  said that given  the close cross-strait exchanges
over the past decade, he wonders if DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen would dare to
publicize such data amid its current opposition to the economic accords signed
between Taiwan and China earlier that day.</P>
      <P>The agreements covered cooperation on fishing crew issues, industrial  product
standards and agricultural  inspection  and quarantine.</P>
      <P>They were signed by China's top negotiator with Taiwan -- Chen Yunlin, president
of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and his
Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, in the
latest round of just-concluded negotiations between the two sides that concluded
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is regrettable that the DPP ignored the meeting agenda,  sent "one-
sided" and "misleading"  information to its supporters and mobilized protests,
instead of engaging in rational policy debates.</P>
      <P>He said rhetorically that Tsai -- an expert in international trade who
previously served on the National Security Council, the Mainland Affairs Council
and in the Executive Yuan -- should realize that the the development of normal
cross-strait trade relations is crucial to avoiding Taiwan becoming
marginalized.</P>
      <P>How else would Taiwan products be able to compete with those of other countries,
Lee asked. China products will enjoy zero tariff treatment in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) after China joins the regional grouping in
forming a free trade zone from Jan.1., he added. In contrast, Taiwan's products
will be subject to tariffs of between 9percent and 10 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>Referring to Tsai and the DPP's objections to the government's cross-strait
policy, Lee challenged the DPP to identify which of the agreements signed
between Taiwan and China since May 2008 have been "self-denigrating," or "a
sellout of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lee said that President Ma Ying-jeou has repeatedly affirmed that the proposed
cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) will not allow for
more agricultural products or laborers from China to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He questioned the DPP's reasons for what he described as its dissemination of
false information and creation of public panic.</P>
      <P>He noted that since 2003, China has been Taiwan's number one trading partner,
absorbing 40 percent of Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>"Is Tsai aware of these figures?" Lee asked.</P>
      <P>He further challenged the DPP come up with ideas to protect the investments of
Taiwan businessmen in China.</P>

      <P>However, Wang Wen-hsieh, director of the KMT's Huang Fuhsing veterans branch,
voiced opposition.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, a retired general, the KMT brought a lot of equipment with it
when it retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the civil war to the
communists, and that the KMT set up a lot of companies in Taiwan that helped its
economic development.</P>
      <P>As for donating the assets to charity, Wang said that a lot of the party's
assets come from KMT membership fees and that "it is not sensible for outsiders
to share our money."</P>
      <P>Wang should know that even if the KMT has helped Taiwan's economic development,
after the nation's democratization and economic liberalization, all party-owned
and state-owned enterprises should be privatized.</P>
      <P>Moreover, political parties should not have businesses, because otherwise, if
the KMT is so rich while the other political parties have to tighten their
belts, how can there be fair competition among them?</P>
      <P>Wang should retire. And soon.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top China affairs official on Tuesday lauded the results of the fourth
round of negotiation between Taiwan and China as fruitful and said she envisions
better bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan addressed the Chinese
delegation after Chiang Pin-kung and Chen Yunlin, heads of designated
organizations that deal with cross-Taiwan Strait matter s in the absence of
formal ties, signed three of four agreements on the meeting's agenda.</P>
      <P>"In order for both sides of the strait to avoid war, pursue peace and establish
a stable environment for exchanges, we have to resolutely take a path of
institutionalized negotiations, which is the right one for cross-strait
relations," Lai said.</P>
      <P>The three agreements were on cooperation on the inspection and quarantine  of
agricultural  products,  standards  testing  and certification cooperation, and
fishery labor cooperation.</P>
      <P>An agreement  on the  avoidance  of double  taxation  and strengthening of tax
cooperation was not signed as both sides failed to reach consensus, citing
"technical issues."</P>
      <P>The MAC chairwoman said that the agreements reached in the four rounds of talks
so far have ensured an orderly and systematic progression of bilateral exchanges
and that the unsigned agreement signified an institutionalized and mature
negotiation process.</P>
      <P>Views on cross-strait relations in Taiwan have been polarized and the Chinese
might be confused at Taiwan's hesitance and unease despite China's goodwill and
its arrangements, Lai acknowledged.</P>
      <P>"But this is the norm in a diverse society and a fact that both sides need to
deal with carefully," she advised.</P>
      <P>The most important factor in cross-strait talks, she stressed, is gaining the
support of the people because Taiwan, with a democratic government, has to
listen to the people, respect them and respond swiftly.</P>
      <P>The development of "peaceful and stable cross-strait relations can only go as
far as people's support takes us," she said.</P>

      <P>A newly established center under the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) plans to form an R&amp;D consortium and to launch the first version of an
advanced container computer system by the end of 2010, the center's head said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Cloud Computing Research Center for
Mobile Application (CCMA) , Chiueh Tzi-cker also said the center will develop
software talent and assist the government to implement a country-wide program
for maintaining electronic medical records.</P>
      <P>According to Chiueh, the CCMA plans to form the R&amp;D consortium with four or
five local partners to develop the "container computer 1.0" -- a 40-foot
preconfigured shipping container that can hold up to 1,000 servers -- and to
launch the product by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>This would make Taiwan the first country in Asia to develop the container
computer, said Chiueh, adding that the product, at an average cost of about US$5
million, will become a building block for any container-based data center.</P>
      <P>He said developing the container computer will provide great business
opportunities for Taiwanese hardware manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing is a Web-enabled software solution that uses the Internet as a
platform for performing tasks on the computer and delivers a range of inter-
operable applications.</P>
      <P>ITRI President Johnsee Lee described  it as a concept of resource-sharing, and
said that cloud computing will not only affect the software and hardware
manufacturers in the information and communication industries, but will also
help local small- and medium-sized companies and the service industry to
transform and upgrade, which could change the economic structure of the country.</P>
      <P>Chiueh said the CCMA has 40 employees employed in hardware equipment, software
services and applications and that the number of employees is expected to
increase to 80 in the first quarter of 2010 and to 150 in 2011.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih on Tuesday dismissed speculations that the reason for the
delay in signing a deal with China on avoidance of double taxation was due to
issues involving the island's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Negotiators of Taiwan and China concluded the latest round of talks the central
Taiwan city of Taichung earlier in the day, without signing the tax agreement,
which was among four items on the agenda for discussion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China had earlier reached consensus on a taxation system based on
where the taxpayer resides, Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, Chinese negotiators later brought up the idea of basing the system on
the origin of the income and cited a similar pact between Hong Kong and China as
an example, he added.</P>
      <P>"We are not in the same status as Hong Kong," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that China-based  Taiwanese investors worried that they
would have to pay higher taxes under the proposed agreement, Wu said that there
will be no problems if everyone obeys the law.</P>
      <P>Following the talks, Taiwan's top negotiator Chiang Pin-kung told a press
conference that putting on hold the tax agreement will not have a negative
impact on Chinese investment in the island.</P>
      <P>Asked if the agreement would be signed at the next round of talks, a Taiwanese
official who took part in the talks did not give a specific answer.</P>
      <P>"We, of course, hope that it would happen as early as possible, " said Liu Te-
shun, the vice chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Top negotiators from both sides said that the taxation issue remains on the
agenda of future negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Both sides had reached a consensus on the main content of the agreement on
avoiding double taxation, " said Chiang.</P>
      <P>"On the technical front, however, both sides believe that more time is needed,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>The agreement had been previously slated to take effect on Jan. 1, 2010. Now, it
could enter into force by 2011 at the earliest, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Chiang, the chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), ended up
with inking three agreements with his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin on fishing
crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection, and industrial product
standards, inspection and certification at the end of the talks held in central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official body set up to handle cross-strait exchanges with
its counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), in the absence of formal ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The next round of Taiwan-China talks, the fifth round since talks resumed last
year, is slated to take place in China during the first half of 2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA, IPR will be covered in fifth cross-strait talks: MAC</HEADLINE>

      <P>A planned economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and the issue of
intellectual property rights (IPR) will be covered in the next round of cross-
Taiwan Strait talks slated for the first half of 2010 in China, the Cabinet-
level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MAC made the announcement in a press release after the top negotiators from
the two sides -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin -- president of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- inked three cooperation pacts
in central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen signed agreements on fishery worker cooperation, agricultural
quarantine inspection and industrial product standards certification during
Tuesday's talks, but an agreement on avoidance of double taxation was not sealed
due to non-political technical details, the MAC said, adding that the accord
will be signed in the near term after further discussions.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from reporters at a news conference later in the day on
whether the ECFA will be signed in May, as Taiwan hopes, or in the fifth round
of cross-strait talks, ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong voiced reservations,
although he pledged that both sides are seeking to start ECFA-related talks as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"Despite the fact that inking a cross-strait ECFA is unavoidable amid the
increased economic interaction between the two sides, many discussions remain to
be conducted and many arrangements remain to be made," he explained.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ECFA is purely an economic matter, Zheng said, China will
take "the scale of Taiwan's market" and "the impact of the trade pact on
Taiwan's economy" into consideration in a bid to "maximize the benefit (to
Taiwan) at the least cost."</P>
      <P>Due to the sharp difference between the size of the two markets, he emphasized,
"China will definitely consider the absorbing capacity of Taiwan's market and
how much its people can take when signing the ECFA with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to political analysts, Zheng's emphasis on the economic fronts of the
ECFA and his promise to weigh Taiwan's market scale are a clear sign of China's
efforts to seek the Taiwan people's backing for the pact -- paving the way for
negotiations on the issue that are scheduled to begin next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the economy recovers, Taiwan's jobless rate dropped for a third consecutive
month in November, while the average monthly wage rose in October for the first
time in nine months, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The jobless rate in November dropped to 5.86 percent, 0.1 percentage points down
from October. After seasonal adjustment, the unemployment rate stood at 5.98
percent, or 0.06 percentage points less than the previous month and the first
time in more than five months it had dropped below 6 percent.</P>
      <P>The monthly jobless rate -- either seasonally adjusted or unadjusted -- was
lower in November, which is a sign that the unemployment situation has
stabilized, said Liu Tien-si, a DGBAS deputy department chief.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of unemployed people totalled 645,000, down 8,000 from the
previous month, while the number of employed totalled 10.37 million, up 59,000.</P>
      <P>Liu also noted that the labor force participation rate in November rose to 58.15
percent -- the highest level in 11 months -- up 0.21 percentage points over the
previous month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the average monthly income in October rose by 1.4 percent to
NT$40,156, which marked the first positive growth in the past nine months.</P>
      <P>However, the average monthly wage between January and October fell by a record
5.57 percent year-on-year to NT$42,766, Liu added.</P>
      <P>The average regular monthly wage fell by 1.13 percent in October, to NT$36,143,
which marked the smallest decline in almost one year.</P>
      <P>The average wage includes regular wages, including salary and fixed monthly
subsidies and bonuses, plus overtime and other non- regular wages such as
performance bonuses, year-end bonuses and employee bonuses.</P>
      <P>Real monthly income, which takes into account the impact of the consumer price
index on wages, also fell by a record 4.76 percent to NT$40,964 between January

      <P>Real regular wages dropped by 1.45 percent year-on-year to NT$34,253 during the

      <P>Taiwanese consumers have been showing high confidence in the stock market, with
less pessimism compared with six months ago, according to the results of a semi-
annual survey released recently by MasterCard Worldwide.</P>
      <P>The latest MasterCard Worldwide Index of Consumer Confidence was conducted
between Oct. 1 and Nov. 9 among 10,623 consumers from 24 markets across the
Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.</P>
      <P>It measures consumer confidence and sentiments on prevailing expectations in the
market for the next six months, with an index score of zero as the most
pessimistic, 100 as most optimistic and 50 as neutral.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overallindex score was 56.5, up from 39.4 six months ago and 32.1 a
year ago, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Consumer sentiment turned optimistic on three indicators compared to six months
ago, with the most significant recovery seen in stock market confidence, on
which the score jumped from 54.5 to 74.7.</P>
      <P>The score is the fifth-highest in the Asia-Pacific region and the highest in the
Greater China region.</P>
      <P>The score of confidence in the economy, meanwhile, moved up from 47.8 to 60.5,
while the score of employment confidence rose from 38.5 to 57.0.</P>
      <P>Local pessimism remained, however, about regular income and quality of life,
although the scores for these two indicators rose from 22.2 to 47.2 and from
34.0 to 43.1, respectively.</P>
      <P>The report revealed that compared to six months ago, the Asia-Pacific region has
seen an increase in its consumer confidence index score, from 38.7 to 66.3.</P>
      <P>Vietnam (90.0) ,  China (85.3) and Singapore (79.4) showed significantly higher
consumer confidence compared to other markets in the region.</P>
      <P>Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, MasterCard's Asia-Pacific economic advisor, noted that when
the global economy started to stabilize in the second half of 2009, conditions
improved especially fast in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"The latest findings of the overall robust rebound in consumer confidence in the
region mirrors progress seen in the real economy, " he said.</P>
      <P>He predicted that renewed consumer confidence will contribute to the momentum of
recovery, because it will lead to lower precautionary savings and higher
spending, which will in turn improve business outlook and encourage more
investment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Tuesday that Hualien Magistrate Fu
Kun-chi's naming of his "ex-wife" as deputy magistrate is invalid, on the
grounds that their divorce was fake and that the appointment of his wife
therefore is in breach of the relevant laws.</P>
      <P>Jiang made the announcement  following a meeting in which officials from the
Interior Ministry, the Justice Ministry, the Central Personnel Administration,
the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan made the decision.</P>
      <P>Jiang said his ministry will ask the Executive Yuan to rescind Fu's appointment
of Hsu Chen-wei, his wife, as deputy magistrate of Hualien County because the
two are still married to each other.</P>
      <P>According to the Public Official Employment Law, it is against the law for a
holder of public office to designate a spouse or a family member living under
the same roof as his or her deputy.</P>
      <P>Fu, who was elected by a landslide in the Dec. 5 local elections running as an
independent after being expelled by the ruling Kuomintang, supposedly divorced
Hsu Dec. 18 and then picked her as his deputy just three days later.</P>
      <P>In a bid to make the divorce appear bona fide, Fu re-registered Hsu's family
registration in the house of his mother-in-law, who lives next door to Fu, the
MOI said in a news release.</P>
      <P>According to Jiang, the MOI will also ask the Control Yuan to fine Fu between
NT$1 million (US$30,000) and NT$5 million for breaking the Employment Rules of
the Act on Recusal of Public Servants Due to Conflicts of Interest because their
actual relations are husband and wife.</P>
      <P>Fu's appointment of Hsu is widely seen as an attempt to hold on to the post, as
he is also appealing a six-and-a-half-year sentence for violating securities
trading regulations.</P>
      <P>The MOI said Fu and Hsu are recognized as "members of the same family" given
that they are rearing their children together and because they have told
supporters that they are still a family.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI, the divorce apparently violates Article 87 of the Civil
Law and thus was ruled invalid.</P>
      <P>Also, in line with the fourth provision of Article 75 of the Local Government
Law, Fu's designation of Hsu as his deputy is unlawful, the MOI said.</P>
      <P>The case also violates Article 6 and Article 7 of the Enployment Rules of the
Act on Recusal of Public Servants Due to Conflicts of Interest for naming a
"related person" to a public office post.</P>
      <P>So-called "related persons" refer to a spouse or family member living under the
same roof, according to the law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP blames MAC, SEF for failing to ink tax deal with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday that both
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) head and the chief negotiator with China
should be held responsible for failing to ink a tax deal in the latest cross-
strait talks that concluded that day in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai shin-yuan and Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , Taiwan's chief negotiator in the talks, are to blame
for the failure, said DPP acting spokesman Chung Shuo-han at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Chiang and his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, signed three agreements on fishery crew
cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection,  and industrial product
standards,  inspection  and certification in the talks, the fourth of their kind
since last year, but fell short of a fourth on taxation, citing "technical
reasons."</P>
      <P>"The government should make public the reasons behind the failure for the tax
deal, which could result in a loss of NT$30 billion (US$940 million) in tax
revenue," said Chien Yao-tang, a research fellow with the Taiwan Thinktank, at
the press conference.</P>
      <P>Well ahead of the talks, the government had blared about forging the tax pact,
and the last-minute failure shows its inability to control the tenor of the
negotiations, said Liu Chieh-hsin, deputy chief of the DPP's Strategy Committee.</P>
      <P>Concern on the part of China-based Taiwanese investors about a possible tax
probe by the government is the main reason for the delay in the cross-strait tax
pact, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to a challenge by the ruling Kuomintang for the
opposition  party  to publish  information  concerning investments in China by
DPP officials and public office-holders, Liu said the KMT has been trying to
"shift the focus of concerns" and has failed to play its role as the ruling
party.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said earlier in the day that given the close cross-
strait exchanges over the past decade, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen should
publicize such data in light of its opposition to the economic  accords signed
between Taiwan and China in the just-concluded talks.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is regrettable that the DPP ignored the meeting agenda,  sent "one-
sided" and "misleading"  information to its supporters and mobilized protests
instead of engaging in rational policy debates.</P>
      <P>However, Liu said that as the main opposition party, the DPP is obliged to
exercise checks and balances on the government, and that in terms of investments
in China, its greatest concern is "whether any of the ruling party members have
ever pursued personal interests in the process of talks with China."</P>
      <P>"Members of Taiwan's negotiating teams should therefore make public the business
operations in China of either their own or family members," he said.</P>

advanced container computer system by the end of 2010, the center's head said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Cloud Computing Research Center for
Mobile Application (CCMA) , Chiueh Tzi-cker also said the center will develop
software talent and assist the government to implement a country-wide program
for maintaining electronic medical records.</P>
      <P>According to Chiueh, the CCMA plans to form the R&amp;D consortium with four or
five local partners to develop the "container computer 1.0" -- a 40-foot
preconfigured shipping container that can hold up to 1,000 servers -- and to
launch the product by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>This would make Taiwan the first country in Asia to develop the container
computer, said Chiueh, adding that the product, at an average cost of about US$5
million, will become a building block for any container-based data center.</P>
      <P>He said developing the container computer will provide great business
opportunities for Taiwanese hardware manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing is a Web-enabled software solution that uses the Internet as a
platform for performing tasks on the computer and delivers a range of inter-
operable applications.</P>
      <P>ITRI President Johnsee Lee described  it as a concept of resource-sharing, and
said that cloud computing will not only affect the software and hardware
manufacturers in the information and communication industries, but will also
help local small- and medium-sized companies and the service industry to
transform and upgrade, which could change the economic structure of the country.</P>
      <P>Chiueh said the CCMA has 40 employees employed in hardware equipment, software
services and applications and that the number of employees is expected to
increase to 80 in the first quarter of 2010 and to 150 in 2011.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tax deal with China involves no sovereignty issue: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih on Tuesday dismissed speculations that the reason for the
delay in signing a deal with China on avoidance of double taxation was due to
issues involving the island's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Negotiators of Taiwan and China concluded the latest round of talks the central
Taiwan city of Taichung earlier in the day, without signing the tax agreement,
which was among four items on the agenda for discussion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China had earlier reached consensus on a taxation system based on
where the taxpayer resides, Wu said.</P>
      <P>However, Chinese negotiators later brought up the idea of basing the system on
the origin of the income and cited a similar pact between Hong Kong and China as
an example, he added.</P>
      <P>"We are not in the same status as Hong Kong," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that China-based  Taiwanese investors worried that they
would have to pay higher taxes under the proposed agreement, Wu said that there
will be no problems if everyone obeys the law.</P>
      <P>Following the talks, Taiwan's top negotiator Chiang Pin-kung told a press
conference that putting on hold the tax agreement will not have a negative
impact on Chinese investment in the island.</P>
      <P>Asked if the agreement would be signed at the next round of talks, a Taiwanese
official who took part in the talks did not give a specific answer.</P>
      <P>"We, of course, hope that it would happen as early as possible, " said Liu Te-
shun, the vice chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>Top negotiators from both sides said that the taxation issue remains on the
agenda of future negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Both sides had reached a consensus on the main content of the agreement on
avoiding double taxation, " said Chiang.</P>
      <P>"On the technical front, however, both sides believe that more time is needed,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>The agreement had been previously slated to take effect on Jan. 1, 2010. Now, it
could enter into force by 2011 at the earliest, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Chiang, the chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), ended up
with inking three agreements with his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin on fishing
crew cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection, and industrial product
standards, inspection and certification at the end of the talks held in central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The SEF is a quasi-official body set up to handle cross-strait exchanges with
its counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), in the absence of formal ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The next round of Taiwan-China talks, the fifth round since talks resumed last
year, is slated to take place in China during the first half of 2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECFA, IPR will be covered in fifth cross-strait talks: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A planned economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and the issue of
intellectual property rights (IPR) will be covered in the next round of cross-
Taiwan Strait talks slated for the first half of 2010 in China, the Cabinet-
level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MAC made the announcement in a press release after the top negotiators from
the two sides -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin -- president of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- inked three cooperation pacts
in central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen signed agreements on fishery worker cooperation, agricultural
quarantine inspection and industrial product standards certification during
Tuesday's talks, but an agreement on avoidance of double taxation was not sealed
due to non-political technical details, the MAC said, adding that the accord
will be signed in the near term after further discussions.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from reporters at a news conference later in the day on
whether the ECFA will be signed in May, as Taiwan hopes, or in the fifth round
of cross-strait talks, ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong voiced reservations,
although he pledged that both sides are seeking to start ECFA-related talks as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"Despite the fact that inking a cross-strait ECFA is unavoidable amid the
increased economic interaction between the two sides, many discussions remain to
be conducted and many arrangements remain to be made," he explained.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ECFA is purely an economic matter, Zheng said, China will
take "the scale of Taiwan's market" and "the impact of the trade pact on
Taiwan's economy" into consideration in a bid to "maximize the benefit (to
Taiwan) at the least cost."</P>
      <P>Due to the sharp difference between the size of the two markets, he emphasized,
"China will definitely consider the absorbing capacity of Taiwan's market and
how much its people can take when signing the ECFA with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to political analysts, Zheng's emphasis on the economic fronts of the
ECFA and his promise to weigh Taiwan's market scale are a clear sign of China's
efforts to seek the Taiwan people's backing for the pact -- paving the way for
negotiations on the issue that are scheduled to begin next year.</P>

from October. After seasonal adjustment, the unemployment rate stood at 5.98
percent, or 0.06 percentage points less than the previous month and the first
time in more than five months it had dropped below 6 percent.</P>
      <P>The monthly jobless rate -- either seasonally adjusted or unadjusted -- was
lower in November, which is a sign that the unemployment situation has
stabilized, said Liu Tien-si, a DGBAS deputy department chief.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of unemployed people totalled 645,000, down 8,000 from the
previous month, while the number of employed totalled 10.37 million, up 59,000.</P>

      <P>The average regular monthly wage fell by 1.13 percent in October, to NT$36,143,

performance bonuses, year-end bonuses and employee bonuses.</P>
      <P>Real monthly income, which takes into account the impact of the consumer price
index on wages, also fell by a record 4.76 percent to NT$40,964 between January

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese consumers have been showing high confidence in the stock market, with
less pessimism compared with six months ago, according to the results of a semi-
annual survey released recently by MasterCard Worldwide.</P>
      <P>The latest MasterCard Worldwide Index of Consumer Confidence was conducted
between Oct. 1 and Nov. 9 among 10,623 consumers from 24 markets across the
Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.</P>
      <P>It measures consumer confidence and sentiments on prevailing expectations in the
market for the next six months, with an index score of zero as the most
pessimistic, 100 as most optimistic and 50 as neutral.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overallindex score was 56.5, up from 39.4 six months ago and 32.1 a
year ago, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Consumer sentiment turned optimistic on three indicators compared to six months
ago, with the most significant recovery seen in stock market confidence, on
which the score jumped from 54.5 to 74.7.</P>
      <P>The score is the fifth-highest in the Asia-Pacific region and the highest in the
Greater China region.</P>
      <P>The score of confidence in the economy, meanwhile, moved up from 47.8 to 60.5,
while the score of employment confidence rose from 38.5 to 57.0.</P>
      <P>Local pessimism remained, however, about regular income and quality of life,
although the scores for these two indicators rose from 22.2 to 47.2 and from
34.0 to 43.1, respectively.</P>
      <P>The report revealed that compared to six months ago, the Asia-Pacific region has
seen an increase in its consumer confidence index score, from 38.7 to 66.3.</P>
      <P>Vietnam (90.0) ,  China (85.3) and Singapore (79.4) showed significantly higher
consumer confidence compared to other markets in the region.</P>
      <P>Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, MasterCard's Asia-Pacific economic advisor, noted that when
the global economy started to stabilize in the second half of 2009, conditions
improved especially fast in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"The latest findings of the overall robust rebound in consumer confidence in the
region mirrors progress seen in the real economy, " he said.</P>
      <P>He predicted that renewed consumer confidence will contribute to the momentum of
recovery, because it will lead to lower precautionary savings and higher
spending, which will in turn improve business outlook and encourage more
investment.</P>

      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Tuesday that Hualien Magistrate Fu
Kun-chi's naming of his "ex-wife" as deputy magistrate is invalid, on the
grounds that their divorce was fake and that the appointment of his wife
therefore is in breach of the relevant laws.</P>
      <P>Jiang made the announcement  following a meeting in which officials from the
Interior Ministry, the Justice Ministry, the Central Personnel Administration,
the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan made the decision.</P>
      <P>Jiang said his ministry will ask the Executive Yuan to rescind Fu's appointment
of Hsu Chen-wei, his wife, as deputy magistrate of Hualien County because the
two are still married to each other.</P>
      <P>According to the Public Official Employment Law, it is against the law for a
holder of public office to designate a spouse or a family member living under
the same roof as his or her deputy.</P>
      <P>Fu, who was elected by a landslide in the Dec. 5 local elections running as an
independent after being expelled by the ruling Kuomintang, supposedly divorced
Hsu Dec. 18 and then picked her as his deputy just three days later.</P>
      <P>In a bid to make the divorce appear bona fide, Fu re-registered Hsu's family
registration in the house of his mother-in-law, who lives next door to Fu, the
MOI said in a news release.</P>
      <P>According to Jiang, the MOI will also ask the Control Yuan to fine Fu between
NT$1 million (US$30,000) and NT$5 million for breaking the Employment Rules of
the Act on Recusal of Public Servants Due to Conflicts of Interest because their
actual relations are husband and wife.</P>
      <P>Fu's appointment of Hsu is widely seen as an attempt to hold on to the post, as
he is also appealing a six-and-a-half-year sentence for violating securities
trading regulations.</P>
      <P>The MOI said Fu and Hsu are recognized as "members of the same family" given
that they are rearing their children together and because they have told
supporters that they are still a family.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI, the divorce apparently violates Article 87 of the Civil
Law and thus was ruled invalid.</P>
      <P>Also, in line with the fourth provision of Article 75 of the Local Government
Law, Fu's designation of Hsu as his deputy is unlawful, the MOI said.</P>
      <P>The case also violates Article 6 and Article 7 of the Enployment Rules of the
Act on Recusal of Public Servants Due to Conflicts of Interest for naming a
"related person" to a public office post.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday that both
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) head and the chief negotiator with China
should be held responsible for failing to ink a tax deal in the latest cross-
strait talks that concluded that day in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai shin-yuan and Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits

cooperation, agricultural quarantine inspection,  and industrial product
standards,  inspection  and certification in the talks, the fourth of their kind
since last year, but fell short of a fourth on taxation, citing "technical
reasons."</P>
      <P>"The government should make public the reasons behind the failure for the tax
deal, which could result in a loss of NT$30 billion (US$940 million) in tax
revenue," said Chien Yao-tang, a research fellow with the Taiwan Thinktank, at
the press conference.</P>
      <P>Well ahead of the talks, the government had blared about forging the tax pact,
and the last-minute failure shows its inability to control the tenor of the

      <P>KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung said earlier in the day that given the close cross-

      <P>Lee said it is regrettable that the DPP ignored the meeting agenda,  sent "one-

instead of engaging in rational policy debates.</P>
      <P>However, Liu said that as the main opposition party, the DPP is obliged to
exercise checks and balances on the government, and that in terms of investments
in China, its greatest concern is "whether any of the ruling party members have
ever pursued personal interests in the process of talks with China."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The drama surrounding new Hualien County Magistrate Fu Kun-chi's politically
calculated appointment of his wife of 10-plus years to be his deputy has come to
an end after Fu withdrew the appointment late Tuesday in wake of the Interior
Ministry's announcement that their divorce was fake.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the controversy:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior ruled Tuesday that Fu's divorce with Hsu Chen-wei
constituted "collusion" between the couple and that Fu's appointment of Hsu is
invalid because of the false divorce.</P>
      <P>Fu will be fined up to NT$5 million for violating conflict of interest
regulations for civil servants, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Fu later said he would act in accordance with the ministry's order, and he
withdrew the appointment. (Dec. 23, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said in a tough tone that Fu's divorce with his
wife was obviously false and an attempt to "make use of a loophole in the law."</P>
      <P>Civil servants have to act according to the law, and if they "try to take
advantage of any loopholes, it is very possible that they will ending up being
guilty of even bigger violations, " Jiang added.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Fu panned the authorities for being "too ruthless" in ruling that his divorce
with Hsu Chen-wei is invalid.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The death of a 7-year-old boy has again drawn concerns about the possible side
effects of the H1N1 vaccine. Despite an increase in the number of reports of
side effects, the Department of Health remains confident that the immunization
program is an effective way to avert the spread of the virus.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the event:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Centers for Disease Control statistics show that the number of people who
developed side effects from the vaccine for influenza A (H1N1) has increased by
nearly 100 over the past week to 424 people since Taiwan started its national
immunization program on Nov. 1. Ninety-three have developed serious symptoms
that killed one boy living in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government, however, has not stopped underlining that the risk of the
vaccine is one in a million, as 4.81 million people have been vaccinated in the
country.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Cabinet-level Department of Health's "quick" move on Tuesday
to declare that the boy's death was not related to the vaccine not only made it
difficult for the boy's parents to accept the statement but also sparked public
doubt over the safety of the vaccine. (Dec. 23, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Taichung District Prosecutors  Office has launched  an investigation into
the death of the 7-year-old boy in Taichung City who died several weeks after
receiving a H1N1 flu shots.</P>
      <P>Although the Cabinet-level Department of Health has excluded the vaccines as the
cause of death, prosecutors think it is necessary to find the real culprit.
(Dec. 23, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Following the report of the 7-year-old boy's death, many worried readers have
reported to the newspaper that their family members have developed symptoms such
as fevers and headaches after receiving the flu vaccine.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Councilor Chang Yiao-chung of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party took six phone calls on Tuesday from people describing
themselves as family members of victims of the H1N1 vaccine. One complained of
her daughter suffering from numbness and blurred vision.</P>
      <P>The petitioners expressed their hope to make contact with the boy's father and
organize with him a self-help association. (Dec. 23, 2009)</P>

    <HEADLINE>President urges civil servants to upgrade communication skills</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
12/23/09  13:19:15
(By Sophia Yeh and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged the country's civil servants Wednesday to improve
their communications skills and develop the ability to both "work" and
"communicate."</P>
      <P>The president lauded the standards and efficiency of civil servants,  but
described their communications  skills as being relatively weak.</P>
      <P>"Some say civil servants should do their jobs quietly. There's nothing wrong
with that but it is not good for civil servants to only 'do' but not
'communicate' or conversely to only 'talk' without doing anything," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In some cases, the president said, it is even better if government officials can
communicate their ideas before carrying them out.</P>
      <P>When, for instance, the Taipei City government launched a policy to collect
garbage fees beginning July 1, 2000 by forcing people to pay for the garbage
bags they used, the city government began a publicity drive three months earlier
on April 1, recalled Ma, who was major of the city at the time.</P>
      <P>Because the people do not always believe government publicity drives, the
government sometimes has to repeat its message "over and over again."</P>
      <P>In other cases, government officials need to "communicate after carrying out a
task, " said Ma, citing the recent controversial lifting of a partial ban on
imports of U.S. beef, including products such as ground beef and beef offal that
some feared could be potentially tainted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Ma said that after the Department of Health (DOH) lifted the ban, it then
announced a series of measures to ensure the safety of the imported beef.</P>
      <P>DOH minister Yaung Chih-liang also explained Tuesday the results of safety
checks over the past two months to assuage public fears on the safety of U.S.
beef, he added.</P>
      <P>He urged the Examination  Yuan and the Central  Personnel Administration to make
"public relations and communications" among the major points of emphasis of
civil servant training.</P>
      <P>Ma,  speaking  at  a meeting  of national  personnel  and administrative
officials, also asked the Examination Yuan to arrange that the award-winning
movie "No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti" be screened for civil servants.</P>
      <P>Ma said Leon Dai, the film's director, invited him to watch it when it came out,
but he was preoccupied at the time with flood-relief efforts in the wake of
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>"I'll go see the movie soon," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Dai received the best director award at the 53rd Asian Pacific Film Festival
last Saturday for the film, which is based on the true story of a single
father's frustration in dealing with unhelpful and uncaring bureaucrats in
trying to maintain legal custody of his daughter.</P>
      <P>The film won five awards, including best director, at Taiwan's Golden Horse Film
Festival, Taiwan's equivalent of the Oscars, last month.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait decided Monday to temporarily shelve a double
taxation avoidance agreement that was scheduled to be signed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is too early to make any judgment on what happened as the government has yet
to reveal how and why the long talked-about agreement was dropped at the last
minute.</P>
      <P>But scenes of officials giving conflicting explanations or arguments were not
what an efficient government should have done.</P>
      <P>Public outrage hit a climax after Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said
he was informed last Thursday of the possibility that the tax accord might be
taken off the list of agreements to be signed at this week's high-level cross-
strait talks.</P>
      <P>Since government authorities were already aware of the tax pact's fate, why did
the Ministry of Finance still run prominently displayed advertisements in
various media on the eve of the meeting touting the merits of the accord at a
cost of NT$4 million?</P>
      <P>If the decision  to run the ad was not caused  by poor interministerial
coordination,  then it reflected  the Finance Ministry's foolhardiness and
idiocy. Worse still, few understood what the ad said. It was truly a waste of
taxpayer money.</P>

      <P>China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, was dogged by protesters
Wednesday as he visited tourist attractions in northern Taiwan's Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>The president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) had lunch with Miaoli County Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung at a
local resort village before visiting the Sanyi Wood Sculpture Museum to get a
taste of local art.</P>
      <P>Before Chen arrived at the resort village, however, Falun Gong practitioners had
already gathered there to wait for him.</P>
      <P>According to the activists, over 200 Falun Gong practitioners were to be
deployed at each of the places that Chen was to visit Wednesday to protest
against Beijing's suppression of the Falun Gong movement in China.</P>
      <P>The Falun Group protesters were confronted by a pro-unification group outside
the resort village, the West Lake Resortopia, before Chen arrived, but they
ended up doing nothing more than trading verbal barbs.</P>
      <P>The heavy police presence outside the resort added to the tense atmosphere, but
no violence erupted thanks to good communications between the protesters and the
police.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Taiwan Monday for his fourth round of talks with his Taiwanese
counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
that was held Tuesday in central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>During the talks, the two sides signed agreements on fishing crew cooperation,

    <HEADLINE>Failed tax agreement not bad for Taiwan: experts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung, Dec. 23 (CNA)
12/23/09  15:54:59

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's failure to sign a tax agreement with China in just-concluded cross-
Taiwan Strait negotiations is not necessarily a bad thing for Taiwan and proves
that the deal will have to gain more support before being signed, according to
experts.</P>
      <P>Representatives from Taiwan and China inked three agreements Tuesday on
agricultural  inspection and quarantine cooperation, industrial standards
testing and certification cooperation, and fishery labor cooperation.</P>
      <P>A fourth item on the agenda -- an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation
and strengthening of tax cooperation -- was not signed, as the two sides failed
to reach consensus, citing "technical issues."</P>
      <P>The development marked the first time since cross-strait talks resumed last year
after a nine-year hiatus that an agreement on the agenda was not signed.</P>
      <P>"China never presumes it has to reach concrete results before entering any
negotiations, " said Kenneth Lin, an economics professor at National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>Lin said the failure to sign the tax agreement is not necessarily bad for Taiwan
because the country in the past has always asked for something solid in
negotiations, even though it could end up to be a disadvantage.</P>
      <P>"Not being able to sign the agreement... is not necessarily a bad thing for us.
We don't have to set a deadline and tie our own hands, " he said.</P>
      <P>The technical issues that were said to hamper the bilateral talks, Lin said,
could still be political issues rather than tax revenue problems.</P>
      <P>Most Taiwanese businessmen investing in China do so through companies in a third
country to avoid being taxed, Lin went on, adding that Taiwanese businessmen are
mostly concerned that "China has been using tax inspections as tool to pester
Taiwanese businesses in China."</P>
      <P>Tax agreements are usually signed between allies, friendly countries or
countries at similar levels of economic development, but that is not the case
between Taiwan and China, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"I would say that the key here is not tax issues but political issues, such as
the wording of the document, " he said.</P>
      <P>"At the end of the day, a government has to protect its own taxpayers, " Lin
noted.</P>
      <P>However, other experts looked at the negotiations, which took place in the
central Taiwan city of Taichung from Dec. 21-23, in a different light.</P>
      <P>Yin Nai-ping,  a finance  professor  at National  Chengchi University, said the
"technical issues" that doomed the tax talks were related to the avoidance of
double taxation.</P>
      <P>"I believe that Taiwan made the request to include Taiwanese businesses
investing indirectly in China through a third country on the double taxation
list in the negotiations, but China refused to accept this, " Yin said.</P>
      <P>Yin said the sovereignty issue is not as serious as it might seem and that "the
real problem is the sophisticated tax regulations."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition parties have questioned whether taxpayers' information could
end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities once an agreement on tax
cooperation takes effect, which raised concern among local businessmen, Yin
said.</P>
      <P>"I think the widespread uneasiness over the issue made Taiwanese officials
particularly cautious in the talks, " he added.</P>
      <P>It is only natural to differ in the process of negotiations and "the most
important thing is to identify the argument and ultimately work out a solution
that both sides can accept, " Yin said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday that the three latest agreements signed with
China are all in the interests of Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>The agreement on fishing crew cooperation, for example, is aimed at providing a
system to regulate the hiring of Chinese fishing crews by Taiwanese boat owners
to reduce disputes and conflicts, Wu said during a meeting with a group of
Control Yuan members who were visiting the Executive Yuan for an inspection
tour.</P>
      <P>The agreement on agricultural quarantine inspection, meanwhile, will accelerate
and standardize exports of Taiwanese agricultural products to China, Wu went on.</P>
      <P>He promised that in pushing toward the goal of signing a cross-Taiwan Strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , the government will also make
sure that it meets the needs of Taiwan, wins the support of the people, and is
subject to the supervision of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>On the country's economic situation, Wu said the economy has shown signs of
growth in the fourth quarter of this year, after declines recorded in the three
previous quarters.</P>
      <P>Although the economy is projected to contract by 2.54 percent for 2009, it is
likely to recover and post growth of 4.39 percent in 2010, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Private investment in 2010 is expected to amount to NT$1.03 trillion, he said.</P>
      <P>The premier also said boosting employment is one of the most important
objectives of the government's economic stimulus measures and that the
administration will continue to work to achieve the goal by promoting
investment,  simplifying  procedures and enhancing efficiency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese subsidiaries of Chinese enterprises in high-tech fields will be
eligible to take advantage of tax incentives offered to high-tech businesses, a
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>C. Y. Ling, director-general of the MOEA's Department of Investment Services,
said in Taichung at a seminar on Chinese investment in Taiwan on the last day of
cross-strait talks that the enterprises can apply for the tax breaks offered
under the Statute for Upgrading Industries and Statute for Innovating
Industries.</P>
      <P>Woody T. J. Duh, director general of the MOEA's Industrial Development  Bureau,
explained  that  any foreign-invested  or Chinese-invested enterprise is
considered a legal entity in Taiwan and therefore eligible for the tax breaks as
long as they have been established in compliance with Taiwan's Corporation Law.</P>
      <P>"They must be subsidiaries, however. Branches and representative offices are not
eligible," Duh said.</P>
      <P>That's because the finances of subsidiaries, unlike branches, are independent of
the finances of their parent companies, Duh explained, citing the example of
U.S.-based insurer AIG and its Taiwanese subsidiary Nan Shan Life Insurance.</P>
      <P>Because their finances were separate, AIG's sale of Nan Shan Life is being
reviewed independently from AIG.</P>
      <P>Among the foreign investors that now enjoy tax incentives under the statutes are
IBM and Philips Electronics, he added.</P>
      <P>The Statute for Upgrading Industries will expire at the end of this year and
will be replaced by the Statute for Innovating Industries starting next year.</P>
      <P>Under the new program, the MOEA will offer incentives for investments in R&amp;D
and talent cultivation but will not give companies five-year corporate income
tax holidays as had been the case previously.</P>
      <P>Wang Jing, chairwoman of Fujian Newland Group, the first Chinese enterprise to
invest in Taiwan, expressed the hope on the same occasion that Taiwan will give
greater access, such as landing visas, to company employees traveling between
the two sides and provide tax incentives for high-tech industries.</P>

      <P>The last-minute halt to the signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait double taxation
avoidance agreement can be seen as "beautiful setback" to the institutionalized
high-level cross-strait engagements known as "Chiang-Chen" meetings.</P>
      <P>While pessimistic observers may just see thorns on roses and conclude that the
incident does not bode well for future cross-strait dealings, we believe the
temporary shelving of the proposed accord is a prudent decision of positive
significance.</P>
      <P>As double tax avoidance accords tend to be applied only to direct investment,
signing such an accord with China is expected to help enhance transparency in
cross-strait investment supervision and even encourage multinational companies
that plan to tap into the Chinese market to use Taiwan as their regional
operation hub.</P>
      <P>The government has yet to reveal what was the straw that broke the taxation deal
at the last minute, but we believe the breakdown indicated that there were
difficulties applying internationally accepted regulations to cross-strait
engagements due to sensitive sovereignty issues.</P>
      <P>As every rose has its thorns, those difficulties were the thorns in the "Chiang-
Chen" meetings.</P>
      <P>Although the decision came as a surprise, it served as a reminder to local
society that the regular meetings between Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, are not high-profile
social functions or rituals, but rather bona fide negotiations that may hit
snags.</P>
      <P>The unexpected setback should also alert the government to the pitfalls and
uncertainties in cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>With negotiations now evolving from the primary stage of dealing with issues
that are purely advantageous to both sides, into an intermediate  stage of
trading benefits or even competing for benefits, the government should work even
harder to make its policy more transparent. The government should have
confidence in the maturity of public discourse in Taiwan. Candid policy
discussion is the best way to win public trust and support.</P>
      <P>The opposition  party  should  also fulfill  its duty  by strengthening
supervision and coming up with solid policy initiatives instead of empty talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should develop yachting services: CEPD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As an island nation renowned for its yacht- building, Taiwan should take an open
attitude toward the development of a yachting services industry, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>San Gee, deputy minister of the CEPD, said in a seminar on developing the
service industry that it seems ironic that the government restricts the
development of local yachting services for security reasons, while even South
Korea has decided to develop its maritime tourism this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  is well-known  in the rest of the world for its yacht-building industry.
However, people in Taiwan have no experience of yachting, San said, adding that
the government should consider a different attitude toward developing the
country's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>San noted that South Korea -- despite the threat from North Korea -- still
decided to develop its coastal leisure recreation business to stimulate
domestic  demand  and  is considering  loosening restrictions on the issuance of
yachting licenses.</P>
      <P>As South Korea has taken an open attitude, Taiwan can surely follow suit, San
said.</P>
      <P>Singling out Kueishan Island as an example, Sun noted that the volcanic islet
about 10 km off the coast of Toucheng in northeast Taiwan is actually very close
to Taiwan. However, as the government has set numerous restrictions on visiting
the island, people feel it is a distant place.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government adopt supporting measures such as using a
Global Positioning System to manage the island.</P>
      <P>According to the island's administration, people who want to visit must file
applications via its Web site three to 20 days before their scheduled visit. As
the number of total visitors cannot exceed 400 people during weekdays and 500
during weekends, the computer makes random selections each day. Selected
applicants have to travel there with qualified and approved boatmen.</P>
      <P>One of Taiwan's major yacht-builders has described Taiwan as the only country in
the world in which yachts are built on land and the only yacht-building country
in the world in which yachting has until recently not been permitted.</P>
      <P>According to Horizon Yachts, the largest builder in Asia and sixth-largest in
the world, Taiwan's yacht industry is a 30-year veteran in the yachting world,
even though the sport is non-existent in the country as a result of restrictive
regulations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi said Wednesday that he will revoke his earlier
appointment of his "ex- wife" as his deputy in line with a decision by the
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Fu, who was elected by a landslide in the Dec. 5 local elections running as an
independent after being expelled by the ruling Kuomintang, supposedly divorced
his wife Hsu Chen-wei Dec. 18 and then picked her as his deputy just three days
later.</P>
      <P>Fu's move was interpreted as a "well-calculated attempt" for his wife to hold on
to the post on his behalf in case he has to serve a jail term mid-way through
his tenure --  he is appealing  a six-and-a-half-year  sentence for violating
securities  trading regulations.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah decided after a meeting with officials of
relevant government agencies a day earlier that Fu's appointment of Hsu was
invalid and in breach of the relevant laws, including the Public Official
Employment Law and the Employment Rules of the Act on Recusal of Public Servants
Due to Conflicts of Interest, as their supposed divorce was fake.</P>
      <P>Fu said in a press conference that he was "surprised" to find the high
administrative efficiency of the central government by deciding in just one day
in an inter-ministerial meeting that his divorce and appointment of Hsu were
invalid, and he questioned whether the marital status of other Taiwanese people
are subject to approval by inter-ministerial meeting.</P>
      <P>Despite Fu's revocation of Hsu's appointment, Ma Yi-kung, a member of the
Control Yuan -- the country's top watchdog agency -- said he will still conduct
an investigation into the case and that a fine of between NT$1 million and NT$5
million will be imposed on Fu if he is found to have broken any laws.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH seeks obligatory autopsies after alleged vaccine death</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced Wednesday it will seek to
amend the law to allow obligatory autopsies  to be performed  on controversial
deaths involving vaccinations, following the report of a boy who died after
getting vaccinated against influenza A(H1N1).</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw explained that mandatory autopsies will
allow health authorities to find out the exact cause of any controversial death
related to vaccinations in a short period of time, so that the authorities can
mitigate public doubts on the safety of vaccines and prevent panic.</P>
      <P>The 7-year-old child, who lived in central Taiwan, passed away on Monday,
several weeks after receiving the H1N1 inoculation on Nov.19.</P>
      <P>The boy's father, who works as a physician, called the 1922 H1N1 vaccination
consultation hotline on Dec. 2 after his son developed a high fever and a skin
rash the day after getting the vaccination.</P>
      <P>Health authorities, however, could not determine what was making the child ill
and treatment they prescribed failed to save the boy.</P>
      <P>Following the boy's death, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) was
blasted for failing to swiftly and seriously respond to the case.</P>
      <P>But DOH Vice Minister Chang Shang-chun and CDC experts had immediately called an
emergency telephone conference with the boy's father in an attempt to offer
help, according to CDC Director-General Steve Kuo.</P>
      <P>After preliminary discussions, the experts concluded the death was unrelated to
the H1N1 vaccine and that an immunity system problem could have been one of the
causes of the death, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The conclusion, however, has failed to convince the heart-broken father that the
H1N1 vaccine was not the killer of his son.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Chou expressed regret that despite all the efforts the DOH has
taken to address the case, it still has not been able to stem public panic amid
the national H1N1 immunization.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that under the standard procedure regulated in the vaccine
injury compensation  program  (VICP) ,  a probe into controversial vaccine
injuries or deaths can only be launched at the request of the victim's family
members.</P>
      <P>"If they are not willing to ask for an investigation nor allow an autopsy, it is
not possible to swiftly find out the cause, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>Chou declined to say whether the family has refused to have an autopsy
conducted. The boy's family could not be reached for comment.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, autopsies can only be performed on people who died of
unidentified contagious diseases. PLURAL OK?</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taichung District Prosecutors' Office has launched an
investigation into the latest death case allegedly caused by the H1N1
inoculation.</P>
      <P>It is reported that since Taiwan's national H1N1 immunization program began on
Nov. 1, a total of 424 out of 4.81 million people who had received the
inoculation have complained of suffering from serious symptoms, including high
fever after taking the shot.</P>

      <P>The influenza A(H1N1) , commonly known as swine flu, is expected to stage a
resurgence that might be more virulent than the present outbreak, a Taiwanese
professional medical group warned Wednesday, urging people to get vaccinated.</P>
      <P>Lee Ping-ing, secretary-general of the Taiwan Immunization Vision and Strategy
Alliance, made the call amid reports of public concerns over the safety of the
H1N1 vaccine triggered by a recent case in which a 7-year-old boy from central
Taiwan died several weeks after being immunized.</P>
      <P>The father of the boy, a physician, has claimed that the vaccine was the
culprit, but health authorities and other medical experts excluded the
possibility after studying the case.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is also a pediatrician at National Taiwan University Hospital, said
there are at least 50 percent - 75 percent of people in the country who have
still not been immunized, while "1 or 2 million" people have obtained immunity
after recovering from the flu and nearly 5 million have had the shot.</P>
      <P>These non-vaccinated people will be at highest risk of the next wave of swine
flu, which could be more deadly because the virus might have mutated, Lee
predicted, noting that judging from the seasonal flu epidemic outbreaks in the
past, there are usually two or three big outbreaks in one epidemic.</P>
      <P>Citing U.S. research that found the swine flu virus invades deep into the lungs,
Lee warned the public not to take the virus lightly, adding that they also
should not harbor that idea that they will not need to be vaccinated if others
are instead.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan has difficulty playing a role in TPP process: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  23  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>American scholars said in a video conference with Taiwan government officials
and economic specialists Wednesday that while the United States needs trade
policy to engage Asia and the expansion of the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic
Partnership (TPP) is seen as an opportunity, Taiwan still has difficulty playing
a role.</P>
      <P>Ernie Bower, a senior adviser and director of the Southeast Asia Program of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), pointed out that the
multilateral free trade agreement, which was signed 15 years ago by Brunei,
Chile, New Zealand and Singapore, was mentioned by U.S. President Barack Obama
during a Nov. 14 speech in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>His announcement that the U.S. intends to engage its trade partners in shaping a
broad-based regional agreement has inspired expectations that the TPP could
become a process toward a framework for a free trade agreement for the Asia-
Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Brower said, however, that the TPP as part of an FTA process is more of a goal
or a new approach of the U.S. Democratic Party and that there is no time frame.</P>
      <P>Referring to a question from an official of Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade as
to whether the long term goal for U.S. engagement in TPP is to connect TPP to
the 21 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Bower
suggested that the U.S. will first consider the pending free trade agreements
with Korea and the inclusion of Japan.</P>
      <P>Charles Freeman, chairman of the CSIS Freeman Chair, said that while the U.S.
needs a trade policy to engage Asia, "the closest at hand is TPP to reshape the
trade agenda."</P>
      <P>He added, however, that the process "doesn't mean much to Taiwan at present."</P>
      <P>Both Freeman and Bower suggested that it is too early for Taiwan to expect
linkage between TPP negotiation and APEC, of which Taiwan is a member.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the proposed Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China will restrain Taiwan's FTA
aspirations, Freeman suggested that Taiwan should maintain a balanced approach
between ECFA and its traditional partners.</P>
      <P>Referring to the barriers to Taiwan inking free trade agreements with its
trading partners, Freeman pointed out that China might mobilize its business
lobby in Washington and meanwhile try to put pressure on its trading partners
that are over-dependent on China's market to block Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Terry Cooke, senior fellow of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said that
"any effort by China to undercut Taiwan's efforts will only undercut China's
efforts to separate politics from economy."</P>
      <P>The video conference was organized by the Office of Trade Negotiations under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, with Sherman Katz, fellow of the Center for the
Study of the Presidency and Congress, a Washington-based think tank, as
moderator.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The abrupt brake on the signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait agreement on double
taxation avoidance reportedly stemmed from a failure by both sides to find vague
terms to define sensitive words such as "nation" and "nationals"  in the
provisions  for the distribution of tax revenues set forth in the accord.</P>
      <P>If that was indeed the case, why didn't either side bring up the issue at any
point during the long negotiation process but instead waited until the Chinese
delegation arrived in Taiwan amid boisterous protests by pro-independence
activists?</P>
      <P>A more convincing explanation would be that compromises had been made on the
wording of the agreement because the two quasi-official organizations  in charge
of negotiations  and their respective governments had overlooked the Taiwanese
people's extreme sensitivity on sovereignty issues.</P>
      <P>The vehemence of the protests ahead of and upon the arrival of Chinese
negotiator Chen Yunlin awoke Taiwan's negotiating team and authorities to the
hazards of signing such a taxation agreement at this time. Not only would it
have caused an extremely strong backlash, but it would have jeopardized the next
round of high-level cross-strait talks and the signing of the much-anticipated
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>While critics have derided the protesters as having overreacted to the current
round of cross-strait talks, we believe that the protesters deserve some credit
and recognition for their loud demonstrations in the past few days.</P>
      <P>They have played a check-and-balance role that has not only reminded Taiwanese
negotiators of the need to exercise caution, but also let Chinese leaders know
that they cannot pressure Taiwan into compromising on sovereignty issues.</P>
      <P>No matter how weak or soft our negotiators may be, if China refuses to make
concessions to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty and dignity, the agreements will
not lead to any satisfactory results.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday that it is not necessary
to adopt measures that will contravene a protocol signed between Taiwan and
United States on the easing of U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang said the ministry "does not want to
see Taiwan-U.S. relations plunge into tension, " pointing out that this would
have a negative impact on the normal development of Taiwan-U.S. trade ties.</P>
      <P>Shih's remarks came as the ruling and opposition parties prepared for a Dec. 29
showdown over the issue.</P>
      <P>The DPP has proposed its version of an amendment to the Act Governing Food
Sanitation relating to U.S. beef imports, which categorically prohibits imports
of products such as offal, ground beef, spinal cords, brains and skulls, in
order to "bar beef imports at the source and at the country's borders."</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus has said it will seek an
emergency consensus with the administration prior to Dec. 25 on how a KMT-
version amendment should be presented.</P>
      <P>Shih said the protocol signed recently with the United States on lifting a
partial ban on imports of U.S. beef has taken into consideration public health
and international regulations, which he described as a "reasonable" arrangement.</P>
      <P>To assuage misgivings about the expanded U.S. beef imports, which include
products such as ground beef and beef offal that some fear could be potentially
tainted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, the
Department of Health (DOH) has also imposed stringent measures -- the so-called
"three controls" and "five certificates," he added.</P>
      <P>The "three controls" refers to setting controls on beef imports at the source,
at borders and in markets,  while the "five certificates" refers to verifying
certification documents, checking that shipments are marked with detailed
product information, opening a high percentage of cartons of imported beef to
check the product, conducting food safety tests, and being able to get
information on suspected problem products immediately, according to DOH
officials.</P>
      <P>"The measures have been effective and the public misgivings about the high-risk
parts of U.S. beef coming to Taiwan have proved unfounded," he added.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Francis Liang said Washington is concerned about
the moves by Taiwan's legislature to ban the imports, which would run counter to
the rules of the World Health Organization and World Organization for Animal
Health.</P>
      <P>The U.S. side is evaluating how Taiwan tackles the issues, he added.</P>

      <P>The government aims to attract US$100 million worth of Chinese investment to
Taiwan next year, when the second phase of liberalization will begin, a Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chinese investments in Taiwan totaled just NT$1.19 billion (US$36.77 million)
this year, but the amount is expected to increase significantly after Taiwan
opens up more industry sectors to Chinese capital, said Ling Chia-yu, head of
the MOEA's Department of Investment Services, during a trip to Taichung to
attend a seminar on the subject.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang had previously said that his
ministry hopes to finalize by next spring the list of business categories to be
liberalized in the second phase.</P>
      <P>Those that are likely to be put on the list include the steel, food and
beverage, flat panel, and online game industries.</P>
      <P>Although China Mobile, the world's largest telecom operator, has on many
occasions indicated its intention to invest in Taiwan, Ling said it remains
uncertain whether the telecom industry will be included in the second phase,
until an inter-ministerial meeting is called to review the proposed list.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics show that the government has so far approved only 22 Chinese
investment projects in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In all cases, only very small amounts were involved, except for the US$980
million invested by an electronics manufacturer, the statistics indicate.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top
negotiator with China Wednesday called for more Chinese investment to flow into
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a seminar attended by enterpreners of Taiwan and China in the central Taiwan
city of Taichung, Chinag stressed that Taiwan's continued investment since the
1990s has immensely contributed to China's economic development.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwanese investors have obviously played an indispensable role in
making China into the world's biggest foreign exchange reserves holder,  the
world's second-largest exporter and the world's third-largest economy.</P>
      <P>Citing official statistics, Chiang reported that Taiwan has channeled over US$80
billion into China with more than 37,000 investment projects over the past 20
years.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that these are just the investment projects that the
government is aware of, adding that the actual figure is far greater than that
and ranges around US$150 billion with over 77,000 investment projects.</P>
      <P>In view of the long-term one-sided capital flow, Chiang said Taiwan also
welcomes more investment from China, noting that from June 30, Taiwan's
government has opened the door to Chinese capital for investment in more than
100 sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>According to SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian, Chinese companies have only
launched 22 investment  plans worth NT$1.19 billion (US$36.73 million) in
Taiwan, and this is the reason why the seminar was held, to beef up mutual
understanding and create a "win-win" situation.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has decided to
open more local sectors to Chinese investors by the end of this year at the
earliest, Kao added.</P>
      <P>China's top envoy Chen Yunlin said at the seminar that Taiwan's businesses do
not need to fear a trade pact that the two sides hope to sign next year, stating
that competition will spur the businesses to excel.</P>
      <P>"Fierce competition in the process will only help build strong competitiveness
and will eventually lead to a better result, " said Chen, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Chen was in Taiwan for the fourth round of Taiwan-China negotiations that
concluded Tuesday in Taichung. Three technical cooperation agreements were inked
by Chiang and Chen in the talks.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's small and medium-size businesses not only had no need  to
fear  competition  from China,  but are actually complementary. Through
increased cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, they can set up partnerships with
Chinese businesses to jointly do global business, he said.</P>
      <P>"What's wrong if people on both sides of the strait work together and earn money
from all over the world? " Chen said, commenting on some Taiwanese people's
misgivings about a planned trade agreement known as an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of people have protested against the visit by Chen and the
Taiwan government's plans to sign the planned trade pact with China next year.</P>
      <P>They and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party said they fear the
agreement will flood the island with cheaper Chinese goods, cause job losses and
hurt Taiwan's sovereignty by making it too economically reliant on China.</P>
      <P>More than a dozen prominent Chinese entrepreneurs accompanying Chen to Taiwan
also took part in the seminar, including Zhang Biyi, vice president of China
Shipbuilding Industry Corp., and Chen Lang, president of China Resources
Enterprise Ltd.</P>
      <P>Many of them complained of the complex visa application process for their
employees to stay and work in Taiwan despite their keen interest in investing in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang Jing, CEO of the Fujian-based Newland Computer Co., the first Chinese
company approved to invest in Taiwan, called for an improvement.</P>
      <P>Wang said the company has fared better than expected in Taiwan but that applying
for an entry visa into Taiwan is something that is currently very inconvenient.</P>
      <P>Relations between China and Taiwan have improved significantly since Taiwan's
President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008 focusing on easing decades of
tensions with China and strengthening economic ties.</P>

      <P>Along with the increased number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan, the
country's Keelung Harbor is likewise expected to see a record number of
passengers this year, harbor bureau officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the Keelung Harbor Bureau, the number of both incoming and outgoing
passengers using the port is expected to reach an all-time-high of 384,000 this
year, up 28,000, or 7.8 percent, from the previous year.</P>
      <P>April Lee, vice chief of the Passenger Service Center of the Keelung Harbor
Bureau, said the number of passengers next year is likely to rise above 400,000
with the arrival of more international cruise ships and Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The number of non-regular international cruise ships making port calls at
Keelung rose from 24 to 38 in 2009, and is expected to rise to 56 next year, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>The number of tourists arriving via non-regular international cruises increased
to 89,000 in 2009, up 50.85 percent from 59,000 last year.</P>
      <P>Among them, Lee went on, nine cruises carrying Chinese Amway employees between
March and May brought some 25,000 passengers through the port.</P>
      <P>Lee continued  that Asian  cruise  vacations  have  become increasingly popular
among Western tourists in recent years, with the number of tourists visiting the
port from eight cruise ships owned by Princess Cruises, a world leader in
cruises, have reached more than 10,000 this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the number of tourists from domestic cruiselines rose to 114,000, up
28.1 percent from the 89,000 recorded last year.</P>
      <P>Lee attributed the rise of domestic line passengers to the increased number of
Chinese tourists traveling via the direct transport  links between the Chinese
city of Xiamen and the Taiwan-held  islands  of Kinmen  and Matsu  --  the so-
called "mini-three-links."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, however, as the number of regular cruise ships from the SuperStar
Libra by Star Cruises decreased to 65 from 86 last year, the number of
passengers has dropped 30,000 to 178,000 this year, she added.</P>
      <P>In line with its aim to become a hub for international cruise ships, the harbor
will keep seeking more port calls by international cruises, the bureau said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan urged to learn from Japan, Korea to lure foreign students</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An economics official suggested Wednesday that Taiwan should follow Japan and
South Korea's lead in the area of education and allow more Chinese students to
study in Taiwan, which he said would help make education an important service
sector and solve the problems of many universities.</P>
      <P>San Gee, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
said at a seminar on the development of Taiwan's service industry that while
Taiwan's higher education institutions have adequate  facilities  and good
faculty  members,  many private universities have difficulty recruiting
students.</P>
      <P>With the number of domestic students unlikely to increase in the near future
because of the country's falling birth rate, Taiwan's higher education market
cannot rely on local students for growth, educators have said on several
occasions.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is still reluctant to take in large numbers of Chinese students,
neighboring Japan and South Korea are attracting them, as the higher education
institutions on the Chinese mainland cannot come close to accommodating its huge
number of high school graduates, according to San.</P>
      <P>Among the 69,000 foreign students in South Korea's universities and colleges,
about 50,000 are Chinese, while 58.5 percent of the 120,000 foreign students in
Japan are from China, San said.</P>
      <P>In comparison, only 29,000 university and college students in Taiwan are from
abroad, 11,000 of whom are from families of Taiwanese origin, Shan added.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) is drafting new regulations on recognizing
certificates issued by higher education institutions on the Chinese mainland and
allowing more Chinese nationals to attend universities and colleges in Taiwan. A
series of public hearings on the issue are being held around the island.</P>
      <P>Under the MOE's current regulations, local universities and colleges may accept
between 1,000 and 2,000 Chinese students per year -- equivalent to one percent
of their annual admission rate.</P>
      <P>However, a draft revision to the University Law proposes an annual quota of
2,000, according to Vice Education Minister Lin Tsung-min.</P>
      <P>The draft bill will state that while a maximum of 2,000 Chinese students can
enroll in Taiwan's universities and colleges per year, Chinese universities and
colleges should accept no more than 2,000 students from Taiwan annually.</P>
      <P>Only 41 universities on the Chinese mainland are recognized by Taiwan, Lin said,
adding that certificates issued by other Chinese universities and colleges are
not accredited by Taiwan's educational authorities.</P>

      <P>Some Taiwanese solar cell manufacturers have fallen prey to a recent financial
crisis involving China-based LDK Solar Co., a manufacturer of multicrystalline
solar wafers,  which are the principal raw material used to produce solar cells.</P>
      <P>Those Taiwanese companies have forged business ties under a so-called bridge-
building  project launched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in May.</P>
      <P>In just half a year, the bridge-building project for the photovoltaics industry
has alomst become a "dead-end" bridge.</P>
      <P>We hope the case will serve as a wake-up call for President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration which has been conducting a pro-China policy since its
inauguration in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Believing China is the only relief for Taiwan's economic ills, the Ma
administration has come up with economic stimulus packages centering around
opening up to China.</P>
      <P>As a result, many measures unveiled by economic and financial affairs have
further fed the craze for the industrial exodus to China.</P>
      <P>Even the quasi-official  Taiwan External  Trade Development (TAITRA) has shifted
its traditional focus on the global market to a China-oriented strategy.</P>
      <P>Since early this year, the trade promotion organization has organized more than
10 so-called bridge-building forums to help mediate cross-strait trade or joint-
venture deals.</P>
      <P>It seems that TAITRA  has narrowed  its role as Taiwan's international trade
promotion organization to China's arm to attract Taiwanese investment and
mediate cross-strait business deals.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, TAITRA has helped with China's procurement mission drama. While
China has announced plans to procure US$10 billion worth of goods from Taiwan,
the amount of orders Chinese business groups actually placed fall far below that
promised target.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people are not fools as evidenced in the large number of demonstrators
who have braved frigid cold weather to protest against the current round of
cross-strait talks.</P>

      <P>A domestic resort developer signed a contract with the Tourism Bureau Wednesday,
committing to an investment of NT$54 million to turn Green Island into an all-
season resort.</P>
      <P>Under the contract, Chu Lung Resort will build various facilities on the
outlying island and operate them for 16 years. From the fifth year, however, the
company will be required to pay the government an annual franchise fee of 8
percent of the revenue generated by the project.</P>
      <P>Chu Lung Chairman Chang Ming-yi said his company is planning to build 30 tree
houses, each of which will have a hot spring bathtub, in the island's camping
area to allow visitors to enjoy nature and also have privacy.</P>
      <P>In addition, a foot spa, an aromatherapy saloon, and stores will be built at the
island's visitors' service center, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The tree houses are expected to be ready for occupancy by next summer, and the
other facilities are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year, the
company said.</P>
      <P>According to company advisor Peng Yu-chung, 80 percent of Green Island's 300,000
annual visitors usually arrive between May and October, and 60 percent go to the
island's unique undersea hot springs.</P>
      <P>The company is planning to offer walking and cycling tours that will be suitable
in fall and winter, and will also promote ecology field trips around the island,
Peng said.</P>

      <P>A police officer was injured but appeared to be in stable condition and six
protesters were detained in an incident Wednesday night in front of the hotel
where Chinese envoy Chen Yunlin is staying, Taichung City police said.</P>
      <P>It was the first arrest and the most serious injury that occurred since a series
of protests were launched Dec. 20 against a five-day visit by Chen, president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in the central Taiwan city Monday for the fourth round of cross-
strait talks with his Taiwan counterpart, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation. The talks concluded the previous day with three agreements inked.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu-hsiang, a police officer in the Criminal Investigative Corps, sustained
an injury to his forehead when he was pushed from a vehicle by protesters as he
tried to stop them from launching firecrackers in the direction of the Windsor
Hotel, Yu Hui-mao, Deputy Director-General of Taichung City's Police Bureau,
said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Six protesters were detained after the incident and are still in custody on
charges of endangering public safety, disrupting public service and assault, Yu
said. The vehicle carrying the protesters was also seized, he added.</P>
      <P>The firecrackers set off by the protesters, who were mostly from the pro-
independence group "The Taiwan Republic Campaign, " posed a safety hazard for
the hotel and the nearby area, Yu said.</P>
      <P>An eye witness among the demonstrators told reporters that more than a dozen
police officers jumped on the vehicle to go after the protesters and Chen
accidentally fell off the truck onto the ground.</P>
      <P>"No one pushed him. I have a video recording to prove that, " said a graduate
student who asked not to be named.</P>
      <P>The police also videotaped the incident but the footage cannot be made public
because the case is now under investigation by local prosecutors, Yu said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index for November rose 31.46 percent year-on-
year, growing for the third consecutive month, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The industrial production index stood at 108.78 in November -- representing the
highest year-on-year growth since August 1978-- an increase that the MOEA
attributed to the low base last year and the recovery of the global economy.</P>
      <P>Production in the motor vehicle and parts industry increased the most, at 71.69
percent, while chemical material production rose 63.45 percent, and electronic
parts and components climbed 60.96 percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>MOEA Statistics Department Director-General Huang Chi-shi attributed the sharp
growth in the auto industry to rebounding consumer demand. The number of vehicle
registrations in November rose to 31,000 -- more than 140 percent higher than
13,000 for the same month last year, he noted.</P>
      <P>Huang forecast that the auto industry will continue to grow in December, as the
current commodity tax reduction on auto purchases will expire at the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>Although industrial production in December is expected to show steady growth,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government agencies started a campaign Wednesday to allay major public concerns
over three new accords signed between Taiwan and China the previous day amid
mass protests by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and civic
groups.</P>
      <P>In their fourth round of talks,  China and Taiwan's  top cross-strait
negotiators signed three agreements Tuesday on fishery worker cooperation,
agricultural quarantine inspection and industrial product standards
certification.</P>
      <P>In response to the fears expressed by the DPP that the agreements will result in
job losses and a compromise of Taiwan's sovereignty, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said that since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office in 2008, the
government has been firmly safeguarding the interests of local industries and
the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Regarding  the fishery cooperation  pact,  the Council  of Agriculture's
Fisheries Agency said it will maintain the current restrictions on the
importation of specific species of fish from China, in order to protect Taiwan's
fish farming sector.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the 144 percent increase in the sale of Chinese catch on the
Taiwan market this year from 2008, the Fishery Agency said this was due to the
Taiwan government's efforts, including its effective crackdown on smuggling and
its stipulation that Taiwanese fishing boats must be equipped with monitoring
systems.</P>
      <P>These measures have helped reduce the smuggling of fish catches across the
strait and have led to normal trade between the two sides, the agency said.</P>
      <P>In the area of quarantine inspection of agricultural products, the COA
reiterated that the agreement has nothing to do with opening the Taiwan market
to Chinese produce. The pact is aimed at ensuring that Taiwan's fruit and
vegetables clear China customs more quickly and at ensuring more transparent
information on chemical residues on both sides, the COA said.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Standards, Meteorology and Inspection under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA), meanwhile, said the industrial product standards
certification agreement will allow Taiwan industries to find a footing in the
Chinese market in the short term and to access the global market in the long
term.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, the vast Chinese market will serve as stepping stone
for goods manufactured under Taiwan-China joint ventures to go international and
to obtain global standards recognition. This will save Taiwan enterprises from
having to pay high royalties to U.S. or European companies, it added.</P>
      <P>The DPP's claim of a "one-China market" is a far-fetched theory, it added.</P>
      <P>The three agreements were signed by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taiwan
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin,
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), in
Taichung City, central Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Pro-independence protesters continued their efforts Wednesday for the fourth
consecutive day to show their opposition to a visit by a Chinese special envoy,
as he toured central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the mountainous county of Miaoli, protesters chanted slogans and held banners
and placards before and during the arrival in the area of Chen Yunlin, chairman
of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Chen is on a sightseeing tour, after having completed his main mission in Taiwan
-- to sign three accords with his Taiwan counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman
of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>At the gate of West Lake Resortopia in Miaoli, dozens of protesters  chanted
slogans,  while supporters of Chen's visit responded in kind.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong practitioners and pro-independence supporters waited for Chen at his
second stop, Wooden Sculpture Museum in Sanyi. On Chen's arrival there, the
protesters shouted slogans such as "Taiwan, China -- one country on each side",
"Communists, go back (to China) " and "stop suppressing Falun Gong."</P>
      <P>Chen, surrounded by tight security, appeared unfazed by the protests.</P>
      <P>At the day's final stop at Dajia Jenn Lann Temple, one of the most well-known
temples in Taiwan dedicated to the sea goddess Matsu, Chen's motorcade was again
beleaguered by Falun Gong members and pro-independence supporters. Some 1,000
police and 200-300 volunteers were deployed around the temple to maintain order.</P>
      <P>In the morning, three city councilmen from the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) sneaked past security into an alley outside Chen's hotel
in Taichung City, where they chanted slogans until the police removed them.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to visit Sun Moon Lake, a scenic spot in Nantou County that is
popular among Chinese tourists, and is expected to spend the night there before
leaving for Beijing Friday.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong practitioners said they will stage a protest at Sun Moon Lake as
well.</P>
      <P>Chen has been bombarded by protests almost everywhere he has gone so far during
his five-day visit to Taiwan. An estimated 30,000 protesters marched against his
visit and a proposed trade pact on Dec. 20, the day before he arrived in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since then, smaller protests have been held every day close to the Windsor Hotel
where he was staying in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Local groups said before Chen's arrival that they will deploy a "shadow
strategy" and follow Chen everywhere he goes.</P>

      <P>In addition, a foot spa, an aromatherapy saloon, and stores will be built at the
island's visitors' service center, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The tree houses are expected to be ready for occupancy by next summer, and the
other facilities are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year, the
company said.</P>
      <P>According to company advisor Peng Yu-chung, 80 percent of Green Island's 300,000
annual visitors usually arrive between May and October, and 60 percent go to the
island's unique undersea hot springs.</P>
      <P>The company is planning to offer walking and cycling tours that will be suitable
in fall and winter, and will also promote ecology field trips around the island,
Peng said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Peng Fu-lang, a section chief at the East Coast National Scenic Area
Administration under the Tourism Bureau, said the government will seek further
cooperation with the private sector to build more hotels on Green Island next
year.</P>

      <P>A police officer was injured but appeared to be in stable condition and six
protesters were detained in an incident Wednesday night in front of the hotel
where Chinese envoy Chen Yunlin is staying, Taichung City police said.</P>
      <P>It was the first arrest and the most serious injury that occurred since a series
of protests were launched Dec. 20 against a five-day visit by Chen, president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in the central Taiwan city Monday for the fourth round of cross-
strait talks with his Taiwan counterpart, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation. The talks concluded the previous day with three agreements inked.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu-hsiang, a police officer in the Criminal Investigative Corps, sustained
an injury to his forehead when he was pushed from a vehicle by protesters as he
tried to stop them from launching firecrackers in the direction of the Windsor
Hotel, Yu Hui-mao, Deputy Director-General of Taichung City's Police Bureau,
said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Six protesters were detained after the incident and are still in custody on
charges of endangering public safety, disrupting public service and assault, Yu
said. The vehicle carrying the protesters was also seized, he added.</P>
      <P>The firecrackers set off by the protesters, who were mostly from the pro-
independence group "The Taiwan Republic Campaign, " posed a safety hazard for
the hotel and the nearby area, Yu said.</P>
      <P>An eye witness among the demonstrators told reporters that more than a dozen
police officers jumped on the vehicle to go after the protesters and Chen
accidentally fell off the truck onto the ground.</P>
      <P>"No one pushed him. I have a video recording to prove that, " said a graduate
student who asked not to be named.</P>
      <P>The police also videotaped the incident but the footage cannot be made public

      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index for November rose 31.46 percent year-on-
year, growing for the third consecutive month, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The industrial production index stood at 108.78 in November -- representing the
highest year-on-year growth since August 1978-- an increase that the MOEA
attributed to the low base last year and the recovery of the global economy.</P>
      <P>Production in the motor vehicle and parts industry increased the most, at 71.69
percent, while chemical material production rose 63.45 percent, and electronic
parts and components climbed 60.96 percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>MOEA Statistics Department Director-General Huang Chi-shi attributed the sharp
growth in the auto industry to rebounding consumer demand. The number of vehicle
registrations in November rose to 31,000 -- more than 140 percent higher than
13,000 for the same month last year, he noted.</P>
      <P>Huang forecast that the auto industry will continue to grow in December, as the
current commodity tax reduction on auto purchases will expire at the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>Although industrial production in December is expected to show steady growth,
the MOEA estimates that the rate for the year will be between -8 percent and -9
percent, Huang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government agencies started a campaign Wednesday to allay major public concerns
over three new accords signed between Taiwan and China the previous day amid
mass protests by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and civic
groups.</P>
      <P>In their fourth round of talks,  China and Taiwan's  top cross-strait
negotiators signed three agreements Tuesday on fishery worker cooperation,
agricultural quarantine inspection and industrial product standards
certification.</P>
      <P>In response to the fears expressed by the DPP that the agreements will result in
job losses and a compromise of Taiwan's sovereignty, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said that since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office in 2008, the
government has been firmly safeguarding the interests of local industries and
the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Regarding  the fishery cooperation  pact,  the Council  of Agriculture's
Fisheries Agency said it will maintain the current restrictions on the
importation of specific species of fish from China, in order to protect Taiwan's
fish farming sector.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the 144 percent increase in the sale of Chinese catch on the
Taiwan market this year from 2008, the Fishery Agency said this was due to the
Taiwan government's efforts, including its effective crackdown on smuggling and
its stipulation that Taiwanese fishing boats must be equipped with monitoring
systems.</P>
      <P>These measures have helped reduce the smuggling of fish catches across the
strait and have led to normal trade between the two sides, the agency said.</P>
      <P>In the area of quarantine inspection of agricultural products, the COA
reiterated that the agreement has nothing to do with opening the Taiwan market
to Chinese produce. The pact is aimed at ensuring that Taiwan's fruit and
vegetables clear China customs more quickly and at ensuring more transparent
information on chemical residues on both sides, the COA said.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Standards, Meteorology and Inspection under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA), meanwhile, said the industrial product standards
certification agreement will allow Taiwan industries to find a footing in the
Chinese market in the short term and to access the global market in the long
term.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, the vast Chinese market will serve as stepping stone
for goods manufactured under Taiwan-China joint ventures to go international and
to obtain global standards recognition. This will save Taiwan enterprises from
having to pay high royalties to U.S. or European companies, it added.</P>
      <P>The DPP's claim of a "one-China market" is a far-fetched theory, it added.</P>
      <P>The three agreements were signed by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taiwan
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin,
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), in
Taichung City, central Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Pro-independence protesters continued their efforts Wednesday for the fourth
consecutive day to show their opposition to a visit by a Chinese special envoy,
as he toured central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the mountainous county of Miaoli, protesters chanted slogans and held banners
and placards before and during the arrival in the area of Chen Yunlin, chairman
of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Chen is on a sightseeing tour, after having completed his main mission in Taiwan
-- to sign three accords with his Taiwan counterpart Chiang Pin-kung, chairman
of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>At the gate of West Lake Resortopia in Miaoli, dozens of protesters  chanted
slogans,  while supporters of Chen's visit responded in kind.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong practitioners and pro-independence supporters waited for Chen at his
second stop, Wooden Sculpture Museum in Sanyi. On Chen's arrival there, the
protesters shouted slogans such as "Taiwan, China -- one country on each side",
"Communists, go back (to China) " and "stop suppressing Falun Gong."</P>
      <P>Chen, surrounded by tight security, appeared unfazed by the protests.</P>
      <P>At the day's final stop at Dajia Jenn Lann Temple, one of the most well-known
temples in Taiwan dedicated to the sea goddess Matsu, Chen's motorcade was again
beleaguered by Falun Gong members and pro-independence supporters. Some 1,000
police and 200-300 volunteers were deployed around the temple to maintain order.</P>
      <P>In the morning, three city councilmen from the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) sneaked past security into an alley outside Chen's hotel
in Taichung City, where they chanted slogans until the police removed them.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to visit Sun Moon Lake, a scenic spot in Nantou County that is
popular among Chinese tourists, and is expected to spend the night there before
leaving for Beijing Friday.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong practitioners said they will stage a protest at Sun Moon Lake as
well.</P>
      <P>Chen has been bombarded by protests almost everywhere he has gone so far during
his five-day visit to Taiwan. An estimated 30,000 protesters marched against his
visit and a proposed trade pact on Dec. 20, the day before he arrived in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since then, smaller protests have been held every day close to the Windsor Hotel
where he was staying in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Local groups said before Chen's arrival that they will deploy a "shadow
strategy" and follow Chen everywhere he goes.</P>

      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Responding to Chiang's complaint that Chinese investment in Taiwan remains
limited, China's top Taiwan negotiator said Wednesday that the persistent
protests and public opposition in Taiwan have spooked potential Chinese
investors.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , said during discussions in Taichung that Chinese enterprises
are likely to gauge two major factors -- whether their investments would be
lucrative, and whether it would be safe for them to operate in Taiwan. (Dec. 24,
2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>While China's top negotiator with Taiwan said that the Taiwan environment is not
"stable enough" to lure Chinese investors, Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of
Taiwan's intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), reported the same day
that so far Chinese investors have channeled some NT$1.15 billion into 22
investment projects in Taiwan. In comparison, Taiwanese entrepreneurs have
invested a mammoth NT$4 trillion in more than 70,000 projects in China over the
past 20 years, he noted.</P>
      <P>Kao said the government is reviewing its policy on Chinese investment in Taiwan,
hopefully to open more industry sectors early next year to Chinese investment
and thus attract more capital. (Dec. 24, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>In Wednesday's discussions, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said so far Chinese
investment in Taiwan has been not at all significant in comparison to the amount
invested by Taiwanese firms and individuals in China.</P>
      <P>In response, ARATS President Chen Yunlin said many Chinese entrepreneurs are
skittish because of the constant opposition and protests in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he fully understands  how the Taiwanese people, particularly those in
southern Taiwan, feel about the signing of a proposed cross-strait free trade
pact, but he argued that if Taiwan could "not be afraid," it would attain a more
advantageous position.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>We are realizing more and more the hollowness and lack of common sense in the
Democratic Progressive Party's mainland China policy, based on the party's
protests against the negotiations between Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Chen Yunlin, president of the Association
for the Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , and to the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Many people have the same question: What exactly is the DPP protesting against?
In the four Chiang-Chen meetings so far, 12 cross-strait agreements have been
signed on issues that include direct flights, Chinese visitors to Taiwan,
judicial cooperation, food safety, agricultural products inspection, fishery
labor affairs, and standardization of certificates. As hardly any objections to
the agreements have been heard from the DPP, could it be that it is only opposed
to Chen's traveling around during his visit in Taiwan, not to the 12 agreements?</P>
      <P>As to the ECFA proposal, the signing of such an agreement is meant to meet the
challenges of globalization. If the DPP really considers the ECFA such a
disastrous idea, why is not against the efforts to join the trade cooperation
framework of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)?</P>
      <P>If the DPP is building its cross-strait policy on the political notion  of a
"Taiwan  Republic"  and  the economic  idea  of "anti-globalization," where will
the DPP find its footing?</P>
      <P>The DPP should immediately stop its political manipulations of deceit and self-
deception.</P>

      <P>A local police officer was rushed to hospital and six men were detained late
Wednesday after the policeman fell from a truck while trying to stop protesters
from shooting fireworks at a Taichung City hotel where top Chinese negotiator
Chen Yunlin was staying.</P>
      <P>The incident involved the most serious injury and the first arrests since Chen's
arrival Monday for a new round of high-level cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the controversy:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>A bloody clash broke out Wednesday night when Chen Chu-hsiang, a Taichung police
squad leader, was allegedly pushed from a van while trying to stop pro-
independence activists from launching fireworks in the direction of the Windsor
Hotel in the central city where China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin was staying.</P>
      <P>The 49-year-old police officer sustained a head injury that caused bleeding
inside the skull, and has been placed in intensive care for further observation,
doctors said. "The next three days are the most critical," said a hospital
spokesman.</P>
      <P>After the incident,  the six protesters were detained for questioning. They
claimed that the police officer was not pushed, but rather fell from the van
accidentally.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the bloody incident, opposition Democratic Progressive Party
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen issued two statements in succession, calling for society
to remain calm and urging protesters to express their opinions in a rational,
peaceful manner. (Dec.24, 2009)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>While Chang Chih-mei, chief executive of the "908 Taiwan Republic Campaign" who
led the protest, insisted that no one pushed the injured policeman, Yu Hui-mao,
deputy director-general of Taichung City's Police Bureau, said police video
footage shows that the officer was indeed pushed from the vehicle.</P>
      <P>Yu urged the protesters to express their views in a peaceful manner to avoid
recurrence of similar incidents. (Dec.24, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>More than 300 young adults dressed red jackets or pink T-shirts appeared near
the popular CehnLan Temple in central Taiwan's Dajia township Wednesday ahead of
a visit there by China's top negotiator Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>While anti-Beijing protesters claimed that the young men were mobilized by an
underworld criminal syndicate to protect Chen, the temple's chairman, Legislator
Yen Ching-piao, said the private security detail was from two volunteer groups
closely associated with the temple. Their presence was only aimed at ensuring
that Chen's visit proceeded smoothly, Yen insisted. (Dec.24, 2009)</P>

      <P/>
      <P>The administration of Ma Ying-jeou has blocked the people out of the secret
negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communists in order to show
China its earnestness.</P>
      <P>Earlier, the Ma administration refused to allow a referendum for the people to
decide on the proposed signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China. The administration's aim was the same -- to marginalize its
own people.</P>
      <P>This approach makes it clear that President Ma is fully aware of the
unpopularity of the KMT-CCP secret negotiations, the private agreements, the
Legislature's rejection of supervision, and the ever closer cross-strait
economic and trade relations reflected in the proposed Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) on monetary cooperation and the ECFA.</P>
      <P>In a democratic country, the administration should heed public opinion.
President Ma, however, has blocked out the people's opinions. As he puts up
barriers against the people, isn't President Ma afraid of being rejected by
them?</P>
      <P>It is generally known that although Taiwan and Hong Kong have totally different
status, China has been trying to apply the Hong Kong model to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since most of the people in Taiwan are not willing to be swallowed by China or
become part of China, it will be extremely difficult for China to "unify" with
Taiwan with the consent of the people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are two countries on each side of the Taiwan Strait, which is
different from Hong Kong's status as a colony before its return to China. People
in Hong Kong did not have the right to voice their expectations about the
future, and it was too late for them to promote democracy after the handover.</P>
      <P>Based on Hong Kong's experience, we can see the reasons for the consistent
protests by sensible people against the Chiang-Chen negotiations and why the
demonstrations must not be demeaned as nonsensical trouble-making.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No need to alter H1N1 immunization program: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
12/24/09  13:45:19
(By Justin Su and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top health official said Thursday there's no likelihood of the
government  revising the ongoing immunization program against H1N1 flu, as the
campaign is doing much more good than harm.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said that so far there has
been only one fatality that could possibly be linked to the vaccine, although
the cause of the death is yet to be determined, and that relatively few people
have developed side effects.</P>
      <P>"The number of deaths from influenza H1N1 would have been comparatively  much
higher had Taiwan  not launched  the H1N1 immunization campaign, " Yaung told
the press after a hearing at the Legislative Yuan on regulations governing
Taiwan's medical sector.</P>
      <P>"So far Taiwan has had 33 H1N1 fatalities, a much better figure than most other
countries in the world," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the number of new H1N1 cases has dropped significantly
since the vaccination campaign was launched nationwide Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>According to DOH statistics, since the start of the immunization program, a
total of 424 of the 4.81 million people who have been vaccinated have complained
of serious symptoms, including high fever.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yaung said the DOH will organize a special task force, comprised of
experts from Taiwan's medical and legal fields, to address  controversies
related  to side effects  of the H1N1 inoculation.</P>
      <P>In response to reports that the family of a seven-year-old boy who died
allegedly from the H1N1 vaccine has refused to have an autopsy performed on the
body, Yaung said the Taichung District Prosecutors' Office has launched an
investigation into the case and the DOH will respect the prosecutors' findings
and their decisions.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 15 member states of the United National Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) concluded the Copenhagen conference with a declaration that the
parties would "take note" of the document, called the Copenhagen Accord, but no
consensus was achieved regarding the sharing of responsibilities or the right to
impose restrictions.</P>
      <P>Although the road to continued negotiations is not totally closed, the United
States and China's battle for leverage at almost every turn portends difficulty
in achieving and implementing a protocol to contain the problem of global
warming.</P>
      <P>The confrontations between the U.S. and China at the Copenhagen summit reflected
the conflict over finding a balance between economic development  and the rights
and obligations  to protect  the environment.</P>
      <P>For most countries, making a choice between economic development and
environmental protection is comparable to untying the legendary "Gordian Knot."
In the Greek legend, the person who untied the knot would rule all of Asia, and
the highly intricate knot resisted all attempts until the year 333 B.C., when
Alexander the Great cut through it with a sword.</P>
      <P>The government's difficulty in making a choice is best reflected in Premier Wu
Den-yih's recent comments on three job-creating investment projects, although
the three projects might run into carbon emissions  problems in the
environmental  screening and evaluation stage, they need to be implemented soon.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Morris Chang, founding chairman and chief executive officer
of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSMC), who is an advocate of
turning the challenge of environmental protection into opportunity for the
development of clean the energy industry, has recently voiced concerns about the
environment. "Those who do not plan for the future will find trouble on their
doorstep, " Chang said, quoting a Chinese proverb.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a small island country constantly threatened by natural disasters such
as floods, earthquakes and droughts. Over-development has led to more
environmental damage. Although no consensus was reached in Copenhagen, the
summit could serve as an reminder of the need for government policy on land
conservation.</P>
      <P>We expect the government to break through conventional thinking and display its
resoluteness to cut its "Gordian Knot."</P>

      <P>The Department of Health will consider making survey forms available to people
who have received the H1N1 flu vaccine, as a means of tracking side effects or
any other problems, Taiwan's top health official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said at the Legislative
Yuan that the idea is for the DOH to ask people who have received the H1N1
vaccine to enter information on the survey forms that will give health
authorities a better grasp of the problems and complaints related to the
immunization program.</P>
      <P>Yaung made the suggestion in response to opposition Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Huang Sue-ying's criticism of DOH officials' "bad attitude" of
immediately denying that reactive symptoms, side effects, and even deaths "had
nothing to do with the H1N1 vaccination."</P>
      <P>The health minister told the legislator that the DOH will set up a special task
force, comprised of experts from Taiwan's medical and legal fields, to jointly
address controversies related to H1N1 inoculation complaints.</P>
      <P>However, Yaung said, he does not yet have any concrete ideas on how such a task
force should function.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  he advised  that  people  who are not medical professionals refrain
from making statements or accusations on matters related to H1N1 vaccination
complaints.</P>
      <P>"It is better to let the specialists talk. Otherwise the DOH will be defeated by
the media before the facts could be determined, " he urged.</P>
      <P>In related news, Steve Kuo, director-general of the DOH Centers for Disease
Control, suggested Thursday that pregnant women consult their obstetricians
before getting the H1N1 vaccine.</P>
      <P>Although the World Health Organization as well as the health authorities of
Taiwan and the United States have advised that vaccination is safe at any stage
of pregnancy, Kuo said it would be better for the pregnant women to consult a
doctor before getting immunized.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after five problem cases involving pregnant women were
reported. Two of the women had stillbirths, two had miscarriages, and the fifth
was distressed to learn, after she had received the H1N1 vaccine, that she was
pregnant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Reneging on beef opening would hurt U.S. support for Taiwan: official</HEADLINE>

12/24/09  16:42:45
(By Alex Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A top national security official on Thursday urged lawmakers and the public not
to demand a reopening of talks with the United States on controversial beef
imports, warning that reneging on an agreement to lift a ban on the imports
would hurt relations.</P>
      <P>National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Su Chi said Taiwanese people
should take into account Taiwan's limited role in the international community
when considering how to approach this issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs the support of the United States, its biggest ally, in its
participation in international organizations and if Taiwan violates a recently-
reached protocol on the import of U.S. beef, it is likely to see the U.S. and
its lawmakers hold back their support for the island, said Su.</P>
      <P>Su noted that the U.S. Congress attaches great importance to the issue as 70
percent of the U.S. congressional leaders are from agricultural states. U.S.
Congress is also a long-time major force backing Taiwan, Su added.</P>
      <P>In addition, "there has been no progress in the economic relationship between
Taiwan and the U.S. in the past 10 years despite improvements in the political
relations" since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May last year, Su said.</P>
      <P>Going back on Taiwan's agreement to lift the ban on U.S. beef products
previously restricted  could continue to put on hold long-stalled talks between
the two sides on the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) , double
taxation, intellectual property rights and energy and environmental cooperation,
Su warned.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Su said that he will "respect the final decision by the
legislature" and "the people's right to initiate a referendum on the issue."</P>
      <P>He, nevertheless, urged the legislature not to amend any law to deal with the
matter, saying that the current control measures are enough to safeguard the
public's health.</P>
      <P>If the referendum on renegotiating the issue passes, Su said he will "abide by"
the decision.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at his first press conference since he took the post in May
last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government agreed to lift a ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef and
certain other beef products in late October, leading to widespread criticisms
and concerns about public health due to fears of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The government has organized a series of press conferences, -- by the Department
of Heath, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
respectively -- since Dec. 22 to clarify its policy on U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Ruling and opposition lawmakers have both proposed their versions of the draft
amendments to the Act Governing Food Sanitation in face of growing pressure from
the public. They may reach a consensus on Dec. 29.</P>
      <P>Su on Thursday also clarified that Taiwan and the U.S. could hold a meeting to
review the beef import agreement "within, " not "in, "180 days after Taiwan's
government decided to allow the U. S. beef products into the island, as
stipulated in the pact. But Su did not elaborate on that.</P>

Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of the
Association for the Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , concluded with
only three agreements on technical issues.</P>
      <P>The reason for the failure to sign a double taxation avoidance agreement has not
been disclosed either by the negotiators or the Ministry of Finance, but Premier
Wu Den-yih has given an explanation that is far removed from the media
speculations.</P>
      <P>According to the media, the reasons are that the two sides have differing views
on the tax jurisdiction; there are fears that China with its non-democratic
system may use political means to scrutinize businesses, and financial and
taxation data may be used to threaten Taiwanese businesses; and there is worry
among many people over the retroactive clause in the proposed agreement.</P>
      <P>Some media have also suggested that under strong lobby from some Taiwanese
businessmen who are worried that greater transparency would mean paying more
taxes, the Ministry of Finance was cowed into shelving the agreement.</P>
      <P>We think this is the most unacceptable reason and hope it is nothing but a
rumor.</P>
      <P>We regret that the government agencies concerned have not issued any statements
of clarification and that there have been only whispers  and speculations  by

      <P>Last week, Premier Wu Den-yih was "furious" about the low efficiency in the

      <P>Taking the proposal of allowing people using their home equity to live a life of
retirement as an example, while the practice can be realized as an arrangement
between banking institutions and individuals approved by the Financial
Supervisory Commission, Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said that the
government will complete the feasibility study within a year and a prototype of
such an arrangement can be expected at the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Minister Jiang doesn't seem to understand that "policy evaluation, " which has
its urgency is different from "academic research." With the convenience in
obtaining information nowadays, the feasibility study should be completed within
a month. If the proposal is found workable, a draft plan for the implementation
should be submitted within a month.</P>
      <P>The issue regarding whether to allow the semiconductor, flat panel display and
petrochemical industries to invest in China has been studied by the government
for over 10 years.</P>
      <P>While China remains the major market for the three sectors with big investments,
if Taiwanese manufacturers fail to participate in the growth of these industries
on the Chinese mainland, they will suffer a serious setback when the Chinese
industries achieve full-fledged development.</P>

      <P>The system of evaluating the performance of public servants has been criticized
as being useless.  President Ma Ying-jeou has suggested that while public
servants can be faulted for giving "lip service without action, or action
without elaboration, " they should be able "to talk and act, to talk and act at

implementation."</P>
      <P>Although there is some truth to Ma's comments, the people can see with their own

      <P>Many  public  servants,  especially  some  intractable  and conservative senior
ones, are only concerned about having an easy time before their retirement.
Haven't you heard the saying, "You can't teach an old dog new tricks"? This is
the result of a system of false equity that purports we are "all taking food

      <P>Taiwan's drastic lagging behind other emerging countries is closely related to

      <P>China's top negotiator with Taiwan visited the famous Buddhist Chung Tai Chan
Monastery in central Taiwan's Nantou County Thursday amid mild protests from
pro-independence activists.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS), was greeted by more than 500 Buddhist followers who
lined up at the main entrance to the sprawling temple complex to welcome him.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by his Taiwanese counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, and staff members of the two quasi-official
intermediary organizations in charge of cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Dharma Master Wei Chueh, the monastery's founder and abbot, met Chen in the
magnificent monastery's main prayer hall.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at a welcoming party, Chen said it has been one of his
great wishes in his 20 years of dealing with Taiwan affairs to meet Master Wei
Chueh.</P>
      <P>"My wish is fulfilled today and I feel flattered by warm friendship and
hospitality shown by friends at the temple," Chen said emotionally.</P>
      <P>Chen praised Wei Chueh for his outstanding contributions to the promotion of
cross-strait religious exchanges over the past decades.</P>
      <P>Noting that many Chinese people believe in Buddhism in hopes of peace and
goodness prevailing in the world and everybody leading a happy life, Chen said
he gets a taste of such sentiments while touring around the Chung Tai complex.</P>
      <P>While Chen and his mission arrived at the monastery, more than 10 members of a
radical pro-independence advocacy group "908 Taiwan Republic Campaign" held up
anti-China placards and chanted slogans to protest against the ARATS
delegation's visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In contrast to clashes the day before in neighboring Taichung City, the protest
at the temple proceeded relatively peacefully.</P>
      <P>Dozens of practitioners of the Falun Gong spiritual group, which is outlawed and
persecuted in China, also staged a sit-in along the main road to the Chung Tai
Monastery to appeal for and end to China's suppression of Falun Gong followers
in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen is in Taiwan for the fourth-round of talks between China and Taiwan since
relations improved after Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008
focusing on reducing tensions and strengthening economic ties.</P>
      <P>Prior to Chen's arrival on Monday, tens of thousands of protesters demonstrated
against his visit on Sunday and the Taiwanese government's plan to sign an
agreement with China next year aimed at removing trade barriers.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to leave Taiwan on Friday after signing three agreements with
Chiang Tuesday on cooperation in fishing crew issues, agricultural quarantine
and industrial products certification.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Adimmune affirms quality of eggs used for H1N1 vaccine production</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's vaccine manufacturer Adimmune Corp. gave the assurance Thursday that
there was no problem with the quality of eggs used to produce the influenza
A(H1N1) vaccine, amid suspicion that contaminated eggs could have been
responsible for the severe side effects suffered by some individuals who have
received the vaccine.</P>
      <P>Wei Yi-chih, the company's president, said that the eggs were supplied by two
chicken farms that met special specifications. The farms were inspected twice by
the Department of Health's (DOH's) Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis and passed
inspection on both occasions, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the eggs produced by the farms passed all nine required tests,
including salmonella levels, avian flu infection, and antibiotic residues,
according to Wei.</P>
      <P>He said that before the immunization program was launched in the country,
approximately 30 people had died from the new flu strain, but the fatalities
have since dropped significantly thanks to the efficacy of the vaccine.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the company has so far produced more than 40 batches of
vaccine, each using 130,000 eggs, Wei said the number of cases of side effects
would have been higher if there had been problems with the eggs or the packaging
of the vaccine.</P>
      <P>DOH statistics show that since the start of the immunization program, a total of
424 of the 4.81 million people who have been vaccinated have developed serious
side effects. They include a seven- year-old boy who died early this week,
allegedly from the H1N1 vaccine.</P>
      <P>With doubts about the safety of the vaccine mounting in the country, opposition
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chen Ting-fei again asked the DOH
Thursday to make public the origins of the eggs used to produce the vaccine and
the results of the tests on the eggs.</P>
      <P>However,  Kang  Chao-chou,  head of the DOH's  Bureau  of Pharmaceutical
Affairs, said that before doing so, the DOH will need to determine whether it is
lawful for it to publicize  such information, because the egg farms are under
the supervision of the the Council of Agriculture, not the DOH.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Li-min, a professor of pediatrics at National Taiwan University
(NTU) who led the vaccine's clinical trials on children,  said the trials were
conducted in accordance  with international  standards  and that legislators
are welcome to scrutinize the results.</P>
      <P>He said NTU has confidence in the trial results and has contributed an article
on the topic to a U.S. medical journal.</P>

      <P>Political parties or individuals who launch mass protests must be responsible
for ensuring the safety of those who participate in the demonstrations, Premier
Wu Den-yih was quoted as saying Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Any political party or individual devoted to the cause must assume the
responsibility of maintaining order on the streets and protect the safety of the
public whom they have mobilized to gather at a rally," Executive Yuan spokesman
Su Jun-pin quoted Wu as saying following a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Wu urged all parties concerned to be rational and not to ignite confrontation in
public protests, arguing that both freedom of speech and personal safety of the
public should be fully safeguarded at the same time.</P>
      <P>The premier's comments followed bloody clashes that broke out when some pro-
Taiwan independence backers and policemen dispatched to maintain order near the
Windsor Hotel, where China's visiting envoy Chen Yunlin was staying.</P>
      <P>Chen is in Taiwan for the fourth round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks, held in
central Taiwan's Taichung City. Prior to his arrival on Monday, tens of
thousands of protesters marched on Taichung's streets on Sunday to protest his
visit and the government's plans to sign an economic agreement with China next
year aimed at lifting trade barriers. Subsequent, but smaller protests, have
been held, including outside his hotel.</P>
      <P>One police officer, Chen Chu-hsiang, was pushed to the ground Wednesday while
trying to stop a group of activists from setting off firecrackers outside the
hotel. Chen sustained serious injuries to his forehead and was rushed to a
hospital, while six members of the group that organized the protest -- 908
Taiwan Republic -- were detained.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) organized the march on
Sunday, it has sought to distance itself from protesters from other pro-
independence groups.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan on Thursday expressed shock over the
incident involving the injured police officer and stressed that the party is
willing to take accountability for the matter even though the detained persons
are not DPP members.</P>
      <P>Su made the comments after visiting the hospitalized officer, whose condition
has taken a turn for the better.</P>
      <P>Su ascribed the injury to a "situation that got out of control" and contended
that protesters found to have broken the law must be dealt with by law and that
police also has to review its handling of the incident.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the party did not endorse the emotional
actions of the 908 Taiwan Republic supporters, but asked police to make public
its investigation report and video footage filmed on the site.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah, meanwhile, called for strong public
backing for the police to keep order in mass protests.</P>
      <P>In response to the argument by the six arrested men that officer Chen had fallen
from the truck on his own, Jiang said police have collected extensive and solid
evidence to prove the wrongdoing of these people.</P>
      <P>Lee Chien-jung, director of the KMT's Culture and Communications Committee,
demanded the DPP take full responsibility for the incident as it has promised,
rather than simply paying lip service.</P>
      <P>The DPP has failed  to keep  its pledge  of a "peaceful demonstration," he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP, however, has called for non-violent protests.</P>
      <P>Chen is slated to return to China on Friday.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian and his three immediate family members were
indicted again Thursday, along with 19 other people, on charges of corruption
and money laundering --crimes that prosecutors said were carried out by
manipulating financial reforms introduced by the Chen administration.</P>
      <P>In a third round of indictments, the Special Investigation Division under the
Supreme Prosecutors Office charged Chen, his wife Wu Shu-jen, their daughter
Chen Hsing-yu and son Chen Chih-chung again with bribery, money laundering and
forgery.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, the first couple took bribes amounting to NT$610
million (US$18.89 million) from the Cathay and Yuanta financial groups to
facilitate the groups' acquisition of other Taiwanese banks to form new
financial holdings companies.</P>
      <P>Other relatives and friends of Chen on the latest indictment list were Chen
Chih-chung's wife Huang Jui-ching; Wu Shu-jen's elder brother Wu Ching-mao; Wu
Ching-mao's wife Chen Chun-ying; Chen Shui-bian's former adviser Wu Li-pei; Ma
Yung-cheng, a top presidential aide during the Chen administration; and Yuanta
Group founder Rudy Ma.</P>
      <P>They were indicted on money laundering charges for helping Chen Shui-bian and
his wife to "hide and move money" within Taiwan and to transfer NT$740 million
to Swiss banks, prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>Hou Hsi-feng, former chairman of Kuo Yang Construction, and Lu Yung-tai,
chairman of Kao Hsing Chang Iron and Steel, were indicted on similar charges for
helping the ex-first couple to purchase a luxury apartment in Taipei City,
according to the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The indictment stated that Jeffrey Koo Jr., former vice chairman of Chinatrust
Financial Holding Co., was charged with crimes related to manipulating the
financial reforms that were conducted during the Chen administration.</P>
      <P>In the first round of trials last year, the Taipei District Court sentenced Chen
and his wife to life imprisonment, while 10 other people were given prison terms
ranging from three months to 20 years.</P>
      <P>In the second round of indictments in September this year, prosecutors charged
former Vice Premier Chiou I-jen and former Foreign Minister Michael Ying-mao Kao
for colluding with Chen to embezzle funds under the guise of "secret diplomacy
spending."</P>
      <P>Chen has been detained at the Taipei Detention Center since Dec. 30, 2008 on
charges of embezzlement, bribery, money laundering and forgery.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government cannot withdraw its approval for the mergers of several
local administrative districts into special municipalities, Minister of the
Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Thursday, citing the Local Government Act,</P>
      <P>In June, the ministry approved the upgrading of Taipei County and the mergers of
Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County, Tainan City and County, and Taichung City
and County into special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The redrawing of administrative districts was in line with the spirit of
President Ma Ying-jeou's plan to remap the country, Jiang said earlier in the
year after his ministry gave its approval for the merger and upgrade plans.</P>
      <P>The merging of administrative zones was aimed at streamlining local
administration and finance, facilitating a balance in urban and rural
development, enhancing local administrative efficiency and promoting  the
country's overall development  and international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>However, controversy over whether the merger plans can be canceled grew recently
after representatives from township and city administrative offices in areas of
southern Taiwan approved for mergers complained that they were not informed that
the elections for township and city representatives in the areas will be
canceled once the merger plans were approved.</P>
      <P>Jiang said Thursday at a legislative session that the plans for mergers of local
administrative districts were approved by local city and county governments as
well as city and county councils before they were filed with the ministry, so
local governments that want to give up their mergers should bring forward their
withdrawal proposals and get consent from city and county councils before
submitting their proposal to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Wu Yu-shen also asked Jiang to make public whether
cities and counties that are to be merged into municipalities are offered the
option to retract their merged plans.</P>
      <P>Jiang said there is a slim possibility for the new special municipalities to
retract their plans but should it happen, the ministry will work to address
related issues.</P>

      <P>U.S. defense manufacturer Raytheon Company said Wednesday that it has been
awarded contracts worth a total of US$1.1 billion to produce new Patriot Air and
Missile Defense System for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The awards cover ground-system hardware through an initial contract valued at
US$965.6 million and an initial spares contract valued at US$134.4 million, the
company said in a statement.</P>
      <P>It said the new Patriot fire units will feature improved man-machine interface
and reduced life-cycle costs and will be produced in Massachusetts, Texas and
Alabama.</P>
      <P>The items are part of an arms sale package approved by the administration of
former U.S. President George W. Bush in late 2008.</P>
      <P>In addition to 330 advanced capability Patriot (PAC-3) missiles, the deal also
includes 30 Apache attack helicopters, 32 Harpoon submarine-launched missiles,
182 guided Javelin missile rounds and four E-2T anti-submarine plane system
upgrades.</P>
      <P>There have also been reports in Taiwan that the administration of President
Barack Obama might soon announce more arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue in a regular press briefing, Taiwan's deputy
representative to the United States, Tung Kuo-yu, said he could not confirm the
reports.</P>
      <P>However, Tung said he understands that inter-agency discussions are still going
on within the Obama administration on whether to sell more weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tan Chih-lung, director-general of the Defense Mission of the Taipei Economic

always kept its arms sales to Taiwan highly confidential and usually does not
disclose related information until a couple of days before they are formally
announced, mainly to prevent possible protests or interference from China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will donate an Embraer Legacy 600 jet to Panama as part of a cooperative
program between the two countries, Republic of China Ambassador to Panama Simon
Y.S. Ko said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The government's decision to donate the Brazilian-made executive jet to the
Latin American country was based on consideration of the Panamanian government's
need for planes that are safe and can be used for emergency patient transport
services, according to Ko.</P>
      <P>Most of the Panamanian government's existing fleet of planes are outdated and
last May, a 40-year-old Panamanian National Air Service helicopter crashed into
a building in Panama City, killing 11 people, including  the head of Chile's
national police Jose Alejandro Bernales, and injuring five others, Ko went on.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese government's decision to donate the executive plane instead of
funds also took into account that in the past, former Panamanian government
officials have been accused of misuse of funds donated by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Embraer Legacy 600, which carries a price tag of US$27.45 million, is
capable of carrying 16 passengers in outstanding comfort and has a range of
5,650 km.</P>

      <P>China's top negotiator with Taiwan paid a visit Thursday to a mountain village
in central Taiwan's Nantou County that was one of the hardest-hit by Typhoon
Morakot-induced flooding and landslides in early August.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) ,  was briefed on the progress of post-disaster reconstruction
after arriving in Sinshan village, where a major bridge collapsed as a result of
strong winds and torrential rain brought by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Chinese people were very concerned about the devastation
caused by Morakot, which left more than 700 people dead or missing and thousands
homeless.</P>
      <P>"Many Chinese people, including some with meager incomes, have donated money to
help with post-disaster rehabilitation projects, " Chen said, adding that their
move epitomizes the idiom "blood is thicker than water."</P>
      <P>After listening to briefings by Taiwanese officials, Chen said he was impressed
by the government's efficiency and achievements in post-disaster relief
operations.</P>
      <P>As part of its cross-Taiwan  Strait unification  promotion strategy, China has
made visits to Morakot-affected zones part of Chen's itinerary during his latest
visit. As most of the areas are located in southern  Taiwan --  a traditional
stronghold  of pro-independence forces -- Chen instead visited Nantou, where he
conveyed China's goodwill and concern for the typhoon victims.</P>
      <P>Following the Sinshan disaster-zone visit, Chen and his ARATS delegation
traveled to Sun Moon Lake, one of Taiwan's most famous tourist attractions and a
must-see for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>As pro-independence  activists  had vowed to shadow Chen's sightseeing tour of
central Taiwan, the area surrounding the Lalu hotel, where Chen was to stay
overnight before wrapping up his visit Friday, was cordoned off by a heavy
security deployment from early Thursday.</P>
      <P>Before  Chen's arrival,  a clash almost broke out between pro-independence
activists and a group of pro-unification advocates at a parking lot on way to
the hotel, but police helped pacify the brawlers before the situation could
escalate.</P>
      <P>Chen was originally scheduled to have a boat tour around the lake, but canceled
the cruise, instead meeting with opposition People First Party Chairman James
Soong for wide-ranging talks instead.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, he visited Chung Tai Chan Monastery, one of Taiwan's largest
Buddhist temples in the county's Puli township, where he met with Dharma Master
Wei Chueh.</P>
      <P>Chen is in Taiwan for the fourth round of talks between China and Taiwan since
relations improved after President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008 and began
focusing on reducing cross-strait tension and strengthening economic ties.</P>
      <P>A day before Chen's arrival Dec. 21, tens of thousands of protesters in central
Taiwan's Taichung City demonstrated against his visit and the government's plan
to sign an agreement with China next year aimed at removing trade barriers.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to leave Taiwan Friday after completing his main mission of
signing three agreements Dec. 22 with his Taiwanese counterpart, Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, on cooperation on fishing crew
issues, agricultural quarantine and industrial products certification.</P>

      <P>A last-minute no-show of a scheduled boat tour around one of Taiwan's most
famous lakes and a visit to a Buddhist temple highlighted Chinese envoy Chen
Yunlin's last full day of his five-day visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, President of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) which is in charge of dealing with matters related to Taiwan,
did not show up on a scheduled boat tour around the Sun Moon Lake. Instead, Chen
met with People First Party Chairman James Soong for about one and a half hours.</P>
      <P>Located in the central county of Nantou, the Sun Moon Lake is one of Chinese
tourists' favorite spots in Taiwan with its breath-taking scenery and rich
indigenous tribal culture.</P>
      <P>Chen's no show left around 100 domestic, Chinese and foreign journalists, who
were already on boats to cover the event, in awe and confused. They did not have
any choice but to follow the boat tour along with Chen's Taiwanese counterpart
Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Chiang's
wife and Chen's wife.</P>
      <P>Chen and his three deputies met with Soong when a large contingent of
journalists were stuck on the boat tour. The meeting was not on the itinerary
arranged by the SEF. A SEF spokesman said they were not aware of the meeting
until moments before the boat tour.</P>
      <P>ARATS and the PFP did not disclose what was discussed in the meeting.</P>
      <P>The lake tour was highly anticipated as rumors said some legislators from the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and pro-independence
supporters have rented boats and were ready to launch a protest on the waters.
Falun Gong practitioners also said they would protest.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of local police were deployed around the lake to maintain order. A
number of divers from Nantou County Fire Department told the CNA that they had
carried out underwater patrol in the morning due to security concerns.</P>

Chen's absence.</P>
      <P>Bombarded by protests during the last three days in Taichung City, Thursday was
the first day Chen was free of loud noises. Hundreds of Falun Gong members held

August.</P>
      <P>Chen, after inking three deals Tuesday in the fourth round of cross-Strait
negotiations with Taiwan, is scheduled to fly back to Beijing Friday morning. A

    <HEADLINE>Reneging on beef opening would hurt U.S. support for Taiwan: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
12/24/09  20:55:40

    <TEXT>
      <P>A top national security official on Thursday urged lawmakers and the public not
to demand a reopening of talks with the United States on controversial beef
imports, warning that reneging on an agreement to lift a ban on the imports
would hurt relations.</P>
      <P>National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Su Chi said Taiwanese people
should take into account Taiwan's limited role in the international community
when considering how to approach this issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs the support of the United States, its biggest ally, in its
participation in international organizations and if Taiwan violates a recently-
reached protocol on the import of U.S. beef, it is likely to see the U.S. and
its lawmakers hold back their support for the island, said Su.</P>
      <P>Su noted that the U.S. Congress attaches great importance to the issue as 70
percent of the U.S. congressional leaders are from agricultural states. The U.S.
Congress is also a long-time major force backing Taiwan, Su added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Su said: "There has been no progress in the economic relationship
between Taiwan and the U.S. in the past 10 years despite improvements in the
political relations" since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May last year.</P>
      <P>Going back on Taiwan's agreement to lift the ban on U.S. beef products
previously restricted  could continue to put on hold long-stalled talks between
the two sides on the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) , double
taxation, intellectual property rights and energy and environmental cooperation,
Su warned.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Su said that he will "respect the final decision by the
legislature" and "the people's right to initiate a referendum on the issue."</P>
      <P>He, nevertheless, urged the legislature not to amend any law to deal with the
matter, saying that the current control measures are enough to safeguard the
public's health.</P>
      <P>If the referendum on renegotiating the issue passes, Su said he will "abide by"
the decision.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at his first press conference since he took the post in May
last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government agreed to lift a ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef and
certain other beef products in late October, leading to widespread criticisms
and concerns about public health due to fears of mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The government has organized a series of press conferences, -- by the Department
of Heath, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
respectively -- since Dec. 22 to clarify its policy on U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Ruling and opposition lawmakers have both proposed their versions of the draft
amendments to the Act Governing Food Sanitation in face of growing pressure from
the public. They may reach a consensus on Dec. 29.</P>
      <P>Su on Thursday also clarified that Taiwan and the U.S. could hold a meeting to
review the beef import agreement "within, " not "in, "180 days after Taiwan's
government decided to allow the U. S. beef products into the island, as
stipulated in the pact. But Su did not elaborate on that.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Timothy Chin-tien Yang said Thursday that
Taiwan should not break its promise after signing an international agreement, as
doing so will undermine its international credibility.</P>
      <P>"As a responsible member of the international community, ... Taiwan should not
categorically take back its promise after signing a deal," Yang told the same
news conference.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation and civic groups have launched bids to initiate a
referendum to ask the government to renegotiate the U.S. beef protocol.</P>
      <P>Critics of the protocol cited South Korea as an example and said that South
Korea had renegotiated a similar deal with the U.S. after facing strong pressure
from the public.</P>
      <P>But Yang noted that at present, 50 countries allow U.S. beef imports, including
Canada, European Union countries, South Korea and the Philippines, which impose
no limits on such imports.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan only gave a green light to beef from cattle under 30 months
old and those with removed risk materials, which assures a higher level of
safety, Yang stressed.</P>
      <P>The U.S. is Taiwan's largest source of beef supply in terms of market value,
according to Yang. U.S. boneless beef accounted for 38 percent, or US$128
million, of Taiwan's entire beef market valued at US$360 million in 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the sixth largest export market for U.S. beef and beef products,
behind Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, according to Yang.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that the government will build four marinas
as part of its efforts to promote tourism.</P>
      <P>"Fishing ports can not only be a hub for commercial fishing but can also serve
as bases for recreational yachting, " Ma said at an award presentation ceremony
for a tourism promotion event in which Taiwan's top 10 most interesting fishing
ports were honored.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing  Taiwan's  rich marine resources,  Ma said the government will lift
obsolete restrictions on the country's coastal regions to allow tourism
promotion under the premise of "no harm to the natural environment and ecology."</P>
      <P>Over the past 60 years, particularly during the martial law era, Taiwan imposed
strict restrictions on coastal development, which Ma said has made many local
people view the sea with a mixture of awe and fear.</P>
      <P>Times have changed, however, Ma went on, adding that besides being used for
commercial  fishing,  fishing  ports and their surroundings can be developed for
recreational and sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>"The newly selected top 10 most interesting fishing ports are expected to
attract both local and foreign visitors," Ma said, adding that the government
will build up-market docks at four of the ports -- Badoutzu, which will be given
a flagship class dock, and Wushih, Anping and Wuci, which will be given model
class docks -- for tourism.</P>
      <P>"The marinas will be able to accommodate 190 recreational yachts, " Ma said. "By
then, Taiwan will not just be Asia's No. 1 and the world's No. 5 yacht maker but
it will also be a country open to yachting."</P>
      <P>Despite the global economic downturn, Ma said Taiwan had posted a nearly 13
percent annual increase in the number of inbound visitors as of the end of
November, with the total number exceeding 3.94 million for the 11-month period.</P>
      <P>Among them, the number coming for sightseeing increased 28.46 percent, while the
number of tourists from Europe posted the greatest gain of 18 percent year-on-
year. The numbers of tourists from the United States and New Zealand also
increased 5 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>"The total number of inbound visitors is expected to reach an all-time high of
4.2 million this year," Ma added.</P>
      <P>The top 10 most interesting fishing ports selection was sponsored by the Council
of Agriculture. In addition to an online vote, a panel of judges composed of
scholars and experts were also invited to evaluate participating  ports'
facilities,  resources,  cultural heritage and market potential.</P>
      <P>The fishery associations that run the winning fishing ports were each given a
trophy and a cash prize of NT$200,000 (US$6,191.95).</P>

Chairman James Soong Thursday in central Taiwan's Nantou County after calling
off a tour of scenic Sun Moon Lake.</P>
      <P>Soong said after the one-hour meeting with Chen and three ARATS vice presidents
that it did not take place behind closed doors and was not for personal gain.</P>
      <P>He added that the meeting was scheduled during a visit he made to China in

      <P>Soong also expressed discontent over the refusal of Taiwan's Straits Exchange

tourism, Taiwanese officials posted in the United States said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The campaign, which will cover the prime period between Christmas and New Year,
will mark the first time a Taiwanese commercial has been presented in the iconic
square.</P>
      <P>From 6 a.m. until 2 a.m. every day, the 2.5-minute commercial will be shown
every hour on each of two wall screens located on either side of the Times
Square Ball -- the focus of the New Year countdown that attracts more than 1.6
million revelers every year.</P>
      <P>Kao Jen-chuan, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York,

      <P>Chang Cheng-yuan, director of the Tourism Bureau's New York office, said with a

commercial is expected to greatly increase Taiwan's media exposure and help
attract more international visitors to the country.</P>
      <P>Due to the economic slump caused by the global financial crisis, visitor
arrivals from the United States to Taiwan dropped by 5 percent year-on-year in

      <P>The National Taiwan University (NTU) lodged a protest Thursday with Webometrics
Ranking against an allegation by the Spanish ranking institute that NTU has
resorted to " bad practices" to win an inflated status in the world university
rankings.</P>
      <P>In its latest world university ranking published in July, Webometrics put NTU in
26th place, advancing from 55th place the previous year. NTU was the only
Taiwanese university to make the top 100 in the rankings.</P>
      <P>The institute,  however,  named NTU as of one of several universities that have
resorted to "bad practices" in a bid to get better rankings.</P>
      <P>According to the institute, NTU and several other universities "are hosting
large numbers of academic papers authored by scientists that do not belong to
those institutions."</P>
      <P>"This is not only unfair, but it clearly violates the copyright of the papers
involved. We urge these universities to take action to decrease the number of
suspicious files," Webometrics said on its Web site.</P>
      <P>However, NTU said in a statement that the allegation was not "clear" enough,
could be classed as libel, and has undermined the reputation of the university,
widely regarded as the best in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The statement said that NTU has always taken matters regarding its world ranking
in stride, and has never tried to manipulate its ranking in any way.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Compared to other major cities in Asia such as Tokyo, Shanghai or Hong Kong,
house prices and rentals in Taipei City still have potential to continue
surging, real-estate brokers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the newest list of Asia's most expensive places to live published
by Forbes magazine, Taipei ranks 16th with an average monthly rent of US$1,065
for a high-end two-bedroom apartment.</P>
      <P>Toyko topped the list at US$4,737, followed by Hong Kong at US$3,871 and Beijing
in third place at US$3,659.</P>
      <P>Urban enclaves where prices rose the most include the region's financial hubs
such as Mumbai, Singapore and Taipei, according to a Mercer Consulting's annual
cost-of-living survey.</P>
      <P>Despite the global downturn, rents are relatively high and property prices are
on the rise in these cities, according to Forbes.</P>
      <P>"In the past, we've seen Europe as the most expensive. Over time, the Asian
cities  have caught  up quite  a bit in terms of cost-of-living increases, "
said Cathy Loose, a principal consultant at Mercer. "Mainly because of the
limited space, real estate in terms of demand versus supply is driving the
rental price high."</P>
      <P>Huang Cheng-fu, an assistant manager with Evertrust Rehouse -- one of the
leading real estate brokers in Taiwan, said the US$1,065 monthly rental
estimated by Mercer for a fine two-bed room apartment in Taipei's upscale Daan
or Hsinyi district is a reasonably accurate figure.</P>
      <P>Compared to the US$3,871 average monthly rent for a similar product in Hong
Kong, rents and house prices in Taipei are expected to continue rising amid ever
closer exchanges in the greater China area, Huang contended.</P>
      <P>Su Chi-jung, a manager at Sinyi Realty Estate, said Taipei's 16th-spot ranking
reflects the fact that there is ample room for it to become more international,
on the grounds that the rate of a city's globalization is closely related to its
rental levels.</P>
      <P>Once there are more foreign business executives in a city, its rent levels
usually go up because such foreign nationals want to rent high-quality houses,
he said.</P>
      <P>With cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges continuing to expand and more foreign and
Chinese executives coming to Taiwan, Su predicted that Taipei will move further
up the list in the future.</P>
      <P>Locations in other parts of the country, however, will not see a similar rise in
real estate property or rental prices, another analyst added.</P>

      <P>Compared to other major cities in Asia such as Tokyo, Shanghai or Hong Kong,
house prices and rentals in Taipei City still have potential to continue
surging, real-estate brokers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the newest list of Asia's most expensive places to live published
by Forbes magazine, Taipei ranks 16th with an average monthly rent of US$1,065
for a high-end two-bedroom apartment.</P>
      <P>Toyko topped the list at US$4,737, followed by Hong Kong at US$3,871 and Beijing
in third place at US$3,659.</P>
      <P>Urban enclaves where prices rose the most include the region's financial hubs
such as Mumbai, Singapore and Taipei, according to a Mercer Consulting's annual
cost-of-living survey.</P>
      <P>Despite the global downturn, rents are relatively high and property prices are
on the rise in these cities, according to Forbes.</P>
      <P>"In the past, we've seen Europe as the most expensive. Over time, the Asian
cities  have caught  up quite  a bit in terms of cost-of-living increases, "
said Cathy Loose, a principal consultant at Mercer. "Mainly because of the
limited space, real estate in terms of demand versus supply is driving the
rental price high."</P>
      <P>Huang Cheng-fu, an assistant manager with Evertrust Rehouse -- one of the
leading real estate brokers in Taiwan, said the US$1,065 monthly rental
estimated by Mercer for a fine two-bed room apartment in Taipei's upscale Daan
or Hsinyi district is a reasonably accurate figure.</P>
      <P>Compared to the US$3,871 average monthly rent for a similar product in Hong
Kong, rents and house prices in Taipei are expected to continue rising amid ever
closer exchanges in the greater China area, Huang contended.</P>
      <P>Su Chi-jung, a manager at Sinyi Realty Estate, said Taipei's 16th-spot ranking
reflects the fact that there is ample room for it to become more international,
on the grounds that the rate of a city's globalization is closely related to its
rental levels.</P>
      <P>Once there are more foreign business executives in a city, its rent levels
usually go up because such foreign nationals want to rent high-quality houses,
he said.</P>

Chinese executives coming to Taiwan, Su predicted that Taipei will move further
up the list in the future.</P>

      <P>With climate change receiving increasing attention around the world, a group of
Taiwanese environmentalists have called on the government to adopt a new
diplomatic approach that focuses on helping its allies reduce carbon emissions
instead of merely providing them with financial assistance.</P>
      <P>According  to  Wang  Chun-hsiu,  president  of the  Taiwan Environmental
Protection Union, such an approach can better enhance the country's
international profile, because climate issues are taking center stage following
the conclusion of the 12-day United Nations Climate Change Conference in the
Danish capital of Copenhagen a week earlier.</P>
      <P>Wang and several other members of the union also took part in the meeting as
representatives of a non-government organization (NGO).</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuang-jung, a former president of the union, suggested that in participating
in similar events in the future, the government should develop closer
connections with domestic NGOs in order to gain contact with more international
groups.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the example of Japan, Hsu said that every day during the U.N.
conference, representatives of the Japanese government met with NGO
representatives at the end of the day to discuss details of the day's meeting
and what responses Japan should adopt.</P>
      <P>This demonstrates that the Japanese government attaches high importance to its
relations with NGOs, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Also, she said that Taiwan, which is promoting a bid to participate in the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) , should take the
initiative to comply with the Copenhagen Accord that was sealed upon the
conclusion of the conference.</P>
      <P>The agreement recognizes the scientific view that an increase in global
temperature of less than 2 degrees Celsius is required to stave off the worst
effects of climate change.</P>
      <P>According to the document, industrialized countries will commit to implement
quantified economy-wide emissions targets from 2020, to be listed in the accord
before Jan. 31 next year.</P>
      <P>A number of developing countries agreed to communicate their efforts to limit
greenhouse gas emissions every two years, also listing their voluntary pledges

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thursday's busting of an online surrogate birth brokering ring has again drawn
concern about the country's procrastination on surrogate motherhood legislation.
While medical experts affirm the existence of such a need, they caution local
couples about the perils of such service.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>An online surrogate birth service ring was cracked by Taiwan police Thursday,
unearthing an illegal social phenomenon that has taken place in Taiwan for years
as a result of demand.</P>
      <P>The ringleader, surnamed Lo, headquartered his online surrogate birth brokerage
in the United States and the potential "clients" shopped from a diverse catalog
of surrogate mothers provided by his Web site.</P>
      <P>Lo's ring collected an average of NT$1.6 million (US$49,536) for each successful
surrogate birth service, and so far nearly 20 of such babies have been born in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Surrogate birth broker Lo Hsien-lung was nabbed in Changhua City along with five
of his ring members for brokering "young," "sweet," and "healthy" women from
Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia as surrogate mothers for Taiwanese couples who
could not have their own children.</P>
      <P>Lo charged the childless couples based on their selections, with younger, more
attractive, better-educated surrogates commanding the highest prices.</P>
      <P>When the babies were born, the couples would travel to the country of origin to
take delivery, using the adoption procedure.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Lo and his accomplices were arrested on charges of violating the statute
governing artificial reproduction. The six could also face charges of human
trafficking and forgery.</P>
      <P>It was found that Lo's ring had earned around NT$20 million from some 20
Taiwanese couples who obtained their babies from abroad using the ring's
services.</P>
      <P>According to unofficial statistics, about 400,000 married couples in Taiwan have
trouble having their own babies. If calculated by Lo's charges, the underground
surrogate birth service is a market worth NT$500 billion.</P>
      <P>Lo would have found his "cash cow" if he had managed to grasp just 0.1 percent
of that huge market. (Dec. 25, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>A local obstetrician said that since surrogate motherhood is illegal in Taiwan,
married couples unable to have their own babies will tread the thin line of the
law in order to obtain one.</P>
      <P>Lee Mao-sheng, a board member of the Taiwanese Society for Reproductive
Medicine, said child-seeking Taiwanese couples are not only risking violating
the law but could also suffer even greater regret should their child obtained
through surrogacy be unhealthy or have any genetic problems.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the Changhua police also rounded up six married couples raising
children they obtained from surrogate  mothers overseas.</P>
      <P>One father aged between 40 and 50 said he and his wife had tried to seek a local
surrogate mother, but the matter proved to be unworkable since surrogate
motherhood is illegal in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He argued that he did not violate any law in Taiwan by adopting a child from
abroad.</P>
      <P>A woman surnamed Liu, who has been a surrogate mother several times in Taiwan
secretly, said she would choose not to do it if given the choice, given the
mental and physical trauma that she has suffered as a result.</P>
      <P>"Adopting a child from an orphanage would satisfy their desire to be parents if
the couple have love," she said. (Dec. 25, 2009)</P>

      <P>With the latest round of high-level cross-Taiwan Strait talks drawing to an end,
two local newspapers on Friday published the results of opinion surveys on
public reaction to the high-profile event.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of media reports on the findings of the latest surveys
on the fourth round of talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
in central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>United Daily News (UDN):</P>
      <P>The results of a UDN poll found that in the aftermath of the fourth round of
cross-strait talks since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office in May 2008, 31
percent of the respondents expressed satisfaction with the Ma administration's
performance during the talks, which led the two sides to sign three agreements
on fishing crew cooperation, agricultural and food quarantine inspection, and
industrial product standards, inspection and certification, while 32 percent
expressed dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>Fifty-six percent of those polled said they were not satisfied with protests
organized by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) against Chen's
visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the public satisfaction rate for DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen dropped
to 38 percent from 43 percent after the Dec. 5 local mayor and magistrate
elections, while the public satisfaction rate for Ma remained at the low level
of 33 percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of the three cross-strait cooperation agreements, 32 percent of the
respondents said they recognize that Taiwan will benefit from the accords, while
23 percent said the disadvantages will outweigh the advantages.</P>

      <P>On Thursday, the DPP unveiled the results of a poll conducted by the party
earlier in the week showing that most respondents still feel the government
lacks transparency  in dealing  with the Chiang-Chen talks.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 60.1 percent of the respondents said they did not think
the process of the latest talks was public and transparent on the scale
instructed by Ma.</P>
      <P>Only 21 percent of the respondents had the opposite opinion.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 71.6 percent of those surveyed said they do not agree
with the idea of trading part of Taiwan's sovereignty in exchange for the
formation of an economic cooperation framework agreement with China, while 16.2
percent were in favor.</P>
      <P>Asked about the recent cross-strait agreement on industrial product standards,
inspection and certification, 52.5 percent of the respondents said it is of
greater disadvantage than advantage toward Taiwan, while 33.9 percent said they

      <P>Detained former President Chen Shui-bian faces more criminal charges as
prosecutors indicted him Thursday for abusing his power by overriding free
market competition in the conduct of badly needed financial reform and taking
bribes from financial groups in exchange for aiding their acquisition and merger
deals.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife Wu Shu-jen, their daughter, son and daughter-in-law, as well as 17
business executives, were also indicted for their roles in those cases.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of media reports on the latest spate of indictments
involving the former first family:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the former president took advantage of his position to
interfere in matters that should be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance.</P>
      <P>Chen hampered  free competition  in the market,  seriously undermined financial
supervision and damaged his credibility as president. He later tried to conceal
his stolen fortune through money laundering, for which the prosecutors said he
should be severely punished. (Dec. 25, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chen established close ties with local conglomerates during his tenure as
president. Prosecutors found that Chen received NT$100 million from Cathay
Financial Holdings when he was first elected in 2000 and then asked Cathay to
sponsor him to the tune of NT$100 million each year from 2001 to 2004.</P>
      <P>Because of these close ties, Chen instructed the then-finance minister to
support Cathay's merger of another major bank.</P>
      <P>The 17 executives from three major financial holdings who were also indicted
include Ruday Ma, founder of the Yuanta Financial Holdings, his wife and two
sons. (Dec. 25, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian's office said Chen was not directly embroiled in any of the
specific cases mentioned by the prosecutors, and that "it is out of the question
that he accepted bribes or was involved in corruption."</P>
      <P>The prosecution should not rule that Chen accepted bribes just because of his
wife's acceptance of political donations.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Chuang Po-lin said the indictment of the former first family again during
top Chinese negotiator Chen Yunlin's visit to Taiwan is a manifestation of
President Ma Ying-jeou's will.</P>
      <P>Chuang said it was a political gesture to Chinese President Hu Jintao and to
Chen Yunlin and was designed to show that Chen Shui-bian is being punished for
his pro-independence stance. (Dec. 25, 2009)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>None of the bosses of five major local financial groups have been indicted for
paying bribes to former President Chen Shui-bian in exchange for his aid in
their merger and acquisition bids during a financial service market
restructuring campaign that took place under his oversight.</P>
      <P>Will their immunity to criminal charges encourage the man in the street to bribe
officials for private gain?</P>
      <P>In many advanced Western countries, individuals can face bribery charges by
offering even US$1 in bribes to a police officer if they are stopped for
violating traffic rules.</P>
      <P>How come local business chiefs can be immune to indictment after giving bribes
worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the former first couple? The judicial
authorities owe the public an explanation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a reputation as a haven for official corruption, as giving bribes is
not liable to incrimination so long as the bribe-taking officials do not violate
their official duties.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 24, the Executive Yuan came up with a draft amendment to that provision
with the aim of holding bribe-givers accountable, regardless of whether the
bribe-taking officials have violated their legal duties.</P>
      <P>However, the bill's fate remains uncertain, as the Legislative Yuan has yet to
screen it.</P>
      <P>The immunity of corporate tycoons to criminal charges after giving huge cash
bribes to the former first couple in exchange for business favors is the shame
of the local judicial community because few can believe the former president did
not lapse in his official duties after taking the bribes.</P>

      <P>The government is trying its utmost to coordinate with the legislature over a
possible legal amendment aimed at obstructing U.S. beef imports considered to be
risky, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang said the existing strict measures, known as the "three controls" and "five
certifications, " have been effective in keeping potentially hazardous beef
parts from the United States out of the country.</P>
      <P>However, the government would be willing to bear some of the consequences should
the Legislative Yuan remain determined to pass an amendment to the Act Governing
Food Sanitation to demand a re-opening of talks with the United States on
controversial beef imports, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"President Ma Ying-jeou will meet Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng later
in the day for a discussion of the issue," he said.</P>
      <P>The so-called three controls refer to setting controls on beef imports at the
source, at borders and in markets.</P>
      <P>The five certifications  refer  to verifying  certification documents, checking
that shipments are marked with detailed product information, opening a high
percentage of cartons of imported beef to check the product, conducting food
safety tests, and being able to get information on suspected problem products
immediately, according to DOH officials.</P>
      <P>Ma's decision to meet with the legislative speaker came after National Security
Council Secretary-General Su Chi urged lawmakers and the public a day earlier
not to demand a re-opening of the beef talks with the United States, warning
that reneging on an agreement to lift a ban on the imports would hurt relations.</P>
      <P>The government agreed to lift a ban on imports of U.S. bone-in beef, offal and
ground beef Nov. 2, based on a protocol that it signed with the U.S. in October,
leading to widespread criticism and concern about public health safety due to
fears of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Su said the public should take into account Taiwan's limited role in the
international community when considering how to approach the issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs the support of the United States, its biggest ally, in its bids to
participate in international organizations. If it violates the import protocol,
it is likely that the U.S. will hold back its support for the country, Su said.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy Chin-tien Yang said that same day that Taiwan should
not break its promise after signing an international agreement, as doing so will
undermine its international credibility.</P>
      <P>"As a responsible member of the international community... Taiwan should
categorically not renege on its promise after signing a deal," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang said
that over half of the KMT lawmakers would support an amendment version authored
by KMT Legislator Daniel Y.J. Huang, which stipulates that ground beef, beef
offal and four other categories of beef products should be barred from import if
the supplying country "has been a mad cow disease affected area."</P>
      <P>Ruling and opposition lawmakers have proposed their own versions of the draft
amendments to the Act Governing Food Sanitation in the face of growing pressure
from the public and could reach a consensus Dec. 29.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan might face U.S. retaliation whatever version of the amendment the
legislature decides to propose," Su warned.</P>

      <P>A new railway station near completion in the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP)
is the first to be designed based on the concept of generating solar energy and

the Tainan County government said Friday.</P>
      <P>When the railway station becomes operational in April next year, it will be able
to generate up to 16.1 kilowatts of electricity each day and save an equivalent
of 84 tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-

      <P>The station will generate solar power through solar panels and thin-film solar
cells that have already been installed on the station's roof and on top of the

      <P>The electricity generated will be sent to Taiwan Power Company's grid rather
than used directly to power the train station.</P>
      <P>The solar power-generating railway station, expected to be completed next month

      <P>China's chief negotiator with Taiwan left Taiwan Friday after wrapping up a
five-day visit during which three cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation agreements on
technical issues were signed but differences between the two sides also emerged.</P>
      <P>Shortly before his departure, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , met briefly with
the press at The Lalu hotel in Nantou County where he had stayed overnight to
express his gratitude for the "understanding and concern" shown by Taiwan's
people toward his delegation.</P>
      <P>He said he was also very thankful for the efforts made by police in maintaining
order during his stay in Taiwan, which allowed his talks with his Taipei
counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, to
proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed  concern  over the condition  of Chen Chu-hsiang, a Taichung
police officer who was injured Wednesday when trying to stop protesters from
launching firecrackers  in the direction of the Windsor Hotel where the ARATS
delegation was staying.</P>
      <P>Lastly, the negotiator voiced his appreciation for the active involvement of the
media to make information about the Chiang-Chen talks known to the public.</P>
      <P>He also invited Taiwan journalists to visit China more often to help promote
cross-strait journalistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chiang said that although he felt some regret that the signing of
an agreement aimed at avoiding double taxation was postponed because of
technical problems, his latest talks with Chen nevertheless marked the
completion of yet another "historic mission" by the two sides.</P>
      <P>The semi-annual meeting, which took place Tuesday in Taichung, was the fourth of
its kind between Chiang and Chen since June 2008.</P>
      <P>Besides  signing  agreements  on fishing  crew cooperation, agricultural
quarantine inspection, and industrial product standards, inspection and
certification, the two top negotiators also agreed to put intellectual property
rights protection and the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) on the agenda of their next meeting.</P>
      <P>After the talks, Chen was shown around central Taiwan, including a tour to the
popular tourist attraction of Sun Moon Lake in Nantou County.</P>
      <P>Chen's  visit,  however,  drew  a series  of protests  by pro-independence
organizations, led by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, and other
civic groups that oppose China's violations of human rights, including the Falun
Gong spiritual group that is outlawed in China.</P>
      <P>Chants of "stop the persecution of Falun Gong" and "Taiwan, China, one country
on each side" were still heard when Chen left The Lalu in a limousine to head to
Taichung Airport to catch a flight back to Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the  journey  to the  airport,  however,  hundreds  of pro-unification
activists lined up along the road to bid farewell to Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four days after a peaceful massive protest against the top Beijing negotiator's
visit to Taiwan, a bloody incident took place, in which pro-independence
activists pushed a police officer off a vehicle as he tried to stop them from
launching fireworks in the direction of the hotel where Chinese envoy Chen
Yunlin was staying.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was quick to clarify that none
of the protesters aboard the vehicle were its members while expressing
willingness to shoulder responsibility for the incident.</P>
      <P>The DPP also did not forget to remind the public that the clash was an isolated
case and the themes and appeals championed by the activists should not be
overlooked simply because of the unexpected incident.</P>
      <P>We think it's time for the DPP to face up squarely to the fact that it cannot
delink itself with radical pro-independence advocates, or so-called deep-green
voters.</P>
      <P>The DPP has grown from a rabble-rousing political force into a mature party with
eight years of governing experience, and it should lead deep-green or pro-
independence extremists to transform and grow. Otherwise, its chances of staging
a comeback will be slim.</P>
      <P>We also would like to ask deep-green groups if it is necessary for them to
repeatedly try to draw attention by instigating conflict.</P>
      <P>The protester who allegedly pushed the injured police officer off the vehicle
said after being released on bail that he will suffer the consequences if found
guilty, but he stressed he did nothing wrong.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a country where freedom of speech is well protected. Pro-independence
activists are free to express their views and goals, but they are not allowed to
advocate their cause at the expense of others.</P>
      <P>If deep-green advocates cannot learn to express their political views in a
rational, peaceful manner and learn to respect those who hold different
political beliefs and visions, their image will never improve.</P>

      <P>Costco Wholesale Corp. will set up a Taiwan logistics and distribution center in
Taoyuan County at the end of next year, a move expected to significantly cut its
cost of distribution, which is currently being outsourced, a county official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>After factoring  in the bright prospects  for the Taoyuan Aerotropolis
development project and the northern county's favorable geographic location,
Costco decided to set up the center there to facilitate the distribution of
products to its various branches around Taiwan, according to the official from
the county's Economic Development Department.</P>
      <P>Costco, the largest membership warehouse club chain in the United States,
expects to invest NT$800 million (US$24.81 million) in the center and two new
big box outlets in northern and southern Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>This was the first large-scale investment project in the county to be announced
since Magistrate John Chih-yang Wu assumed his post earlier this month, and the
economic development official said it should help stimulate the development of
related industries.</P>
      <P>Ahmen Lee, Costco Taiwan's regional marketing manager, confirmed the project
earlier Friday and said Costco decided to locate the center in Taoyuan because
it is a very important market in Taiwan and home of Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>
      <P>The planned logistics center, to cover an estimated 49,600 square meters, will
be located in Dayuan Township.</P>
      <P>The two Costco branches to be set up in the county at yet-to-be finalized
locations will allow local Costco members to shop only a short distance from
their homes, rather than needing to travel to Costco outlets in Taipei or
Hsinchu as they do now, Lee added.</P>

      <P>More Taiwanese citizens have petitioned for constitutional interpretations over
the past 10 years, indicating that Taiwanese people have grown increasingly

      <P>Of those petitions, 76 percent or 130 petitions were filed by Taiwanese people.</P>

abnormal housing price increases.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, major governments around the world and their central banks

expanding government  spending and injecting capital into the banking system.</P>
      <P>The measures, however, should ultimately come to an end because maintaining a

excessive fiscal expansion will make it hard for countries around the world to

      <P>Australia has raised its interest rates three times since October, and the U.S.
Federal Reserve also announced last week it will end most of its emergency
support measures by Feb. 1, 2010, because the economic recovery has gathered
momentum.</P>
      <P>Those moves indicate that the time may have come for countries around  the
world,  including  Taiwan,  to  review  various recession-fighting measures
adopted over the past year.</P>
      <P>We suggest that our central bank refer to trends in private sector borrowing in
choosing an opportune time to adjust its monetary policy.</P>

      <P>A local finance expert called on the government Friday to work to harmonize the
country's financial regulations to prevent arbitrage between markets.</P>
      <P>Arbitrage occurs when investors make a simultaneous purchase or sale in two
separate financial markets in order to profit from a price difference between
them.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Tung-hao, a professor at National Chengchi University's
Department of Money and Banking, the recent sale of Nan Shan Life Insurance and
the financial woes of Kuo Hua Life Insurance are two examples which show that
Taiwan needs to improve its regulations of the insurance sector, although the
country is very experienced in regulating banks and financial holdings
companies.</P>
      <P>Filling the regulatory gaps existing between the insurance and banking sectors
is essential to ensuring fair competition and preventing speculators from taking
advantage of the differences in pursuit of risk-free profits, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee was speaking in a seminar on the status and outlook of the financial
industry in the post-financial crisis period. The seminar was held by the Taiwan

      <P>Closer economic and trade ties with China have not helped improve Taiwan's
economy or people's lives but instead resulted in an unequitable distribution of
the economic benefits, a former chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hung Chi-chang,  who chaired the SEF while the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) was in power, said the lack of apparent benefits from closer ties
has led many people to feel that cross-strait development has progressed too
quickly, and he urged the ruling Kuomintang to address the public's misgivings.</P>
      <P>Hung said many people thought ties with China proceeded too slowly before
President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration in May 2008 and too fast afterwards.</P>
      <P>"The reason for such a perception is because the public does not think that
society has felt economic growth or a substantive improvement in their lives
through closer cross-strait ties, " Hung observed at a seminar on national
competitiveness at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>People also feel relations between Taiwan and China have grown too close because
their expectations have not been met, he said.</P>
      <P>That, coupled with the perception that the benefits accrued by large enterprises
from closer cross-strait ties have not filtered down to other layers of society,
have resulted in a concern over the unequal distribution of the economic gains.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan's international trade is already greater than the
country's gross domestic product,  and that Taiwan's OEM-oriented industries
should transform or upgrade their structures.</P>
      <P>Hung also said Taiwan's financial structure is not sound, with its tax revenues
accounting for only 13 percent of GDP, compared with 18 percent in the past.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the figure is about 35 percent in Scandinavian countries, which
often place high in international competitiveness rankings.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's outstanding government debt ratio also is approaching its legal
ceiling, which he said will be a potential threat to Taiwan's national
competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Taipei's city government will send a publicity team to boroughs and communities
to explain to the citizens what the central government's proposed economic
agreement with China is all about, Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Friday.</P>
      <P>In celebration of his third anniversary as mayor, Hau highlighted the importance
of the trade pact to Taiwan's capital, describing the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) as the key to Taipei City's future development.</P>
      <P>Hau explained that 81 percent of the city's employed population works in the
services sector. Of the service workers, 62 percent work in retail and wholesale
businesses, as well as the banking and insurance sector.</P>
      <P>Hau said he expects his city will be the top choice of Chinese enterprises that
decide to set up operations or offices in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei City is the best place for the establishment of a business talents
breeding center, the mayor touted.</P>
      <P>From this viewpoint, Hau said he believes Taiwan's signing of the trade pact
with China will benefit Taipei City, noting that his administration in the
coming year will focus on ECFA-related matters, including working to upgrade the
Neihu high-tech industrial services center into an Asia-Pacific economic and
trade services center.</P>
      <P>Other major policies include assisting the traditional industries in the city to
transform and upgrade themselves, and outlining a management mechanism to ensure
the safety of Chinese imports, Hau added.</P>
      <P>With the city's survey showing most citizens do not know what the content of the
cross-strait trade pact is, despite expressing opposition to its signing, the
mayor said he will strengthen efforts to address the concerns that the
industrial sectors and individual citizens have over the proposed agreement,
including organizing a round-the-city publicity tour.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu recognized her administration's achievements
in promoting the southern Taiwanese city's development in the past three years,
grading the team with a score of 85 points in a 1-100-point scoring system.</P>
      <P>Like Hau, Chen also celebrated her third year in office on Friday.</P>
      <P>In her address to the celebration ceremony, Chen said that if she wins a second
term as mayor next year, she will ensure balanced distribution of resources
between Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County after the two merge next December.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Low interest rate spread threatens banking industry: banking expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's interest rate spread, the world's lowest at around 1 percent, is
jeopardizing the profitability and operations of the banking industry, and any
sudden increase in bad loans could result in bank collapses, a banking industry
expert said at a seminar on the industry's outlook Friday.</P>
      <P>SinoPac Holdings Independent Director Sophia Cheng, a former managing director
and head of research of Merrill Lynch Taiwan, said the low interest rate spread
has not only undermined domestic banks' tolerance of risk but also affected
their return on equity (ROE) and share price performance.</P>
      <P>If there is another recession, even a mild one, the possible rise in non-
performing loans could bring down some domestic banks, she warned.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's interest rate spread of roughly 1 percent can only cover a bank's
expenses but is not enough to account for the average cost of non-performing
loans over the long term, explained Cheng, who is known as the "queen analyst of
the financial sector" by foreign securities houses.</P>
      <P>The interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield banks make
on loans and investments and the average rate institutions have to pay on
deposits and borrowing. It accounts for the major share of banks' income.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from Taiwan's central bank, the interest rate spread
among local banks was 1.18 percent in 2009 Q3, compared with 2 percent in the
same period in 2006.</P>
      <P>Although the global financial crisis did not create large-scale systematic risks
in Taiwan, it delivered a warning on banking industry operations, Cheng argued.
If no quick action is taken to improve the situation, the local banking industry
will be less able to deal with any economic crisis in the future.</P>
      <P>She also noted that low interest rates have put huge pressure on insurance
companies' investment spread -- the gap between their portfolio yield on
invested assets and the interest rate credited on insurance liabilities.</P>
      <P>Given that many countries ran up heavy debt to rescue financial markets during
the crisis, there is also only limited room for governments to issue more debt
in the future. So figuring out how to prevent future crises is particularly
important, she added.</P>
      <P>Despite fears over the country's low interest rate spreads, Taiwan's central
bank on Thursday left its key interest rates unchanged as expected, noting that
inflation is not a concern at the moment.</P>
      <P>The central bank has left its key rates unchanged since Feb. 19, after having
cut them by 237.5 basis points from September 2008 to try and stave off the
country's worst-ever recession.</P>

      <P>New investment in Taiwan's export processing zones in 2009 has surpassed the
annual target set despite the global economic downturn, the Export Processing
Zone (EPZ) Administration said Friday.</P>
      <P>Administrator Jerry J. R. Ou said in his year-end report that investment in
Taiwan's EPZs had reached NT$40.885 billion (US$1.265 billion) for the year as
of Dec. 21, surpassing the original target of NT$38 billion set by the EPZ
authority at the beginning of the year.</P>
      <P>Aside from the positive investment figures, Taiwan's EPZs are also taking steps
to improve their commercial environments, Ou said.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung EPZ, for example, hopes to transform itself into an LCD cluster
and is encouraging manufacturers in the zone to sign an agreement on technology
exchange and cooperation with the nonprofit Metal Industries Research &amp;
Development Centre to upgrade their technology.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to solve water supply problems and counter possible water shortages
in southern Taiwan, the Nantze EPZ has planned Taiwan's first experimental
industrial waste water recycling plant.</P>
      <P>"It's estimated that the plant will produce 1,800 tons of recycled water daily
by 2013," Ou said.</P>
      <P>The EPZs have also seen continuing signs of economic recovery. Ou said the
number of workers on unpaid leave in the EPZs dropped to 451 as of Dec. 21 from
the peak of 26,624 in February.</P>

      <P>Responding to a series of reports on the rundown state of major reservoirs in
central and southern Taiwan, the government called a "small-scale national
security meeting" last Saturday to plot action plans.</P>
      <P>The brainstorming session came to two conclusions: dredging silt and mud from
the reservoirs and advising individuals and corporations to save water.</P>
      <P>If the government believes such measures alone are sufficient to resolve
Taiwan's water issue, it has overlooked the gravity of the country's water woes.
In the long run, tens of billions of dollars spent on those measures will turn
out to be a waste of public funds.</P>
      <P>For years, the government has paid little attention to water conservation and
supply issues. Every time the country faces the threat of drought, the
government tends to map out temporary relief measures but has never tried to
plot forward-looking and long-term strategies that can resolve the increasingly
serious warter shortage problems once and for all.</P>
      <P>At best, the measures initiated at the recent "national security meeting" are
only aimed at combatting the threat of an imminent water shortage this spring.</P>
      <P>We are worried, however, that the government's passive and shortsighted working
style will miss any possible opportunity to truly resolve the issue and may even
worsen the situation.</P>
      <P>To address water supply problems, the government should preserve water resources
while reducing consumption and encouraging recycling.</P>
      <P>The government should study how to raise the utilization rate of each water
source, including preserving rainwater, and review current water distribution
ratios  among agricultural,  household  and industrial users and related
management systems. Equally important is water recycling to increase supplies.</P>
      <P>As most of Taiwan's reservoirs are located in mountain regions at medium
elevation, management of their catchment areas is extremely important to sustain
their life spans.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's military will help dredge the sand, mud and driftwood which Typhoon
Morakot brought down to southern Taiwan's Tsengwen Reservoir, Water Resources
Agency (WRA) Director-General Yang Wei-fu said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, some 1.2 billion cubic meters of sand and mud brought about
by the storm, which hit Taiwan in August, has built up in the upstream
mountainous area. Over 400 million cubic meters of the substance have washed
down to the downstream rivers, including Gaoping River, Laonung River and Chisan
River.</P>
      <P>The Laonung River has carried some 91 million cubic meters of the substance and
driftwood to the Tsengwen Reservoir, causing a water supply problem and leading
to a suspension of irrigation for the first harvest next year on farmland in
neighboring Chiayi and Tainan counties, Yang told a news conference.</P>
      <P>He was speaking  to reporters  following  a meeting of a cross-agency task force
which is in charge of the dredging plan.</P>
      <P>As part of the dredging project, about 65 million cubic meters of sand and mud
will be removed from the reservoir upon the project's completion, slated for
late November next year, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Sand and rocks dug out from the reservoir will be used for construction and for
filling in land reclaimed from the sea, WRA Deputy Director-General Wu Yueh-si
said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang presided over the meeting, which
was attended by officials from the Ministry of National Defense, the Council of
Agriculture, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the Ministry of
the Interior and the National Science Council, among others.</P>
      <P>In the long-term, the Executive Yuan has decided to earmark NT$34 billion
(US$1.05 billion) to dredge the Tsengwen Reservoir in Chiayi County and the
Nanhua Reservoir in Tainan County, Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said last
week.</P>
      <P>About NT$26 billion will be allocated to desilt the Tsengwen Reservoir over the
next six years and NT$8 billion to clean the Nanhua Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Tsengwen Reservoir is Taiwan's largest facility of the kind and has an effective
storage capacity of 596 million cubic meters.</P>
      <P>Since Typhoon Morakot, no rain has fallen in southern Taiwan and the two
reservoirs have not collected any more water, exacerbating the threat of water
shortages.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih warned that the water supply problem would
develop into a food crisis if the two reservoirs could not be effectively and
swiftly dredged, now that the rice cultivation for the coming spring harvest has
been halted for a lack of water for irrigation.</P>
      <P>More frequent of fallows will definitely push up rice prices in Taiwan, which
have surged this year, Su said.</P>

      <P>A new network system will replace the existing one on Taipei's Mass Rapid
Transit (MRT) Wenhu Line next year to significantly improve the glitch-plagued
system's stability, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Wenhu Line suffered frequent breakdowns soon after opening in July, but Hau
said the system has become more stable since network optimization was
implemented in August, and a gigabit Ethernet network will be installed to
further upgrade the metro line early next year.</P>
      <P>The existing system's performance achieved 99 percent reliability by November,
as promised  by the MRT line's main contractor Canada-based Bombardier Inc.</P>
      <P>But the city government hopes the mean kilometers between failures (MKBF) on the
Wenhu Line will reach only one failure per 500,000 kilometers, a reliability
level that the Taipei Metro's Muzha Line took six years to reach, according to
Hau.</P>
      <P>Despite the initial breakdowns, the Wenhu Line now serves an average of 170,000
passengers a day, Hau said, a 70 percent rise over the 100,000 passengers per
day that rode the Muzha Line, of which the Wenhu Line is an extension.</P>
      <P>The mayor praised the new line as mitigating traffic jams, boosting  housing
prices along its route and reducing  carbon emissions, as many passengers now
take the line instead of driving their own vehicles.</P>
      <P>The new subway line, which combines the Muzha section that was built by French
contractor Matra Co. in the 1990s and the new Neihu section built by Bombardier,
has experienced nearly 10 shutdowns since its inauguration.</P>
      <P>Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. Chairman Richard Chen promised at a city council
meeting Friday to conduct checks on 51 pairs of train cars used on the original
Muzha Line, which are being refitted to make them compatible with the Wenhu
Line, before putting them into service in the next one to two years.</P>
      <P>The refit work is scheduled to be completed by Feb. 14, 2010, after which
testing of the refurbished cars will begin.</P>
      <P>Hau also addressed the troubled Maokong Gondola, which had to halt service
because the foundation for one of its support pillars began eroding. The pillar
is now being moved but local residents still complain that the system may have a
negative impact on the local environment.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city government has commissioned the Chinese Union of Professional
Civil Engineer Associations to conduct an overall inspection of the gondola
line, with the results expected to be made public next month.</P>
      <P>The mayor reiterated there is no timetable for the resumption of the gondola's
operations.</P>

      <P>The idiom "all talk, no action" can best describe the latest round of high-level
talks between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Only three agreements, all of which cover less contentious technical issues,
were signed during the visit of China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin,
to Taichung Dec. 21-25. The far more important double taxation avoidance
agreement was not signed as scheduled for reasons not clearly identified.</P>
      <P>During the Chinese delegation's  stay,  Taiwanese officials carefully watched
whether Chen brought with him any good news on the proposed cross-strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) and whether China was likely to
accept Taiwan's terms.</P>
      <P>Chen brushed Taiwan's expectations, however, reminding Taiwan not to engage in
too much wishful thinking and not to harbor a "wait-rely-demand" mentality in
cross-strait engagements.</P>
      <P>Chen's statement might have been a preventive salvo aimed at telling Taiwan's
ruling and opposition camps not to expect too much of the ECFA talks, but it
also revealed China's growing arrogance and contempt toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>We need not be frustrated by his words, but we should wake up and act
confidently to revive our competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Over the past two decades, Taiwan has contributed much to China's economic
development  by supplying  capital and technical  and managerial talent.</P>
      <P>But because of our government's incompetence, we lost our superiority vis-a-vis
China economically.</P>
      <P>However, we still have plenty of capital. So long as we act in concert and with
resolve, our country still stands a good chance to restore its glory. We should
never lose our self-confidence.</P>

said on the same occasion that China's investment in Taiwan amounted to NT$1.19
billion.</P>
      <P>China has unilaterally benefited from Taiwan's huge capital infusion, while
providing little protection for Taiwanese investors. Quite a few Taiwanese
businessmen have fallen victim to fraud and disputes in China and lost
everything there. Only the proverb "what's gone can never come back" can reflect
their plight.</P>
      <P>Those who hold illusions about the possible gains from China's investment should
learn from those lessons. And that's why Taiwanese people have become ever more
wary about the prospects of signing a proposed cross-strait  economic

controls on credit for investors who want to buy second houses in Taiwan's three

      <P>The Commercial Times reported Friday that the bank had decided to impose credit
controls on buyers of second houses in Taipei City and County, Taichung City's
seventh land consolidation area, and the area around Kaohsiung City's Museum of
Fine Arts.</P>
      <P>The newspaper cited Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan as saying that the price
rises focused mainly on those three areas, and that banks could impose selective
credit controls to limit loans to any person who wants to buy a house not
occupied by its owner in the overheated districts.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Friday, the central bank acknowledged that Perng had
noted the rising property prices in the three areas while also pointing to
stable or even declining prices in other areas, but it denied that he said
anything related to credit controls.</P>

reciprocity, equality and dignity, and the growing participation of officials
from both sides in the talks accentuates the fact that both Taiwan and China
cannot deny each other's existence, " Lai said while meeting Taiwan's
negotiating team with China.</P>
      <P>The team, led by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), concluded the fourth round of cross-strait talks with its Chinese
counterpart,  the delegation headed by President Chen Yunlin of the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , in the
central Taiwan city of Taichung Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 12 agreements, including three from the latest Taichung talks, have
been forged between Taiwan and China since the first round of talks in June 2008
to increase economic cooperation, Lai added.</P>
      <P>"All the talks have been conducted with the aim of safeguarding national
sovereignty, promoting industrial development and taking care of people's lives,
" Lai said to counter opposition arguments that the talks have hampered Taiwan's
sovereignty and actually endangered some local industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>Spokeswoman Hsiao Bi-khim of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said her party has not been against dialogue between Taiwan and China to
establish a framework for peace and stability, but rather it has insisted that
the talks have to be held transparently and openly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA to consider alternative plans for DRAM restructuring</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will seriously consider alternative
plans to help Taiwan's ailing DRAM sector if the Legislative  Yuan decides  to
reject  the government's plan to restructure the industry, an MOEA official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang said that with DRAM prices on the rebound,
there will be more time for the ministry to consider more sophisticated ways to
restructure the industry.</P>
      <P>"We will not do it in hurry," he added.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee adopted a resolution in November
asking  the MOEA to suspend  its DRAM  industry restructuring plan and withdraw
its proposed investment in the state-backed Taiwan Innovation Memory Co. (TIMC),
which was supposed to be the centerpiece of the plan.</P>
      <P>Although the ministry has been lobbying lawmakers not to scuttle the plan, Shih
said it will propose alternative plans if another resolution opposing the
restructuring plan is passed by the full Legislative Yuan by the end of the
current session on Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has conditionally approved TIMC's request for NT$8.1 billion
in funding from the National Development Fund (NDF) , but legislators across the
political spectrum believe that the Fund should not invest in TIMC because DRAM
prices have recovered, making it pointless to proceed with the original plan.</P>
      <P>The government had hoped that TIMC would secure badly needed core technologies
and bring together some of the sectors' big players, including Powerchip
Semiconductor, ProMOS Technologies, and Rexchip Electronics, to spur the
consolidation of the fragmented industry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's DRAM industry has been bleeding money over the past two years because
of overcapacity and a slump in demand. It boasts six of the world's top 10 DRAM
manufacturers but holds a global market share of only 15 percent.</P>

      <P>China's 11-year sentence of leading dissident Liu Xiaobo on Friday for
subversion serves as a test of the Chinese government's approach to dealing with
human rights, according to Taiwan's top government agency for China affairs.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun said human rights are
universal values and that all governments around the world should endeavor to
ensure that their citizens enjoy their human rights.</P>
      <P>Earlier,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP) spokeswoman Hsiao
Bi-khim accused President Ma Ying-jeou, who during his term as Taipei mayor
championed the rights of Tiananmen Incident protesters, of staying silent about

      <P>Lawmakers from ruling and opposition camps have decided to discuss an amendment
next week that would allow U.S. bone-in beef products  to enter Taiwan without
disputes,  the legislative caucus whip of the governing Kuomintang (KMT) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang  said KMT legislators  and their opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) peers are slated to deal with the amendment to the Act
Governing Food Sanitation that has been stalled for nearly two months on Dec.
29.</P>
      <P>They hope to provide a sound legal basis for the executive branch's disputed
decision in late October to allow bone-in beef to be imported from the United
States.</P>
      <P>Lu said versions submitted  by the two parties have many similarities, but
further discussions may be needed to bridge the differences. He pointed out that
the KMT will never give way to the DPP's request that "U.S. bone-in beef
products will be permitted to enter Taiwan only after their bones are removed in
advance."</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the KMT version would note the principle of "offshore
inspection guidelines" and would require the government to send officials to
check every batch of bone-in beef products in the United States before being
shipped to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the DPP's version is selected, the KMT will add a note explaining that the
legislation's logic falls in line with the requirements set by the World
Organization for Animal Health, which gives the administration a basis for
discussing the issue with the U.S., he said.</P>
      <P>Once an amendment is passed, Lu wondered "whether someone in the government
should be held politically accountable" for all the furor that has arisen over
the issue in the past two months.</P>
      <P>"It is important to review the entire process of the government's poor handling
of the matter, even if an amendment to the Act Governing Food Sanitation,
whether the KMT version or the DPP version, clears the Legislative Yuan," he
argued.</P>
      <P>The lack of advanced notice to the legislature of its decision to allow U.S.
bone-in beef into Taiwan has affected related legislation and also delayed the
screening of the central government's budget, he said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health's announcement Oct. 23 that bone-in beef
and other previously banned beef products would be allowed into Taiwan starting
Nov. 10 provoked an outcry led by the DPP, and it demanded that the Executive
Yuan reopen negotiations with the United States on the protocol covering U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, secretary-general of the National Security Council, has ruled out the
possibility of a new round of beef talks on the grounds that doing so will
jeopardize two-way relations.</P>

does, except perhaps in archery. But even then, when he wins  he  courteously
makes  his  bow before he advances to take his place  among  the  winners;  and,
when he has lost, he walks down and drinks his cup of forfeit. Thus, even in
this case of competition, he shows himself to be a gentleman."</TEXT>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has reaffirmed his commitment to protecting the well-
being of local farmers, saying that Taiwan will not open its doors wider to
Chinese agricultural products after a trade pact between the two sides is
signed.</P>
      <P>Instead, the government will seek to expand market access for Taiwanese
agricultural products in China, Ma told Huang Hsien-yao, chief of Jhengbei
village in Minsyong township, Chiayi County, during a recent visit to the
agricultural village.</P>
      <P>The dialogue between Ma and Huang was presented in the latest issue of the
president's weekly online video journal, released Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the conversation, Huang asked Ma why underground radio stations often report
that the proposed Taiwan-China  economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
is intended to "sell out Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma responded by pointing out that during the run-up to the 2008 presidential
election, these underground radio stations also claimed that "if Ma Ying-jeou
gets elected, the monthly NT$6,000 allowance for old farmers will be gone," a
claim later proved to be utterly false.</P>
      <P>He noted that of the total of 1,415 Chinese agricultural products that have been
allowed access to Taiwan, none were liberalized during his term. The upcoming
ECFA talks with China will not touch upon issues concerning further
liberalization of Taiwan's market toward agricultural products from China, he
added.</P>
      <P>"So all farmers please rest assured that as president, Ma Ying-jeou will
definitely uphold your interests and will never sell out Taiwan," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president also noted that the launch of direct shipping links across the
Taiwan Strait after his inauguration has helped expedite the export of Taiwanese
fruit and vegetables to China.</P>
      <P>While it used to take eight days for such exports to reach Shanghai from
Keelung, it now takes only four days, he said.</P>

      <P>Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi divorced his wife after being elected and
announced three days after the divorce that he was naming his "ex-wife" deputy
magistrate. The Ministry of the Interior ruled Dec. 22 that the divorce is fake

is subject to penalty by the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Fu canceled the appointment immediately after the ruling, ending the political
farce but marking a negative lesson in Taiwan's democratic development.</P>
      <P>Anyone with good observation can see that the incident was motivated by
political calculation on the part of Fu, who was sentenced to four years in
prison for illegal trading by the Taiwan High Court June 11, 2009. He intended
to maintain his magistrate seat by having his wife as acting magistrate when he
was inside.</P>
      <P>The case of Fu, a political figure who could have used the scheme for the
purpose of keeping his public post, reflects how tempting is political power.</P>
      <P>Fu had claimed that by naming his spouse as deputy he was only following the
example of former Taitung Magistrate Wu chun-li. The grave practice of nepotism
in politics has been an unforgivable mistake.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will put more effort into managing state-owned
shares and land to increase government revenue, a ministry official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>National Treasury Agency Director-General Hwang Ding-fang said the MOF has
formed  a team to supervise  the management  of government-owned shares, with
the aim of more effectively managing them, strengthening corporate performance
and competitiveness and increasing the income thereof for the government.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, the government holds a total of 88.1 billion state shares
worth NT$2.9 trillion, of which 20.8 billion, worth about NT$600 billion, are
held by the MOF.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih has asked the MOF to focus more on activating national
assets, saying that the government, with the large amount of land and shares in
its hands, is "complaining about being poor while sitting on a golden chair," an
MOF official quoted Wu as saying.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the ministry has also formed a team to better manage national land.
Citing Taipei 101 as an example, he said the government provided the land for
private investors to construct the building, which not only brought more income
and tax revenue, but also created 3,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>In addition, with outstanding savings deposits of NT$27 trillion and lending of
NT$20 trillion, there is about NT$7 trillion held by banks, said Hwang, adding
that this money should be invested in public construction projects, which would
create a win-win situation for the government and the public.</P>

of villagers, will organize the party at the village on New Year's Eve.</P>
      <P>"We hope to help the survivors and their families wave goodbye to the past
sorrow and embrace a better new year in a warm atmosphere, " she said, adding
that "there will be no celebrities or fireworks, but we will stage a concert, a
barbecue and a night campfire for them."</P>
      <P>Huang said she will also donate a batch of children's books she has collected
from the public to the children of the village. "We hope Siaolin's children can
find consolation and a new lease on live from these books and can welcome the
new year with confidence and strength, " she added.</P>
      <P>More than 600 people in Siaolin were buried alive in a landslide triggered by
precipitation brought by Typhoon Morakot, making the village the hardest-hit
area of the disaster.</P>

      <P>Anyone with good observation can see that the incident was motivated by

prison for illegal trading by the Taiwan High Court June 11, 2009. He intended
to maintain his magistrate seat by having his wife as acting magistrate when he
was inside.</P>
      <P>The case of Fu, a political figure who could have used the scheme for the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite signs showing that the unemployment situation has stabilized, many job
seekers still see civil service jobs as their top choice, with more than 100,000
people registering to take the civil service examination for local government
employees -- the highest number in recorded history.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Examination (MOE) , the number of people
registering for the civil service special examination for local government
employees this year, which began Saturday and was scheduled to take place over
three days, totaled 107,096, up 22,559 from the previous year.</P>
      <P>The acceptance rate for this year is estimated at around 2.3 percent, compared
to 3.8 percent in 2008 and 5 percent in 2007, according to ministry statistics.</P>
      <P>In addition to the examinations for local government employees, the number of
people registering for senior and junior examinations for civil servants earlier
this year also set the highest record in 10 years at 122,597, with an acceptance
rate of 4.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Although it is getting more difficult to land a government job, finding a way to
strengthen the quality of government employees has become a hot topic among
politicians recently.</P>
      <P>Examination Yuan President Kuan Chung said Saturday that it is necessary to
reform the existing performance appraisal system for government employees so
that people who have outstanding performance can be properly rewarded and those
with unsatisfactory ones can be punished.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 24, Control Yuan President Wang Chien-shien said while addressing a
group of students from Taipei First Girls' High School who were visiting the
Control Yuan that many government employees are idiots who can only talk about
problems but cannot solve them.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that government employees who are unable to solve problems need
to resign.</P>
      <P>Responding to Wang's remarks the following day, Premier Wu Den-yih said that no-
one is perfect and that the government just needs to find people's talent and
capabilities and use them well.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as the workload of government employees has increased two-to-three-
fold, the examination ministry plans to provide more details for government job
applicants to avoid some unrealistic expectations of their jobs, an MOE official
said.</P>
      <P>As the economy continues to recover, Taiwan's jobless rate dropped for a third
consecutive month in November to 5.86 percent -- the first time in more than
five months it had dropped below 6 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Price cuts for extra cross-strait flights over Lunar New Year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Discounts of at least 10 percent will be offered for extra flights being
scheduled on cross-Taiwan Strait routes for the coming Lunar New Year holiday,
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Lee Lung-wen said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the CAA and Taiwan-based carriers have agreed that the price
of additional cross-strait flights during the Lunar New Year period from Jan. 3
to Feb. 28 -- the first new year holiday since the two sides started regular
flight services in July -- will be slashed by at least 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Price cuts for popular cross-strait routes with restricted flight numbers will
be smaller, while the range for other routes, such as Taiwan/Nanjing and
Taiwan/Hangzhou could be larger, Lee added.</P>
      <P>The CAA announced Dec. 25 that 176 flights will be added to four popular cross-
strait routes from Taiwan to Shanghai,  Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou during
the period, meaning that each side will be able to offer an additional 88
flights -- 32 flights from Taiwan to Shanghai, 20 flights from Taiwan to
Beijing, 20 flights from Taiwan to Guangzhou and 16 flights from Taiwan to
Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>With the 176 flights added to their 496 normal flights on the four routes, Lee
predicted that 403,200 seats will be available to transport passengers cross the
strait during the Lunar New Year period.</P>
      <P>Flight schedules and quotas for additional flights allocated to each carrier
will be announced next week, while the booking for seat reservations is expected
to kick off in late January, he added.</P>
      <P>CAA officials, however, warned the public that the schedule for flights
temporarily added to meet strong travel demand is usually inconvenient for
passengers, either early morning or late at night.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, business sources said ticket prices for popular routes on New Year
holidays have continued to surge due to the limited increase in flight numbers
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>For instance, they noted, a round-trip ticket between Taiwan and Shanghai during
the Lunar New Year period stands at a high of around NT$25,000 (US$800), while a
two-way Taiwan-Guangzhou ticket will cost around NT$20,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislature disputes fairness of financial reform review</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has challenged the fairness of a Cabinet review of a second
phase of financial reform and the propriety of officials involved in the
controversial reform continuing to hold important positions.</P>
      <P>In particular, the review fails to address suspicions that the reforms were
promoted in favor of private business groups and that the government underpriced
state assets, the legislature stated in a recently released report.</P>
      <P>The second round of financial reforms was launched by the administration of
former President Chen Shui-bian in October 2004. One of the main objectives was
to halve the number of publicly owned banks to six by promoting mergers with
private banks.</P>
      <P>Because allegations of irregularities surrounding the reforms became rife, the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou formed a panel to review the reforms in
August 2008, three months after Ma's inauguration.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the review was released in January 2009.</P>
      <P>The legislature, however, questioned the qualifications of some of the panel
members, including then-Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung, Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen and Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan,
saying that their appointments to the panel involved obvious conflicts of
interest.</P>
      <P>For example, both Chiu and Chen were serving in the financial sector during the
financial reforms, while Perng already headed the Central Bank at that time and
was one of the officials overseeing the reforms.</P>
      <P>In addition, many officials who supervised the reforms were allowed to hold
important positions in financial agencies, the legislature said.</P>
      <P>They include former FSC Chairman Gordon Chen, who is now chairman of the Gretai
Securities Market, and Ding Kung-hwa, a former director-general of the FSC's
Securities and Futures Bureau who is now chairman of the Securities and Futures
Institute and a board director of the Financial Information Service Co. and the
Taiwan Power Company.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislature demanded that the FSC and the Ministry of Finance
investigate the responsibilities of officials implicated in major financial
scandals and work out solutions to the problems.</P>
      <P>The legislature said that if the two agencies fail to do so, it will request the
Control Yuan and the Ministry of Audit to look into the possibility that they
have been derelict in their duties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on Beijing Saturday to demonstrate the "greatest
possible tolerance" towards its dissidents.</P>
      <P>"The pursuit of democracy and human rights has always been my top priority
throughout my political career, and both Taiwan and China, as signatories to the
International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic and
Cultural Rights, should have the 'greatest possible tolerance' of those who
express their opinions in a peaceful way, " Ma said in the wake of the
sentencing to 11 years in prison of renowned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo by a
Beijing court the previous day.</P>
      <P>Liu, a co-author of "Charter 08, " which calls for an end to Communist  Party
of China  rule  and  the implementation  of constitutional democracy in China,
was detained just before it was released last December. More than 300 people,
including some of China's top intellectuals, have signed the charter.</P>
      <P>Liu's 11-year sentence on charges of "inciting subversion of state power," a
unique term used by China to prosecute dissenters, is the longest that Beijing
has ever given to any dissident, and many political observers see it as a signal
that China will start dealing even more harshly with dissenters in its efforts
to "maintain social stability."</P>
      <P>A day  earlier,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party spokeswoman Hsiao
Bi-khim accused Ma, who during his term as Taipei mayor championed the rights of
Tiananmen Massacre protesters, of staying silent about China's gross violations
of human rights since taking office.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MSC), the agency in charge of China affairs,
said that same day that Liu's sentence serves as a test of the Chinese
government's approach to dealing with human rights.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun said human rights are universal values and that
all governments around the world should endeavor to ensure that their citizens
enjoy their human rights.</P>

      <P>A series of meetings on the development of commerce have been held around the
island over the past few weeks, and apparently, businesses are very concerned
about the issue judging from the large turnouts. Upon the conclusion of the
meetings, three visions and seven goals for Taiwan's commerce-related service
sectors were announced.</P>
      <P>While the three visions -- making Taiwan a logistics headquarters for global
franchises, an Asian-Pacific operational center for Chinese-run e-commerce
businesses and a distribution base in the Asian Pacific region -- cannot be
realized without the support of coordinated government policies to promote
cross-border operations, the other goals, including boosting revenues of
e-commerce, raising research and development investments, and creating 320,000
new jobs in the next three years, might be even more difficult to attain.</P>
      <P>The job target of 320,000 new jobs in the commerce-related service sectors is
almost a fantasy. Between 2005 and 2008 when the nation's economic environment
was relatively prosperous, the retail, transportation and inventory, as well as
hotel and restaurant businesses, created 100,000 new jobs, increasing employment
from 2.77 million to 2.87 million.</P>
      <P>Employment in the three sectors accounted for 28.4 percent of the nation's
overall employed population, which is higher than the average of 25 percent in
developed countries. In other words, the job market of Taiwan's commerce-related
service sectors is almost saturated.</P>
      <P>In the past, large numbers of newly employed were found in commerce- related
service businesses, which mostly remained small scale operations. In the future,
more opportunities will be available overseas, mostly in the innovation
businesses.</P>
      <P>Future development of the commerce-related service sectors should be oriented
toward improvement of efficiency and exploration of overseas opportunities,
instead of recruiting large numbers of workers with a low threshold. As for
creating jobs, the government should take into consideration the structure of
the service sector and develop more knowledge-related service businesses such as
medical care and nursing establishments.</P>

      <P>will publish Monday the business indicator light signals for November. While the
base data of the same month of last year was very low, the light signal of
monitoring indicators based on percentage changes over a one-year span might be
an optimistic yellow-red or even red. It is not that Taiwan's economic prospects
have rebounded robustly but rather that the calculation method used has led to
this result. Apparently, some revisions to the formula are needed.</P>
      <P>The component indicators include monetary aggregates M1B, direct and indirect
finance, stock price index, industrial production index, non-agricultural
employment, customs-cleared exports, imports of machinery and electrical
equipment,  manufacturing  sales,  and wholesale,  retail and food services
sales. Each of the nine components is graded from one to five points, with the
light signal for a total score of below 16 points as blue (sluggish) , between
17 and 22 as yellow-blue (transitional) , between 23 and 31 as green (stable),
between 32 and 37 as yellow-red (transitional), and between 38 and 45 as red
(overheated).</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the CEPD show that in October, the total score of
component indicators was 28, which is not far from yellow-red.</P>
      <P>The appearance of yellow-red and red recently could be attributed to the frigid
economic prospects for the past year and the formula based upon year-on-year
changes.</P>
      <P>The CEPD should consider revising the formula in view of the constantly changing
economic prospects.</P>
      <P>Many  countries  have  adopted  the  system  based  upon season-on-season or
even month-on-month changes. As more and more rapidly changing economic
prospects are expected, we suggest that the CEPD study the feasibility of
adopting a month-on-month formula so that the light signal can reflect the
economic expansion or shrinkage more accurately.</P>

      <P>, gave a press conference Friday for the first time to explain the dilemma
Taiwan is facing. Comparing Taiwan's situation as sinking in a whirlpool along
with three strong powers -- the United States, Japan and China -- Su said Taiwan
is incapable of creating any change.</P>
      <P>While the strategy for Taiwan is "to reconcile with China, befriend Japan and
cling to the United States, " he said, "we cannot risk breaking up with any one
of them, otherwise probably the other two will snub us."</P>
      <P>From a pragmatic point of view, Su's comments were not improper. In an age of
globalization, there is no need to find fault with other countries.</P>
      <P>Why is President Ma Ying-jeou's administration  giving the impression that it
has only attended to relations with China and has gradually moved away from
Japan and the U.S.? Probably, Taiwan's relations with China have been poor over

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang held a heated discussion with
scholars Saturday about the proposed economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, in which he said Taiwan will keep seeking free trade
agreements (FTAs) with other nations while continuing to negotiate with China.</P>
      <P>At a seminar on the ECFA held by the student union of National Taiwan
University, Shih was confronted by scholars several times but still insisted on
the urgency of signing the trade agreements, as the government is stepping up
its campaign to convince a skeptical public to support the pact.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih said that since China has expressed
objections about Taiwan's signing of FTAs with other countries, the government
might have trouble protecting the country's economic development and democracy
in the future.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he strongly advised the government to make sure China will not oppose
Taiwan signing FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>The government needs to tell Beijing loud and clear that it will not sign the
ECFA with China if it continues to intervene in Taiwan's signing of FTAs, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested that the government should add a clause to the ECFA stating
that Taiwan's signing of FTAs with the United States, Japan, the European Union
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations should not be affected once the
ECFA is signed with China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shih said the theory that signing free trade agreements will lower
wages is not necessarily the reality.</P>
      <P>Citing the U.S. as an example, Shih said the U.S.-Mexico FTA has not lowered the
average wage in the U.S., so he asked those opposing the ECFA not to believe the
theory.</P>
      <P>Chen responded that he was surprised that Shih, with his science background,
would have made such remarks. He said that once Taiwan has closer economic ties
with China, the power of dragging down the average wage in Taiwan will
definitely be stronger.</P>
      <P>Although Chen said there is a point of view that Taiwan can make China become
its manufacturing  base --  by utilizing China's advantages of cheap labor and
resources -- he expressed concern that this would make Taiwan more reliant on
China.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese investment in the Philippines in 2009 more than doubled to hit over
US$113 million, despite the global economic downturn, according to a report by
the Taipei-based Manila Economic &amp; Cultural Office (MEC0).</P>
      <P>Ancku Taichung Corp. topped the list with a US$60 million electric arc furnace
project being built in Batangas Province, followed by a US$40 million investment
plan by TECO Industrial Motors &amp; Applications Group, which produces UMID
cards -- multi-purpose identification cards used in the Philippines' social
service system -- MECO reported.</P>
      <P>The two companies' combined investment has far surpassed the 2008 figure of all
investment from Taiwan, which totaled US$45.7 million, MECO said.</P>
      <P>Dita Angara-Mathay, MECO's director of commercial affairs, said Ancku is
planning further investment of another US$100 million to build a blast furnace
in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>To lure greater investment from Taiwan, four delegations from the Philippines
sponsored investment seminars and took part in trade fairs in Taiwan last year,
in search of more trade and investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Mathay predicted that Taiwanese investment will again double in 2010, with more
than 50 percent going to the power sector.</P>
      <P>Other Taiwanese firms that have invested in the Philippines this year include
China Bond International Services for iron-ore mining in Aparri, worth US$5
million, as well as a US$2 million coal mining project by Shyi Chien Co. Ltd. in
Sorsogon Province and a US$2 million plywood manufacturing plant by Tian Yuan
Co. Ltd. in Butuan Province.</P>
      <P>According to Mathay, a Taiwanese footwear group is scheduled to visit the
Philippines in the first half of 2010 to study the feasibility of setting up an
operation in Bataan Province.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese footwear maker are considering Bataan because of the availability
of huge tracts of property and its proximity to Subic and Clark free port zones,
Mathay said, adding that there is still a big possibility that a footwear
cluster will be set up by Taiwan businessmen in the Philippines, depending on
the willingness of the Philippine government to provide subsidies for land
leases.</P>

      <P>, gave a press conference Friday for the first time to explain the dilemma
Taiwan is facing. Comparing Taiwan's situation as sinking in a whirlpool along
with three strong powers -- the United States, Japan and China -- Su said Taiwan
is incapable of creating any change.</P>
      <P>While the strategy for Taiwan is "to reconcile with China, befriend Japan and
cling to the United States, " he said, "we cannot risk breaking up with any one
of them, otherwise probably the other two will snub us."</P>
      <P>From a pragmatic point of view, Su's comments were not improper. In an age of
globalization, there is no need to find fault with other countries.</P>
      <P>Why is President Ma Ying-jeou's administration  giving the impression that it
has only attended to relations with China and has gradually moved away from
Japan and the U.S.? Probably, Taiwan's relations with China have been poor over
the last 10 years, and the Ma administration, while doubling its efforts to seek

      <P>patients has increased over the weekend as fewer people have accepted shots amid
mounting reports of side effects of the immunization.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue of public
doubts about the safety of H1N1 vaccine:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Amid doubts and concerns over the safety of H1N1 vaccine after a 7-year-old died
several weeks after being immunized, there has been resistance among the Taiwan
public against the inoculation drive.</P>
      <P>As a result of the resistance, the number of new influenza A(H1N1) infection
cases in Taiwan rose over the weekend, overturning a positive situation posted
last week in which the number dropped significantly since the vaccination
campaign was launched nationwide Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>The number of people vaccinated against H1N1 reached a single-day record of
560,000 in mid-December, a number that had plummeted to a mere 42,000 as of Dec.
25, according to the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The immunization drive proved its success in Taiwan between Nov. 21 and Nov. 23,
when no H1N1 hospitalized cases were recorded.</P>
      <P>This performance, however, was smashed Dec. 25 when five new cases were
reported, underlining that the resistance against the vaccination drive has
dragged down the entire H1N1-fighting effort.</P>
      <P>Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw warned
that with fewer than 20 percent of the people in the country immunized so far,
it will be a challenge for Taiwan to face a likelihood of a second wave of
influenza A(H1N1) , commonly known as swine flu, as colder weather approaches.
(Dec. 27, 2009)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Lee Ping-ing, a pediatrician with National Taiwan University Hospital, quoted
experiences in the United States and Mexico as suggesting that there are usually
two or three big outbreaks in any given epidemic.</P>
      <P>A second wave outbreak of H1N1 flu will be a sure thing in Taiwan as the winter
break approaches and air travel increases if the people continue to resist the
vaccination drive because of doubts and concerns, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee called for the public to "listen more closely to medical professionals" and
not to take the virus lightly. (Dec. 27, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Local health authorities are worried that people's doubts over the safety of the
H1N1 vaccine is having a negative effect on the nationwide vaccination campaign.</P>
      <P>Five new hospitalized cases were reported over the weekend, with two admitted to
intensive care units. None of the five new cases had been immunized.</P>
      <P>Even though more people have become resistant to accepting the HIN1 vaccine due
to an alleged fatality and some 400 people who have been vaccinated have
complained of serious symptoms, including high fever, health officials said
Sunday that all eight complaints probed under a vaccine injury compensation
program (VICP) were confirmed a day earlier to be unrelated to the HIN1
inoculation.</P>
      <P>Dozens of other complaints cases are being probed under the VICP.</P>

      <P>Concluding a round-the-island walk to promote their cause, referendum activists
claimed Saturday that mainstream opinion wants a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) be put to a national referendum.
Meanwhile, the government is stepping up publicity efforts to help the public
better understand the gist of the deal and the challenges the country could face
without such an all-encompassing trade accord with China.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: A 49-day, round-the-island walk to call for "the people to decide
on cross-strait agreements" ended Saturday at its starting point -- Lungshan
Temple in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Chen Li-kuei, convener of the journey initiated by former opposition Democratic
Progressive Party Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung, read a statement saying that putting a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China to a
national referendum has become mainstream opinion.</P>
      <P>The statement  blasted the administration  of President Ma Ying-jeou for being
arrogant, saying that "mounting public opposition to the signing of the ECFA and
continued slipping of the approval rating of the Ma administration has not
persuaded it to be on guard and to reflect humbly." (Dec. 27, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News: Ma recently visited a village chief in southern Taiwan to
speak on issues farmers are most concerned about, including the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsien-yao, chief of Jhengbei village in Minsyong township, Chiayi County,
said he told Ma that farmers will not oppose the ECFA as long as their
livelihoods are protected.</P>
      <P>Ma, who spoke mostly in Taiwanese throughout the nearly two-hour visit, pointed
out that he has not opened one single Chinese agricultural product to Taiwan
since his inauguration and that he "sells Taiwan fruit instead of selling out
Taiwan, " contrary to claims by some underground radio stations in the south.</P>
      <P>The upcoming ECFA talks with China will not touch upon issues concerning further
liberalization of Taiwan's market to agricultural products from China, Ma said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has selected 21 wetlands areas that are
expected to be listed as wetlands of national importance in February, bringing
the total number of nationally important wetlands to more than 100, an MOI
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The newly selected wetlands cover a total area of 20,000 hectares in 14 cities
and counties around Taiwan, according to the official, citing an initial
assessment report of national wetlands for 2009 released by the MOI's
Construction and Planning Agency.</P>
      <P>The new sites include one listed as world-class wetlands on the Changhua Coast,
10 listed as national-level wetlands in the Danshui River basin, Taoyuan
County's Hsutsuo Harbor, Nankunshen in Tainan County and various other areas,
and 17 of local importance in Hisnchu, Nantou, Pingtung and other cities or
counties, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In the agency's first assessment conducted in 2007, 75 sites were identified  as
qualifying  as wetlands of national importance, according to the official.</P>
      <P>This year, the MOI's wetlands evaluation panel selected the 28 sites as
nationally important wetlands from a number of wetland areas recommended by 36
civic groups, schools and public and private institutions, the official went on.</P>
      <P>The agency also made adjustments on the grades of the original 75 wetland sites.
For example, the Jhubei Lianhua Temple wetlands -- the habitat of several rare
aquatic carnivorous plants -- was proposed to be upgraded to a national-level
wetland site with the aim of strengthening habitat protection there, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The final assessment report will be made public Feb. 2, next year's World
Wetland Day, when a ceremony to present accreditation certificates will be held,
according to the official.</P>

      <P>The time has come for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to be more practical in
arranging their institutionalized high-level talks, known locally as the
"Chiang-Chen meetings, " in order to enhance their effects and avoid any snags.</P>
      <P>The failure of the two sides to sign a double taxation avoidance agreement at
the just-concluded fourth such meeting in Taichung signals that cross-strait
negotiations have entered a new stage that will require more dealmaking efforts
than previous rounds.</P>
      <P>In the past, the two-quasi-official intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- spent much time on formality details, including
meeting settings and venues, as they endeavored to create a good atmosphere for
cross-strait interaction after years of tension created by the previous
Democratic Progressive Party administration's pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>Such efforts can no longer be justified, as cross-strait talks have become more
issue- and substance-oriented, with more and more thorny issues involving
distribution of interests and benefits topping the agenda.</P>
      <P>Those issues can only be discussed in a sincere and frank manner with the
support of well-planned preparations. What matters is the delicate dealmaking
process rather than hollow pomp and trappings.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary agreement, the next meeting between SEF Chairman
Chiang Pin-kun and ARATS President Chen Yunlin will mainly deal with two issues
-- a much-anticipated cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) and cooperation in intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.</P>
      <P>Given the scope and complexity of the issues to be covered in the ECFA, the two
sides should consider whether they should still arrange the fifth Chiang-Chen
meeting in the first half of 2010 in line with the existing formality of holding
a high-level meeting once every six months.</P>
      <P>The next Chiang-Chen meeting should take place only when the two sides are ready
to cut the ECFA deal, which will cover wide-ranging cross-strait distribution of
interests and lay the groundwork for normalization of cross-strait trade and
economic relations.</P>
      <P>The image and framework of the Chiang-Chen talks could be at stake if the ECFA
deal is not signed at the fifth meeting.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan has approved a proposal to spend NT$13.26 billion (US$410
million) between 2010 and 2013 on building sports facilities around the country
and sponsoring sports activities aimed at promoting sport for all.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has
recently given the nod to a plan by the Sports Affairs Council (SAC) to
improving the country's sports environment and developing Taiwan into a place
that is more enthusiastic about sport.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the government will provide funds during the period to establish
20 sports parks and 50 public sports centers around the country, as well as
subsidizing local governments to install sports facilities and equipment, an SAC
spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>From 2010, local governments can begin submitting applications for the
installation of sports facilities in their administrative areas, according to
the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The SAC will evaluate the applications based on population size and population
density of an area within 200 hectares of the proposed sports centers, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Local governments that agree to take charge of the management and operation of
the proposed sports facilities will be given priority for subsidization, the
spokesman went on.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the plan also includes the building and refurbishment of sports
fields such as basketball courts, swimming pools, skating rinks, tennis courts,
slow pitch softball fields and gateball courses, as well as the maintenance and
repair of sports facilities.</P>
      <P>To encourage more people to exercise, the SAC will set up 125 physical fitness
test stations nationwide and plans to hand out 200,000 sports and fitness medals
during the period.</P>
      <P>The SAC hopes that through the program, the number of people who exercise
regularly will increase by 0.5 percent-1 percent per year so that by 2013, the
number of people exercising regularly will have reached 26 percent of the
population, the spokesman added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has taken stock of the experience of Japan in disaster
prevention and has suggested the formation of local disaster relief alliances to
provide quick rescue at the first strike of a disaster.</P>
      <P>The legislature's Organic Laws and Statutes Bureau noted that Typhoon Morakot,
which wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan in August with the most serious
precipitation in nearly half a century, exposed the deficiencies of Taiwan's
disaster relief mechanism.</P>
      <P>As a result, bureau officials went on a tour of Japan to learn about that
country's experience in disaster prevention and response.</P>
      <P>The officials said they found Japan has shifted its focus to software and
management from its past concentration on hardware development, and that
disaster prevention orchestrated by the central government has also switched to
joint cooperation between local residents and the administration to mitigate the
impact of disasters.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government attaches great importance to disaster simulation drills,
and cities and prefectures form alliances to conduct such drills regularly.</P>
      <P>Residents are taught that when disaster strikes, they should first seek self-
relief or take shelter to mitigate casualties and then wait for government
rescue and relief.</P>
      <P>The bureau also suggested that ministries, commissions and bureaus should send
their officials to work regularly at the Central Disaster Prevention and
Response Council to enhance inter-agency coordination.</P>
      <P>A special  commission  should  also be set up to conduct investigations after
each major disaster and announce the results. This would establish a mechanism
to pass on management and experience in disaster response.</P>
      <P>In an evaluation report on the draft amendment on Disaster Prevention and
Response Act, the bureau pointed out that the deficiencies in Taiwan's disaster
prevention and response system include the lack of a joint disaster response
plan, incomplete disaster information,  the lack of on-site command system and
insufficient use and management of available resources.</P>
      <P>The bureau noted that Typhoon Morakot also highlighted the "inappropriate
concept and approach" in flood prevention, lack of a land safety and
conservation plan, a faulty command system in the central and local disaster
response centers and rigid procedure and slow response in providing military
support to rescue operations, as well as a lack of regular drills.</P>

      <P>, has warned of the risks of retaliatory measures by the United States if the

      <P>This lose-lose situation could have been prevented if Taiwan had not signed any

any retaliatory action.</P>
      <P>This is the result of the government's  secret and hasty decision-making

special municipalities.</P>
      <P>An open process gives people an opportunity to voice their concerns, which makes
the outcome of a decision more acceptable to the public. A transparent process
also allows experts to review the facts and theories adopted in proposed

      <P>The government should replace those decision makers with people who respect
public opinion and who are more willing to face criticism.  The government
should also assure the public that sufficient time and open discussions will be
allowed before decisions are made.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs should have second thoughts on a proposal to
set up a new national research institute on the cultural and creative
industries.</P>
      <P>The council is reported to have come up with the proposal at the suggestion of
an opposition legislator who took her cue from the phenomenal success of the
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in helping spur the development
of Taiwan's information and communications technology (ICT) industry.</P>
      <P>As industrial intellectual  property tends to originate in laboratories, they
have to undergo a period of incubation to evolve into commercial products, a
need that necessitates the establishment of ITRI.</P>
      <P>The ITRI has long played the role of an incubator in the development of Taiwan's
high-tech industry. It has helped test the maturity of new technology, explored
its market acceptance and raised money for start-up companies to venture into
potential markets. Only when the time is mature does the ITRI-formed start-up
companies spin off to become independent corporations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) -- the world's largest contract
computer chip foundry -- is a typical example of the ITRI's incubating mission.
TSMC Chairman Morris Chang helped incubate semiconductor technologies during his
tenure as ITRI president and his company is an ITRI spin-off.</P>
      <P>As the cultural and creative industries mostly do not involve any abstractive
technologies developed in laboratories, the need to set up an ITRI-like
institute to help with the sector's development is questionable.</P>
      <P>Culture refers not to experiments in laboratories but rather to concrete
developments in daily life and social activity. If there are indeed some ICT-
related cultural or creative products, the government just needs to commission
the ITRI's information technology institute to form a task force to help with
digitization of relevant products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan really has to accelerate its cultural and creative industry development,
but the focus should be on marketing rather than setting up a huge institute
just for incubation purposes. The government should employ competent officials
with marketing expertise to carry out relevant projects.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A fatality allegedly due to an inoculation against influenza A(H1N1) involving a
7-year-old in Taichung has caused panic among parents in Taiwan leading to a
sharp decline in the number of school children receiving H1N1 immunization over
the past week.</P>
      <P>Pediatricians at major medical institutions confirmed Sunday that the number of
school children receiving H1N1 vaccine shots has declined sharply over the past
week, primarily due to concerns over the safety of the vaccine after the 7-year-
old boy died several weeks after being immunized.</P>
      <P>The doctors, however, still recommended that parents should get their children
immunized because the benefits far outweigh the risks.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-min, head of the Pediatrics Department of National Taiwan University
Hospital, also noted that the immunization effect will be limited if the child
receives only one shot rather than the recommended two.</P>
      <P>"The young vaccine recipient will become fully protected against the H1N1 virus
only after receiving two shots," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Hsiu-chen, a pediatrician with Taipei Medical University
Hospital, estimated that the number of school children receiving H1N1
inoculations was down by some 30 percent compared to the number when the
nationwide vaccination campaign was launched Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>Lin said she will persuade parents to have their young children vaccinated,
although she admitted she could not force them to do so.</P>
      <P>"The decision is for the parents to make," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education said Sunday it will respect the decisions
of parents on whether their children will receive H1N1 vaccine shots or not.</P>
      <P>Lee Ping-ing,  another  pediatrician  with National  Taiwan University Hospital,
attributed the decline in the number of people being immunized to the fact that
the number of new H1N1 cases has dropped significantly since the vaccination
campaign was launched, while several hundred cases complaining about side
effects after being immunized have given rise to doubts about the safety of the
vaccine.</P>
      <P>Lee, who doubles as secretary-general of the Taiwan Immunization Vision and
Strategy Alliance, said that some people have become disenchanted with the
vaccination drive and prefer to take medicine such as Tamiflu upon falling
victim to the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>These non-vaccinated people will be at highest risk of the next wave of swine
flu, which could be more deadly because the virus might have mutated, Lee
predicted, noting that judging from the seasonal flu epidemic outbreaks of the
past, there are usually two or three big outbreaks in one epidemic.</P>
      <P>Citing U.S. research that found the swine flu virus invades deep into the lungs,
Lee warned the public not to take the virus lightly, adding that they also
should not harbor the idea that they need not to be vaccinated if others are
instead.</P>
      <P>"Only those children who are allergic to eggs or those who have developed
allergy symptoms after receiving seasonal flu vaccine should forego
vaccination," he said.</P>
      <P>H1N1 inoculation is safe for almost all children, even if they have nasitis,
asthma or dermatitis, he added.</P>

Sunday.</P>

week, questioned the authenticity of the story at a press conference, saying the
report was not true.</P>
      <P>Major newspapers and news Web sites in Taiwan had all dedicated extensive
coverage to the topic over the past two days. The story, which described former
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) chairmen Wu Po-hsiung and Lien Chan, and opposition
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong as "A-list politicians who were
desperately seeking to meet with Chen, a C-list official in China, " stirred up
a political discussion, with President Ma Ying-jeou saying that the usage was
"inappropriate and disrespectful."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Wu Den-yih told reporters that "the use of the expression

    <HEADLINE>Prominent Chinese dissident envious of Taiwan's democracy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/27/09  19:31:11</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Writer</P>
      <P>It is a dream of Liu Xiaobo, the prominent Chinese dissident who was sentenced
to 11 years in jail Dec. 25, for a democratic system like the one in Taiwan to
someday take shape in China.</P>
      <P>Liu, who had been detained since December last year, was given the jail term --
one of the harshest ever for any Chinese dissenter, on charges of "inciting
subversion of state power, " a vague and unique term that China uses to
prosecute its dissidents.</P>
      <P>In interviews with CNA before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Liu said he has been
very interested in Taiwan's recent democratic development and that it could
serve as "an enlightenment or a model" for China.</P>
      <P>"I'm very curious about what the younger generation of Taiwan has been thinking
and doing, as this would be a key indicator of the direction in which Taiwan
will move," he said.</P>
      <P>Liu, who has been jailed several times as a political prisoner since 1989, has
never shown any sign of cynicism or resentment, unlike many other persecuted
Chinese dissidents.</P>
      <P>"I know what I have been doing and what kind of cost I have to pay for that," he
told CNA in his small home in Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, he expressed a great deal of tolerance toward the policemen who
arrested him under the instructions of the authorities.</P>
      <P>"The men who nabbed me would probably be good fathers when they have their
uniforms off at home," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu turned 54 three days after his latest sentence was handed down by a Beijing
court, and he and his wife have decided not to have a child -- the only one
allowed under China's one-child policy.</P>
      <P>"We are not against having a child, but rather we dare not have one, as human
rights have never been respected in China nowadays, so we have "a hundred
reasons" not to have a child."</P>
      <P>Liu was arrested in December last year on the eve of the release of "Charter 08,
" a blueprint Liu co-authored with about 300 elite from across all spectrums of
Chinese society that calls for an end to the Communist Party of China's (CPC's)
dominance of the government, military and courts, protection of freedom of
speech and religious beliefs and implementation of constitutional democracy in
China.</P>
      <P>"Charter 08" is reported to have been seconded by more than 10,000 people so
far, many of whom are leading intellectuals in China.</P>
      <P>In 1989, Liu cut short a visiting scholar program at Columbia University in the
United States and rushed back to Beijing to join the hunger strike staged at
Tiananmen Square by students calling for political reform in China, a protest
that led to the bloody military crackdown by the authorities, known as the
Tiananmen Massacre.</P>
      <P>He was then detained at Qincheng Prison near Beijing on charges of "anti-
revolution" for his role in the incident.</P>
      <P>After his release in January 1991, Liu refused to go into exile and instead
chose to stay at home to promote China's democratization. He was jailed again in
May 1994 for over six months for his appeals for justice for the 1989 massacre.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, Liu was dumped in a labor camp in Talian City in the
northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning for three years after he advised a CPC
congress session to launch a national anti- corruption drive and to usher in the
rule of law.</P>
      <P>His insistence on the universal value of human rights and democracy has earned
him numerous awards from Human Rights Watch, Reporters without Borders and other
international organizations.</P>
      <P>His latest sentence triggered outcry from international human rights
organizations and Western countries, with the United States pressing Beijing for
his immediate release.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined the ranks of the international community Dec. 26, with President
Ma Ying-jeou calling on China to demonstrate "the greatest possible tolerance"

      <P>Human Rights Watch said that since 2003, China has sentenced more than 35 people
on charges of inciting subversion of state power to prison terms ranging from
1.5 to 11 years, with Liu being the most severely punished.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will convene an inter-ministerial
meeting before the end of this year to tap the possibility of further improving
Taiwan's investment climate for capital from China, an MOEA official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Huang Chung-chiu said the MOEA will invite officials
from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Education for discussions
on whether and how Taiwan's investment climate should be improved or relaxed to
facilitate investment made by citizens of China.</P>
      <P>The discussions are expected to focus on simplification of entry-exit procedures
for Chinese investors and their employees traveling between the two sides,
greater education access to Taiwan's schools for the children of such people,
and various other matters, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will also discuss in the first quarter of next year the next wave of
opening of Taiwan's business and industrial sectors to capital from China, he
added.</P>
      <P>Wang Jing, chairwoman of Fujian Newland Group, the first Chinese enterprise to
invest in Taiwan, expressed hope at a seminar on Chinese investment in Taiwan
that took place in Taichung Dec. 25 that Taiwan will give greater access, such
as landing visas, to company employees traveling between the two sides and
provide tax incentives for the high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>On Wang's suggestions, Huang said it is not viable at present for Taiwan to
grant landing visas to businessmen from China and that one-year multiple entry
visa will remain the only option for company owners or executives from China,
given the existing political and economic reality across the strait.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that restrictions on Taiwanese companies inviting Chinese
people to Taiwan for business trips will be relaxed further -- with the
requirement that the host companies must have annual business transactions of
NT$1 billion or over relaxed to NT$100 million annually.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait negotiation still an uphill battle</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/27/09  19:53:14</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>The fourth round of Taiwan-China talks concluded last week with three agreements
signed amid a series of protests by the opposition and mixed views toward a
proposed trade pact that seeks closer bilateral economic relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  Chairman Chiang Pin-kung signed
three agreements with Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , in the fourth round of such talks
in the central city of Taichung, where protesters harassed the negotiations all
week.</P>
      <P>The SEF, the quasi-official organization set up to deal with cross-strait talks,
and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan's top China policy-making agency,
both lauded the talks as "fruitful," saying that the 12 agreements signed and a
consensus reached over the past two years will benefit the people of both sides.</P>
      <P>The U.S. maintained its long-term policy and cheered from the sidelines,
encouraging Taiwan and China to engage in peaceful talks to resolve their
differences and reduce tension across the strait.</P>
      <P>But that did not stop the opposition and non-believers from staging protests
throughout Chen's visit, with the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) blasting the government for non-transparency and failure to respect
mainstream public opinion in dealing with bilateral matters.</P>
      <P>Twenty meters away from where Chen Yunlin made his farewell speech Dec. 25, a
famous quote engraved on a stone wall reads: "The meaning of life is in the
birth of new lives that will succeed us in this universe; the goal of living is
in the betterment of living conditions of the entire humankind."</P>
      <P>The man who said this was Chiang Kai-shek, the generalissimo who lost to the
Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese civil war and retreated to Taiwan in
1949, starting 60 years of hostility across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 21, the Chinese negotiator's charter flight touched down at Taichung's
Chingchuankang Airport. Coincidentally, the airport, which is now known as
Taichung International Airport, got its initial name in dedication to late ROC
Army Gen. Chiu Ching-chuan, who killed himself after losing a battle in the
civil war.</P>
      <P>The contradiction shows how much times have changed since 1949. Once bitter
rivals, the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are now
collaborating to boost each other's economic development.</P>
      <P>Also on the day of Chen's departure, a Beijing court sentenced dissident Liu
Xiaobo to 11 years in prison for campaigning for political freedom by organizing
the "Charter 08" petition.</P>
      <P>Up until now, Taiwan has only been allowed to participate in a handful  of
international  organizations  because  of  China's interference and there are
more than 1,000 missiles deployed in China aimed at Taiwan, still considered a
renegade province by China.</P>
      <P>But Chen Yunlin said all the right things during his visit.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, the right path for peaceful cross-strait development will be broader
in the future, " Chen said in his farewell speech, adding that he appreciated
the Taiwan people's "understanding, support and caring."</P>
      <P>He also offered to endorse Taichung City, where the talks took place, and Sun
Moon Lake, a favorite among Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The protesters said they do not oppose better relations with China but fear that
closer economic relations will cost them jobs in case of a large influx of
Chinese labor and products and a bigger exodus of Taiwanese companies to China.</P>
      <P>The government has acknowledged it needs to step up its efforts to explain to
the public the positives and negatives of a proposed Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA) , which is on the agenda of the fifth round of talks
scheduled for next spring.</P>
      <P>It has also reiterated that the whole process of negotiation is transparent and
beneficial to Taiwan and that the government will safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty
every step of the way.</P>
      <P>It is also maintaining its policy of "economy first, politics second" in dealing
with China.</P>
      <P>However, Kenneth Lin, an economics professor at National Taiwan University,
argued that "whatever the issue is (between Taiwan and China), it's always a
political one in the end."</P>
      <P>It all boils down to one simple question, Lin said -- "Can China be trusted by
the people of Taiwan? "</P>
      <P>The failed tax agreement also suggests that when it comes to conflict of
interest, such as tax revenue, more discussion and negotiation will be needed
for both sides to find a solution.</P>
      <P>Chiang described the cross-strait exchanges in the past two years as having only
"scratched the surface of what we can accomplish in the end" and as being "a
long and winding road."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that water conservation is as important a major
government policy as energy conservation and carbon emission reduction.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed concern during a tour of southern Taiwan to learn more
about the water supply situation that supplies in some areas of southern Taiwan
might not be able to keep up with demand after next June.</P>
      <P>He said the government will use fee incentives to encourage the public to
conserve water, as it has done as part of its electricity conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>The premier said the Water Resources Agency has estimated that it can dredge
450,000 cubic meters of accumulated silt from Nanhua and Tsengwen reservoirs
next year, but this is just a fraction of the volume that needs to be removed.</P>
      <P>"We hope to step up promotion of various measures to ensure the functioning of
the reservoirs, " the premier said while inspecting Taiwan Water Corp.'s Nanhua
water treatment plant in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Earlier, he said in Pingtung County that the government has mapped out short-,
medium- and long-term measures to fight the possible water shortage problem.</P>
      <P>He said the immediate measure will be for "every household to conserve water"
and the government has also prohibited irrigation on 1,900 hectares of farmland
since Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>In the long-term, the Executive Yuan has decided to earmark NT$34 billion
(US$1.05 billion) to dredge Tsengwen Reservoir,  which straddles the border of
Chiayi and Tainan counties, and Nanhua Reservoir in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>About NT$26 billion will be allocated to remove silt from Tsengwen Reservoir
over the next six years, with NT$8 billion to be spent on cleaning Nanhua
Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Tsengwen Reservoir is Taiwan's largest and has an effective storage capacity of
596 million cubic meters.</P>
      <P>Since Typhoon Morakot in August, no rain has fallen in southern Taiwan and the
two reservoirs have not collected any more water, exacerbating the threat of
water shortages.</P>
      <P>Inspecting dredging work being carried out with assistance from the military on
one section of Gaoping River, Wu also instructed that monitoring the progress of
dredging work should be made a priority.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the sediment at the Paolai section of the river in Kaohsiung
County is now nearly at bridge height and that this section should be given
first priority in dredging.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung County, Wu toured construction sites for permanent housing units
beside Shanlin Junior High School for the settlement of flood-affected victims.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the first batch of 600 units can be completed by Jan.
31 so that the flood victims can move in before the Chinese New Year, which
falls on Feb. 14.</P>

      <P>The impact of a sandstorm sweeping in from China on Taiwan's air quality has
subsided and air quality has gradually returned to normal, although the quality
in southern Taiwan is still not ideal, the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The EPA said in a press release that this is due to wind speed weakening in
southern Taiwan, making conditions less than ideal for the dispersal of airborne
suspended particles.</P>
      <P>The latest data on air quality showed that the concentration of suspended
particles in northern Taiwan had dropped to below 100 micrograms per cubic
meter, with around 150 micrograms per cubic meter in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The EPA said that the sandstorm in northern China Dec. 24 mainly affected South
Korea and Japan and that Taiwan was affected to a far lesser extent.</P>
      <P>The air quality in northern Taiwan and in the southern counties of Yunlin,
Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung was poor Saturday, while the effect on
eastern Taiwan was milder.</P>
      <P>Suspended particles on the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, however, came
close to 300 micrograms per cubic meter, showing a more marked effect.</P>
      <P>The EPA noted Chinese sandstorms often affect Taiwan in the winter and spring
and that they are most frequent in March and April.</P>
      <P>The EPA tracks and forecasts Chinese sandstorms between November and the
following May every year and publishes the data on its Web site.</P>

      <P>A cable car system that will provide an aerial link between two popular tourist
destinations in central Taiwan -- Sun Moon Lake and the nearby Formosan
Aboriginal Culture Village amusement park -- will open to the public Dec. 28,
the amusement park administration said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 1.87 km system takes 7-10 minutes to travel between the two scenic sites,
located 10 km from each other by road, according to the administration.</P>
      <P>The system linking the lake's Ita Shao Dock and the private amusement park is
expected to promote local tourism because it will give tourists a bird's eye
view of the scenic lake area and the Puli basin.</P>
      <P>It was constructed by the park under a build-own-operate model, with the work
taking 18 months and passed Nantou county government inspections Dec. 24.</P>
      <P>Between Monday to Jan. 3, the amusement park will treat residents of the central
county's Yuchih township free cable car rides and free admission to the park.</P>
      <P>Before its official opening March 31, regular ticket prices will be NT$250, with
prices for groups of over 20 or more set at NT$225.</P>
      <P>After its official launch, regular ticket prices will be NT$300, concessionary
prices will be NT$250, and prices for groups of 20 or more will be NT$270.</P>
      <P>The system will operate between 10: 30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays and between
10:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on holidays.</P>
      <P>The 86-car system, which passes through a valley that is 786 meters wide at its
widest point and 200 meters deep, will be able to transport up to 3,000
passengers per hour, the administration said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has taken stock of the experience of Japan in disaster
prevention and has suggested the formation of local disaster relief alliances to
provide quick rescue at the first strike of a disaster.</P>
      <P>The legislature's Organic Laws and Statutes Bureau noted that Typhoon Morakot,
which wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan in August with the most serious
precipitation in nearly half a century, exposed the deficiencies of Taiwan's
disaster relief mechanism.</P>
      <P>As a result, bureau officials went on a tour of Japan to learn about that
country's experience in disaster prevention and response.</P>
      <P>The officials said they found Japan has shifted its focus to software and
management from its past concentration on hardware development, and that
disaster prevention orchestrated by the central government has also switched to
joint cooperation between local residents and the administration to mitigate the
impact of disasters.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government attaches great importance to disaster simulation drills,
and cities and prefectures form alliances to conduct such drills regularly.</P>
      <P>Residents are taught that when disaster strikes, they should first seek self-
relief or take shelter to mitigate casualties and then wait for government
rescue and relief.</P>
      <P>The bureau also suggested that ministries, commissions and bureaus should send
their officials to work regularly at the Central Disaster Prevention and
Response Council to enhance inter-agency coordination.</P>
      <P>A special  commission  should  also be set up to conduct investigations after
each major disaster and announce the results. This would establish a mechanism
to pass on management and experience in disaster response.</P>
      <P>In an evaluation report on the draft amendment on Disaster Prevention and
Response Act, the bureau pointed out that the deficiencies in Taiwan's disaster
prevention and response system include the lack of a joint disaster response
plan, incomplete disaster information,  the lack of on-site command system and
insufficient use and management of available resources.</P>
      <P>The bureau noted that Typhoon Morakot also highlighted the "inappropriate
concept and approach" in flood prevention, lack of a land safety and
conservation plan, a faulty command system in the central and local disaster
response centers and rigid procedure and slow response in providing military
support to rescue operations, as well as a lack of regular drills.</P>

      <P>, has warned of the risks of retaliatory measures by the United States if the

      <P>This lose-lose situation could have been prevented if Taiwan had not signed any

any retaliatory action.</P>
      <P>This is the result of the government's  secret and hasty decision-making
process. Similar incidents have repeatedly occurred in the administration of

      <P>An open process gives people an opportunity to voice their concerns, which makes
the outcome of a decision more acceptable to the public. A transparent process
also allows experts to review the facts and theories adopted in proposed

    <DATELINE>12/27/09  18:26:30
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs should have second thoughts on a proposal to
set up a new national research institute on the cultural and creative
industries.</P>
      <P>The council is reported to have come up with the proposal at the suggestion of
an opposition legislator who took her cue from the phenomenal success of the
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in helping spur the development
of Taiwan's information and communications technology (ICT) industry.</P>
      <P>As industrial intellectual  property tends to originate in laboratories, they
have to undergo a period of incubation to evolve into commercial products, a
need that necessitates the establishment of ITRI.</P>
      <P>The ITRI has long played the role of an incubator in the development of Taiwan's
high-tech industry. It has helped test the maturity of new technology, explored
its market acceptance and raised money for start-up companies to venture into
potential markets. Only when the time is mature does the ITRI-formed start-up
companies spin off to become independent corporations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) -- the world's largest contract
computer chip foundry -- is a typical example of the ITRI's incubating mission.
TSMC Chairman Morris Chang helped incubate semiconductor technologies during his
tenure as ITRI president and his company is an ITRI spin-off.</P>
      <P>As the cultural and creative industries mostly do not involve any abstractive
technologies developed in laboratories, the need to set up an ITRI-like
institute to help with the sector's development is questionable.</P>
      <P>Culture refers not to experiments in laboratories but rather to concrete
developments in daily life and social activity. If there are indeed some ICT-
related cultural or creative products, the government just needs to commission
the ITRI's information technology institute to form a task force to help with
digitization of relevant products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan really has to accelerate its cultural and creative industry development,
but the focus should be on marketing rather than setting up a huge institute
just for incubation purposes. The government should employ competent officials
with marketing expertise to carry out relevant projects.</P>

      <P>A fatality allegedly due to an inoculation against influenza A(H1N1) involving a
7-year-old in Taichung has caused panic among parents in Taiwan leading to a
sharp decline in the number of school children receiving H1N1 immunization over
the past week.</P>
      <P>Pediatricians at major medical institutions confirmed Sunday that the number of
school children receiving H1N1 vaccine shots has declined sharply over the past
week, primarily due to concerns over the safety of the vaccine after the 7-year-
old boy died several weeks after being immunized.</P>
      <P>The doctors, however, still recommended that parents should get their children
immunized because the benefits far outweigh the risks.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-min, head of the Pediatrics Department of National Taiwan University
Hospital, also noted that the immunization effect will be limited if the child
receives only one shot rather than the recommended two.</P>
      <P>"The young vaccine recipient will become fully protected against the H1N1 virus
only after receiving two shots," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Hsiu-chen, a pediatrician with Taipei Medical University
Hospital, estimated that the number of school children receiving H1N1
inoculations was down by some 30 percent compared to the number when the
nationwide vaccination campaign was launched Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>Lin said she will persuade parents to have their young children vaccinated,
although she admitted she could not force them to do so.</P>
      <P>"The decision is for the parents to make," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education said Sunday it will respect the decisions
of parents on whether their children will receive H1N1 vaccine shots or not.</P>
      <P>Lee Ping-ing,  another  pediatrician  with National  Taiwan University Hospital,
attributed the decline in the number of people being immunized to the fact that
the number of new H1N1 cases has dropped significantly since the vaccination
campaign was launched, while several hundred cases complaining about side
effects after being immunized have given rise to doubts about the safety of the
vaccine.</P>
      <P>Lee, who doubles as secretary-general of the Taiwan Immunization Vision and
Strategy Alliance, said that some people have become disenchanted with the
vaccination drive and prefer to take medicine such as Tamiflu upon falling
victim to the H1N1 virus.</P>
      <P>These non-vaccinated people will be at highest risk of the next wave of swine
flu, which could be more deadly because the virus might have mutated, Lee
predicted, noting that judging from the seasonal flu epidemic outbreaks of the
past, there are usually two or three big outbreaks in one epidemic.</P>
      <P>Citing U.S. research that found the swine flu virus invades deep into the lungs,
Lee warned the public not to take the virus lightly, adding that they also
should not harbor the idea that they need not to be vaccinated if others are
instead.</P>
      <P>"Only those children who are allergic to eggs or those who have developed
allergy symptoms after receiving seasonal flu vaccine should forego
vaccination," he said.</P>
      <P>H1N1 inoculation is safe for almost all children, even if they have nasitis,
asthma or dermatitis, he added.</P>

Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a story published a day earlier by the China Times daily, an official of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) -- Taiwan's quasi-official organization set up
to deal with cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations -- was quoted as saying that the
situation of three Taiwanese political heavyweights trying to meet with Chen
during his five-day visit that concluded Friday was like "the A-listers versus
the C-listers," with Chen as the "C-list" politician.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, who signed three agreements with Chen the previous
week, questioned the authenticity of the story at a press conference, saying the
report was not true.</P>
      <P>Major newspapers and news Web sites in Taiwan had all dedicated extensive
coverage to the topic over the past two days. The story, which described former
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) chairmen Wu Po-hsiung and Lien Chan, and opposition
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong as "A-list politicians who were
desperately seeking to meet with Chen, a C-list official in China, " stirred up
a political discussion, with President Ma Ying-jeou saying that the usage was
"inappropriate and disrespectful."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Wu Den-yih told reporters that "the use of the expression

      <P>Responding to reporters' questions, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman

    <HEADLINE>Prominent Chinese dissident envious of Taiwan's democracy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/27/09  19:31:11</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Writer</P>
      <P>It is a dream of Liu Xiaobo, the prominent Chinese dissident who was sentenced
to 11 years in jail Dec. 25, for a democratic system like the one in Taiwan to
someday take shape in China.</P>
      <P>Liu, who had been detained since December last year, was given the jail term --
one of the harshest ever for any Chinese dissenter, on charges of "inciting
subversion of state power, " a vague and unique term that China uses to
prosecute its dissidents.</P>
      <P>In interviews with CNA before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Liu said he has been
very interested in Taiwan's recent democratic development and that it could
serve as "an enlightenment or a model" for China.</P>
      <P>"I'm very curious about what the younger generation of Taiwan has been thinking
and doing, as this would be a key indicator of the direction in which Taiwan
will move," he said.</P>
      <P>Liu, who has been jailed several times as a political prisoner since 1989, has
never shown any sign of cynicism or resentment, unlike many other persecuted
Chinese dissidents.</P>
      <P>"I know what I have been doing and what kind of cost I have to pay for that," he
told CNA in his small home in Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, he expressed a great deal of tolerance toward the policemen who
arrested him under the instructions of the authorities.</P>
      <P>"The men who nabbed me would probably be good fathers when they have their
uniforms off at home," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu turned 54 three days after his latest sentence was handed down by a Beijing
court, and he and his wife have decided not to have a child -- the only one
allowed under China's one-child policy.</P>
      <P>"We are not against having a child, but rather we dare not have one, as human
rights have never been respected in China nowadays, so we have "a hundred
reasons" not to have a child."</P>
      <P>Liu was arrested in December last year on the eve of the release of "Charter 08,
" a blueprint Liu co-authored with about 300 elite from across all spectrums of
Chinese society that calls for an end to the Communist Party of China's (CPC's)
dominance of the government, military and courts, protection of freedom of
speech and religious beliefs and implementation of constitutional democracy in
China.</P>
      <P>"Charter 08" is reported to have been seconded by more than 10,000 people so
far, many of whom are leading intellectuals in China.</P>
      <P>In 1989, Liu cut short a visiting scholar program at Columbia University in the
United States and rushed back to Beijing to join the hunger strike staged at
Tiananmen Square by students calling for political reform in China, a protest
that led to the bloody military crackdown by the authorities, known as the
Tiananmen Massacre.</P>
      <P>He was then detained at Qincheng Prison near Beijing on charges of "anti-
revolution" for his role in the incident.</P>
      <P>After his release in January 1991, Liu refused to go into exile and instead
chose to stay at home to promote China's democratization. He was jailed again in
May 1994 for over six months for his appeals for justice for the 1989 massacre.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, Liu was dumped in a labor camp in Talian City in the
northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning for three years after he advised a CPC
congress session to launch a national anti- corruption drive and to usher in the
rule of law.</P>
      <P>His insistence on the universal value of human rights and democracy has earned
him numerous awards from Human Rights Watch, Reporters without Borders and other
international organizations.</P>
      <P>His latest sentence triggered outcry from international human rights
organizations and Western countries, with the United States pressing Beijing for
his immediate release.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined the ranks of the international community Dec. 26, with President
Ma Ying-jeou calling on China to demonstrate "the greatest possible tolerance"
toward its dissidents.</P>
      <P>Human Rights Watch said that since 2003, China has sentenced more than 35 people
on charges of inciting subversion of state power to prison terms ranging from
1.5 to 11 years, with Liu being the most severely punished.</P>
      <P>This shows that the Chinese government will not tolerate Chinese citizens
participating in discussions about their own form of government, the group said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will convene an inter-ministerial
meeting before the end of this year to tap the possibility of further improving
Taiwan's investment climate for capital from China, an MOEA official said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Huang Chung-chiu said the MOEA will invite officials
from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Education for discussions
on whether and how Taiwan's investment climate should be improved or relaxed to
facilitate investment made by citizens of China.</P>
      <P>The discussions are expected to focus on simplification of entry-exit procedures
for Chinese investors and their employees traveling between the two sides,
greater education access to Taiwan's schools for the children of such people,
and various other matters, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will also discuss in the first quarter of next year the next wave of
opening of Taiwan's business and industrial sectors to capital from China, he
added.</P>
      <P>Wang Jing, chairwoman of Fujian Newland Group, the first Chinese enterprise to
invest in Taiwan, expressed hope at a seminar on Chinese investment in Taiwan
that took place in Taichung Dec. 25 that Taiwan will give greater access, such
as landing visas, to company employees traveling between the two sides and
provide tax incentives for the high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>On Wang's suggestions, Huang said it is not viable at present for Taiwan to
grant landing visas to businessmen from China and that one-year multiple entry
visa will remain the only option for company owners or executives from China,
given the existing political and economic reality across the strait.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that restrictions on Taiwanese companies inviting Chinese
people to Taiwan for business trips will be relaxed further -- with the
requirement that the host companies must have annual business transactions of
NT$1 billion or over relaxed to NT$100 million annually.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait negotiation still an uphill battle</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/27/09  19:53:14</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>The fourth round of Taiwan-China talks concluded last week with three agreements
signed amid a series of protests by the opposition and mixed views toward a
proposed trade pact that seeks closer bilateral economic relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  Chairman Chiang Pin-kung signed
three agreements with Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , in the fourth round of such talks
in the central city of Taichung, where protesters harassed the negotiations all
week.</P>
      <P>The SEF, the quasi-official organization set up to deal with cross-strait talks,
and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Taiwan's top China policy-making agency,
both lauded the talks as "fruitful," saying that the 12 agreements signed and a
consensus reached over the past two years will benefit the people of both sides.</P>
      <P>The U.S. maintained its long-term policy and cheered from the sidelines,
encouraging Taiwan and China to engage in peaceful talks to resolve their
differences and reduce tension across the strait.</P>
      <P>But that did not stop the opposition and non-believers from staging protests
throughout Chen's visit, with the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) blasting the government for non-transparency and failure to respect
mainstream public opinion in dealing with bilateral matters.</P>
      <P>Twenty meters away from where Chen Yunlin made his farewell speech Dec. 25, a
famous quote engraved on a stone wall reads: "The meaning of life is in the
birth of new lives that will succeed us in this universe; the goal of living is
in the betterment of living conditions of the entire humankind."</P>
      <P>The man who said this was Chiang Kai-shek, the generalissimo who lost to the
Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese civil war and retreated to Taiwan in
1949, starting 60 years of hostility across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 21, the Chinese negotiator's charter flight touched down at Taichung's
Chingchuankang Airport. Coincidentally, the airport, which is now known as
Taichung International Airport, got its initial name in dedication to late ROC
Army Gen. Chiu Ching-chuan, who killed himself after losing a battle in the
civil war.</P>
      <P>The contradiction shows how much times have changed since 1949. Once bitter
rivals, the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China are now
collaborating to boost each other's economic development.</P>
      <P>Also on the day of Chen's departure, a Beijing court sentenced dissident Liu
Xiaobo to 11 years in prison for campaigning for political freedom by organizing
the "Charter 08" petition.</P>
      <P>Up until now, Taiwan has only been allowed to participate in a handful  of
international  organizations  because  of  China's interference and there are
more than 1,000 missiles deployed in China aimed at Taiwan, still considered a
renegade province by China.</P>
      <P>But Chen Yunlin said all the right things during his visit.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, the right path for peaceful cross-strait development will be broader
in the future, " Chen said in his farewell speech, adding that he appreciated
the Taiwan people's "understanding, support and caring."</P>
      <P>He also offered to endorse Taichung City, where the talks took place, and Sun
Moon Lake, a favorite among Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The protesters said they do not oppose better relations with China but fear that
closer economic relations will cost them jobs in case of a large influx of
Chinese labor and products and a bigger exodus of Taiwanese companies to China.</P>
      <P>The government has acknowledged it needs to step up its efforts to explain to
the public the positives and negatives of a proposed Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA) , which is on the agenda of the fifth round of talks
scheduled for next spring.</P>
      <P>It has also reiterated that the whole process of negotiation is transparent and
beneficial to Taiwan and that the government will safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty
every step of the way.</P>
      <P>It is also maintaining its policy of "economy first, politics second" in dealing
with China.</P>
      <P>However, Kenneth Lin, an economics professor at National Taiwan University,
argued that "whatever the issue is (between Taiwan and China), it's always a
political one in the end."</P>
      <P>It all boils down to one simple question, Lin said -- "Can China be trusted by
the people of Taiwan? "</P>
      <P>The failed tax agreement also suggests that when it comes to conflict of
interest, such as tax revenue, more discussion and negotiation will be needed
for both sides to find a solution.</P>
      <P>Chiang described the cross-strait exchanges in the past two years as having only
"scratched the surface of what we can accomplish in the end" and as being "a
long and winding road."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that water conservation is as important a major
government policy as energy conservation and carbon emission reduction.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed concern during a tour of southern Taiwan to learn more
about the water supply situation that supplies in some areas of southern Taiwan
might not be able to keep up with demand after next June.</P>
      <P>He said the government will use fee incentives to encourage the public to
conserve water, as it has done as part of its electricity conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>The premier said the Water Resources Agency has estimated that it can dredge
450,000 cubic meters of accumulated silt from Nanhua and Tsengwen reservoirs
next year, but this is just a fraction of the volume that needs to be removed.</P>
      <P>"We hope to step up promotion of various measures to ensure the functioning of
the reservoirs, " the premier said while inspecting Taiwan Water Corp.'s Nanhua
water treatment plant in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Earlier, he said in Pingtung County that the government has mapped out short-,
medium- and long-term measures to fight the possible water shortage problem.</P>
      <P>He said the immediate measure will be for "every household to conserve water"
and the government has also prohibited irrigation on 1,900 hectares of farmland
since Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>In the long-term, the Executive Yuan has decided to earmark NT$34 billion
(US$1.05 billion) to dredge Tsengwen Reservoir,  which straddles the border of
Chiayi and Tainan counties, and Nanhua Reservoir in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>About NT$26 billion will be allocated to remove silt from Tsengwen Reservoir
over the next six years, with NT$8 billion to be spent on cleaning Nanhua
Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Tsengwen Reservoir is Taiwan's largest and has an effective storage capacity of
596 million cubic meters.</P>
      <P>Since Typhoon Morakot in August, no rain has fallen in southern Taiwan and the
two reservoirs have not collected any more water, exacerbating the threat of
water shortages.</P>
      <P>Inspecting dredging work being carried out with assistance from the military on
one section of Gaoping River, Wu also instructed that monitoring the progress of
dredging work should be made a priority.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the sediment at the Paolai section of the river in Kaohsiung
County is now nearly at bridge height and that this section should be given
first priority in dredging.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung County, Wu toured construction sites for permanent housing units
beside Shanlin Junior High School for the settlement of flood-affected victims.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the first batch of 600 units can be completed by Jan.
31 so that the flood victims can move in before the Chinese New Year, which
falls on Feb. 14.</P>

      <P>The impact of a sandstorm sweeping in from China on Taiwan's air quality has
subsided and air quality has gradually returned to normal, although the quality
in southern Taiwan is still not ideal, the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The EPA said in a press release that this is due to wind speed weakening in
southern Taiwan, making conditions less than ideal for the dispersal of airborne
suspended particles.</P>
      <P>The latest data on air quality showed that the concentration of suspended
particles in northern Taiwan had dropped to below 100 micrograms per cubic
meter, with around 150 micrograms per cubic meter in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The EPA said that the sandstorm in northern China Dec. 24 mainly affected South
Korea and Japan and that Taiwan was affected to a far lesser extent.</P>
      <P>The air quality in northern Taiwan and in the southern counties of Yunlin,
Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung was poor Saturday, while the effect on
eastern Taiwan was milder.</P>
      <P>Suspended particles on the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, however, came
close to 300 micrograms per cubic meter, showing a more marked effect.</P>
      <P>The EPA noted Chinese sandstorms often affect Taiwan in the winter and spring
and that they are most frequent in March and April.</P>
      <P>The EPA tracks and forecasts Chinese sandstorms between November and the
following May every year and publishes the data on its Web site.</P>

      <P>The question of whether Taiwan should further open up to cross-Taiwan Strait
investment flows has been of major concern in local society. With the Ministry
of Economic Affairs expected to conditionally allow flat panel and semiconductor
industries to invest in China, some analysts have warned that further
liberalization could freeze Taiwan's GDP growth.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the proposed opening:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will convene an inter-ministerial
meeting this week to explore the possibility of further lifting restrictions on
China-bound Taiwanese high-tech investment.</P>
      <P>The discussions are expected to focus on lifting restrictions on manufacturers
of large TFT-LCD display panels, semiconductor testing and packing technology,
as well as IC design.</P>
      <P>If everything goes according to plan, the opening will be announced before the
end of the year, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said it is urgent for Taiwan's flat
panel makers to secure a foothold in China before massive expansion of the TFT-
LCD display market there over the next three to five years.</P>
      <P>"It would be too late for Taiwan manufacturers to edge into the huge market if
the opening is not approved soon," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The opening policy is not expected to be announced by the MOEA until January at
the earliest.</P>
      <P>The MOEA is likely to give a green light mainly to flat panel manufacturing and
semiconductor testing and packing technology, on the principle that high-end
technologies should remain in Taiwan and only earlier generation technologies
should be allowed to head to China.</P>
      <P>Based on the Wassenaar Arrangement, the restrictions on the establishment of
eight-inch silicon wafer foundries in China using Taiwan's 0.18-micron process
technology will be lifted across the board, while investment plans involving
technology more advanced than 0.18-micron would be screened on a case-by-case
basis, MOEA officials said. (Dec. 28, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou administration's swift deregulation of Taiwan's hi-tech industry to
allow investors to head west to China will imperil the country's nascent
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>In the face of high unemployment rate, dwindling wages and shrinking tax
revenues at home, the government's imminent lifting of restrictions  on
investments  in China  by Taiwanese  hi-tech manufacturers is triggering a new
wave of capital exodus and will cause a "sudden freeze" in the domestic economy.

    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan's public debt approaches an alarming NT$2 trillion (US$62 billion) ,
some economic scholars have suggested that the government  install  an early
warning system,  similar to the odometer-style "debt clock" put up near Times
Square in 1989, to prevent the national debt from escalating too fast.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The total debt incurred by the central and local governments has increased to
around NT$450 billion this year, which has pushed the accumulated national debt
close to the NT$2 trillion mark.</P>
      <P>Lee Yun-jie, a professor at National Open University's Department of Public
Affairs, suggested that the debt ceiling must be lowered when the economy is
booming but the nation's financial state is deteriorating.</P>
      <P>Lee also suggested the central government establish a three-color national debt
rating system based on six national financial indices that include the national
debt growth rate, the ratio of governmental budget deficits to the gross
domestic product (GDP) , the ratio of special budgets to GDP, and the ratio of
government debt spending to its total spending in a year.</P>
      <P>Under such a system, a "red" light would suggest deterioration of the debt
situation, a "yellow" light would reflect a balanced financial state and a
"blue" light would signal a sound and stable financial situation, Lee suggested.
(Dec. 28, 2009)</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Commenting on the increase of the government debt this year to about NT$450
billion -- the highest in nearly five years -- ranking Ministry of Finance
officials explained that it was the result of the government's efforts to help
stimulate the economy during the global downturn.</P>
      <P>Now that the economy is recovering, efforts will be made to reduce the national
debt, the officials said. The government will consider raising taxes at an
appropriate time to help improve the country's finances, they added.</P>
      <P>The proposed tax measures will include raising property taxes and introducing a
luxury tax, the officials said, but stressed that the increases will not be
carried out without public consensus. (Dec. 28, 2009)</P>

      <P>Amid protests, the fourth-round of cross-strait talks ended without a double
taxation agreement or any substantial discussion on a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement with China.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that these issues have been deferred to the next round of talks in
China when a closed-door deal will be sealed and the Taiwanese people will not
be able to stage protests.</P>
      <P>What is even more worrying is the Ma administration's servile attitude toward
China, and the attempt to achieve the goal of ultimate unification under the
guise of cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Ma's advocacy of unification runs counter to historical facts and his
presidential mandate and has turned him into a national traitor.</P>
      <P>Qing Dynasty Emperor Yongzheng once said that Taiwan had not belonged to China
since in ancient times, which is evidence of Taiwan's independence from China.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui's rule was a milestone in Taiwan's historical
development. Before him, Taiwan was dominated by the alien forces of the
Netherlands, Spain, Ming Dynasty loyalist Koxinga, the Qing Dynasty, Japan and
Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>But after Lee's push for localization and democratization, Taiwan became a
sovereign, independent country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's only connection with China was after the Qing Dynasty's annexation of
the island, but it ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after China's defeat. Japan,
after its own defeat in World War II, surrendered its sovereignty over Taiwan
and Penghu, but did not specify in the San Francisco Peace Treaty to whom they
should belong. Chiang established a government in exile in Taiwan after his
forces were annihilated by the Communists in a civil war in China in 1949.</P>
      <P>Since the presidential election by popular vote in Taiwan in 1996, Taiwan has
become a completely democratized and localized country in accordance with the
international norm of residents deciding their own fate.</P>
      <P>Ma as an elected president  should uphold the independent sovereignty of the
nation. If he insists on pushing for ultimate unification, he will surely be
attacked and rejected by the people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang remained tight-lipped Monday on
whether the government would lift restrictions on China-bound Taiwanese hi-tech
investment.</P>
      <P>On media reports the day before that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will conditionally allow TFT-LCD display panel makers and semiconductor
industries to widen investment in China, Shih said it is inappropriate for him
to make any disclosure before the plan is finalized and approved by the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The minister, however, gave the assurance that the MOEA has proposed only
liberalization measures that will be beneficial to Taiwan's long-term economic
development.</P>
      <P>"All factors,  including Taiwan's priorities,  globalization strategy, domestic
employment and wage structures, were studied meticulously before the
liberalization plan was proposed," he noted.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials was quoted as reporting Sunday that restrictions on manufacturing
operations of large TFT-LCD display panels are expected to be lifted, but the
measure will exclude top technologies owned by specific companies, such as the
10th-generation TFT-LCD display manufacturing technology of AU Optronics Corp.,
one of the leading flat panel manufacturers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The restrictions on the establishment of eight-inch silicon wafer foundries in
China using Taiwan's 0.18-micron process technology will be lifted across the
board, but investments in more advanced technology at the 0.13-micron level and
above will still be banned, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Other major aspects  of the deregulation  package  include semiconductor testing
and packing technology,  naphtha cracking plants,  semiconductor IC design and
infrastructure development projects, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>According  to the Liberty Times Monday,  the Ma Ying-jeou administration's swift
deregulation of Taiwan's hi-tech industry to allow Taiwanese companies to head
west to China will imperil the country's nascent economic recovery.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The sixth round of high-level cross-Taiwan Strait talks, known locally as
"Chiang-Chen meetings, " should be held either in Tainan, Kaohsiung or Pingtung.
Whichever one is chosen, the meeting should take place in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Based on precedent and the rotating host principle, the sixth Chiang-Chen
meeting should be convened in Taiwan late next year, sometime after the
elections  for mayors of the five special municipalities.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current trend, we believe Taiwan's political map will remain
practically unchanged after the municipality mayoral elections, with all
southern cities and counties still under the control of the opposition pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>By that time, the controversial cross-strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) should have been signed at the fifth Chiang-Chen meeting which
is scheduled be held in China in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>Without such a contentious issue on the agenda, it should pose no special
problem for any of the DPP-controlled local governments in the south to host the
Chiang-Chen meeting.</P>
      <P>Most important, it would inspire the DPP to temper its hostility toward China
and ultimately lead to a change of attitude by the DPP-led pan-green camp.</P>
      <P>When the Chiang-Chen meeting took place in Taipei in late 2008 for the first
time, more than 200 police officers and ordinary citizens were injured in
violent street protests against top Chinese negotiator Chen Yunlin's visit, but
only one policeman was injured during Chen's just-concluded second visit. This
is an indication that violence is no longer acceptable to local mainstream
society.</P>
      <P>The image of DPP mayors or magistrates taking turns to fete Chen Yunlin could be
yet another amazing development in cross-strait relations. The DPP would then be
able to deal with such thorny issues such its aim of "building a Taiwan
republic" as stated in its party charter, a goal that for years has kept
centrist and swing voters away from the party and will hinder its return to
power.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's main opposition force, the DPP should stop its anti-China and anti-
globalization closed-door policies because they offer no way out for Taiwan and
the DPP itself.</P>

      <P>The Tax Reform Committee under the Executive Yuan recently indicated that it
would not introduce any reforms involving stock income tax in the short term. It
is clear that even if the government decides to reintroduce stock income tax for
enterprises, it will maintain the exemption for individuals.</P>
      <P>Even though we did not have any great expectations of the committee, we still
deeply regret such a decision.</P>
      <P>We know of course the sensitivity of the issue, but if the society is to
progress, faulty systems have to be fixed.</P>
      <P>Deciding against stock income tax will not only result in annual tax revenue
losses of nearly NT$40 billion, but will also lead to unequitable taxation,
encourage tax evasions and eventually widen the gap in the distribution of
social resources and cripple the tax system.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said recently that the public does not full
understand the issue, noting that the stock transaction tax actually includes
stock income tax.</P>
      <P>This is not correct. Stock income tax and stock transaction tax are two
different types of taxes, with the former targeting transactions and the latter
relating to profits made from the sale of stocks.</P>
      <P>The stock transaction tax will add costs to transactions, which means that if
the tax rate is too high, it will hamper transactions, while stock income tax
will cut into gains. Looking back on the nation's taxation history, we find that
both taxes were imposed on and off, but there is no record of one substituting
for the other.</P>
      <P>We are totally disappointed in the Tax Reform Committee, and we think it should
not attempt to use a foul pretext to cover its inability to institute reforms.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/28/09  15:45:47
(By Lillian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors recently concluded their probe into the controversial financial
reforms introduced by former president Chen Shui-bian and indicted him, his
wife, five family members, and 15 other people.</P>
      <P>But the prosecutors have faced harsh criticism because the indictments have been
limited to only a few people, and especially because most of the investigations
have been closed on the grounds that "bribery is not in violation of their
duties."</P>
      <P>Considering the fact that the prosecutors lightly dismissed such a serious
matter as selling national property below cost in the name of financial reforms,
we would like to point out what is a financial merger and what is a violation of
one's duty.</P>
      <P>State-controlled banks are the nation's cash cows, bringing in steady revenues
to the national coffers. If the state decides to sell a bank, it is usually
mainly for the purpose of making as much money as possible for the state
coffers.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if the Ministry of Finance (MOF) decides to sell a bank, it will sell
to the highest bidder or the most appropriate bidder.</P>
      <P>For example, if A bids NT$100 billion, while B bids only NT$30 billion, and the
MOF decides to sell to B, it would mean a loss of NT$70 billion in revenue. Does
that not constitute violating one's duty as a civil servant?</P>
      <P>We believe that those civil servants involved should be pursued by the law and
those who paid the bribes should also be penalized because they tried to get the
civil servants to award them operation rights, in violation of national
interests.</P>
      <P>We want to ask Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng and prosecutors to address the
seriously flawed interpretation of the law, which we believe will not be
accepted by the majority of Taiwanese and is a rationalization of bribery at the
government's discretion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecution  authorities have finally completed probes into suspected
irregularities involving the second round of financial reforms,  with former
President  Chen Shui-bian  indicted over bribe-taking and money laundering.</P>
      <P>Senior executives and major shareholders of several financial holding companies
were also indicted for helping with Chen's money laundering.</P>
      <P>The indictments have again highlighted the need to address the aftermath of the
botched second round of financial reforms and have rekindled concern as to when
financial reforms will re-start.</P>
      <P>The focus of financial reforms tends to shift with the times and changing market
developments. Taiwan's first round of financial reforms focused on cleaning up
bad debts in the banking system and mapping out exit rules for poorly managed
banks, while the second round concentrated on the privatization of state-owned
banks and augmentation of financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Although the direction of the second round of financial reforms was correct, it
was mismanaged. The government should not stop banking reforms using the excuse
of illegal dealings involved in the reforms and should instead reaffirm its
determination to reactivate reform by grappling with the issues left by the
earlier failed reforms.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the aftermath,  the Financial  Supervisory Commission should
factor in both legal provisions and practical reality in drafting solution
packages on a case-by-case basis in order to maintain financial stability while
upholding rule of law and the principles of fairness and justice.</P>
      <P>For instance, the commission should refer to existing regulations and insist
that banking institutions review the qualifications of their heads and major
shareholders in terms of "fit and proper" principles.</P>
      <P>In line with existing bank spin-off and investment laws, the commission can also
ask banking institutions that have failed to acquire controlling shares of other
banks within the legal deadlines to sell off their stakes in those banks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the government should accelerate  reform steps, including  capital
increment,  improving merger and acquisition regulations, consistency in
releasing government stakes in local banks and management supervision.</P>
      <P>The government should also review whether its control of over 40 percent of the
stakes in many local banks hampers operational efficiency, innovation and
competition. Otherwise, a new financial crisis could be in the offing.</P>

      <P>Nearly 70 percent of the population favors the notion of replacing nuclear power
with renewable energy, while 50 percent think nuclear power should be maintained
as an option, according to the results of a poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan Power Company, the sole supplier of electricity in Taiwan, said
that renewable energy may not be a realistic path as the average consumer would
complain about its much higher price.</P>
      <P>In a telephone poll conducted by Shih Hsin University on randomly chosen
citizens over the age of 20, it was found that 49.1 percent support nuclear
power as one of the energy production options, while 69.9 percent favor
replacing nuclear power with renewable and clean energy.</P>
      <P>Some 73.8 percent  of the respondents  support  industrial restructuring so as
to help cut carbon dioxide emissions, according to the poll, which was
commissioned by the Atomic Energy Council to determine people's awareness of and
opinions on energy production and consumption.</P>
      <P>Liang Shih-wu, director of the Shih Hsin public opinion poll center, said the
survey results indicate that the Taiwan public generally agrees there is a need
for alternative, cleaner energy, but opinions on the safety of nuclear power is
evenly divided.</P>
      <P>About one-third of the respondents consider nuclear power as "safe, " one-third
think it is "unsafe, " and one-third have no opinion on the matter, he said.</P>
      <P>Support for clean energy is a matter of theory and practicality. Although
Taiwanese people in general support the development of renewable energy, they
may find their electricity bills unaffordable once the much more expensive
renewable energy is applied to replace traditional sources of electrical power,
according to Hsiao Chin-yi, director of the Taipower Department of Public
Services.</P>
      <P>Besides,  Hsiao said,  Taipower encountered  opposition  or resistance by local
residents when it tried to establish facilities for solar power or wind power.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang Chao-yueh, an associate professor at National Taiwan
University's Institute of Oceanography, said the global share of nuclear power
has been dwindling steadily. A German research team has found that global
deposits of uranium -- the raw material used for nuclear power -- are enough to
last no more than 40 years for use by nuclear power plants around the world, he
said.</P>
      <P>"With such prospects, it is not worth pursuing nuclear power generation in
Taiwan at any cost," Yang added.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted in November collected 517 valid samples, and had a
confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error of 4.3 percentage points.</P>

      <P>Negotiations between Taiwan and China will move on to the issues of investment
protection and security after the signing of a proposed Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA), a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  policy and negotiation  priority has always been "economics first,
politics second, " which is why it intends to sign the ECFA with China before
anything else, said James Chang, deputy director-general of MOFA's Department of
Information and Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>"After the ECFA is signed, both sides will begin an even more difficult and
sophisticated part of talks.  The new phase of negotiation is expected to touch
upon various issues such as investment protection and security, which includes
the missiles deployed on China's southeastern coast, as well as anti-terrorism
measures," he said.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while briefing the media after the ministry briefed
around 70 foreign representatives in Taiwan on the results of the fourth round
of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China both intend to focus on economic issues at present as
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin
made it very clear in the talks that "political discussions are not an urgent
issue right now, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>Once the ECFA is signed, the new phase of negotiations will not be limited to
politics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has always called for China to remove its missiles aimed at the country
in order to reduce cross-strait tension and convince the people of Taiwan of
China's goodwill.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  investment  protection is a serious concern of Taiwanese businessmen
in China, some of whom have faced legal problems or have suffered operating
losses or various forms of fraud in China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been doing its best since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008
to improve cross-strait relations, Deputy Foreign Minister Shen Lyu-shun told
the foreign representatives.</P>
      <P>"One side-effect of improved cross-strait relations is the enlargement of
Taiwan's international space, " Shen said, citing Taiwan's participation in the
World Health Assembly, the Government Procurement  Agreement,  and high-level
representation  in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum as examples.</P>

that the CHA will zone cities and townships as Hakka areas so long as at least
33 percent of the population there are of Hakka descent.</P>
      <P>"The Hakka dialect will also be designated as the official language in those
areas," Huang said.</P>
      <P>A total of 61 townships around the country are expected to be zoned as Hakka
areas as a result of that stipulation, he continued.</P>
      <P>The Hakka, which translates as "guest families" in Cantonese, comprise a unique
ethnic group of Han Chinese who fled famine and war in central China in past
centuries and eventually settled in southern and eastern China, predominantly in
the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, Fujian and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A 2008 CHA survey found that Taiwan's Hakka population -- using a broad
definition of the term -- accounts for 25.6 percent of the total population.</P>
      <P>Huang also said the CHA will begin a nationwide census from 2010 to enable the
government to better grasp the situation of the Hakka people in Taiwan. The
census is scheduled to be completed in 2011.</P>
      <P>He quoted the latest tallies compiled by the CHA as indicating that the total
number of Hakka people in Taiwan ranges from 3.10 million to 5.87 million,
depending on whether a narrow or broad definition of the term is employed.</P>
      <P>Most of the country's Hakka people are concentrated in the northern counties of
Hsinchu, Miaoli and Taoyuan, and in the southern county of Pingtung.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou was right to reject offers by three "pan-blue" bigwigs to
separately host dinners for top Chinese negotiator Chen Yunlin during his just-
concluded visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>No matter how high their political statures, Lien Chan, James Soong and Wu Poh-
hsiung should not have tried to meddle with the biannual high-level cross-Taiwan
Strait talks, because they no longer hold any government positions.</P>
      <P>Gone are their days of power. Now is Ma's turn. They needed to respect Ma's
decision made out of consideration of public sentiment.</P>
      <P>Had they entertained Chen, it would have undermined the Ma administration's
efforts to emphasize the government-to-government nature of the talks between
Chen and his Taiwanese counterpart Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Given the aversion of Taiwan's people to China's attempts to belittle Taiwan's
sovereign  status and downgrade  cross-strait engagements as party-to-party
dealings, their high-profile appearance during Chen's visit would have only
served Beijing's goal and even affected the legitimacy of the three agreements
signed during Chen's Dec. 21-25 visit.</P>
      <P>Many people, particularly pro-independence activists, may have suspected that
secret deals were being struck behind closed doors, while others would have had
the impression that the trio were pulling the strings from behind the scenes, an
image that could have weakened Ma's leadership.</P>
      <P>For the country's overall interests, Ma was right to reject the trio's attempts
to play a role in Chen's visit, and he need not feel apologetic about it at all.</P>

      <P>The establishment of Taiwan's eighth national park, Taijiang National Park in
Tainan, was described by Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu at its opening Monday as
an important landmark in Taiwan's environmental conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>Speaking in fluent Taiwanese, Chu said the park incorporates environmental
conservation efforts into a local salt-production industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih noted that a plan to build an
industrial zone in Binnan in Tainan County where flocks of endangered black-
faced spoonbills usually overwinter, was vetoed because the bird protection zone
is now part of the park.</P>
      <P>The 39,310-hectare park contains many valuable ecological areas, such as
wetlands and lagoons, and is the home to some 100 precious species, including
black-faced spoonbills and mangroves, according to Minister of the Interior
Jiang Yi-huah, who was among the many political figures from across party lines
at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>The national park project, initiated by the local government and supported by
the central government, was made possible with the concerted efforts of various
government agencies, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>According to Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, the park is part of his plans to
develop Tainan into an international city characterized by abundant cultural
assets, pioneering technology and special ecology.</P>
      <P>Located along a coastal area that straddles Tainan City and Tainan County in
southern Taiwan, the park has a total area of 39,310 hectares, 4,905 hectares of
which is on land and 34,405 hectares at sea, according to the MOI.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony was attended by the four above-mentioned central local
government chiefs and other political figures, all of whom are considered as
potential candidates for upcoming elections in five  municipalities.  They
included  Presidential  Office Secretary-General Liao Liou-yi and opposition
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lai Ching-teh.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Monday that it is considering  a revision to
the law to raise the compensation for victims who suffer adverse reactions to
the H1N1 vaccine.</P>
      <P>DOH officials made the remarks during a legislative committee meeting  after
several  recent  cases,  including  deaths  and miscarriages, that some have
attributed to the H1N1 vaccine, began to impact public interest in getting the
shots.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Chen  chiech-ju  of the  opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
said that in South Korea, the compensation for death attributed to vaccine is
the equivalent of NT$20 million (US$619,540).</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lo Shu-lei said the authorities should pay out at
least NT$10 million for each death attributed to the vaccine.</P>
      <P>"At present, death related to vaccine gets just NT$2 million, "said Steve H.S.
Kuo, director of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH. He added
that the DOH is considering raising the amount.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister  Yaung Chih-liang  also pointed out that the regulation has been in
place for 20 years and needs to be reviewed, although he noted that "the DOH
will not have a final say on the matter, which will require a law revision."</P>
      <P>Kuo said that the DOH convened a three-day meeting starting that day to review
the vaccine relief system in a bid to regain public confidence.</P>
      <P>He noted that the CDC is concerned about the declining interest in getting
immunized, down from an average of 150,000 who were getting the shots before the
panic took hold.</P>
      <P>On reports that military personnel have been given expired seasonal flu shots,
Yaung said the DOH is concerned about the matter and that the Medical Affairs
Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense will address the matter.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, getting expired vaccine "will not pose a health hazard, " but
is "an administrative error" that should be explained by the Medical Affairs
Bureau.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that same day, an H1N1 self-assistance association formed by the
private sector was launched, with DPP Legislator Chen Ying named as convener.</P>
      <P>Chen announced the telephone number 04-24724421 for members of the public to
report any symptoms after being given H1N1 shots.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the CDC has set up a 1922 consultation hotline for the same
purpose, but said that if the public do not want to call that number, it can
call the association instead.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Draft bill allowing referendum on planned expressway turned back</HEADLINE>

12/28/09  18:39:59

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hualien County Council on Monday decided against putting on its agenda a
draft bill that would allow the local government to hold a referendum on the
construction of an expressway connecting the underdeveloped eastern county with
Taiwan's more prosperous areas.</P>
      <P>The council made its decision after newly elected Hualien County Magistrate Fu
Kun-chi said his administration will seek to hold a referendum if the Cabinet
continues to ignore the support among most Hualien residents for the expressway.</P>
      <P>Unfazed by the setback, the Hualien County government vowed to continue its
efforts to create a legal basis for the planned referendum and said it would
submit the bill to the council again in January.</P>
      <P>Fu has long supported building an expressway to replace the existing Suhua
highway, the main single-lane artery connecting Yilan County and Hualien City
that cuts through coastal cliffs and is vulnerable to landslides.</P>
      <P>The government has yet to approve the expressway, however, in part because of
environmental opposition.</P>
      <P>The county council explained that its decision Monday was not based on the
substance of the controversy but on technical grounds. County Councilor Wang
Yen-mei said Fu's administration failed to make the request by the required
deadline.</P>
      <P>It was the third time the council had turned back the draft bill, which was
approved by the county government in 2005 but shelved by the county council
later that year.</P>
      <P>The bill was again submitted to be put on the agenda of a provisional session of
the county council in May 2007, but the request was again rejected.</P>
      <P>Fu, who was elected county magistrate earlier this month, criticized the central
government's plans to upgrade the existing Suhua highway  instead of building  a
new expressway  linking northeastern Taiwan and the county.</P>
      <P>It is the government's job to repair dilapidated highways, Fu said Monday,
adding that the expressway was part of a long-planned central government project
to construct an islandwide  freeway network.</P>
      <P>"Such a project should not be withdrawn for any such reason, or because of
someone's opposition, " he said, urging the Executive Yuan to pay heed to the
wishes of Hualien's residents.</P>
      <P>If the Cabinet continues to ignore the residents' views on this matter, the
county government would consider holding a referendum on the construction of the
expressway, Hu added.</P>
      <P>The controversial Suao-Hualien expressway was proposed more than a decade ago,
but has faced strong opposition by environmental experts and activists who
believe that it will destroy the scenic beauty, flora, fauna and ecological
balance in the area.</P>
      <P>Proponents of the expressway have argued that it will boost the economy in
eastern Taiwan, a region that is relatively underdeveloped and consists mostly
of farming townships.</P>
      <P>Fu won the Dec. 5 local election as an independent candidate with 56 percent of
the vote. One of his campaign slogans was "giving the Hualien people a safe road
home." Fu's big victory was seen as a reflection of the people's desire for an
efficient and safe transport artery that would open up the mountain-ringed
county.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has decided to shelve
its plans for the expressway, and will instead try to fix the Suhua highway,
replacing dangerous sections along coastal cliffs with tunnels.</P>
      <P>However,  the MOTC has not ruled out the possibility  of "upgrading" the Suhua
highway into an expressway in the future, once there is public consensus in
support of this plan.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Monday that no timetable has
been set for allowing local large-size flat-panel makers to set up panel
factories in China and promised that any decision by the government on the issue
will be in Taiwan's best interests.</P>
      <P>Rebutting news reports the previous day that the government had concluded an
inter-ministerial meeting and will conditionally allow the flat panel and
semiconductor industries to invest more in China, Shih said that plan is still
under discussion and has yet to be finalized and approved by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Pan Meng-an accused the
ministry Dec. 26 of making the issue public before a final decision had been
made, a move that he said sent several companies' shares skyrocketing.  He also
lambasted the ministry for indirectly fuelling speculation in the local stock
market.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Wintek Corp, the nation's biggest mobile phone panel
maker, and LED maker Para Light Electronics Co. advanced by their 7 percent
daily maximum limits to NT$25.55 and NT$253.5, respectively.</P>
      <P>Reacting to Pan's criticism, Shih argued that as stock prices are highly
sensitive to the issue, the ministry has been meticulously assessing the
liberalization plan.</P>
      <P>Asked when a final decision will be made, Shih said the situation will become
more clear over the next two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US$30 billion in Chinese funds may enter Taiwan after MOU: FSC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's qualified domestic institutional investors (QDIIs) will be allowed to
invest up to an estimated US$30 billion (NT$968 billion) in Taiwan's stock
market, Taiwan's top financial regulator said Monday, 30 times more than was
originally anticipated.</P>
      <P>Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Sean Chen said the FSC will allow QDII
funds approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) , which have
a combined investment quota of about US$30 billion, to invest in Taiwan once a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) on financial regulatory cooperation between
the two countries takes effect Jan. 16.</P>
      <P>Just over one month ago, Chen said China's QDIIs would be allowed to invest up
to 10 percent of their estimated US$10 billion in assets, or about NT$30
billion, in Taiwan's market.</P>
      <P>China's securities regulator later told the FSC, however, that it would not
impose the 10 percent maximum investment  limit on investments in Taiwan's stock
market, enabling the entire US$30 billion quota to theoretically be injected
into Taiwan, according to FSC officials.</P>
      <P>Chen said the FSC will discuss with other agencies and Taiwan's central bank
whether to impose any upper limit on total QDII investment in the local bourse.</P>
      <P>"We will set an upper limit for total investment (for the QDIIs) in the local
stock market and for individual companies, " Chen said, while responding to
questions from reporters following a legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen did not mention, however, whether the FSC will eventually allow Chinese
QDIIs under a different regulatory regime -- those approved by the China Banking
Regulatory Commission (CBRC) -- with a total investment quota of about US$7.9
billion, to invest in the local stock market.</P>
      <P>Under the MOU, which was signed Nov. 17 and was to take effect within 60 days,
Taiwan and China will also work together to exchange and protect the
confidentiality of information, establish a mechanism to deal with possible
financial crises, and conduct financial examinations, according to the FSC.</P>
      <P>Under existing regulations in China, Chinese QDIIs are only allowed to invest up
to 3 percent of their assets in public and corporate bonds in regions that have
not signed an MOU with China.</P>
      <P>Twelve fund management and securities companies in China have been granted QDII
licenses, though they are only operating nine funds so far.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE)
had granted these QDIIs combined investment quotas of US$33.57 billion, and a
total investment of US$14.5 billion has already been made in overseas markets,
according to SAFE statistics.</P>
      <P>In the first three quarters of this year, the nine QDII funds rose an average of
43.4 percent, statistics show.</P>
      <P>Analysts said increased investment from QDIIs is definitely a bullish factor for
the local stock market in the medium to long term, and they expect leading
electronics issues to benefit the most from Chinese QDII investment.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/28/09  19:49:30</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many of the photographers at Taiwan's largest auto show are aiming their cameras
not just at models of concept cars but also at the show girls who survived a
stringent selection process that began months ago to allow them to shake their
stuff at the show.</P>
      <P>Ann Chen, who is working for Suzuki during the Dec. 26-Jan. 3 biennial Taipei
International Auto Show, said that unlike other types of show, clients
exhibiting at the auto show started looking for models and showgirls much
earlier.</P>
      <P>This year, the process started as early as April.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is also a model agent, said that the size of the new cars on show is
one of the key factors in selecting models.</P>
      <P>"Firms that plan to display large cars prefer tall girls, while those with small
ones choose shorter ones, " she told the CNA Monday.</P>
      <P>The preparation process for the auto show is also longer than other shows, Chen
added. The screening process requested by clients started in July or August this
year, compared with two weeks to two months of preparation for computer and
other shows, she said.</P>
      <P>Every screening interview is a "ruthless" process for the candidates, she said.
"After the screening, you have to learn how to cheer yourself up and go for the
next one if you fail to make the list."</P>
      <P>At the auto show, the 18th of its kind, the models do not just stand there and
smile.</P>
      <P>They have to handle a variety of tasks. "Some need to know how to dance, some
serve as emcees for activities, while others give away small gifts at the
reception desks, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen, who wears a red wig and dresses up as a car-race girl along with seven
colleagues, has to put on a 20-minute performance five times a day during
weekdays and six times on the weekend.</P>
      <P>Models at the auto show often outshine their peers at other shows, Chen
continued, explaining that "the event takes place twice a year, so the car
companies focus very much on the looks and temperament of the models."</P>
      <P>Another key element in the presentation of models and showgirls is their
costumes, which are tailor-made to go with the cars on display.</P>
      <P>"Attention has to be paid to every little detail of the costumes. For example,
the car logo must always be seen and visible in photos, no matter how the girls
pose, " said Coraline Lin, the publicist for the event.</P>
      <P>It costs NT$6,000 (about US$186) to NT$15,000 on average to hire a model for a
day in Taiwan, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, not every car company uses models or showgirls as the principal
means to help promote their products.</P>
      <P>Firms such as Audi and Porsche prefer to appeal to visitors by focusing less on
dancing showgirls and more on setting up VIP rooms where visitors can have a
seat and enjoy a complimentary dessert.</P>
      <P>This tactic might work on Jean-Francois Fort, a French car fan who was surprised
to see so many people pointing their cameras at the girls rather than at the
cars, and the long line of people waiting to have their photo taken with the
girls.</P>
      <P>"They should at least take some photos of the cars," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Driven by speculation, property rebound may not last: scholar</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The domestic property market showed signs of recovery in the third quarter after
a year-long recession, but a scholar cautioned Friday that the rebound has been
driven by speculation and may be a short-lived phenomenon.</P>
      <P>"Excess capital and high expectations are creating conditions that could cast a
cloud over the market in the future, " said Chin-oh Chang, a professor in
National Chengchi University's Department of Land Economics.</P>
      <P>"Excess capital could push interest rates higher while high expectations have
led to an oversupply of new developments and inventory, " he said, referring to
a potential move by the central bank to soak up liquidity in the property and
equity markets by raising basic rates.</P>
      <P>According to a report released by the Architecture and Building Research
Institute under the Ministry of the Interior, the composite monitoring indicator
for the domestic real estate market reached 10 points to qualify for a yellow-
blue light, signaling that the market may finally be leaving the recession
behind.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time in a year that the property market has emerged from its
slump after showing a gloomy blue light for four straight quarters.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the report, Chang said the market rebound was mainly spurred by a
substantial rise in investment, but he cautioned that the market reversal could
be merely an ephemeral phenomenon.</P>
      <P>"Further observation is needed to determine whether the upward trend can be
sustained," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The third-quarter property market performance rose three points from the
previous quarter, with the transaction volume index gaining one point and that
of the total acreage of construction licenses issued during the three-month
period up two points.</P>
      <P>The utilization rate of residential housing and the standard unit price of new
development projects remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Citing the report, Chang said the increase in the number of approved
construction licenses during the quarter was most noteworthy because it will
create pressure in the future to move inventory and lead to a new wave of buyers
saddled with mortgage payments.</P>
      <P>"The upward trend indicates that housing buyers will face payment pressure when
construction is completed, " Chang said, predicting that the pressure will be
most conspicuous in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In retrospect, Chang said, the local housing market was stagnant in the first
quarter, turned a bit better in the second quarter and then gathered more
momentum in the third quarter, during which transaction volume increased and
prices stabilized, except for some places where prices posted mild declines.</P>
      <P>As to future market prospects, Chang said, several factors may contribute  to
market stability,  including a general economic recovery, a rebound in consumer
confidence, "one house in lifetime" land increment tax incentives, and the
anticipated signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement.</P>
      <P>Negative factors cited included lower than expected Chinese investment in the
local property market, high unemployment and a high ratio of unoccupied office
space.</P>

in a mainstream  Panamanian media of Taiwan's "traditional checkbook diplomacy,
" which claimed that Taiwan donated aircraft to Panama this year worth US$40
million.</P>
      <P>In a report Dec. 27, the Panamanian newspaper "La Prensa" described the aircraft
as a gift to please Panama's new President Ricardo Martinelli, who did not
assume office until July.</P>
      <P>That raised the concerns  of lawmakers  of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, who voiced suspicions that the donation may have involved corruption.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy Yang told the suspicious lawmakers, however,
that it was the new Panamanian government that asked Taiwan for help in
replacing rescue helicopters that needed to be replaced.</P>
      <P>After evaluating Panama's need for such aircraft to transport sick people living
on remote areas to urban hospitals, the government decided to make the donation,
Yang said, noting that a public ceremony was even held to mark the aid handover.</P>
      <P>The aid program was "totally open to the public and transparent" and met the
president's principles on foreign aid, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Yang said he "believes there was no corruption involved" in the case but added
that he would still look into the case.</P>

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs will work with local governments and groups to
stage performances on a regular basis around Taiwan over the next six months to
appeal to tourists visiting Taiwan, CCA Minister Emile Sheng said Monday.</P>
      <P>The CCA devised the plan in part to stimulate local cultural and creative
industries, which have been designated as one of six emerging sectors for
priority development, and also to help boost local tourism, Sheng said.</P>
      <P>The CCA is also considering incorporating  the performance schedules into travel
itineraries prepared by local travel agencies for inbound tourists to enable
them to visit Taiwan's popular tourist destinations and enjoy performances
staged by local groups at the same time, Sheng added.</P>
      <P>He said he plans to make programs with local characteristics -- to be provided
by various city and county governments -- part of the activities for the 100th
anniversary celebrations of the Republic of China in 2011 and show visitors from
home and abroad Taiwan's cultural power.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to grab more international attention, the agency is also planning to
transform the government-funded Formosa festival activities, which have been
staged separately by various cities and counties around the country, into a
bigger, national festival that combines tourism, arts and travel, Sheng added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced Monday that major enterprises
with annual turnover of NT$1 billion can double the number of Chinese
businessmen they invite to Taiwan to 800.</P>
      <P>The new measure is aimed at giving impetus to the nation's convention and
exhibition industry, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Under existing regulations, domestic enterprises with turnover between NT$10
million and NT$30 million can invite 45 Chinese nationals to visit Taiwan per
year, while those with turnover exceeding NT$30 million can invite 400 Chinese
nationals.</P>
      <P>But to give fresh impetus to cross-strait trade and get more Chinese businessmen
to visit Taiwan, the National Immigration Agency and the MOEA plan to let major
businesses with annual turnover exceeding NT$1 billion to double the number of
Chinese they can invite to 800.</P>
      <P>The measure is expected to be put into practice next year.</P>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade under the MOEA began this year to promote a four-year
exhibition and convention industry development plan because of its high
potential for added value in terms of benefits for the peripheral tourism,
hospitality and insurance sectors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top financial regulator said Monday that Taiwan will benefit if the
financial services sector is included in the early harvest program of the
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen said that signing the
ECFA with China is one way to prevent Taiwan's financial services sector from
being treated unfavorably.</P>
      <P>"If the signing of the ECFA is delayed, I will be worried and sorry about it,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The ECFA is on the agenda  of the next formal round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks
scheduled for next spring. In negotiations leading up to that meeting,
representatives of the two sides will exchange lists of products they hope will
be covered by an early harvest program under the trade deal.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Monday that there will be
about 500 items included in the early harvest list, mostly involving the
petrochemical, textile, machinery and auto parts industries.</P>
      <P>Shih also noted that formal ECFA negotiations will be held in January at the
earliest.</P>
      <P>Some experts have said that including the financial services sector in the early
harvest program will bring about reciprocal market openings while not violating
WTO guidelines and regulations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen also said the two sides have not yet discussed the number of
Chinese banks that will be allowed to enter Taiwan's market.</P>
      <P>It is not appropriate to set the number in the regulations, said Chen, when
questioned by ruling Kuomingtang (KMT) Legislator Sun Ta-chien at a legislative
committee hearing.</P>
      <P>Chen said signing the ECFA is like building a highway, with the question of how
many banks will be allowed to enter Taiwan to be controlled similar to the way
traffic volume is controlled by regulating access on entry ramps.</P>
      <P>Under the memorandum of understanding  (MOU)  on financial regulatory
cooperation sealed by both sides in November, which will take effect Jan. 16,
each side will be allowed to set up bank branches in the other's territory and
once further agreements are signed, could allow each side to invest in the
other's banks.</P>
      <P>Chen mentioned last month that during the first stage after the MOU takes
effect, Chinese banks will only be allowed to set up branches in Taiwan. The FSC
will need to see how negotiations on the ECFA's  early harvest  list progress
before revising  related regulations to further open the market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan's economic recovery has continued gathering pace, wage levels
are not expected to rise until the second half of next year, an official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>"Our wage levels are indeed unusually low as they have been declining for
several years, " said Hu Chung-ying, vice chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>He attributed the steady fall to a combination of factors, including ever
slimmer profits from electronic OEM orders, mounting competition  from cheap
Chinese goods and changes in Taiwan's industrial structure.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a global economic recovery,  the CEPD's overall monitoring  indicator
for Taiwan's economic climate flashed a "yellow-red" light in November, marking
the first time in 25 months that the country's economic activity has been seen
as heating up.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announcing last week a 15
percent pay raise for its employees from next year, many wage earners are
expecting similar good news.</P>
      <P>Hu said if local companies post stable gains as the global economic recovery
gains momentum, they will more likely raise their employees' salaries or wages.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the current trend, domestic wage levels will rebound in the second
half of 2010," he predicted.</P>
      <P>Hu said the electronics sector is expected to lead the way in raising pay
levels, followed by the financial sector.</P>
      <P>Conventional industries and the public sector may lag behind in adjusting pay
rates, he predicted.</P>
      <P>The CEPD official said rising pay levels are critical to economic growth because
only with gains in income will private consumption see substantial growth.</P>
      <P>That may take some time, however, according to Hu, who observed that wage levels
are generally adjusted only after the economy bottoms out of a recession and
grows steadily for two consecutive quarters.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economy began to show signs of recovery in October, when
the monitoring indicator flashed a green light to signal stable growth, Chang
said November's "yellow-red" light indicated that the economy's recovery is on a
steady track.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, in his capacity as Kuomintang chairman, will tour Taiwan
early next year to thank voters for their support in the Dec. 5 local elections

      <P>Ma will first visit Taoyuan, Taitung and Taichung counties, where legislative
by-elections are to be held Jan. 9, to drum up support for KMT candidates, said

      <P>During his tour, which will last until Feb. 21, 2010, Ma will meet with KMT

      <P>Four Taiwanese fishermen detained by Myanmar's military for more than a month
were released with the assistance of Taiwanese businessmen after paying a fine
and returned to Taiwan on a China Airlines flight Monday evening, according to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-yi and Huang Shih-cheng, skippers of the Donggang-based fishing boats Ho
Yi Fa and Ming Cheng Yi respectively, and Chen Wan-yi and Pan Chih-nan, crew
members the Taiwanese fishing boats Hung Fa 128 and Ching Ming Tsai 130, were
detained by Myanmar authorities for entering the country's waters without
permission.</P>
      <P>The four were sentenced by a Myanmar court to an unspecified jail term and fined
on Dec. 12. They were released after paying the fine, set at US$200 for each
skipper and US$20 per crew member, but the fishing boats were confiscated by
Myanmar.</P>
      <P>The families said they were thrilled by the news of the four men's release, but
Hsu's wife could not help lamenting over losing the Ho Yi Fa, which cost them
over NT$10 million to build 10 years ago and an additional NT$3 million that was
invested in the vessel before its most recent fishing mission.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was notified in late November that four

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan's economic recovery has continued gathering pace, wage levels
are not expected to rise until the second half of next year, an official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>"Our wage levels are indeed unusually low as they have been declining for
several years, " said Hu Chung-ying, vice chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>He attributed the steady fall to a combination of factors, including ever
slimmer profits from electronic OEM orders, mounting competition  from cheap
Chinese goods and changes in Taiwan's industrial structure.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a global economic recovery,  the CEPD's overall monitoring  indicator
for Taiwan's economic climate flashed a "yellow-red" light in November, marking
the first time in 25 months that the country's economic activity has been seen
as heating up.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announcing last week a 15
percent pay raise for its employees from next year, many wage earners are
expecting similar good news.</P>
      <P>Hu said if local companies post stable gains as the global economic recovery
gains momentum, they will more likely raise their employees' salaries or wages.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the current trend, domestic wage levels will rebound in the second
half of 2010," he predicted.</P>
      <P>Hu said the electronics sector is expected to lead the way in raising pay
levels, followed by the financial sector.</P>
      <P>Conventional industries and the public sector may lag behind in adjusting pay
rates, he predicted.</P>
      <P>The CEPD official said rising pay levels are critical to economic growth because
only with gains in income will private consumption see substantial growth.</P>
      <P>That may take some time, however, according to Hu, who observed that wage levels
are generally adjusted only after the economy bottoms out of a recession and
grows steadily for two consecutive quarters.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's economy began to show signs of recovery in October, when
the monitoring indicator flashed a green light to signal stable growth, Chang
said November's "yellow-red" light indicated that the economy's recovery is on a
steady track.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, in his capacity as Kuomintang chairman, will tour Taiwan
early next year to thank voters for their support in the Dec. 5 local elections
and stump for party candidates in the upcoming legislative by-elections, a KMT
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma will first visit Taoyuan, Taitung and Taichung counties, where legislative
by-elections are to be held Jan. 9, to drum up support for KMT candidates, said
Lee Chien-jung, the head of the party's Culture and Communications Committee,
after a KMT meeting hosted by KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung.</P>
      <P>During his tour, which will last until Feb. 21, 2010, Ma will meet with KMT
supporters at New Year's gatherings organized by the KMT in various cities and
counties around Taiwan, Lee added.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Lu Hsueh-chang said during the meeting that the caucus will
convene a delegation to campaign for KMT hopefuls in the by-elections, according
to Lee.</P>
      <P>Under the KMT plan, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-Pyng and Deputy Speaker Tseng
Yung- chuan and Premier Wu Den-yih will organize election activities for Kuang
Li-chen, who will represent the KMT in the Taitung County legislative by-
election, Lee said.</P>
      <P>She hopes to fill the seat vacated by Justin Huang, who was elected Taitung
County magistrate on Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>KMT Honorary Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu and Taoyuan
County Magistrate John Chih-yang Wu will lend their support to Chen Li-ling, the
KMT's candidate in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The seat was previously held by the party's Liao Cheng-ching, whose election was
invalidated after he was convicted of vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local KMT grassroots leaders will throw their support behind Yu Wen-
chin, the mayor of Taiping in Taichung County, who will run there for the seat
previously held by the KMT's Chiang Lien-fu, Lee said.</P>

      <P>Four Taiwanese fishermen detained by Myanmar's military for more than a month
were released with the assistance of Taiwanese businessmen after paying a fine
and returned to Taiwan on a China Airlines flight Monday evening, according to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-yi and Huang Shih-cheng, skippers of the Donggang-based fishing boats Ho
Yi Fa and Ming Cheng Yi respectively, and Chen Wan-yi and Pan Chih-nan, crew
members the Taiwanese fishing boats Hung Fa 128 and Ching Ming Tsai 130, were
detained by Myanmar authorities for entering the country's waters without
permission.</P>
      <P>The four were sentenced by a Myanmar court to an unspecified jail term and fined
on Dec. 12. They were released after paying the fine, set at US$200 for each
skipper and US$20 per crew member, but the fishing boats were confiscated by
Myanmar.</P>
      <P>The families said they were thrilled by the news of the four men's release, but
Hsu's wife could not help lamenting over losing the Ho Yi Fa, which cost them
over NT$10 million to build 10 years ago and an additional NT$3 million that was
invested in the vessel before its most recent fishing mission.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was notified in late November that four
Taiwanese fishing trawlers were captured by the Myanmar military.</P>
      <P>After confirming that there were four Taiwanese among the crew members, the
ministry went through various channels to communicate with the Myanmar
authorities and ensure the fishermen's safety.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy seems to be gaining momentum after its deepest slump in
history. The overall economic monitoring indicator flashed a "yellow-red" light
for November for the first time in 25 months, indicating that the rebound is on
a steady track. Leading firms have also recently announced salary hikes. But
will this rebound last or will it be short-lived?</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Thanks to a global economic recovery, the government's overall monitoring
indicator for Taiwan's economy flashed a "yellow-red" light in November, marking
the first time in 25 months that the country's economy has been seen as heating
up.</P>
      <P>According to a poll conducted by National Central University, Taiwan's
consumer's confidence index also rose to 65.39 points in December, marking a
five-month high.</P>
      <P>The recovery is similar to the rebound seen by Taiwan more than a year after the
SARS crisis struck in 2003.</P>
      <P>Wage levels, however, are not expected to rise until the second half of next
year even though Taiwan's economic recovery has continued to pick up momentum,
said Hu Chung-ying, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) . (Dec. 29, 2009)</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwan's leading high-tech companies have announced pay raise plans one after
another on prospects that production will increase in line with a global
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract
chipmaker, announced in mid-December that it would raise employee salaries
across the board by 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Foxconn, part of the Hon Hai Grop, the world's largest contract maker of
consumer electronics by revenue, announced over the weekend that it will raise
wages by no less than 3 percent beginning next year.</P>
      <P>Because Foxconn is seen as a benchmark of Taiwanese business operations in
China, its move to raise the pay of blue collar workers could be emulated by
other Taiwanese companies in China. (Dec. 29, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Discounting the CEPD's rosy forecast as "way off base, " some people said they
are not feeling the recovery at all.</P>
      <P>A Mr. Wu, a publishing company employee, was furious with the CEPD's "yellow-
red" light economic indicator, saying that he and his colleagues have suffered
from the bad economy over the past two years and were even forced to sign a
"voluntary pay cut agreement" recently.</P>
      <P>Wu said he and his colleagues quit en masse a few days ago after their
negotiations with the company's management broke down.</P>
      <P>"Has the economy recovered?  The government  shouldn't lie anymore," the
employee said. (Dec. 29, 2009)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A report of the Tax Reform Committee indicates that Taiwan's short-term tax
revenues are dropping while long-term tax revenues are "extremely uncertain."
But the tax disaster is not over yet, as business and industrial groups are
lobbying to get a tax cut act approved by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Under the strong lobbying of heavyweight entrepreneurs, the Executive Yuan and
the Legislative Yuan hope to lower the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent
for big international corporations which locate their operational headquarters
in Taiwan. If the proposed "industrial innovation act" passes the Legislature,
big domestic corporations will be the real beneficiaries, and the national
treasury the loser, as tax revenues will be sacrificed.</P>
      <P>Different from Singapore and Hong Kong, Taiwan has a wide spectrum of
industries, but rather than creating incentives for foreign corporations to help
with the fundamental restructuring of local industry, the government is trying
to copy the model of "transit trade zones."</P>
      <P>The preferential treatment for operational centers is in fact a tax cut for big
Taiwanese enterprises, in the name of attracting international corporations to
invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Let's remind the administration that the government is sitting on a huge debt,
and that when international corporations decide on investing in Taiwan, they
will weigh the overall environment more heavily than their costs.</P>

      <P>is reviewing its compensation mechanism for H1N1 vaccine victims after reports
of adverse reactions to the vaccine, including deaths and miscarriages by
pregnant women, have emerged.</P>
      <P>The government hopes the review will allay misgivings about the immunization
program and regain public confidence at a time when the number of people getting
the H1N1 flu shot has declined markedly while the number of people hospitalized
is on the rise.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Monday that the DOH is making an overall
review of the relief system for immunization victims, and that the compensation
for deaths related to vaccinations will be raised from the present NT$2 million,
which has been the rule for the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>He said that the government currently only provides relief to patients whose
adverse reaction is confirmed as being "related to" or "cannot rule out being
related to" the flu shot, but it will now consider expanding the provision to
other kinds of victims. (Dec. 29, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Steve Kuo, director general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said
Monday that although the number of reported H1N1 cases has declined, the number
of those getting vaccinated on a daily basis has also declined, and he is
worried about the overall effect of the fight against the disease.</P>
      <P>"Public  concern  about vaccine safety is far higher than imagined," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Thirty-one people have applied for relief compensation after adverse reactions
to the H1N1 vaccine. But all eight cases that have been reviewed so far were
denied compensation.</P>
      <P>Legislators are concerned about the situation and have asked the DOH to make
public the list of screening panel members and the statements of the members to
ensure the transparency and fairness of the screening process. They also asked
for the compensation for those who die after being vaccinated to be raised to
NT$10 million. (Dec. 29, 2009)</P>

      <P>Since Ma Ying-jeou assumed the chairmanship of Kuomintang on Oct. 19, he has
consolidated the power,  money and brains of the administration and the party.</P>
      <P>However, two incidents in the past two months reveal the bankruptcy of his
credibility. On Dec. 5, the KMT suffered a serious setback in local elections.
During the latest round of cross-strait negotiations,  the  KMT  old guard's
denunciation  of the Ma administration became the main show and the curtain has
yet to be drawn on "League A vs. League C" farce.</P>
      <P>How come a president with such a high position could have lost his grip so
easily? Why is it that the Ma Ying-jeou phenomenon is fleeting? This could
become a much talked about topic as people observe the next step in Taiwan's
political evolution.</P>
      <P>The soap opera in which Lien Chan, James Soong, Chen Yunlin and Ma's
subordinates all have their roles can be seen as a preface of the show. It
doesn't matter who belongs to League A or League C. The truth is that no one
sees Ma as a member of the A League and Ma himself has failed to be a member of
the A League.</P>
      <P>For an administration relying on the support of China, in theory, it should be
able to create "the Santa Claus Effect" of gaining a boost after a round of
negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Chinese Communists. Nevertheless, a
magazine opinion poll after the Chiang-Chen negotiations indicated that the
KMT's credibility is edging nearer to that of the Democratic Progressive Party.
Ma has taken all the possible steps to regain momentum --  assuming chairmanship
of the ruling party, summoning his "switchblade" friend to help, and inviting an
imperial commissioner. However, he was not able to reverse the situation.</P>
      <P>There is one and only reason for that -- Ma himself has led to his own downfall.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) on Tuesday published a study on weather changes
in Taiwan over the past century, which showed that local temperatures had risen
by an average of 0.8 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>The average temperature rose by 1.2 degrees in plains areas and 1.4 degrees in
metropolitan areas, according to the study, which compiled weather change
statistics between 1897 and 2008.</P>
      <P>One noteworthy finding was that the minimum temperature increased by 2.1 degrees
while the maximum temperature rose by 0.7 degrees on average in metropolitan
areas.</P>
      <P>"The gap shows that the increase in temperatures at night was greater than in
the daytime," a CWB official said.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that affected by global warming, Taiwan's isotherms have
been pushed northwards by around 150 kilometers.</P>
      <P>The warming trend also has affected mountain areas, with the average temperature
in mountainous areas rising by around 0.6 degrees, and has also lifted the
critical altitude for living animals by about 100 meters from a century ago.</P>
      <P>The CWB also confirmed the general feelings of many local residents: winters are
not quite as cold as they have been in the past and the rest of the year is
getting warmer.</P>
      <P>Over the past five decades, the number of days with temperature lows falling
below 10 degrees Celsius fell by 19 days in mountainous areas but only one day
in low-lying areas.</P>
      <P>But the number of days with temperatures rising to more than 30 degrees Celsius
increased by 28 days in Taiwan proper, though only two days in mountainous
areas, and 41 days in its outlying islands.</P>
      <P>Though temperatures were up, the amount of sun most parts of Taiwan have
received has been on the decline, which the CWB attributed to air pollution and
suspended particles that had blocked the sunshine.</P>
      <P>The CWB found that sunny hours on average fell by 176 hours per year in northern
Taiwan, 552 hours per year in central Taiwan, 294 hours per year in eastern
Taiwan and 417 hours per year in southern Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors  recently indicted 22 people,  including former President Chen Shui-
bian, his wife, five family members and 15 others after concluding its probe
into the controversial financial reforms initiated by Chen.</P>
      <P>The indictment against Chen accused the former president of receiving bribes
from a business tycoon to help him lay his hands on KMT assets, just as Chen was
campaigning against the ill-gotten KMT assets of the Kuomintang during his re-
election bid in late 2003.</P>
      <P>The Yuanta Group headed by Rudy Ma wanted to buy KMT-owned China Investment
Corp., because the latter controlled Fuhwa Financial Holdings, which Yuanta
coveted to help it expand.</P>
      <P>Yuanta first approached Chen by donating NT$20 million to his re-election
campaign. After Chen won re-election, Ma visited the former president to inquire
if he could buy China Investment Corp. but was told to gain control of the
company by buying China Investment shares on the stock exchange.</P>
      <P>That strategy, however, would have pushed up the price of China Investment
shares, which Yuanta did not want.</P>
      <P>Yuanta then planted an "industrial spy" in China Investment to remain informed
on the KMT's attempt to sell the company to another business group headed by the
Koo family.</P>
      <P>After learning that the Koo family was about to strike a deal with Fuhwa, Ma
sent an envoy to the presidential residence to directly seek Chen's support, and
former first lady Wu Shu-jen then asked for NT$200 million to help him clinch
the deal.</P>
      <P>One might ask if Chen only became corrupt after his first term, but that is not
the case. When Chen first became president, he asked for money from Tsai Hong-tu
of Cathay Financial Holdings. Tsai paid NT$400 million over four years, which
helped him beat a strong rival to acquire a major bank.</P>
      <P>For Chen, the mantra "power corrupts" should be revised to "power corrupts
immediately."</P>

      <P>Encouraged by the results of overseas trade fairs in 2009, Taiwan's Ministry of

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sarcastic rhetoric pitting "A League vs. C. League" has become the most
heated topic after the fourth round of Chiang-Chen negotiations.</P>
      <P>No one can deny that in a democratic society, people should be classified in the
"A League." Regretfully, however, people only get "A League" treatment during
elections and are forsaken immediately after elections. How many politicians
really care for the welfare of the people?</P>
      <P>Taking the case of U.S. beef import debates at the legislature, it was two
months after the government announced the signing a protocol to relax
restrictions on beef imports from the U.S. that the man in charge, National
Security Council Secretary-general Su Chi, appeared at a briefing for the first
time to "communicate" with the press.</P>
      <P>Su suggested in a close to "threatening" tone that should the Legislative Yuan
revise the Act Governing Food Sanitation in relation to imports of U.S. beef,
and the version it adopts violates the protocol, Taiwan may face retaliation
from the U.S.</P>
      <P>For those who did not know that Su is a Taiwanese official, they might have
thought of him as a representative of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
delivering an "imperial message."</P>
      <P>Su also spoke of the case of South Korea.  Indeed,  the administration  of Ma
Ying-jeou  should learn from the Korean experience. Last year, after announcing
his administration would lift ban on U.S. beef imports, Korean President Lee
Myung-bak faced mass demonstrations, a paralyzed Congress, a setback in local
elections and a Cabinet reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Lee apologized twice to the Korean people before an agreement was finally
reached between the administration and the Congress to revise the law,  giving
more power to the Congress  in beef import supervision.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, if not for the fury of the public, the administration
would not have adopted the so-called "three control, five certification"
measures to control beef imports from the U.S.</P>
      <P>Is it that Taiwanese people can only resort to self-assistance? Is it that the
high ranking officials will only take people seriously as "A League" when they
resort to referendums or take to the streets?</P>

      <P>Three medical doctors who have admitted to colluding with patients in defrauding
some NT$80 million (US$2.48 million) from insurance companies may have their
licenses revoked and be expelled from the profession forever, medical officials
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yang Chao-jan, a physician with the Department of Health's (DOH) Keelung
Hospital, Lai Teh-hsing, a surgeon with Yee Zen General Hosptial in Taoyuan
County, and Wu Kuo-ching, a surgeon with St. Joseph's Hospital in Yunlin County,
have been indicted by the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office for fraud, along
with seven others who acted as patients, according to DOH Minister Yaung Chih-
liang.</P>
      <P>More medical workers remain under investigation in the same fraud case, which
involves more than 10 health care institutions and could end up being the
largest medical scandal in Taiwan's history, Yaung said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>The accused doctors colluded with a fraud ring headed by a man identified as Fu
Chien-sen, who since 2003 has orchestrated fake medical treatment records with
doctored diagnoses and surgery reports to claim cancer payments from life
insurance companies.</P>
      <P>"The trick was using fake diagnoses and surgery reports as well as samples
stolen from cancer patients to make the fraudulent insurance claims," Yaung
noted.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, ring leader Fu Chien-sen himself had hemorrhoids  removed
at a hospital,  but he filed claims for reimbursement of cancer treatments that
included certificates showing he had an operation and received chemotheropy for
rectum cancer.</P>
      <P>Shih Chung-liang, director of the DOH Bureau of Medical Affairs, said the three
disgraced doctors and the seven fake patients have defrauded between NT$60
million and NT$80 million from insurance companies.</P>
      <P>Other individuals still under investigation, including four doctors, may have
defrauded another NT$100 million from insurers.</P>
      <P>Yang Chao-jan has been given two major demerits and relieved of his duties by
DOH Keelung Hospital, Shih said, while the DOH has also notified Yee Zen General
Hosptial and St. Joseph's Hospital to deal with Dr. Lai and Dr. Wu accordingly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both Lee Ming-ping, chairman of the Taiwan Medical Association and Wu
Teh-lang,  chairman of the Taiwan Hosptial Association, expressed support for
the DOH's decision to have the three doctors' licenses revoked as punishment.</P>
      <P>"It means that the three will not be able to practice their profession for the
rest of their lives," Shih said.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/29/09  15:43:45
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since the inauguration of the Ma administration, the pace of cross-strait
liberalization has accelerated, but the agreements covering the opening reached
to date have been simple in nature with less impact on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the Ministry of Economic Affairs now working on easing restrictions on
high-tech investment in China, some media and scholars have expressed concern.</P>
      <P>They contend that if the government eases restrictions while allowing Taiwanese
businessmen operating in China to return to Taiwan and issue TDRs, all of
Taiwan's capital will be soaked up. Without increasing investment in Taiwan, the
moves would also lead to a rapid freezing of Taiwan's economic growth.</P>
      <P>But in reality, capital is not a problem in Taiwan. Since the global economic
crisis erupted, central banks have adopted loose monetary policies that have
left investors awash in money, and stock and real estate markets have thrived.</P>
      <P>What could cause a rapid freezing of Taiwan's economic growth is insufficient
momentum for investment and a lack of economic strength.</P>
      <P>We are worried that as China maintains its vibrant economy, Taiwan will be
stalled by its declining exports.</P>
      <P>Also, as Taiwan opens up to Chinese businesses, they could buy into enterprises
with high potential, which could undermine Taiwan's economy even further.</P>
      <P>At this critical juncture, the government should make good use of its edge in
certain industries, geographical location and economic structure to revitalize
its economy, and pool social resources to help medium-sized enterprises with
potential take advantage of China's vast market.</P>
      <P>We simply wonder if the government is capable of doing that.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan's tax revenue fell sharply this year, Finance Minister Lee Sush-
der said Tuesday that taxes cannot be raised at present and will only be
increased during a strong economy under the proper conditions.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that the Executive Yuan's Tax Reform Committee has been unable to
launch tax hikes during the past 18 months because of the economic downturn,
which caused the sharp decline in tax revenue.</P>
      <P>Hit hard by the global economic slump, Taiwan should be seen as a patient that
needs to be cared for to regain its strength.</P>
      <P>"What a patient needs most is to take medicine or get a shot. How can there be
talk of raising taxes at this point in time? " Lee said in answering reporters'
questions.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that the government's reluctance to raise taxes now does not
mean it will not do so in the future.</P>
      <P>"As long as the economy is good and the conditions are right, the finance
ministry will naturally follow the trend and raise taxes, " he said.</P>
      <P>Lee also said the government will take a long-term view of tax hikes. Although
the number of tax categories has fallen since 2001, total tax revenue has still
risen by NT$500-600 billion, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's net tax revenue in the first 11 months of this year totaled NT$1.43
trillion, a decline of 14.6 percent, the largest in the country's history.</P>
      <P>Revenue from corporate and personal income taxes, which account for almost 50
percent of the country's total tax revenue, was down 24 percent during the 11
month-period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New green idea: building solar-powered greenhouses on fallow land</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Noting that there are around 200,000 hectares of fallow land around Taiwan, the
Environmental Protection Administration  (EPA)  minister suggested Tuesday that
building "photonics greenhouses" on such land as part of efforts to promote the
development of renewable energy would be a good policy.</P>
      <P>Such facilities can not only use solar energy to generate power but can also be
used to raise valuable cash crops such as orchids, said Stephen Shu-hung Shen in
an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>Shen said photonics greenhouses use photonic technology in which light- pervious
thin-film solar cell panels are installed on the roofs of the facilities.</P>
      <P>These cells are capable of separating blue-green light from the red-orange part
of the spectrum and using it to generate power, while taking advantage of the
heat emitted from the red-orange rays to warm the greenhouses, Shen said.</P>
      <P>If all the fallow land around the country could be used to house such
greenhouses, they could not only provide generous power to neighboring areas but
could also serve to raise crops with high economic value, he added.</P>
      <P>The minister also disclosed that the EPA is in contact with the German
government, which is experienced in the development of renewable energy, and is
seeking its assistance in sending experts and scholars to Taiwan to share their
knowledge and experience in the field.</P>
      <P>The EPA is also hoping to host a forum in Taipei in April with the participation
of those foreign experts, Shen added.</P>

      <P>As the stock market index is an objective indicator while the consumer
confidence index, on the other hand, reflects a subjective notifier, with both
ascending, Taiwan's economy seems to be on its way out of the depression caused

adopting a "cautiously optimistic" attitude.</P>
      <P>Between the rising consumer confidence and the climbing of stock prices, there

      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and the Chunghwa Post
Company will collaborate to launch an online platform that aims to be the "last
mile" in helping local  small-  and medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  to reach
international buyers.</P>
      <P>TAITRA and Chunghwa announced Tuesday that they will launch a joint integrated
service Jan. 1 that provides information flow, logistics and payment flow on a
single online platform.</P>
      <P>"With 80,000 members and over 1.2 million international buyers in the database,
TAITRA's Web site will be able to integrate the services of Chunghwa Post, which
has long been known for its logistics expertise and success to help Taiwan's
SMEs, " said TAITRA Chairman Wang Chih-kang.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that SMEs account for 98 percent of Taiwanese enterprises and have
been the pillar of Taiwan's economy for decades, but most smaller companies have
problems finding foreign buyers, especially in China.</P>
      <P>With the platform, Chunghwa Post provides an express mail service network that
covers 103 countries, a 10 percent to 25 percent mail delivery discount and an
online payment service so businesses can cut down on their logistics expenses by
using this one-stop shop, said Chunghwa Post Chairman Oliver Yu.</P>
      <P>The service is expected  to benefit Taiwanese  businesses, especially to those
trying to flex their muscles in China, since China-bound exports account for 40
percent of Taiwan's overall exports, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The business-to-business platform will focus on the China market, he went on.
The Taiwantrade Web site has launched a version in simplified Chinese and has
worked with Taobao.com and Eachnet.com -- two of the largest online shopping Web
sites in China -- to set up online accounts for Taiwanese companies.</P>
      <P>After a nosedive in the second half of 2008 and the ensuing global crisis, Wang
said, Taiwan's exports are on the way to recovery, with the total export value
surpassing NT$20 billion in November -- the highest figure for the last 13
months.</P>
      <P>"TAITRA's aim is to promote Taiwanese products and to assist Taiwanese
businessmen to reach out to as many customers as possible," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
12/29/09  18:51:05
(By Tang Pei-chun and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has decided to target China, Indonesia,
India and Vietnam for its 2010 market exploration efforts through a fair price-
branding strategy, Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang told a year-end
news conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The MOEA hopes to win customers'  trust  and to control distribution channels
by promoting fairly priced high-end Taiwanese products in emerging markets
through trade fairs, particularly in those four countries, through a branding
strategy that will build Taiwan into a global operations hub," said Shih.</P>
      <P>Predicting that the global economy will gradually regain momentum next year and
will begin posting positive growth, Shih said emerging countries, rather than
developed states, will play the role as the growth engine driving up the
international economy.</P>
      <P>Citing data compiled by the International Monetary Fund, Shih reported that
China and India will become the world's second-largest and fifth-largest
consuming powers by 2015, respectively.</P>
      <P>Although this might sound an amazing development to many, the minister said it
serves as a sign that Taiwan-based enterprises should seize the immense business
opportunities that will arise from these markets.</P>
      <P>The ascendance of the middle class in these emerging markets also points to the
popularity of "fair price luxury" style and value-added products, providing
Taiwan with a chance to tap into these markets with its high-end but inexpensive
goods, he explained.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign
Trade, the bureau will earmark NT$2 billion (US$ 61.53 million) to NT$3 billion
in each of the coming three years to help subsidize the local industries that
will be impacted by a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China and to help them break into the emerging markets.</P>
      <P>Shih also announced that electricity and water rates will not be increased next
year, while the existing transparent floating oil pricing system will also be
maintained in response to international oil price fluctuations.</P>
      <P>In response to a low approval rating that he received in a public opinion survey
conducted by the China Times daily, the economic minister ascribed it to
Taiwan's economic sluggishness and promised to fully carry out his duties to
revive the economy.</P>
      <P>Regarding the government's stance on whether local large-size flat-panel display
and semiconductor companies will be permitted to set up factories in China, the
minister said that a relaxation on existing restrictions must be approved by the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>"The issue is still being studied by relevant government agencies and has yet to
gain final approval from the Executive Yuan, " he noted.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the government will allow more investment from
China, Shih said the MOEA has been assessing the feasibility of a second-stage
opening after it made the first-stage opening on a trial basis in late June.</P>
      <P>Commenting on pressure from the Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee, which
wants the MOEA not to support a merger of the DRAM industry through an
investment of NT$8.1 billion by the National Development Fund to form a Taiwan
Innovative Memory Company (TIMC) , Shih said the MOEA will continue to persuade
lawmakers not to block the merger plan until the legislature has made a final
decision.</P>
      <P>"Should the Legislative Yuan eventually decide to halt the plan, the MOEA will
iron out an alternative policy, such as putting forth a reconstruction law, to
deal with the development needs of the DRAM industry, " he said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Shih asked legislators to reverse their decision to save the
local DRAM industry, but ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers criticized the plan
as a money-losing proposition that has been debated since the beginning of the
year.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a resolution in mid November blocking NT$4.9 billion
in funding for the TIMC -- a brainchild of the government to consolidate
Taiwan's financially troubled DRAM industry by seeking to merge local companies
in the face of robust competition from South Korea and Japan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih reiterated Tuesday that the government will stick to three
preconditions it has set for the signing of an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>These preconditions are that the trade pact must be consistent with the
country's needs, must be favored by public opinion and must be subject to the
supervision of the Legislative Yuan, Wu said in an interview.</P>
      <P>He said the government has always made sure that any agreements with China are
in the interests of Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the government decided last week to postpone the signing
of an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation with China after the Chinese
authorities went back on an understanding reached between the two sides on the
deal.</P>
      <P>For many businesses in Taiwan, he said, it is urgent that the ECFA be signed by
next May or June.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, the government cannot turn a blind eye to the doubts
held by 20 percent to 30 percent of Taiwan's population about the pact, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said the government opposes the idea of holding a referendum on the proposed
ECFA because if it is rejected at the polls, no other referendum on the same
issue will be allowed for three years.</P>

      <P>Motech Industries Inc., Taiwan's largest solar cell maker, said Tuesday it will
buy a solar cell module assembly plant in Delaware from General Electric Co.'s
(GE) energy unit for NT$146 million (US$4.54 million).</P>
      <P>The agreement, signed the previous day, will also enable Motech to use GE
Energy's brand on the solar-cell modules made in the Delaware facility for two
years, Motech said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Although the plant has an annual capacity of about 20-30 megawatts, it can add
more flexibility to Motech's operation and is also a major step in helping the
company to enter the solar-cell market in the U. S., the company said.</P>
      <P>Motech also noted that it will not use its own brand in the U.S. market, to
avoid cannibalization of its products.</P>
      <P>The company said it is now running at full capacity and that annual capacity is
expected to reach between 800 megawatts and 1 gigawatt in 2010 -- with total
shipments above 700 megawatts.</P>
      <P>Motech is also building a module assembly plant in Kunshan, in the eastern
China's Jiangsu Province, and might also consider building a module assembly
plant in the U.S., the company said.</P>
      <P>Cheered by the news about Motech's acquisition, solar issues gained on the
Taiwan stock market Tuesday, beating the broader market.</P>
      <P>Motech shares rose NT$8, or 5.8 percent, to close at NT$147, while Solartech
Energy and Tynsolar both advanced to the maximum daily ceiling of 7 percent to
close at NT$56.6 and NT$45.2, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consensus at legislature: No ground beef or beef offal from U.S.</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After several rounds of confrontation, legislators of the ruling Kuomintang and
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party reached consensus Tuesday that no
ground beef or bovine offal from the United States will be allowed to enter
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus accepted a revised KMT motion to write into law that
hazardous substances, including cattle skulls, brains, eyes, spinal cords,
intestines, ground beef and other related beef products from areas in which mad
cow disease has been reported in the past 10 years are banned from being
imported.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on a revision to the Act Governing Food Sanitation regarding beef
imports from the U.S. had a turbulent start Tuesday as the KMT caucus -- which
has a majority advantage -- was ready for a showdown, while the DPP blocked the
rostrum.</P>
      <P>With the whole morning wasted in the confrontation, Legislative Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng invited members of the KMT and DPP caucuses to negotiate. A consensus
was finally reached in the afternoon after two hours of discussions with the
participation of DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>As the DPP gave way to a KMT proposal on the issue while maintaining some
reservations, Tsai said afterward that the DPP caucus had tried its best to
protect the health of the public and that there are a great deal of follow-up
work demanding the efforts of all parties.</P>
      <P>The controversy over U.S. beef arose in early November when the Department of
Health announced that the government had signed a protocol in Washington to open
Taiwan's market to bone-in U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>A supplementary resolution proposed by the KMT caucus that "in case of aroused
international pressure, legislative caucuses and the administration should
jointly face the consequences," was adopted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  two DPP-proposed supplementary  resolutions,  on confining imported
U.S. beef to products from cattle younger than 30 months and no bone-in beef
before a referendum, will be top of the agenda when the legislature meets Jan.

      <P>Taiwan's largest auto show, currently underway in Taipei, is showcasing a wide
variety of cars, from real to virtual ones and from colorful ones to a
transparent one.</P>
      <P>While many visitors were gazing covetously at shiny sports cars or breathtaking
models of concept cars, scores of students from 18 car-related schools were
lining up to test PlayStation's latest racing car video game Monday.</P>
      <P>Another attraction for visitors is a "crystal model" of a Lexus two-seater. The
model, made of a transparent acrylic material, is on display in a dark room and
reflected by white and blue lights to allow almost every component to be seen.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ching-tien, head of the Taipei Automobile Distributors Association, said
the association organized the event despite a difficult business climate for car
firms.</P>
      <P>Major European and U.S. car companies that were absent from the recently
concluded Tokyo auto show are taking part in the Taipei event due to the support
of the association members, he noted.</P>
      <P>The show features cars from 25 companies, including Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, BMW,
Toyota, Audi, Ford, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Taiwan's new brand, Luxgen.</P>
      <P>"Some models of cars are not yet out in the U.S." said one visitor from Boston
who told CNA he had read about these new models of cars in magazines, although
they will not be introduced to the U.S. until later.</P>
      <P>"It's always fun to see the real cars," he said.</P>
      <P>After touring the show for an hour, he observed that many of the photographers
were taking photos of pretty showgirls posing next to the cars, but said he
would rather look at the cars.</P>
      <P>"Beautiful girls you can see anywhere, but cars not so much, " he said.</P>
      <P>His view was shared by French engineer Jean-Francois Fort, who said the first
impression of the show was that many people were more interested in
photographing the models than the cars.</P>
      <P>"They should at least take some photos of the cars," he said.</P>
      <P>As a regular visitor to the Paris car show, Fort said that both car shows are
similar in format, although the Taipei show is smaller than the one held in the
French capital.</P>
      <P>Fort also noted that many of the cars on show in Taipei are not distributed in
Europe.</P>
      <P>More than 40,000 people have visited the show, which takes places every other
year, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>Coraline Lin, the publicist for the event, said that companies at the auto show
are not so much seeking orders as using the event to understand market needs.</P>
      <P>The event runs from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily at the Taipei World Trade Center's
Exhibition Hall I, with an admission fee of NT$250 (US$8). It will close Jan. 3.</P>

      <P>Taiwan ranked eighth in Asia in terms of the number of international meetings it
hosted in 2008, according to a report released Tuesday by the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Dutch-based International Congress and
Convention Association (ICCA), the CEPD said Taiwan was host to 79 international
meetings in that year.</P>
      <P>Japan, where 247 meetings took place, remained Asia's largest host country for
2008, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei, which played host to 52 meetings, was Asia's ninth-largest
host city in 2008.</P>
      <P>The host city list was topped by Singapore, which was host to a total of 118
meetings.</P>
      <P>In 2008,  the production value of Taiwan's convention and exhibition industry
amounted to NT$25.74 billion, with 9,936 people employed in the sector, the CEPD
said.</P>
      <P>It noted that from this year, the government is promoting two flagship projects
in an effort to expand the scale of the industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government will further seek to simplify the entry procedures
for foreigners and Chinese nationals and relax entry restrictions to facilitate
visits by international businessmen and buyers, according to the CEPD.</P>

      <P>The number of cross-Taiwan Strait business disputes handled by the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) has soared over the past 18 months, as ties
with China have warmed, SEF officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>They attributed the phenomenon to the resumption of communication links between
the SEF and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS), following President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration in May
2008, which increased Taiwan businessmen's willingness to seek the SEF's
assistance in dealing with business disputes in China.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are the two semi-official intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan
and China, respectively, to deal with cross-strait affairs in the absence of
official ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>SEF statistics show that up until the end of 2007, the foundation received only
a few scores of complaints per year from Taiwan businessmen regarding disputes
in China.</P>
      <P>The number, however, soared to 221 in 2008 and further to 393 in the first 11
months of 2009, the statistics reveal.</P>
      <P>The total number for the whole year is likely to be double that of last year,
SEF officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of cases handled by the SEF regarding the physical
safety of Taiwanese in China has been climbing over the past 10 years, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The number topped 100 for the first time in 2003 and went up to 249 in 2007, 312
in 2008 and 326 in the first 11 months of 2009, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Campaign renewed to end use of disposable chopsticks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) renewed a campaign Tuesday in which
the public are urged not to use disposable chopsticks -- a move that has
persuaded more shopping malls, department stores and hypermarkets to take part
in its carbon-reduction efforts.</P>
      <P>Food court operators at 32 businesses, including Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Department
Store and RT-MART, have decided to take part in the drive from Jan. 1 by
offering re-usable chopsticks to customers eating on the premises and no longer
providing disposable chopsticks to those who want to take their food away.</P>
      <P>The DOH has estimated that this will help reduce the amount of disposable
chopsticks used next year by some 44 million pairs -- an equivalent to about 350
metric tons of waste or a reduction of 320 metric tons in carbon emissions,
sparing around 11,000 trees older than 20 years from being cut down.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with Sogo Taipei Department Store, Shin Shin Department Store,
Ming Yao Department Store,  Taimall and the country's four major convenience
store chains, the DOH first launched its carbon-reducing drive in July last
year.</P>
      <P>According to a Sogo executive, a dozen Sogo stores around the country used about
2.3 million pairs of disposable chopsticks last year, but the consumption
decreased this year by 80 percent. "The measure not only has helped business
owners slash operating costs, but also has pushed them to contribute to the
environmentally friendly cause," he said.</P>
      <P>Government agencies have since 2006 been making similar efforts by eschewing the
use of disposable tableware and chopsticks, the DOH said, calling on the public
to collaborate by carrying their own chopsticks when eating out.</P>

      <P>The government will try hard to communicate with the United States regarding the
recent legislature consensus on an import ban on certain beef products from the
U.S. and "hopes the damage can be minimized and severe impact on Taiwan-U.S.
relations avoided, " Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Replying to press inquiries after the legislative caucuses of the ruling
Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party reached consensus
that no ground beef or bovine offal from the U.S. will be allowed to enter
Taiwan, Wang said the Presidential Office respects the resolution of the
legislature to revise the Act Governing Food Sanitation and appreciates that the
Legislative Yuan will shoulder the responsibility for any consequences.</P>
      <P>He added that the Presidential Office has continuously negotiated with the
Legislative Yuan over the U.S. beef issue for two months, while successfully
implementing its control measures of "three controls" and "five certifications"
to make sure that no ground beef and offal enters the domestic market.</P>
      <P>The measures are setting controls on beef imports at the source, at borders and
in markets, while the five certifications refer to verifying certification
documents, checking that shipments are marked with detailed product information,
opening a high percentage of cartons of imported beef to check the product,
conducting food safety tests and being able to get information on suspected
problem products immediately.</P>
      <P>Upon learning about the legislative decision, Thomas Hodges, spokesman and
public affairs section chief of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) expressed
disappointment and said Washington would make an announcement later in the day.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 22, AIT made an announcement welcoming Taiwan's decision to lift a ban
on U.S. bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30 months as agreed in a protocol
inked in Washington earlier that day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Chi-ping, Ministry of Foreign Affairs deputy director-general
of information, said the ministry would follow international guidelines on the
matter, respecting the protocol on the one hand and taking into consideration

      <P>The number of workers needed in August by local companies increased from six
months earlier, showing that companies became more willing to recruit people as
the economy recovered,  the Cabinet-  level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest employment survey conducted by the DGBAS, the number of
workers needed by the manufacturing and service industries totaled 133,587 in
August, down 12,000 from the same month of the previous year, but up 18,000 from
February.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said unemployment was eased from early this year as the economic
recovery has helped the country's exports and has increased companies' hiring
needs.</P>
      <P>As the economy continues to recover, Taiwan's jobless rate dropped for a third
consecutive month in November to 5.86 percent -- the first time in more than
five months it had dropped below 6 percent.</P>
      <P>However, as the labor supply still exceeded demand, employers tended to require
higher education levels when recruiting new employees, the survey results show.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 43.1 percent of companies with labor shortages in August
wanted to hire workers with college degrees, up 7.3 percentage points from a

    <HEADLINE>Premier reveals idea of building affordable houses in Linkou</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government is considering building "fairly priced" houses in a zone
near Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in an effort to provide houses at
affordable prices, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to local electronic press reporters, Wu said the central government has
had the idea of constructing the houses in the A7-A9 zone along the metro line
that will link Taipei with Taiwan International Taoyuan Airport in neighboring
Taoyuan County upon its completion in 2014.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted that housing prices in Taiwan's major urban areas, especially Taipei
City, have surged to levels that are far beyond the reach of the vast majority
of salaried young people.</P>
      <P>"Through administrative measures, the government can provide more inexpensive
houses on suitable land for the general public, " the premier said. He expressed
hope that construction of the houses and the metro line to the airport will both
be completed in 2014 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the land in the A7 zone is close to Linkou's Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital and is close to "all prime facilities." "As the cost of land
in Linkou is much lower than in Taipei, the new houses should be much cheaper,"
he contended.</P>
      <P>Real-estate brokers, however, voiced skepticism about the idea, pointing out
that relatively cheap housing in the Linkou and Tamsui areas already far exceeds
demand. They called on the government to carefully weigh the possible impact of
even greater supply in such areas.</P>
      <P>Liu Pen-sheng, an executive at Evertrust Rehouse -- one of Taiwan's leading
real-estate brokers -- said houses built by the government,  except for those
constructed in Taipei City, are unpopular and difficult to sell. The same is
very likely to occur in Linkuo and the government should be cautious about going
ahead with the plan, he said.</P>
      <P>Another expert said the government's intention to build more cheap houses in
Linkou is pointless, as there is already superfluous inexpensive housing in the
area and the opening of a new metro line will not necessarily help matters, with
the low house prices in Tamsui a clear example.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of cross-Taiwan Strait business disputes handled by the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) has soared over the past 18 months, as ties
with China have warmed, SEF officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>They attributed the phenomenon to the resumption of communication links between
the SEF and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS), following President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration in May
2008, which increased Taiwan businessmen's willingness to seek the SEF's
assistance in dealing with business disputes in China.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are the two semi-official intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan
and China, respectively, to deal with cross-strait affairs in the absence of
official ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>SEF statistics show that up until the end of 2007, the foundation received only
a few scores of complaints per year from Taiwan businessmen regarding disputes
in China.</P>
      <P>The number, however, soared to 221 in 2008 and further to 393 in the first 11
months of 2009, the statistics reveal.</P>
      <P>The total number for the whole year is likely to be double that of last year,
SEF officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of cases handled by the SEF regarding the physical
safety of Taiwanese in China has been climbing over the past 10 years, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The number topped 100 for the first time in 2003 and went up to 249 in 2007, 312
in 2008 and 326 in the first 11 months of 2009, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Campaign renewed to end use of disposable chopsticks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) renewed a campaign Tuesday in which
the public are urged not to use disposable chopsticks -- a move that has
persuaded more shopping malls, department stores and hypermarkets to take part
in its carbon-reduction efforts.</P>
      <P>Food court operators at 32 businesses, including Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Department
Store and RT-MART, have decided to take part in the drive from Jan. 1 by
offering re-usable chopsticks to customers eating on the premises and no longer
providing disposable chopsticks to those who want to take their food away.</P>
      <P>The DOH has estimated that this will help reduce the amount of disposable
chopsticks used next year by some 44 million pairs -- an equivalent to about 350
metric tons of waste or a reduction of 320 metric tons in carbon emissions,
sparing around 11,000 trees older than 20 years from being cut down.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with Sogo Taipei Department Store, Shin Shin Department Store,
Ming Yao Department Store,  Taimall and the country's four major convenience
store chains, the DOH first launched its carbon-reducing drive in July last
year.</P>
      <P>According to a Sogo executive, a dozen Sogo stores around the country used about
2.3 million pairs of disposable chopsticks last year, but the consumption
decreased this year by 80 percent. "The measure not only has helped business
owners slash operating costs, but also has pushed them to contribute to the
environmentally friendly cause," he said.</P>
      <P>Government agencies have since 2006 been making similar efforts by eschewing the
use of disposable tableware and chopsticks, the DOH said, calling on the public
to collaborate by carrying their own chopsticks when eating out.</P>

      <P>The government will try hard to communicate with the United States regarding the
recent legislature consensus on an import ban on certain beef products from the
U.S. and "hopes the damage can be minimized and severe impact on Taiwan-U.S.
relations avoided, " Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Replying to press inquiries after the legislative caucuses of the ruling
Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party reached consensus
that no ground beef or bovine offal from the U.S. will be allowed to enter
Taiwan, Wang said the Presidential Office respects the resolution of the
legislature to revise the Act Governing Food Sanitation and appreciates that the
Legislative Yuan will shoulder the responsibility for any consequences.</P>
      <P>He added that the Presidential Office has continuously negotiated with the
Legislative Yuan over the U.S. beef issue for two months, while successfully
implementing its control measures of "three controls" and "five certifications"
to make sure that no ground beef and offal enters the domestic market.</P>
      <P>The measures are setting controls on beef imports at the source, at borders and
in markets, while the five certifications refer to verifying certification
documents, checking that shipments are marked with detailed product information,
opening a high percentage of cartons of imported beef to check the product,
conducting food safety tests and being able to get information on suspected
problem products immediately.</P>
      <P>Upon learning about the legislative decision, Thomas Hodges, spokesman and
public affairs section chief of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) expressed
disappointment and said Washington would make an announcement later in the day.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 22, AIT made an announcement welcoming Taiwan's decision to lift a ban
on U.S. bone-in beef from cattle younger than 30 months as agreed in a protocol
inked in Washington earlier that day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Chi-ping, Ministry of Foreign Affairs deputy director-general
of information, said the ministry would follow international guidelines on the
matter, respecting the protocol on the one hand and taking into consideration
the health of the public on the other.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of workers needed in August by local companies increased from six
months earlier, showing that companies became more willing to recruit people as
the economy recovered,  the Cabinet-  level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest employment survey conducted by the DGBAS, the number of
workers needed by the manufacturing and service industries totaled 133,587 in
August, down 12,000 from the same month of the previous year, but up 18,000 from
February.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said unemployment was eased from early this year as the economic
recovery has helped the country's exports and has increased companies' hiring
needs.</P>
      <P>As the economy continues to recover, Taiwan's jobless rate dropped for a third
consecutive month in November to 5.86 percent -- the first time in more than
five months it had dropped below 6 percent.</P>
      <P>However, as the labor supply still exceeded demand, employers tended to require
higher education levels when recruiting new employees, the survey results show.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 43.1 percent of companies with labor shortages in August
wanted to hire workers with college degrees, up 7.3 percentage points from a
survey conducted at the same time last year.</P>

      <P>The central government is considering building "fairly priced" houses in a zone
near Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in an effort to provide houses at
affordable prices, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to local electronic press reporters, Wu said the central government has
had the idea of constructing the houses in the A7-A9 zone along the metro line
that will link Taipei with Taiwan International Taoyuan Airport in neighboring
Taoyuan County upon its completion in 2014.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted that housing prices in Taiwan's major urban areas, especially Taipei
City, have surged to levels that are far beyond the reach of the vast majority
of salaried young people.</P>
      <P>"Through administrative measures, the government can provide more inexpensive
houses on suitable land for the general public, " the premier said. He expressed
hope that construction of the houses and the metro line to the airport will both
be completed in 2014 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the land in the A7 zone is close to Linkou's Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital and is close to "all prime facilities." "As the cost of land
in Linkou is much lower than in Taipei, the new houses should be much cheaper,"
he contended.</P>
      <P>Real-estate brokers, however, voiced skepticism about the idea, pointing out
that relatively cheap housing in the Linkou and Tamsui areas already far exceeds
demand. They called on the government to carefully weigh the possible impact of
even greater supply in such areas.</P>
      <P>Liu Pen-sheng, an executive at Evertrust Rehouse -- one of Taiwan's leading
real-estate brokers -- said houses built by the government,  except for those
constructed in Taipei City, are unpopular and difficult to sell. The same is
very likely to occur in Linkuo and the government should be cautious about going
ahead with the plan, he said.</P>
      <P>Another expert said the government's intention to build more cheap houses in
Linkou is pointless, as there is already superfluous inexpensive housing in the
area and the opening of a new metro line will not necessarily help matters, with
the low house prices in Tamsui a clear example.</P>

      <P>The Tax Reform Committee under the Executive Yuan ended its one-and-a-half-year
mission Tuesday, but whether the committee has achieved its goal on tax reforms
is debatable.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Sun Keh-nan, a financial scholar who served in the committee, reported Tuesday
that although the committee has simplified taxation procedures and improved
economic efficiency, "inappropriate tax cuts" have made the tax system even more
unjust.</P>
      <P>In the short term, the tax cuts will result in lost revenues of NT$21 billion
(US$650.15 million) annually, and in the medium- and longer-term, the government
is bound to raise taxes.</P>
      <P>Compared with the results of the previous two committees, it is believed this
committee has been the most affected by political interference and the one that
has achieved the least, analysts said.</P>
      <P/>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be responsible for tax reform now that the
Tax Reform Committee has bowed out.</P>
      <P>The MOF is planning to propose luxury, energy and property taxes by the end of
next year. It is also scheduled to put into practice by 2012 a partial capital
gains tax on stock investments to be levied on institutional investors.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Tuesday that raising taxes is not the trend
but that a tax system of fairness and justice is.</P>
      <P>The phaseout of income tax exemption for military personnel and teachers was
originally planned for next year, but Vice Finance Minister Chang Sheng-ford
said that because the necessary legal revision could not be completed in time,
the measure will be postponed for one year, meaning that it will be put in
practice in 2011. (Dec. 30, 2009)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators  from across the political  spectrum reached a consensus Tuesday to
pass a proposed amendment to the Act Governing Food Sanitation that would ban
imports of "risky" beef products from areas where cases of mad cow disease have
been documented over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The United States' representative office in Taipei immediately voiced its
concern over the move, while the Presidential Office vowed to step up
communications with U.S. authorities on the issue to minimize possible fallout.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Reacting to the legislative consensus to resume a ban on certain U.S.  beef
imports amid public concern over mad cow disease, Presidential  Office spokesman
Wang Yu-chi said President  Ma Ying-jeou respects the Legislative Yuan's
decision.</P>
      <P>The ban's resumption contravenes a Taiwan-U.S. protocol that lifted a previous
ban on bone-in beef imports from the United States, and Wang said the government
will do its best to communicate with the U.S. on the issue.</P>
      <P>Currently, the top priority is to do something to minimize the possible damage
to Taiwan-U.S. relations, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Governmental  officials  admitted that Taiwan has obviously violated the
Taiwn-U.S. beef protocol and World Trade Organization (WTO) common practices.
For now, Taiwan can only try to seek the U.S.' understanding, they said.</P>
      <P>Next, they added, the two sides need to reopen negotiations on the issue, but
whether or not to restart the talks depends on what the U.S. decides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials have refused to talk
about what the ministry will do to mend Taiwan-U.S. relations after the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) -- the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan -- expressed
disappointment with the legislature's decision.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will state its position on the issue after the Legislative Yuan votes
on the consensus on Jan. 5, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Some officials at the MOFA, however, expressed dismay over the legislature's
decision, saying the ministry was not involved in the legislature's inter-party
negotiations on the issue but did present a risk assessment on its possible
impact on Taiwan-U.S. ties. (Dec. 30, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>A government official who participated in talks on trade and economic issues for
more than 20 years described the legislative decision to resume the ban on
certain U.S. beef products as a "major trade and economic crisis."</P>
      <P>The official stated that the decision violated WTO obligations and common
international negotiation practices,  badly damaging Taiwan's  image and
credibility.  Taiwan will have trouble in conducting talks on trade and economic
issues with other countries in the future, he said. (Dec. 30, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>U.S. officials, who expressed dismay over the legislature's decision to block
controversial U.S. beef products from entering Taiwan, pinpointed Taiwan's
National Security Council Secretary General Su Chi on Tuesday as the person who
should be held responsible for the result.</P>
      <P>They complained that Su rejected their suggestion when the protocol was signed
in October to wait until after Taiwan's local elections on Dec. 5 to make it
public, to avoid resistance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party demanded that Su step
down from his post. (Dec. 30, 2009)</P>

      <P>The public will get a discount for conserving water starting in January, the
Water Resources Agency announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the incentive program, water users who cut consumption by 15 percent from
the same period last year will get a 5 percent discount on their water bill, the
agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.</P>
      <P>Those who cut water usage by between 15 and 30 percent will receive a 10 percent
discount, and those who cut usage by more than 30 percent will get a 15 percent
discount, the agency said.</P>
      <P>It is expected that 6.03 million average users, households and elementary and
junior high schools will be eligible for the program, which will be applied
during the anticipated drought period from January to June, the agency said.</P>
      <P>The plan will be adjusted as necessary.</P>
      <P>"If the water shortage problem gets worse, the agency could provide even bigger
incentives to encourage water conservation, " an agency official said.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that water conservation is as important a
government policy as energy conservation and carbon emissions reduction.</P>
      <P>He said the government will use financial incentives to encourage the public to
conserve water, as it has done to encourage the reduction of power consumption.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan rep. to U.S. comments on beef issue impact</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
12/30/09  12:44:05

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Representative to the United States Jason C. Yuan said Tuesday that
Taiwan should assess the consequences of abrogating some of the content of an
agreement with the U.S. on beef imports, which will directly impact efforts to
promote good relations.</P>
      <P>Upon hearing the news that a consensus was reached by Taiwan's legislature on a
proposed amendment to the Act Governing Food Sanitation regarding beef imports
from the U.S., Yuan commented that relations between Taiwan and the U.S. over
the past 18 months have turned for the better mainly because of the building of
mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Should the amendment,  which would overturn  parts of the agreement, pass the
legislature, the consequences would not be hard to imagine, he added.</P>
      <P>In late October, Taiwan and the U.S. signed the "Protocol of Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) -Related Measures for the Importation of Beef and Beef
Products for Human Consumption from the Territory of the Authorities Represented
by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)."</P>
      <P>The deal obliged Taiwan to lift a partial ban it had previously opposed on U.S.
bone-in beef, but the legislature's measure would reimpose parts of the partial
ban.</P>
      <P>Yuan  suggested  that it would  not be possible  to seek understanding  from the
U.S.  using "domestic  affairs"  as a justification because the U.S. treats
Taiwan as a single entity.</P>
      <P>Confirming the concern of related U.S. authorities, Yuan said that he had
received phone calls from U.S. officials at the deputy secretary level, even
during the Christmas holidays.</P>
      <P>If the legislation ends up overturning an agreement reached through
negotiations, it could be very serious and definitely will affect anticipated
negotiations on a Taiwan-U.S. trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA),
according to Yuan.</P>
      <P>As to the possible impact on the representative office's planning for President
Ma's transit visit to the U.S. on his way to attending the presidential
inauguration in Honduras in late January, Yuan said he has yet to receive
instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on making such arrangements.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Demetrios Maratis and Undersecretary
for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Jim Miller issued a joint statement
on the issue, expressing deep concern and disappointment on the matter.</P>
      <P>"The proposed amendment's provisions do not have a basis in science or fact, "
the statement read. "If passed, this amendment would represent a new barrier to
U.S. beef exports to Taiwan, and would constitute a unilateral abrogation of a
bilateral agreement."</P>
      <P>The two U.S. officials also advised that "the Taiwan authorities should consider
very carefully the impact that passage of the amendment in its current form
would have on Taiwan's reputation as a reliable trading partner and responsible
member of the international community."</P>
      <P>After several rounds of confrontation, Taiwan's legislators across party lines
reached a consensus Tuesday to write into law that hazardous substances,
including cattle skulls, brains, eyes, spinal cords, and intestines, and ground
beef and other related beef products from areas in which mad cow disease has
been reported in the past 10 years are banned from being imported.</P>

12/30/09  13:48:37
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>has been so capivated by China that it is diligently learning from China's
control of mass media and may soon become an incarnation of the now-defunct
Taiwan Garrison Command in restricting freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>After arbitrarily formulating regulations that give it the power to order
electronic media to suspend the broadcast of specific programs or to slap them
with fines, the commission now plans to streamline TV news graphics.</P>
      <P>Claiming that current TV news graphics are messy and untidy, the NCC says it
will lay out ground rules to standardize the format of TV news graphics,
including the direction and size of the Chinese characters used in the graphics.
Violators may face fines ranging from NT$200,000 to NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>It is true that many TV viewers dislike graphics, but it is not a question that
the government should meddle with. The issue should be left for the market to
decide.</P>
      <P>In a democratic society, it is very important that the government exercise self-
restraint and refrain from expanding its control beyond legal authorization.
Arbitrary government interference tends to have political side effects and leads
to suppressing civil liberties.</P>
      <P>Since President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office, the sense and scope of government
control has become more evident than during the previous A-bian administration.
The NCC is a typical example.</P>
      <P>As the Criminal Code, the Child and Juvenile Welfare Law and the Consumer
Protection Act have prescribed clear provisions to penalize law-breaking media
outlets, the NCC need not bother setting new rules to discipline TV stations at
the risk of violating constitutional provisions.</P>
      <P>Thirty-five media outlets ran a joint advertisement in local newspapers Tuesday
reminding the NCC that it only has supervisory rights and should not try to
expand its role in restricting electronic media operations.</P>
      <P>We support such an appeal and suggest that they file a request for a
constitutional interpretation by the Constitutional Court of Grand Justices to
prevent the NCC from becoming an anachronistic "bizarre beast" with unauthorized
power.</P>

      <P>Derivative instruments have been credited as one of the greatest inventions of
human history, but a global economic crisis last year battered economies such as
the United States and Europe where the development of derivatives was more
mature.</P>
      <P>It may not be fair or reasonable to blame derivatives alone for the global
crisis, because without the culprit -- the subprime mortgage crisis -- the
problems would not have surfaced.</P>
      <P>The subprime mortgage crisis was caused by the bursting of the U.S. real estate
market bubble. In fact, every economic crisis has resulted from the bursting of
asset or commodity price bubbles.</P>
      <P>All governments in the world have almost invariably adopted loose monetary
policies and strong fiscal policies in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis,
providing huge injections of cheap funds to investment banks, private funds and
hedge funds so that they were the first to rebound.</P>
      <P>The influx of funds have helped battered stock markets return to pre-crisis
levels and driven prices higher in the oil, gold, and commodity markets, while
also pushing real estate prices higher in Asia.</P>
      <P>But all governments are wary of the approach of using a new bubble to replace an
old bubble to salvage their economies.</P>
      <P>They have promised to gradually phase out the stimulus packages they adopted in
late 2008 and early 2009 by 2010. China has already shown such an attitude,
having already adopted a series of measures to dampen rising housing prices.</P>
      <P>For this reason, if 2008 was the year when the world reeled from the economic
crisis and 2009 was the year of asset bubbles bursting, 2010 will likely be a
year featuring a tug-of-war between stabilizing and stimulative policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP urges U.S. to respect Taiwan people's will on beef imports</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
12/30/09  14:53:37

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed its hope
Wednesday that the United States will understand and respect the desire of
Taiwan's people not to accept controversial beef imports from the U.S.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Taiwan's people have spelled out their demand
to the government to prohibit the import of potentially hazardous U.S. beef
products, referring to a consensus reached between the ruling and opposition
parties to resume a ban on various U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the DDP legislative caucus accepted a revised motion by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) to write into law that hazardous substances, including cattle
skulls, brains, eyes, spinal cords, and intestines, as well as ground beef and
other related beef products from areas in which mad cow disease has been
reported in the past 10 years, are banned from entering Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The revision to the Act Governing Food Sanitation, however, sparked fears among
officials who participated in negotiations with the U.S. on the beef issue that
Taipei-Washington relations could be affected.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the U.S.  Department of Agriculture  and Trade Representative office
issued a joint statement saying the proposed amendment "would constitute a
unilateral abrogation of a bilateral agreement."</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that there would be no "U.S. beef import protocol" if the government
had not promoted the agreement in secret, a practice showing its lack of respect
for the people's will.</P>
      <P>Consequently, there would have been no possibility of U.S. retaliation,  Tsai
added,  blaming  National  Security  Council Secretary-General Su Chi, who was
allegedly responsible for the negotiations, for the dispute.</P>
      <P>Tsai also pointed out that a video conference held by the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) -- the U.S.' de facto embassy in Taiwan -- had failed to convince
Taiwan's people that the high-risk beef parts are safe for consumption.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  DPP legislative caucus head Wang Sing-nan said President Ma Ying-
jeou should apologize for his administration's hasty decision to lift the ban on
U.S. bone-in beef and that Su should step down to shoulder responsibility.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang called on the U.S. government to respect the
legislature's decision and said the caucus would ask related  agencies  to
explain the decision  to their American counterparts at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Lu contended that the amendment in fact would not be very restrictive, blocking
only 1-to-2-percent of U.S. beef and related products from entering Taiwan,
while still allowing the U.S. to ship 98 percent of its beef products to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although  the administration  made mistakes in forging the Taiwan-U.S. protocol,
it is now not too late to amend the flaws, Lu argued.  He also recognized  the
president's  respect for the Legislative Yuan's decision, describing it as
respect for democratic politics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the chairman of the nonprofit Consumers' Foundation, Hsieh Tien-jen,
urged people to take part in a public hearing, to be held later Wednesday, on
the foundation's proposed referendum on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Hsieh called for the locals to stand out to say no to U.S. beef.</P>

      <P>The economy flashed a yellow-red light in November, just one step away from the
red light, which signifies overheating.</P>
      <P>But the improvement in economic performance was mainly because of last year's
low baseline,  when the economy  began  severely contracting, making exports and
manufacturing sales look relatively strong.</P>
      <P>In fact, we know that the world economy has gradually come out of the shadow of
a meltdown after governments in the world injected funds into capital markets to
create high liquidity.</P>
      <P>And those fund inflows, rather than increases in production, sales, or services,
are primarily responsible for the slow economic rebound and explains why the
recovery has failed to create new jobs or stimulate consumption.</P>
      <P>The so-called jobless recovery has only benefited specific sectors and widened
the gap between rich and poor.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment is actually more serious than on the surface, even though
the official unemployment rate in November was 5.8 percent, a drop from the
record high of over 6 percent.</P>
      <P>We believe the root behind the present economic decline in Taiwan is the
government's China-leaning policy. Instead of focusing on improving the local
investment environment to retain businesses, the Ma administration  has relaxed
even reasonable restrictions on investment in China to induce the exodus of
industry, technology and people, which we believe will only drive up jobless
numbers.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/30/09  15:56:43
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent poll about Cabinet officials found that up to 82 percent of those
polled could not even name one minister without prompting and even after
prompting, up to 52 percent still could not name so much as a single Cabinet
official.</P>
      <P>Why are these powerful officials, whose businesses and policies have a direct
influence on the public, so unknown to most people?</P>
      <P>Lack of charisma, inability or reluctance to defend policy could all be reasons,
although there are other factors over which they have no control.</P>
      <P>First, a gap between the various government agencies and the needs of society
they are supposed to serve is too wide. For example, former Legislator Kao Su-po
is the son of former Taiwan Provincial Assembly Speaker Kao Yu-jen and an in-law
of Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, but even so, the public has difficulty
associating him with his position as head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs
Commission.</P>
      <P>Second, the business of some government agencies is irrelevant to the public.
For example, the head of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
which is in charge of national land and planning, may be easily overlooked by
most people.</P>
      <P>Third, the frequent changes of Cabinet officials might make it difficult to keep
track of who is who.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above factors and the personal qualities of the officials,
what is more worrisome is that the public might simply not care about public
affairs.</P>
      <P>One should never overlook the issue. A society that lacks public discussion on
politics and policy will find it difficult to upgrade its political culture, and
this is not healthy.</P>

      <P>Not only advanced countries but also developing countries are gearing up to lay
out regulations demanding carbon reductions from manufacturing through end-
consumption.</P>
      <P>With "friendly to the earth" and "rescue the earth" becoming a global consensus,
the pace of promoting earth-friendly production and sustainable lifestyles will
speed up and restrictions on carbon emissions will definitely become stricter.</P>
      <P>Faced with the new market trend, Taiwan must catch up or risk being knocked out
of the global market.</P>
      <P>Available figures show that Taiwan's environmental protection records are
lackluster and poor. The United States tops the world in terms of annual per
capita carbon emissions at 20 tons, far higher than the world average of 4.3
tons. Taiwan's ranking is not expected to fall below five, as its per capita
emissions reach an average of 12 tons.</P>
      <P>What is even more sad is that Taiwan's per capita carbon emissions have
continued to rise even during the period of economic recession.</P>
      <P>This is an indication that Taiwan has yet to substantiate its promised target of
carbon reductions either in the manufacturing sector or in people's daily lives.</P>
      <P>This is an issue of great urgency that the government should not ignore.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economy is mostly driven by export-oriented OEM manufacturing, the
country could be especially vulnerable to changes in global business practices.</P>
      <P>With  the  application  of environmentally  friendly  green technologies
becoming the order of the day, major multinational conglomerates can restrict
their material and end product suppliers to using only technologies  or
production processes that meet ISO-certified energy efficiency and carbon
emission standards.</P>
      <P>Major international business associations can also devise new regulations
demanding that its members only trade in products manufactured with
environmentally friendly technologies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, an increasing number of consumer groups have published booklets
advising  individual  consumers  on  how  to procure environmentally friendly
products through carbon footprint labeling.</P>
      <P>To maximize their chances of survival, local business groups should review their
investment strategies and stop indulging in high-polluting and high-energy
consuming manufacturing operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Judge named to head trial of ex-president in financial reform scandal</HEADLINE>

      <P>A three-judge panel led by Chou Chan-chun will preside over the upcoming trial
of former President Chen Shui-bian and his family in connection with corruption
scandals surrounding the country's second round of financial reforms, the Taipei
District Court decided Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made through a drawing of lots. The other two judges on the
panel are Lin Po-hung and Ho Chiao-mei.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 24, the district court indicted Chen, his wife Wu Shu-jen, their
daughter Chen Hsing-yu and son Chen Chih-chung on charges of corruption, money
laundering and forgery for manipulating the financial reforms in favor of
certain business groups.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, the first couple took bribes totaling NT$610
million from the Cathay and Yuanta financial groups to facilitate the groups'
acquisitions of other Taiwanese banks to form new financial holdings companies.</P>
      <P>Others on the indictment list include Chen Chih-chung's wife Huang Jui-ching, Wu
Shu-jen's elder brother Wu Ching-mao,  Wu Ching-mao's wife Chen Chun-ying, and
Yuanta Group founder Rudy Ma.</P>
      <P>The latest indictment to date came three months after the former first couple
was given life sentences by the district court after being found guilty of
corruption, forgery and money-laundering for embezzling from a special
Presidential Office discretionary fund, taking bribes from business owners, and
secretly stashing some of the funds overseas.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 22, the former president was also indicted for embezzling funds under
the guise of "secret diplomacy spending."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After three doctors were found to have colluded with patients to defraud
insurance companies, the Department of Health (DOH) minister said Wednesday that
the DOH will order the hospitals at which they work to suspend operations if
they are found to have concealed information about illegal conduct by their
doctors.</P>
      <P>Yaung Chih-liang told reporters that he was pained to learn that the three
doctors have been indicted for fraud.</P>
      <P>They are Yang Chao-jan, a physician at the DOH-run Keelung Hospital; Lai Teh-
hsing, a surgeon at Yee Zen General Hospital in Taoyuan County; and Wu Kuo-
ching, a surgeon at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Their licenses to practice were rescinded after evidence was seized by law-
enforcement personnel and they all confessed to having colluded with a fraud
ring since 2003, making fake medical treatment records and surgery reports to
claim cancer payments from life insurance companies, according to the DOH.</P>
      <P>Seven other individuals who acted as "patients" in the cases were also indicted
by the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office for fraud.</P>
      <P>Aside from the defendants, another four doctors practicing in other hospitals
were also listed as suspects, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>If the hospitals where the law-breaking doctors worked are discovered to have
deliberately hidden information about their illegal practices, the facilities
will be punished and might even be forced to close, Yaung noted.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper report said that day that the fraud in the medical sector --
in which doctors were stealing samples from cancer patients to perform surgery
on non-cancer  sufferers  to make fraudulent insurance claims -- might have
involved more than 10 hospitals and funds of over NT$1 billion.</P>
      <P>The case promoted the DOH to take the rare action of sanctioning the doctors
before the court's ruling, the reports said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Restart tax reform</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/30/09  17:32:19
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversial Tax Reform Committee has been finally disbanded after 18
months of operations at an expense of NT$20 million in taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>The committee had a bumpy start, with its goals, organizational framework,
roster and operational mode coming under question from the very beginning. Its
repeated endorsement of the Executive Yuan's policy proposals made it more like
a rubber stamp organ rather than an arm dedicated to reform and innovation.</P>
      <P>Some of the committee's actions pandering to special interest groups drew even
more fire and prompted some commissioners to boycott its meetings in protest.
Its closure came as a relief for some.</P>
      <P>To be fair, the committee contributed more to tax simplification than to
overhauling the tax system into a more just and balanced one.</P>
      <P>Most regrettable is that the committee failed to introduce a capital gains tax
while largely cutting the inheritance and gift tax rate to 10 percent without
imposing any accompanying measures to minimize its impact.</P>
      <P>Unfair taxation has long been a source of public grievance, with capital gains
tax on stock transactions as the top target. The committee has let the public
down due to its inaction in this regard.</P>
      <P>Success in tax reform tends to hinge on the leadership's determination and guts
as well as a well-devised package of measures and incentives.</P>
      <P>It does not bode well for any future plans to increase taxes after the committee
failed to introduce them at the same time that tax reductions were introduced
during its tenure.</P>
      <P>As a remedy, the government should now show its execution capability by
introducing energy tax, environment tax and special consumption tax, resuming
capital gains tax on stock transactions, and raising business tax rates to win
back public trust.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance should from now on take up the mission of studying
relevant problems and initiating  feasible tax reform measures.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has instructed that a team be sent to the United States
to step up communication with Washington on the legislature's latest move over
U.S. beef imports, the Presidential Office spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi made the remarks after Ma called a meeting earlier that day in
response to a proposed legislative amendment that would abrogate an agreement
with the United States on beef imports.</P>
      <P>Ma exchanged views with Vice President Vincent Siew, Premier Wu Den-yih, Vice
Premier Eric Liluan Chu, National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi,
Presidential Office Secretary-General Liao Liuo-yi, KMT Secretary-General King
Pu-tsung, KMT Policy Committee Director Lin Yi-shih and officials from related
government agencies on how to deal with the U.S. should the amendment pass the
legislature.</P>
      <P>He said the team should leave as soon as possible on its damage-control mission,
to mitigate the impact of the lawmakers' decision on Taiwan-U.S. relations, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>"The team will depart for the U.S. next week at the latest, " he added.</P>
      <P>After the legislature goes into recess, a group comprised of legislators,
scholars and representatives of civic groups and consumers will also travel to
the United States to express the stance of the Taiwan people and make on-site
visits to meat facilities there in an attempt to assuage the local misgivings
over U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture issued a statement a day earlier saying that the proposed amendment
will constitute the unilateral abrogation of an agreement concluded between
Taiwan and the U.S. two months ago and that Taiwan should consider the impact on
its reputation as a reliable trade partner and a responsible member of the
international community.</P>
      <P>Wang said Ma attaches great importance to the U.S. statement and will
communicate with Washington through diplomatic channel before dispatching the
team.</P>
      <P>A Presidential Office official said the government is willing to abide by its
international commitments, but added that the proposed amendment is the
manifestation of public will reached through democratic procedure, and that "we
hope the United States will respect the decision."</P>
      <P>Ruling and opposition party legislators reached consensus Tuesday to pass the
proposed amendment to the Act Governing Food Sanitation that would ban imports
of "risky" beef products from areas where cases of mad cow disease have been
documented over the past decade.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Timothy C. T. Yang honored the diplomatic contributions of the
country's aid technicians Wednesday, as the country marked the 50th anniversary
of the first farming aid mission sent overseas.</P>
      <P>"These specialists overcame great difficulties to improve the locals'
livelihoods and lay solid foundations for relations between Taiwan and other
countries, " Yang said at a ceremony in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"They also helped raise Taiwan's international profile, " he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which has enjoyed economic prosperity over the past several decades
based on its agricultural and high-tech industries, has only limited space in
the international community due to China's suppression.</P>
      <P>The country at present maintains official ties with 23 countries, mostly in
Central America, the Caribbean and Africa.</P>
      <P>The country sent its first mission of farming experts, hailed as "grassroots
ambassadors, " to Vietnam in 1959. Today, however, the scope of these missions
has moved beyond the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>"We now have missions made up of experts from the high-tech, medical, solar
energy, environmental protection, business marketing and computer engineering
fields," Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Thirty-three of these original experts -- who went on their missions in their
20s and now have gray hair -- attended a ceremony organized by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs' International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) to unveil
a book featuring their stories.</P>
      <P>The ICDF also launched a special English-language section of its Web site on the
history of the country's foreign aid.</P>
      <P>The 287-page Chinese-language book details missions carried out in Southeast
Asia, the Pacific region, Africa, Central America and the Middle East from the
1960s to the 21st century.</P>
      <P>At the peak period in the 1970s, Taiwan had 1,000 specialists posted overseas,
with 47 overseas missions in the 1990s, according to the book. However, the
number had decreased to 33 missions in 28 countries, with just 225 specialists,
as of 2009.</P>
      <P>A total of 38 people have died on mission over the years, either due to war,
disease or car accidents.</P>
      <P>Yang Wu-jiun, who was sent to Sierra Leone in the late 1970s at the age of 28,
told CNA at the ceremony that he joined the mission with seven others because it
was difficult for Taiwanese to travel abroad at that time.</P>
      <P>"I wanted to take the opportunity to go overseas, even though I had been married
for just five months at the time," he recalled.</P>
      <P>During his one-month training session before setting out on the mission, he and
others had to be equipped with language, rescue, haircutting, cooking and
mechanical skills besides their farming know-how.</P>
      <P>The 72-year-old said he stayed in the African country for two years on a monthly
salary of US$200.</P>
      <P>He added that although he enjoyed those days and wanted to join another mission
after returning home, things did not go according to plan, "thanks to opposition
from the family."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese surgeon leads medical team on Africa mission</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/30/09  20:27:41</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A well-known Taiwanese surgeon who has spent all his annual leave for nearly a
decade offering free treatment in less-developed countries, has decided to lead
a medical team on a one-year mission to one of the smallest countries in Africa.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-tai, who has been working at the Taipei City Hospital's Hoping branch
for over 20 years, will leave next month for Sao Tome and Principe, a
Portuguese-speaking island country off the west coast of Africa.</P>
      <P>This will be Chang's longest overseas mission to date. Over the past 13 years,
he has been to seven other African countries and a dozen Asian and Central and
South American countries to offer free medical services. All those trips,
however, have lasted for less than two weeks.</P>
      <P>Chang said his experience of providing short term medical services in African
countries has left him with only a shallow understanding of those countries.</P>
      <P>"I need to stay longer so that I can have a deeper understanding of their
situations and their needs," he said.</P>
      <P>Chang, along with another three doctors and two nurses, will help doctors in Sao
Tome and Principe to treat patients and will also train medical staff to enhance
the level of health care in the country.</P>
      <P>"We can actually play a bigger role in a small country with a small population,
" said Chang, adding that once local doctors and other medical staff have been
trained, most people in the country will benefit and the Taiwanese medical team
will be able to perform better.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei Medical University's international office, which organizes
the Taiwanese medical teams that are sent to Africa -- including a seven-member
team stationed in Swaziland -- Sao Tome and Principe suffers from an extreme
lack of medical and health care resources, with just 22 doctors to take care of
a population of 160,000.</P>
      <P>The six-member Taiwanese medical team will need to help treat patients with
malaria and infection by the vibrio bacteria, TMU officials said.</P>
      <P>The 57-year-old Chang is no stranger to malaria and in fact was infected during
a stint in Malawi in 2004 that almost killed him.</P>
      <P>Less than a year later, when the South Asia tsunami struck in December that
year, Chang immediately organized a medical aid team that went to Sri Lanka for
rescue and treatment work.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Taiwan experienced a series of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
outbreaks, and the Municipal Hoping Hospital (now the Taipei City Hospital
Hoping branch) suffered the first and most serious outbreak.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was the director of the hospital's emergency room at that time,
stayed at the hospital from the first day the hospital was forced into isolation
until it re-opened two weeks later.</P>
      <P>He has also gone to various disaster areas in Taiwan after earthquakes or
typhoons and in fact his colleagues say that every time a natural disaster
occurs in Taiwan, Chang will always be at the scene soon afterward.</P>
      <P>Chang's medical career began in 1975 in Japan, where he studied medical science
and started his own practice, specializing in endocrine surgery and breast
surgery before returning to Taiwan in 1990. He later moved into emergency care
and at the same time, started to offer free treatment to people in need.</P>
      <P>"As a specialist, I cannot provide enough help to people in emergencies, so I
need to equip myself with more abilities to deal with those situations," Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Chang also expressed hope that young doctors and hospital staff, by taking part
in medical missions -- can develop stronger spirit under difficult circumstances
with limited medical resources.</P>
      <P>As an example, he went on, diagnosing and treating victims of car accidents with
just bare hands can be a massive challenge.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that with power supplies expected to become more stable in Sao
Tome and Principe, he hopes to be able to use the Internet to conduct video
conferences so that more local people can be trained remotely in the future.</P>
      <P>"I feel I am lucky to be able to help other people, " said Chang, who has won
numerous awards throughout his career -- including the Medical Devotion Award
and the Meritorious Service Award in 2007, and the Medical Profession Award in
2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lin En-yu named top pick in 2010 Taiwanese pro baseball draft</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 30 (CNA)
12/30/09  20:52:51
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Right-handed pitcher Lin En-yu was selected as the number one pick by the
Brother Elephants in the 2010 Taiwanese professional baseball draft, held even
though the league's future remains clouded by a major game-fixing scandal</P>
      <P>Lin, a regular on Taiwan's national baseball team who played professionally in
Japan for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, was chosen first by the Elephants,
before the Sinon Bulls picked 18-year-old Chang Keng-hao of Nan Ying Vocational
High School.</P>
      <P>In all, 51 players were chosen by the league's four teams.</P>
      <P>"With Lin's talent and experience, he brings a lot to the table and will
definitely be in our starting rotation next season, " Elephants manager Chen
Jui-chen said after the draft.</P>
      <P>The 28-year-old compiled a 1-3 record for the Golden Eagles during his three-
year stint in Japan from 2007 to 2009, which was plagued by injuries and
ineffectiveness.</P>
      <P>He has spent the past two years in the Japanese minor league trying to regain
the form that earned him Rookie of the Year and MVP honors in his first year in
Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in 2005.</P>
      <P>The Elephants hope he will be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of
leading the team, widely seen as the most popular franchise in the CPBL, out
from under the darkest cloud in team history.</P>
      <P>Thirteen Elephants members, including 12 players and manager Nakagomi  Shin,
were charged with game-fixing  in an ongoing investigation by Taiwan prosecutors
in October and November, sparking concern that the team might be disbanded.</P>
      <P>Over 40 active and former players and coaches in the league were implicated in
the case that shocked the country, where baseball remains the national pastime.</P>
      <P>"We are happy to have Lin on our team. He is a proven pitcher and seasoned
veteran. Both Taiwanese baseball and the Elephants need him, especially now,"
Elephants coach Feng Sheng-hsien told reporters. "He will shoulder a great
burden of reviving fan interest in the national pastime and the Elephants."</P>
      <P>Before going to Japan, Lin spent two years (2005-06) in the CPBL with the now-
defunct Macoto Cobras, compiling a 29-16 won-loss record and setting an all-time
single-season strikeout record of 209.</P>
      <P>Sinon also has high hopes for the No. 2 pick, Chang, who will try to jump
directly from high school baseball to the professional ranks.</P>
      <P>"We have been keeping an eye on Chang for a while. He is a promising young
pitcher, but it will take time for him to make the adjustment from high school
ball, " said Sinon Assistant General Manager Liu Chih-shen.</P>
      <P>For young players like Chang, it was not an easy decision to place their names
in the draft pool at a time when the baseball community and fans are still
reeling from the aftershocks of the scandal, CPBL Secretary-General Wayne Lee
said.</P>
      <P>"Young players may have doubts about the league's stability and future.
Understandably, it was a difficult decision for them to apply for the draft at
this time, " Lee said. "But I told them that as all the teams are still doing
their best to prepare for the new season in this difficult time, there will be
more and better opportunities for the young guys."</P>
      <P>In the two-hour draft, the short-handed Elephants picked up 19 players. Sinon
and the La New Bears selected 11 each while the defending champion Uni-President
Lions added 10 newcomers. None of the players selected in the draft were on hand
to witness the process, however.</P>
      <P>All of the players selected in the first round were pitchers, as La New selected
Lee Chu-kwan third and Uni-President selected Tsai Ching-hao with its top pick.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou convened a Cabinet-level task force to tackle the issue
of reviving local baseball after the scandal broke out and hundreds of fans
marched the streets requesting  the government's help in "saving the national
pastime."</P>

      <P>According to the TRI, 3D TV will be showcased along with tablet PCs, Google
phones, pico projectors and simple mobile computers as the five leading products
at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show, slated for Jan. 7-10 in Las Vegas.</P>
      <P>With international TV manufacturers, including Sony, having announced their

      <P>The institute predicted that the trend will bring lucrative commercial
opportunities for Taiwan's display panel, polarizer and blue-ray player
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Another hot item in 2010 will be the simple mobile computer, such as the mobile
Internet device (MID) and the Smartbook, the TRI said.</P>
      <P>Though bearing different names, these products share several similarities: a
price tag of no more than US$300, a size that is slightly larger than a mobile
phone, and the ability to be connected to the Internet at any time, according to
the research institute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ripples from aborted Taiwan-China tax pact continue to be felt</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The failure of Taiwan and China to conclude a tax agreement in formal talks
earlier this month continued to stir debate at the Legislative Yuan Wednesday,
with officials and lawmakers attributing the stalemate to different factors.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Taiwan had no idea why China changed its
mind and backed off from its decision to ink the pact with Taiwan during the
latest round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks held in Taichung City Dec. 22-23.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged, however, that some technical issues needed to be resolved to
forge a consensus on the deal designed to help Taiwanese businessmen operating
in China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has no knowledge of why China altered its decision. Both sides were
fully aware that further negotiation was necessary on the question of whether
taxes should be collected based on their country of origin or the country in
which they reside, " Lee told ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lo Shu-lei at a
legislative hearing on the cross-Taiwan Strait talks.</P>
      <P>Lo said she suspected the agreement was shelved at the last minute because of a
backlash from China-based Taiwanese businesses, which were worried they might be
penalized by Chinese authorities for tax evasion based on information provided
by Taiwan under the terms of the planned agreement.</P>
      <P>Lee responded that paying tax is both an obligation  and responsibility of a
country's citizens, and he said Taiwan and China would only exchange information
in serious tax evasion cases "in line with Taiwan's laws."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao attributed the breakdown in talks to opposition from
Hong Kong, which feared it might be unable to collect taxes once a deal was
signed from the many Taiwan businessmen who have invested in China through the
former British colony.</P>
      <P>In their fourth meeting, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) ,  signed accords on
industrial product standards,  fishing crew cooperation  and agricultural
product inspection.</P>
      <P>But the two negotiators failed to clinch an anticipated pact on the avoidance of
double taxation, with neither side providing a clear explanation for the
stalemate.</P>
      <P>It was the first time in the four rounds of Chiang-Chen talks since June 2008
that an agreement that was expected to be reached failed to materialize.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fan Liqing, a spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's
State Council, rebutted speculation in Taiwan that China would use the cross-
strait pact on the avoidance of double taxation  to recover  tax that had gone
unpaid  by Taiwanese businessmen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China failed to sign the accord because conditions were not yet ripe,
and the matter had nothing to do with the sovereignty dispute, Fan stressed
Wednesday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>She said the two sides agreed to further negotiate the issue pragmatically and
clinch the agreement when the time was right.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of the pact is aimed at protecting the rights of Taiwanese
businessmen and to enable them to pursue more prosperous development in China,
she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) will dispose of its assets by next June and transform the
party into an "election machine," a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said the Central Investment Holding Co., the
only party asset that has been put in trust, will be auctioned off by June after
two previous failures.</P>
      <P>King said that political parties operating businesses were not acceptable amid
contemporary democratic trends in any free and democratic country, which is why
President and KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has also repeatedly called for party-run
businesses to be ended as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>King said the party's transformation is not a response to persistent criticism
but rather a move made out of necessity.</P>
      <P>"If the party does not re-engineer itself, it will not be able to develop in a
sustainable way," King said.</P>
      <P>The opposition alleges that the KMT's assets were illegally amassed during its
decades of authoritarian rule in the second half of the 20th century when the
lines between state and party were blurred.</P>
      <P>King said the party will be turned into a powerful election machine revolving
around the organization department, which will be complemented by a publicity
department. The party's organization and development  department  will  be
restructured  and its  staff streamlined.</P>
      <P>The party's funding will come from government subsidies for political parties ,
membership fees and donations, he said.</P>
      <P>On the upcoming by-elections for three legislative seats in Taoyuan, Taichung
and Taitung counties on Jan. 9, King said they will be "uphill battles."</P>
      <P>But he said the popularity of the KMT candidate in Taoyuan County is growing.</P>
      <P>On by-elections for four legislative seats to be held on Feb. 27, he said the
KMT has only decided on recruiting professor Lin Teh-jui from National Chung
Cheng University to run for the seat in Chiayi County. The candidates for the
races in Hualien, Hsinchu and Taoyuan counties will be announced later.</P>
      <P>Asked about the higher profile mayoral elections for five special municipalities
in late 2010, he said the KMT has yet to decide its candidates but vowed that
the screening process will be "as fair as possible, and will not be influenced
by under-the-table deals."</P>

      <P>Taiwan will have to spend twice as much as other countries as a percentage of
GDP to meet international carbon emissions reduction norms, which should be
carefully considered by the government in approaching the problem, an
environmental expert said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Taiwan's low-carbon roadmap, Yang Jih-chang, a senior
adviser to the Industrial Technology Research Institute, said the pursuit of
international standards could entail a heavy financial burden on the country.</P>
      <P>Citing International Energy Agency (IEA) data, Yang said a country has to spend
up to 0.5 percent of its annual gross domestic product (GDP) to keep greenhouse
gases below 450 ppm (parts per million) by 2020.</P>
      <P>But with scant natural energy resources and an industrial sector accounting for
over 50 percent of the country's annual GDP, Taiwan may have to spend more than
double the IEA-estimated amount to realize the IEA goal, Yang said, estimating
that such an effort could cost NT$100 billion to NT$150 billion annually.</P>
      <P>Speaking  on the same  occasion,  Environmental  Protection Administration
Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen said the Legislative Yuan has passed laws on
energy management and renewable energy development, but more work still needs to
be done.</P>
      <P>"Once the statutes governing energy taxes and the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions are enacted, our legal framework on carbon reduction will be
complete," Shen said.</P>
      <P>He also urged Taiwan Power Co. to reduce the ratio of fossil fuels in its energy
generation at the same as renewable energy sources are being developed.</P>
      <P>Minister-without-Portfolio  Liang Chi-yuan said President Ma Ying-jeou attaches
great importance to carbon reduction and has instructed Vice Premier Eric Liluan
Chu to form an interministerial task force to promote energy conservation and
carbon reduction.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang is also scheduled to convene a
meeting on strategies for boosting development of new energy sources, Liang
said.</P>
      <P>Yang Chi-yuan,  an associate professor  at Chinese Culture University, said the
government should not plot a carbon reduction target using a top-down
centralized process, suggesting instead that it allow agencies in charge of
transportation, industrial and economic affairs to set targets based on
practical abilities.</P>
      <P>"We need not follow European and American countries in setting carbon reduction
targets because their regulations do not necessarily meet Taiwan's needs," Yang
added.</P>

      <P>At present, direct exports from Taiwan to ASEAN countries account for 15-16
percent of the country's total exports, higher than the 12 percent to Europe or

      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD), a nonprofit organization set up by
the government to promote democracy around the world, has concluded that China's
human rights situation did not improve this year.</P>
      <P>According to the TFD's annual China human rights report, which will be
officially released Dec. 31, human rights protections in China in social,
political, judicial,  economic, environmental, educational  and cultural spheres
still have room for further improvement.</P>
      <P>The report found that China's system and its legal environment protect those
government officials who infringe on citizen's human rights, while, at the same
time, policies and regulations which can protect human rights are not
effectively implemented.</P>
      <P>The report points out that the Chinese regime continued to pressure Chinese
dissidents and human rights defenders and restrict freedom of speech this year,
and it also severely punished those who criticized  the shoddy construction
quality of buildings that collapsed in the Sichuan Earthquake in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government also imposed new ways to control Internet access and
interfered with the news media after the Beijing Olympics, while also using a
more systematic approach to apply greater pressure on human rights defenders,
the report says.</P>
      <P>All of these factors contributed to the continued deterioration of human rights
in the country, the report observes.</P>
      <P>Although China issued its first action plan on human rights this year, vowing to
address a host of issues from torture to the death penalty and the environment,
it still remains debatable whether China will be able to implement the plan, as
it still executes more people than any other country in the world, the report
says.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic and environmental rights, the Chinese government lacks a
practical and comprehensive development plan to solve outstanding problems left
over from the past, with the rural garbage issue requiring the most urgent
attention, the report says.</P>
      <P>The report, which was first published in 2003, also points out that the blocking
of many foreign  news and domestic  human rights-related Web sites also violates
people's right to know and their freedom of speech.</P>

      <P>Many people remain unsatisfied with the government's efforts to crack down on
official corruption and promote clean politics, according to the results of a
public opinion survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Up to 50.8 percent of respondents to the poll conducted by the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) said they are dissatisfied with the President  Ma Ying-jeou
administration's  efforts to wipe out corruption and upgrade political ethics,
while 42.4 percent said they are satisfied with the adminsitration's
achievements in this areas.</P>
      <P>Eliminating official corruption and establishing clean politics have been one of
the president's main policy goals. The MOJ commissioned a private polling
company to conduct the survey in June to gauge public reaction to the campaign.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 61 percent of respondents were unhappy with law enforcement
authorities' achievements in weeding out official corruption and cracking down
on links between local politics and crime syndicates.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 51.4 percent said they are optimistic about the government's
determination to improve political ethics and clamp down on official corruption,
compared to 36.7 percent who said they were pessimistic about the future.</P>
      <P>On the public's evaluation of the integrity of 24 catagories of public servants,
health care personnel at government-run medical institutions received the

      <P>Some 24.4 percent of Taiwan's population regularly exercises three times a week
for at least 30 minutes at a time, an increase of 0.2 percentage points from
2008, a survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council (SAC) has
found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the SAC's 2009 survey on the exercise habits of
people in Taiwan's 25 cities and counties, released Wednesday, Taiwan's people
exercise mainly to improve their health, shape their bodies or simply to have
fun.</P>
      <P>Walking is the most popular exercise, performed by 31.7 percent of respondents,
followed by hiking (21.9 percent) , cycling (21.1 percent) and basketball (18.9
percent), the survey found.</P>
      <P>Walking has been identified by the annual poll as the most popular form of
exercise in Taiwan for three straight years. Hiking rose to second from fifth a
year ago while jogging fell to fifth from second place last year, SAC officials
noted.</P>
      <P>Kao Chun-hsiung, a professor at National Taiwan Sport University, said more
people were choosing to hike in the mountains instead of jogging because of the
serious air pollution in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 80.5 percent of Taiwan's people exercise regularly or
occasionally.</P>
      <P>Wu Lung-shan, an SAC department director, said the council will allocate NT$1.6
billion (US$49.69 million) over the next four years to make exercise more common
among Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>The central government hopes to make Taiwan a "vigorous island" in collaboration
with local governments through the four projects, designed to boost the people's
interest in exercising at safe and complete facilities, Wu said,</P>
      <P>The SAC survey was based on 25,518 valid responses from all 25 localities around
the country, including Kinmen and Matsu islands.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling reported at the Legislative Yuan
that the sports lottery should generate about NT$2 billion in funds every year
to help promote sports in the country.</P>
      <P>The funds will be used to encourage corporate sponsorship of sports businesses

      <P>The Kaohsiung City government unveiled Wednesday a plan to drill new wells along
the Gaoping River to solve water shortages as a result of scanty rainfall.</P>
      <P>According to Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lin Jen-yi, daily water demand in the
greater Kaohsiung area amounts to approximately 1.25 million cubic meters by
household users and 300,000 cubic meters by industrial users.</P>
      <P>With the water flow of the Gaoping River having decreased by 40 percent compared
with last year, the government has to find new water sources, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that wells supply 200,000 cubic meters of water per day in the region at
present, Lin said the water supply from wells is likely to double to 400,000
cubic meters after new wells are drilled.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-shiao, deputy manager of Taiwan Water Corp.'s Seventh Branch,
confirmed that the company is planning to drill two new wells to meet the
demand.</P>
      <P>Lin also urged the authorities concerned to repair a water pipeline that

      <P>Right-handed pitcher Lin En-yu was selected as the number one pick by the
Brother Elephants in the 2010 Taiwanese professional baseball draft, held even
though the league's future remains clouded by a major game-fixing scandal</P>
      <P>Lin, a regular on Taiwan's national baseball team who played professionally in
Japan for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, was chosen first by the Elephants,
before the Sinon Bulls picked 18-year-old Chang Keng-hao of Nan Ying Vocational
High School.</P>
      <P>In all, 51 players were chosen by the league's four teams.</P>
      <P>"With Lin's talent and experience, he brings a lot to the table and will
definitely be in our starting rotation next season, " Elephants manager Chen
Jui-chen said after the draft.</P>
      <P>The 28-year-old compiled a 1-3 record for the Golden Eagles during his three-
year stint in Japan from 2007 to 2009, which was plagued by injuries and
ineffectiveness.</P>
      <P>He has spent the past two years in the Japanese minor league trying to regain
the form that earned him Rookie of the Year and MVP honors in his first year in
Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in 2005.</P>
      <P>The Elephants hope he will be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of
leading the team, widely seen as the most popular franchise in the CPBL, out
from under the darkest cloud in team history.</P>
      <P>Thirteen Elephants members, including 12 players and manager Nakagomi  Shin,
were charged with game-fixing  in an ongoing investigation by Taiwan prosecutors
in October and November, sparking concern that the team might be disbanded.</P>
      <P>Over 40 active and former players and coaches in the league were implicated in
the case that shocked the country, where baseball remains the national pastime.</P>
      <P>"We are happy to have Lin on our team. He is a proven pitcher and seasoned
veteran. Both Taiwanese baseball and the Elephants need him, especially now,"
Elephants coach Feng Sheng-hsien told reporters. "He will shoulder a great
burden of reviving fan interest in the national pastime and the Elephants."</P>
      <P>Before going to Japan, Lin spent two years (2005-06) in the CPBL with the now-
defunct Macoto Cobras, compiling a 29-16 won-loss record and setting an all-time
single-season strikeout record of 209.</P>
      <P>Sinon also has high hopes for the No. 2 pick, Chang, who will try to jump
directly from high school baseball to the professional ranks.</P>
      <P>"We have been keeping an eye on Chang for a while. He is a promising young
pitcher, but it will take time for him to make the adjustment from high school
ball, " said Sinon Assistant General Manager Liu Chih-shen.</P>
      <P>For young players like Chang, it was not an easy decision to place their names
in the draft pool at a time when the baseball community and fans are still
reeling from the aftershocks of the scandal, CPBL Secretary-General Wayne Lee
said.</P>
      <P>"Young players may have doubts about the league's stability and future.
Understandably, it was a difficult decision for them to apply for the draft at
this time, " Lee said. "But I told them that as all the teams are still doing
their best to prepare for the new season in this difficult time, there will be
more and better opportunities for the young guys."</P>
      <P>In the two-hour draft, the short-handed Elephants picked up 19 players. Sinon
and the La New Bears selected 11 each while the defending champion Uni-President
Lions added 10 newcomers. None of the players selected in the draft were on hand
to witness the process, however.</P>
      <P>All of the players selected in the first round were pitchers, as La New selected
Lee Chu-kwan third and Uni-President selected Tsai Ching-hao with its top pick.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou convened a Cabinet-level task force to tackle the issue
of reviving local baseball after the scandal broke out and hundreds of fans
marched the streets requesting  the government's help in "saving the national
pastime."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ripples from aborted Taiwan-China tax pact continue to be felt</HEADLINE>

      <P>The failure of Taiwan and China to conclude a tax agreement in formal talks
earlier this month continued to stir debate at the Legislative Yuan Wednesday,
with officials and lawmakers attributing the stalemate to different factors.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said Taiwan had no idea why China changed its
mind and backed off from its decision to ink the pact with Taiwan during the
latest round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks held in Taichung City Dec. 22-23.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged, however, that some technical issues needed to be resolved to
forge a consensus on the deal designed to help Taiwanese businessmen operating
in China.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has no knowledge of why China altered its decision. Both sides were
fully aware that further negotiation was necessary on the question of whether
taxes should be collected based on their country of origin or the country in
which they reside, " Lee told ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lo Shu-lei at a
legislative hearing on the cross-Taiwan Strait talks.</P>
      <P>Lo said she suspected the agreement was shelved at the last minute because of a
backlash from China-based Taiwanese businesses, which were worried they might be
penalized by Chinese authorities for tax evasion based on information provided
by Taiwan under the terms of the planned agreement.</P>
      <P>Lee responded that paying tax is both an obligation  and responsibility of a
country's citizens, and he said Taiwan and China would only exchange information
in serious tax evasion cases "in line with Taiwan's laws."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao attributed the breakdown in talks to opposition from
Hong Kong, which feared it might be unable to collect taxes once a deal was
signed from the many Taiwan businessmen who have invested in China through the
former British colony.</P>
      <P>In their fourth meeting, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) ,  signed accords on
industrial product standards,  fishing crew cooperation  and agricultural
product inspection.</P>
      <P>But the two negotiators failed to clinch an anticipated pact on the avoidance of
double taxation, with neither side providing a clear explanation for the
stalemate.</P>
      <P>It was the first time in the four rounds of Chiang-Chen talks since June 2008
that an agreement that was expected to be reached failed to materialize.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fan Liqing, a spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's
State Council, rebutted speculation in Taiwan that China would use the cross-
strait pact on the avoidance of double taxation  to recover  tax that had gone
unpaid  by Taiwanese businessmen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China failed to sign the accord because conditions were not yet ripe,
and the matter had nothing to do with the sovereignty dispute, Fan stressed
Wednesday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>She said the two sides agreed to further negotiate the issue pragmatically and
clinch the agreement when the time was right.</P>
      <P>The major purpose of the pact is aimed at protecting the rights of Taiwanese
businessmen and to enable them to pursue more prosperous development in China,
she added.</P>

      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) will dispose of its assets by next June and transform the
party into an "election machine," a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said the Central Investment Holding Co., the
only party asset that has been put in trust, will be auctioned off by June after
two previous failures.</P>
      <P>King said that political parties operating businesses were not acceptable amid
contemporary democratic trends in any free and democratic country, which is why
President and KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has also repeatedly called for party-run
businesses to be ended as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>King said the party's transformation is not a response to persistent criticism
but rather a move made out of necessity.</P>
      <P>"If the party does not re-engineer itself, it will not be able to develop in a
sustainable way," King said.</P>
      <P>The opposition alleges that the KMT's assets were illegally amassed during its
decades of authoritarian rule in the second half of the 20th century when the
lines between state and party were blurred.</P>
      <P>King said the party will be turned into a powerful election machine revolving
around the organization department, which will be complemented by a publicity
department. The party's organization and development  department  will  be
restructured  and its  staff streamlined.</P>
      <P>The party's funding will come from government subsidies for political parties ,
membership fees and donations, he said.</P>
      <P>On the upcoming by-elections for three legislative seats in Taoyuan, Taichung
and Taitung counties on Jan. 9, King said they will be "uphill battles."</P>
      <P>But he said the popularity of the KMT candidate in Taoyuan County is growing.</P>
      <P>On by-elections for four legislative seats to be held on Feb. 27, he said the
KMT has only decided on recruiting professor Lin Teh-jui from National Chung
Cheng University to run for the seat in Chiayi County. The candidates for the
races in Hualien, Hsinchu and Taoyuan counties will be announced later.</P>
      <P>Asked about the higher profile mayoral elections for five special municipalities
in late 2010, he said the KMT has yet to decide its candidates but vowed that
the screening process will be "as fair as possible, and will not be influenced
by under-the-table deals."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pursuing global carbon reduction norms may cost Taiwan: expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will have to spend twice as much as other countries as a percentage of
GDP to meet international carbon emissions reduction norms, which should be
carefully considered by the government in approaching the problem, an
environmental expert said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Taiwan's low-carbon roadmap, Yang Jih-chang, a senior
adviser to the Industrial Technology Research Institute, said the pursuit of
international standards could entail a heavy financial burden on the country.</P>
      <P>Citing International Energy Agency (IEA) data, Yang said a country has to spend
up to 0.5 percent of its annual gross domestic product (GDP) to keep greenhouse
gases below 450 ppm (parts per million) by 2020.</P>
      <P>But with scant natural energy resources and an industrial sector accounting for
over 50 percent of the country's annual GDP, Taiwan may have to spend more than
double the IEA-estimated amount to realize the IEA goal, Yang said, estimating
that such an effort could cost NT$100 billion to NT$150 billion annually.</P>
      <P>Speaking  on the same  occasion,  Environmental  Protection Administration
Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen said the Legislative Yuan has passed laws on
energy management and renewable energy development, but more work still needs to
be done.</P>
      <P>"Once the statutes governing energy taxes and the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions are enacted, our legal framework on carbon reduction will be
complete," Shen said.</P>
      <P>He also urged Taiwan Power Co. to reduce the ratio of fossil fuels in its energy
generation at the same as renewable energy sources are being developed.</P>
      <P>Minister-without-Portfolio  Liang Chi-yuan said President Ma Ying-jeou attaches
great importance to carbon reduction and has instructed Vice Premier Eric Liluan
Chu to form an interministerial task force to promote energy conservation and
carbon reduction.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang is also scheduled to convene a
meeting on strategies for boosting development of new energy sources, Liang
said.</P>
      <P>Yang Chi-yuan,  an associate professor  at Chinese Culture University, said the
government should not plot a carbon reduction target using a top-down
centralized process, suggesting instead that it allow agencies in charge of
transportation, industrial and economic affairs to set targets based on
practical abilities.</P>
      <P>"We need not follow European and American countries in setting carbon reduction
targets because their regulations do not necessarily meet Taiwan's needs," Yang
added.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD), a nonprofit organization set up by
the government to promote democracy around the world, has concluded that China's
human rights situation did not improve this year.</P>
      <P>According to the TFD's annual China human rights report, which will be
officially released Dec. 31, human rights protections in China in social,
political, judicial,  economic, environmental, educational  and cultural spheres
still have room for further improvement.</P>
      <P>The report found that China's system and its legal environment protect those
government officials who infringe on citizen's human rights, while, at the same
time, policies and regulations which can protect human rights are not
effectively implemented.</P>
      <P>The report points out that the Chinese regime continued to pressure Chinese
dissidents and human rights defenders and restrict freedom of speech this year,
and it also severely punished those who criticized  the shoddy construction
quality of buildings that collapsed in the Sichuan Earthquake in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government also imposed new ways to control Internet access and
interfered with the news media after the Beijing Olympics, while also using a
more systematic approach to apply greater pressure on human rights defenders,
the report says.</P>
      <P>All of these factors contributed to the continued deterioration of human rights
in the country, the report observes.</P>
      <P>Although China issued its first action plan on human rights this year, vowing to
address a host of issues from torture to the death penalty and the environment,
it still remains debatable whether China will be able to implement the plan, as
it still executes more people than any other country in the world, the report
says.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic and environmental rights, the Chinese government lacks a
practical and comprehensive development plan to solve outstanding problems left
over from the past, with the rural garbage issue requiring the most urgent
attention, the report says.</P>
      <P>The report, which was first published in 2003, also points out that the blocking
of many foreign  news and domestic  human rights-related Web sites also violates
people's right to know and their freedom of speech.</P>

      <P>Many people remain unsatisfied with the government's efforts to crack down on
official corruption and promote clean politics, according to the results of a
public opinion survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Up to 50.8 percent of respondents to the poll conducted by the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) said they are dissatisfied with the President  Ma Ying-jeou
administration's  efforts to wipe out corruption and upgrade political ethics,
while 42.4 percent said they are satisfied with the adminsitration's
achievements in this areas.</P>
      <P>Eliminating official corruption and establishing clean politics have been one of
the president's main policy goals. The MOJ commissioned a private polling
company to conduct the survey in June to gauge public reaction to the campaign.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 61 percent of respondents were unhappy with law enforcement
authorities' achievements in weeding out official corruption and cracking down
on links between local politics and crime syndicates.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 51.4 percent said they are optimistic about the government's
determination to improve political ethics and clamp down on official corruption,

      <P>On the public's evaluation of the integrity of 24 catagories of public servants,

      <P>Some 24.4 percent of Taiwan's population regularly exercises three times a week
for at least 30 minutes at a time, an increase of 0.2 percentage points from
2008, a survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council (SAC) has
found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the SAC's 2009 survey on the exercise habits of
people in Taiwan's 25 cities and counties, released Wednesday, Taiwan's people
exercise mainly to improve their health, shape their bodies or simply to have
fun.</P>
      <P>Walking is the most popular exercise, performed by 31.7 percent of respondents,
followed by hiking (21.9 percent) , cycling (21.1 percent) and basketball (18.9
percent), the survey found.</P>
      <P>Walking has been identified by the annual poll as the most popular form of
exercise in Taiwan for three straight years. Hiking rose to second from fifth a
year ago while jogging fell to fifth from second place last year, SAC officials
noted.</P>
      <P>Kao Chun-hsiung, a professor at National Taiwan Sport University, said more
people were choosing to hike in the mountains instead of jogging because of the
serious air pollution in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 80.5 percent of Taiwan's people exercise regularly or
occasionally.</P>
      <P>Wu Lung-shan, an SAC department director, said the council will allocate NT$1.6
billion (US$49.69 million) over the next four years to make exercise more common
among Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>The central government hopes to make Taiwan a "vigorous island" in collaboration
with local governments through the four projects, designed to boost the people's
interest in exercising at safe and complete facilities, Wu said,</P>
      <P>The SAC survey was based on 25,518 valid responses from all 25 localities around
the country, including Kinmen and Matsu islands.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling reported at the Legislative Yuan
that the sports lottery should generate about NT$2 billion in funds every year
to help promote sports in the country.</P>
      <P>The funds will be used to encourage corporate sponsorship of sports businesses

      <P>The Kaohsiung City government unveiled Wednesday a plan to drill new wells along
the Gaoping River to solve water shortages as a result of scanty rainfall.</P>
      <P>According to Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lin Jen-yi, daily water demand in the
greater Kaohsiung area amounts to approximately 1.25 million cubic meters by
household users and 300,000 cubic meters by industrial users.</P>
      <P>With the water flow of the Gaoping River having decreased by 40 percent compared
with last year, the government has to find new water sources, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that wells supply 200,000 cubic meters of water per day in the region at
present, Lin said the water supply from wells is likely to double to 400,000
cubic meters after new wells are drilled.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-shiao, deputy manager of Taiwan Water Corp.'s Seventh Branch,
confirmed that the company is planning to drill two new wells to meet the
demand.</P>
      <P>Lin also urged the authorities concerned to repair a water pipeline that
delivers water from Nanhua Reservoir to the Gaoping River dam. The channel was
damaged during Typhoon Morakot in August.</P>
      <P>Wang replied that the pipeline is expected to be repaired by the end of next
May. He also predicted that the water supply will remain normal before Chinese

      <P>The report points out that the Chinese regime continued to pressure Chinese
dissidents and human rights defenders and restrict freedom of speech this year,
and it also severely punished those who criticized  the shoddy construction
quality of buildings that collapsed in the Sichuan Earthquake in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government also imposed new ways to control Internet access and
interfered with the news media after the Beijing Olympics, while also using a
more systematic approach to apply greater pressure on human rights defenders,
the report says.</P>
      <P>All of these factors contributed to the continued deterioration of human rights
in the country, the report observes.</P>
      <P>Although China issued its first action plan on human rights this year, vowing to
address a host of issues from torture to the death penalty and the environment,
it still remains debatable whether China will be able to implement the plan, as
it still executes more people than any other country in the world, the report
says.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic and environmental rights, the Chinese government lacks a
practical and comprehensive development plan to solve outstanding problems left
over from the past, with the rural garbage issue requiring the most urgent
attention, the report says.</P>
      <P>The report, which was first published in 2003, also points out that the blocking
of many foreign  news and domestic  human rights-related Web sites also violates
people's right to know and their freedom of speech.</P>

    <HEADLINE>One quarter of Taiwan people's exercise regularly: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 24.4 percent of Taiwan's population regularly exercises three times a week
for at least 30 minutes at a time, an increase of 0.2 percentage points from
2008, a survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council (SAC) has
found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the SAC's 2009 survey on the exercise habits of
people in Taiwan's 25 cities and counties, released Wednesday, Taiwan's people
exercise mainly to improve their health, shape their bodies or simply to have
fun.</P>
      <P>Walking is the most popular exercise, performed by 31.7 percent of respondents,
followed by hiking (21.9 percent) , cycling (21.1 percent) and basketball (18.9
percent), the survey found.</P>
      <P>Walking has been identified by the annual poll as the most popular form of
exercise in Taiwan for three straight years. Hiking rose to second from fifth a
year ago while jogging fell to fifth from second place last year, SAC officials
noted.</P>
      <P>Kao Chun-hsiung, a professor at National Taiwan Sport University, said more
people were choosing to hike in the mountains instead of jogging because of the
serious air pollution in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 80.5 percent of Taiwan's people exercise regularly or
occasionally.</P>
      <P>Wu Lung-shan, an SAC department director, said the council will allocate NT$1.6
billion (US$49.69 million) over the next four years to make exercise more common
among Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>The central government hopes to make Taiwan a "vigorous island" in collaboration
with local governments through the four projects, designed to boost the people's
interest in exercising at safe and complete facilities, Wu said,</P>
      <P>The SAC survey was based on 25,518 valid responses from all 25 localities around
the country, including Kinmen and Matsu islands.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling reported at the Legislative Yuan
that the sports lottery should generate about NT$2 billion in funds every year
to help promote sports in the country.</P>
      <P>The funds will be used to encourage corporate sponsorship of sports businesses
and develop athletes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government unveiled Wednesday a plan to drill new wells along
the Gaoping River to solve water shortages as a result of scanty rainfall.</P>
      <P>According to Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Lin Jen-yi, daily water demand in the
greater Kaohsiung area amounts to approximately 1.25 million cubic meters by
household users and 300,000 cubic meters by industrial users.</P>
      <P>With the water flow of the Gaoping River having decreased by 40 percent compared
with last year, the government has to find new water sources, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that wells supply 200,000 cubic meters of water per day in the region at
present, Lin said the water supply from wells is likely to double to 400,000
cubic meters after new wells are drilled.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-shiao, deputy manager of Taiwan Water Corp.'s Seventh Branch,
confirmed that the company is planning to drill two new wells to meet the
demand.</P>
      <P>Lin also urged the authorities concerned to repair a water pipeline that
delivers water from Nanhua Reservoir to the Gaoping River dam. The channel was
damaged during Typhoon Morakot in August.</P>
      <P>Wang replied that the pipeline is expected to be repaired by the end of next
May. He also predicted that the water supply will remain normal before Chinese
New Year even if the drought continues.</P>

      <P>The time is not yet ripe for Taiwan and China to hold political negotiations,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Chao Chien-min said in a statement
Wednesday to clarify comments he made two days earlier.</P>
      <P>Briefing foreign envoys posted in Taiwan on Monday, Chao talked about the
direction of future talks between Taiwan and China, and some media outlets
interpreted his remarks as signaling that cross-Taiwan Strait political talks
were not far away.</P>
      <P>In Monday's briefing, however, Chao said Taiwan and China would continue to
discuss issues related to investment protection and security after a proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement is signed.</P>
      <P>On proposed cross-strait political negotiations, Chao told the foreign envoys
that it was indeed worrisome that China has deployed over 1,000 missiles on its
coast opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the time was not ripe for Taiwan and China to proceed with political
talks related to Taiwan's international space, the political status of each side
and military security since "there is a lack of mutual trust between us."</P>
      <P>Responding to a question by a representative of the American Institute in
Taiwan, which represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of official
ties, Chao cited both MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan and Chen Yunlin, China's top
negotiator with Taiwan, as saying that political talks are not the priority task
of both sides at the moment.</P>

      <P>announced Wednesday it will sell the last of the party's most controversial
assets -  the Central Investment Holding Co. - by the end of next June to
resolve the contentious  party asset issue and restructure itself into an
"election machine."</P>
      <P>However,  the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) remained skeptical
of the KMT's sincerity, saying that many KMT chairmen have promised to resolve
the party asset problem during their term, "but so far we have seen no
improvement."</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The KMT failed in its two previous attempts to sell Central Investment Holding
Co., in 2006 and in February this year. The company has a net worth of NT$22.9
billion and is the last of the party's most contentious assets, following the
sale of its policy research institute complex, three media outlets and its
former headquarters building.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung stressed at a news conference that in the
future, the KMT's funding will come from membership fees, fund raising and
government subsidies for political parties, but he would not promise that funds
from the sale of Central Investment will not be used to help bankroll the
campaigns of KMT candidates in next year's special municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Lin Yong-jui, head of the KMT's administration and management department, said
on the same occasion that the party will not appeal if Broadcasting Corp. of
China (BCC) loses the third trial over its two plots of land in Banciao, Taipei
County and in Hualien County.</P>
      <P>The previous DPP administration sued BCC for occupying six plots of government-
owned land as part of its efforts to return the KMT's "stolen" assets to the
public. BCC won the second trial.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Speaking at the KMT Central Standing Committee's weekly meeting, President Ma
Ying-jeou, in his capacity as KMT chairman, reiterated his determination to
resolve the party asset issue.</P>
      <P>"Dealing with the issue is part of our party's determination to transform
itself, " Ma said, adding that he hopes the company can fetch a good price as
Taiwan's economy has shown signs of a turnaround from its yearlong slump. (Dec.
31, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The DPP said the KMT's plan to sell its "stolen" assets is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>"The KMT's assets were stolen from the country. What the people of Taiwan want
to see is the party return those assets to the national coffers. The party
should do so to uphold the principles of justice and fairness," the DPP said in
a statement. (Dec. 31, 2009)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government has stepped up fence-mending efforts after a Legislative
Yuan consensus to restrict U.S. beef imports drew a strong protest from the
United States on Wednesday. Both the administration and the private sector plan
to organize delegations to visit Washington, D.C. and drive home their stances.</P>
      <P>The following is a digest of some local media reports on the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou ordered Wednesday that a team be sent to the United
States to communicate  with Washington  after the legislature on Tuesday agreed
to amend the Act Governing Food Sanitation in a way that would ban imports of
"risky" beef products from areas where cases of mad cow disease have been
documented over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The U.S. representative office in Taipei immediately voiced its concern Tuesday
over the planned legislation, because it contravenes a Taiwan-U.S. protocol
signed in October that lifted a previous ban on bone-in beef imports from the
United States.</P>
      <P>Ma's men will be visiting Washington aimed at minimizing the impact of the beef
controversy on U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>Washington has expressed its concern over the beef issue on three occasions
since November and many believe that if Washington takes any retaliatory moves
against Taiwan, it would likely be a new freeze on the resumption of talks under
the Taiwan-U.S. trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA).</P>
      <P>Washington could also retaliate by shelving plans to have ministerial-level U.S.
officials visit Taiwan. (Dec. 31, 2009)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>High-ranking officials, including President Ma, have perceived that the
situation has gone beyond salvation as the Legislature is set to have the new
ban consensus passed into law next week.</P>
      <P>Ma agreed that things would have turned out much better if relevant government
agencies had communicated more closely with the Legislature before Taiwan signed
the beef protocol with the U.S. in October.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that his team will be visiting Washington to let the U.S.
know that the ban, if takes place, will involve only about 2 percent of Taiwan's
total U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>"Some 98 percent of U.S. beef imports, including bone-in beef from cattle
younger than 30 months, will not be affected, " Ma stressed. (Dec. 31, 2009)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ma administration officials have said that the "sternly-worded" concern that
Washington has expressed over the Legislative Yuan's amendment represents the
"most serious diplomatic  crisis" for President Ma since he took office in May
2008.</P>
      <P>Veteran diplomat Eugene Yi-cheng Lok said Washington's latest wording was so
strong that it went beyond diplomatic rhetoric and suggested that the next step
could be that Washington recalls its liaison officer from Taiwan over the flap.</P>
      <P>Lok pointed out, however, that while the Ma administration scrambles to
"communicate" with Washington to minimize any possible fallout, the government
should also communicate with the Legislative Yuan, which represents the voices
of Taiwan's people. (Dec. 31, 2009)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>American scholars familiar with Taiwan affairs suggested Wednesday that Taiwan
should consider the negative impact the beef issue will have on future bids to
negotiate trade deals with other countries, as it ponders how to handle the
controversy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's legislators on Tuesday reached a consensus to ban imports of ground
beef or bovine offal from the U.S. through an amendment to the Act Governing
Food Sanitation. They will formally vote on the amendment on Jan. 5.</P>
      <P>The cross-party consensus contravenes some of the contents of a protocol inked
by representatives of Taipei and Washington in late October and has drawn a
stern rebuke from Washington.</P>
      <P>Bonnie S. Glaser, senior fellow at the Washington-based think tank Center for
Strategic and International Studies, said she believes that the U.S. will expect
that President Ma Ying-jeou's administration will try its best to prevent the
proposed amendment from passing the legislature.</P>
      <P>Should the amendment be written into law, its impact will be limited to economic
issues, such as the anticipated reopening of negotiations under the Taiwan-U.S.
trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA), Glaser suggested.</P>
      <P>As to its possible impact on other issues, such as U.S. military sales to Taiwan
or arrangements for President Ma's transit visit to the U. S., Glaser said she
highly doubted that Washington would link the flap over beef to other issues.</P>
      <P>Walter Lohman, director of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, also
suggested the beef issue may have a negative impact on Taiwan's economic and
trade relations with the U.S. and one of the consequences could be the
imposition of more barriers to the reopening of TIFA talks.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the debate in the Legislative Yuan over the amendment was not a
demonstration of democracy but rather a show of political manipulation, Lohman
said that what should really matter is the safety of U.S. beef products.</P>
      <P>He felt that Taiwan had handled the matter very poorly and that the country's
anti-globalization posture would disappoint those who expect to see closer
economic relations between Taiwan and the U.S.</P>

      <P>Lin Join-sane stressed, however, that the message the delegation will deliver to
U.S. officials and its bottom line will be carefully worked out beforehand.</P>
      <P>"The team will not depart without carefully thinking through the situation, " he

      <P>The U.S. beef storm is approaching Taiwan. The people of Taiwan will have to
share the lethality of U.S. retaliation if the country indeed bans imports of
U.S. ground beef or bovine offal through an amendment to the Act Governing Food
Sanitation.</P>
      <P>The consequences are still hard to predict at the moment. But people should
brace themselves for possibly frequent retaliations from the United States  and
China in the future due to the government's mishandling of key policy issues.</P>
      <P>National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi had warned lawmakers that
Taiwan could suffer if it unilaterally abrogates an international agreement like
the beef import protocol with the U.S. He is right. But why would the
administration secretly sign the pact? If it had put the issue to open debate
before sealing the deal, the scenario would have been far different.</P>
      <P>The U.S. retaliation could be a justly deserved penalty for the lack of
transparency of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration in its governance.</P>
      <P>Su and his team should be held accountable for striking the beef trade deal in
an opaque and closed-door manner. They deserve to be penalized. But the
consequences of their actions have to be assumed by the Legislature and the
people as a whole.</P>
      <P>Ma's administrative team will also face big troubles. One of the most direct
consequences will be its loss of public trust. People have reason to speculate
that Ma's administration may strike secret deals with China since it could sign
a beef trade accord with the U.S. without prior public discussion or
consultation with the Legislature.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's nongovernmental organizations are still facing China's obstruction
internationally with more than a dozen NGOs being requested to change their
names this year, but the trend was unrelated to the new flexible diplomatic
approach of Taiwan's government, according to a foreign ministry official.</P>
      <P>"Around a dozen Taiwan NGOs were requested to change names by respective
international NGOs this year. The number is slightly down from last year, " said
David Wu, vice chairman of the NGO Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>Due to political differences, China has been blocking Taiwan's representation in
the international organizations -- governmental or non-governmental -- for
years. In most cases, Taiwan NGOs are asked to change their names to "Taiwan,
China", "Chinese Taipei" or other names.</P>
      <P>"There are still incidents of Beijing blocking Taiwan NGOs' representation in
the international community,  " President Ma Ying-jeou said on Dec. 18, adding
that his administration hopes China would move away from that trend of
interference "to avoid giving Taiwan's people a bad impression of Chinese
authorities."</P>
      <P>For example, the Internet Society requested its Taiwan chapter to change its
membership name to "Taiwan, China" this year, a case which is still being
negotiated bilaterally, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The Internet Society Taiwan Chapter, YWCA and Taiwan Nurses Association (TNA)
are only among a handful of NGOs that face problems each year. Wu noted that
there are 2,162 Taiwanese NGOs that are members of INGOs.</P>
      <P>The most important thing in such cases is whether the NGO will retain its full
rights as a member, regardless of whether its name is eventually changed or not,
Wu said.</P>
      <P>Answering reporters' questions, Wu said the number of such cases is "unrelated
to the flexible diplomacy" Taiwan government is now implementing to ease cross-
Taiwan Strait tensions.</P>
      <P>Sometimes it is the INGOs who take the initiative to ask Taiwanese NGOs to
change their names because those INGOs want to recruit Chinese NGOs, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Citing the 70,000-member strong TNA, whose executive director Teresa Yin served
as the second vice president of the International Council of Nurses (ICN), as an
example, Wu encouraged Taiwan NGOs to increase their participation in the INGOs,
because those with high-level representation in international organizations are
more likely to be able to fend off China's interference.</P>
      <P>Government agencies and NGOs are doing everything they can to relay their
message to China, hoping that the long-time rival would relax its interference
on Taiwan's international civic participation, he said.</P>
      <P>The NGO Affairs Committee asked the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to add the
issue to the cross-strait negotiation agenda, Wu said, but the proposal was
turned down.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWSE to raise daily price fluctuation limit of stocks to 10%</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. (TWSE) may soon raise the daily price
fluctuation limit of stocks from the current 7 percent to 10 percent in response
to the expectations of many foreign institutional investors, TWSE Chairman
Schive Chi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Schive said the TWSE has recently conducted a survey among investors at home and
abroad and the feedback indicates that many institutional investors expect a
relaxation of the price fluctuation limits.</P>
      <P>The proposal to raise the daily limit will be submitted to the Financial
Supervisory Commission for approval.</P>
      <P>To maintain the market's stability, the daily price fluctuation limits of
stocks,  beneficiary certificates,  Taiwan Depository Receipts (TDRs) and
convertible bonds are currently set at 7 percent of the closing price of the
preceding business day, while those of listed bonds are set at 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Schive also addressed the increasing interest among overseas enterprises in
issuing Taiwan Depositary Receipts (TDRs) and the price difference between TDRs
and the underlying securities of some listed companies.</P>
      <P>He explained that the price difference reflects a competition between TDRs and
the underlying securities and with the maturity of the TDR market, the
difference is expected to narrow gradually.</P>
      <P>Schive said that over the past months, 10 overseas enterprises, including the
Hong Kong-listed cable TV connector producer Sandmartin International  Holdings,
Taiwanese-invested  decorative lighting producer Neo-Neon in China, and the
largest Taiwanese-invested food producer in China Master Kong, began floating
shares in Taiwan in the form of TDRs, and seven more are expected to follow suit
before the Chinese New Year in mid-February.</P>
      <P>In all, 14 companies have listed TDRs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. beef discontent can be handled: national security council</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking National Security Council (NSC) official said Thursday that a
high-level meeting convened a day earlier was enough to address Washington's
discontent over ban on U.S. beef proposed by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan on the beef controversy, NSC
Deputy Secretary-General Lee Hai-tung said there is no need for the country to
convene a national security meeting over the latest situation, including the
U.S. discontent and the possible retaliatory moves that could result.</P>
      <P>Lee said that according to the law, if a national security meeting is convened,
the heads of more than 10 Cabinet-level agencies should attend, adding that the
controversy is not serious enough to warrant being tackled by a national
security meeting.</P>
      <P>He was responding to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lu Shiow-yen, who asked
whether it is necessary for the NSC to convene a national security meeting to
handle the situation, which Lu described as "a diplomatic crisis between Taiwan
and the United States."</P>
      <P>After meeting with Premier Wu Den-yih and other officials Wednesday on the beef
controversy, President Ma Ying-jeou instructed that a delegation should be sent
to Washington to mitigate the fallout from the legislature's decision.</P>
      <P>The administration has stepped up fence-mending efforts after the Legislative
Yuan declined to endorse the protocol that Taiwan signed with the U.S. in
October that lifted previous bans on U.S. bone-in beef and various other beef
products.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan decided to amend the Act Governing Food Sanitation in a way
that would ban imports of "risky" beef products from areas where cases of mad
cow disease have been documented over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The legislative move has drawn a stern rebuke from Washington, which thinks the
planned amendment contravenes the protocol.</P>
      <P>Officials in Washington said that after the protracted talks that led to the
October lifting of the ban, the legislature's unilateral reversal will damage
Taiwan's credibility.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese authorities should consider very carefully the impact that
passage of the amendment in its current form will have on Taiwan's reputation as
a reliable trading partner and responsible member of the international
community, " a U.S. statement said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng called for the U.S. government
not to take advantage of the beef controversy to defer its plan to grant visa-
free privileges for Taiwan tourists visiting the United States.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the administration will have no option but to accept the
amendment, which is likely to be passed into law Jan. 5 by the ruling
Kuomintang-dominated legislature.</P>
      <P>Besides, he added, one of the attached strings of the amendment stipulates that
political responsibility in the wake of the amendment should be borne by both
the legislature and the administration.</P>
      <P>On the notion of whether the Legislative Yuan should send a delegation to
Washington to drive home its stance, Wang said that if a delegation representing
the whole legislature is to be sent, its implementation will require a
legislative resolution.</P>
      <P>"The legislators, however, have the right to join the Executive Yuan delegation
as individuals, if invited, " he continued.</P>
      <P>Wang said Washington should also know that the amendment involves a ban that
would affect only about 2 percent of Taiwan's total U.S. beef imports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a refugee draft bill Thursday, representing a step
closer for Taiwan to efficiently address the "human ping-pong ball" issue and
other related matters.</P>
      <P>It also passed an amendment to Article 17 of the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>The draft bill and the amendment will create a legal basis for the government to
handle the refugee issue and possibly allow asylum-seekers from abroad to stay
in Taiwan legally and rebuild their lives and careers.</P>
      <P>The bill and amendment, which still need to be referred to the Legislative Yuan
to be voted into law, would allow foreign nationals or stateless individuals
whose lives were under threat due to wars or natural disasters or who were
persecuted for political reasons, to apply for refugee status with the Taiwan
authorities, according to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>In the event of applications for asylum, an official said, the MOI will contact
the relevant United Nations agencies for assistance to verify the refugee status
and will make a decision on the case within six months, with a possible
extension of a further six months, he added.</P>
      <P>"During the one-year application period, the applicant will be granted  a permit
to stay in Taiwan,  along with free legal consultation services and basic
medical care and accommodation, " the official said.</P>
      <P>Should a mass number of people apply for refugee status in Taiwan, the MOI will
impose a quota on the applications and will contact the U.N. for consultation
and assistance, the official said.</P>
      <P>Once the applicant obtains refugee status, he or she will be issued with a
refugee ID that can be used to apply for permanent residence,  travel documents
and eventually naturalization,  he continued.</P>
      <P>At present, most refugees seeking asylum in Taiwan are from Tibet or are
descendants of the remnants of a Kuomintang (KMT) force that was stranded in
northern Thailand while trying to follow the KMT to Taiwan at the end of the
Chinese civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Apart from these refugees, two Chinese pro-democracy activists -- Cai Lujun and
Wu Yalin -- have also sought sanctuary in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cai sneaked into Taiwan last year and was held for six months at the Hsinchu
detention center for illegal Chinese immigrants, while Wu sought political
asylum after he arrived in Taiwan last year as a tourist. Both of them have
since obtained temporary resident status.</P>
      <P>The two men came under the media spotlight last September when they scaled the
wall of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) compound to ask for political
asylum in the United States.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan does not have a political refugee or asylum law, the government has
not been able to grant political asylum to the two Chinese political activists,
but they have been allowed to remain in Taiwan temporarily based on humanitarian
considerations, according to the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>The MAC provides them with a monthly stipend of between NT$10,000 and NT$20,000
to help with their living expenses because they are not allowed to work in
Taiwan, an MAC official went on, adding that this will continue to be a
financial burden on the agency.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said recently that he was deeply moved and grateful after
learning that "hope" has been selected as the word most representative of Taiwan
for 2009 in an opinion survey.</P>
      <P>When the survey asking respondents to choose a word best reflecting the
situation in the country for the year was held for the first time in 2008, the
word "chaos" was chosen.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan's economy is mired in a recession with unemployment reaching
6 percent and gross domestic product (GDP) contracting 2.53 percent this year,
local people have not chosen a negative word to epitomize the national
situation.</P>
      <P>The selection of the neutral word "hope" represents local people's tolerance of
Ma's flaws and deficiencies and their strong expectations that Ma will do
something to lead the country out of the abyss.</P>
      <P>Ma understands the public's moods and expectations as evidenced in his recent
calligraphy that reads "2010 will be a new start for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He says Taiwan's economy will rebound and post growth of more than 4 percent
next year. It is a general world trend that the economy will improve in the
coming year, but what our people expect is not just short-term growth or rebound
but vision for long-term national development.</P>
      <P>After two decades of social confusion, disorder and divisions due to frequent
political elections, Taiwan's social system and ethical values are in disarray.
Ma must come up with farsighted initiatives to inspire people to work in concert
for national wellbeing and prosperity.</P>
      <P>While maintaining the status quo and upholding the constitution are Ma's
fundamental governance guidelines, we would like to see him take bolder steps in
the coming year to rebuild Taiwan into a sustainable homeland where people can
lead stable and prosperous lives.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is destined to engage in peaceful competition with China, we hope Ma
can take the initiative in the coming year to help upgrade Chinese civilization
using Taiwan's experiences in building a liberal and democratic modern society
and political system for the wellbeing of the whole Chinese race. This endeavor
will help protect Taiwan from plunging into a cross-Taiwan Strait war.</P>
      <P>At a time when many young Europeans have gradually dropped narrow-minded nation-
state complexes and perceive themselves as Europeans and world citizens, Ma
should take steps to encourage local people to shed their "outcast mentality"
resulting from Taiwan's diplomatic isolation and to participate in global
activities and volunteer services to win Taiwan more friends and upgrade our
country's international profile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Paying a hefty price on beef</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/31/09  16:49:25</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislature has reached consensus on a draft law amendment based mainly on
an opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) version to restrict certain
beef imports from the United States, which will contravene a Taiwan-U.S.
protocol signed in October.</P>
      <P>The legislature naturally has the right to legislate, but this revision is an
improper gesture in that it shows the legislature randomly dismissing  an
executive  branch commitment  to other countries.</P>
      <P>Whether the revision truly reflects the public will is unknown, but it could be
seen as an irresponsible and rash decision that could damage Taiwan's image
internationally.</P>
      <P>The question of the safety of imported U.S. beef should be left to scientific
tests, not by a policy that panders to the populace. If local people do not want
to eat U.S. beef, no-one can force them to buy it.</P>
      <P>The government could also ask businesses that import and sell U.S. beef to mark
the origin and tell of the perceived risks for the discretion of consumers.</P>
      <P>The DPP's political confrontation is a political strategy and the legislators of
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) should stick to their guns and defend the executive
branch's decision rather than just trying to evade the issue or smooth things
over.</P>
      <P>Some might point out the executive  branch's  failure  to communicate with the
legislature before signing the agreement, and say that President Ma Ying-jeou,
who doubles as KMT chairman, should take political responsibility.</P>
      <P>However,  it would be unjust to hold Ma responsible  for everything. After all,
the KMT enjoys an absolute majority in the legislature, so it is up to its
legislators to take the initiative to defend the policy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved Thursday its national development plan for 2010, setting
the target for economic growth at 4.8 percent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government aims to achieve per capita Gross Domestic Product of
US$17,541, lower the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent, and keep the inflation
rate at below 1 percent.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih instructed the relevant authorities to remove barriers to
private investment, boost the development of the six industries designated as
strategic, and encourage the private sector to participate in public
construction projects to help the government attain its goals.</P>
      <P>The authorities should also enhance the execution of public construction
projects and implement measures to boost employment, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, the three main policy themes for 2010 are promoting
economic prosperity, improving the quality of life and making a commitment to
environmental sustainability.</P>
      <P>In terms of promoting economic prosperity, the government will seek to stimulate
private investment by measures such as regularly tracking the progress of major
investment projects and setting up special task forces to push for the
realization of major projects.</P>
      <P>The government will also carry out industrial  reforms by developing the six
strategic industries, assisting the development of the  information  and
communication  technology  industry,  and encouraging the adjustment of
industrial structures.</P>
      <P>There will also be measures to strengthen Taiwan's global connections, such as
promoting the signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement with China,
introducing projects aimed at bridging industries on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait and exploring opportunities in emerging markets such as India, Russia,
Brazil and the Middle East.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government will improve Taiwan's business environment by
promoting deregulation of the six strategic industries and the services sector,
reviewing financial regulations  and simplifying the processing of land
development projects.</P>
      <P>It will also step up measures to boost employment by expanding the salary
subsidies program for private employers and increasing government hiring, with
the goal of creating at least 100,000 jobs in 2010.</P>
      <P>In terms of improving the quality of life, it will introduce affordable housing
projects, continue to provide assistance to young people to help them buy their
own homes and promote a baby-sitting subsidy program.</P>
      <P>The government will enact a law to govern long-term care services, reform the
pension system and will study a reverse mortgage program for seniors.</P>
      <P>There will also be emergency aid for those in need, assistance for disadvantaged
families, school vouchers for children attending private kindergartens, child-
care and education subsidies for low- and medium-income  households  and
kindergarten  subsidies  for indigenous children.</P>
      <P>In terms of measures to ensure environmental sustainability, the government will
speed up post-Typhoon Morakot reconstruction, step up the prevention and control
of swine flu, continue to promote the "i-Taiwan  12 projects,  " work out a
strategy  for homeland development, enact a law on greenhouse gas reduction and
amend the energy management law.</P>

      <P>A delegation composed of lawmakers, experts and civic group and government
representatives will visit the United States after the legislature's adjournment
and the New Year holiday in an attempt to minimize the possible impact on
bilateral ties arising from the dispute over U.S. beef imports to Taiwan,
Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held at the Government Information Office, Wu said
the Executive Yuan, through the Washington-based Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office, had notified the United States that the delegation will
make the trip to boost mutual understanding and communication on the issue.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Executive Yuan will put together a mission of its own to visit
the United States, Wu said that will depend on subsequent developments and
actual needs.</P>
      <P>In view of the outcry from the public and the legislature over the Executive
Yuan's decision in late October to partially lift a ban on some U. S. bone-in
beef products, including offal and ground beef, the premier acknowledged that
the government has not done enough to provide a clear explanation to the public.</P>
      <P>"The executive branch will conduct an in-depth self-examination to avoid making
the same mistake again," he pledged.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy Yang, the United States fully
understands Taiwan's stance and handling of the dispute following an explanation
from Jason Yuan, Taiwan's top envoy to the United States.</P>
      <P>"There is no urgent need for the executive branch to send a delegation to the
United States for the time being, and it will be sent only when necessary," Yang
explained.</P>
      <P>However, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said it seems that "the
United States is to put aside a two-way meeting on the trade and investment
framework agreement (TIFA) planned for early next year and to delay an exchange
of high-ranking officials."</P>
      <P>Despite the strong pressure from the United States, Yang vowed to continue to
communicate with the United States in the hope that bilateral communication will
remain smooth.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from the ruling and opposition  camps reached a consensus Tuesday on a
revision to the Act Governing Food Sanitation that would ban the import of offal
and ground beef from cattle raised in areas affected by mad cow disease within
the past 10 years, including the United States. The bill will be put to a final
vote Jan. 5.</P>
      <P>In response, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office and the U.S. Agriculture
Department issued a joint statement saying that  "the United States is deeply
concerned and disappointed" by the proposed amendment that would prohibit
imports of cattle skulls, brains, eyes, spinal cords and intestines, as well as
ground beef and offal.</P>
      <P>It also warned that if the bill is passed, the United States will abort a
bilateral trade deal.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the civic delegation's visit to the United States, Lu Hsueh-chang,
a caucus whip of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , said lawmakers are welcome to
take part in the mission to explain the Taiwan people's stance on the beef issue
to the U.S. side or to gain first-hand information about U.S. beef processing.</P>
      <P>"But Taiwan's lawmakers have no responsibility for explaining the law amendment
to Washington, " he noted, adding that "it is a matter of national dignity
simply because Taiwan is not an American colony."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Daniel Huang, whose law revision proposal was adopted by the
legislature, said that "in line with the Constitution, it is absolutely
inappropriate for the legislature to send a delegation and explain the matter to
Washington."</P>
      <P>He insisted that "he will not take part in the mission and head for the states
for that reason," pointing out that he is responsible only to Taiwan's voters.</P>
      <P>Huang  Wei-jer,  a lawmaker  of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party,
meanwhile, said he would be willing to join the mission -- making him the first
legislator to make the gesture.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tomorrow will be the Republic of China's 99th birthday and will mark the start
of its last year before its centenary.</P>
      <P>The ROC is unique in world history. It owes its origin to the Wuchang Uprising
of Oct. 10, 1911 that started the Xinhai Revolution, which led to the collapse
of the Qing dynasty.</P>
      <P>After losing a civil war to the Chinese communists,  the Kuomintang-led ROC
moved its seat to Taiwan, which was ceded to Japan by Qing dynasty rulers in
1895 and returned to China after the end of World War II in 1945.</P>
      <P>Over the ensuing six decades, the ROC has not only survived communist shelling,
diplomatic suppression and a missile threat but also has evolved from an
agricultural backwater into an industrial powerhouse and vibrant democracy.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the People's Republic of China, which came into being in China
in 1949, has also withstood a series of disastrous policy blunders to emerge as
one of the world's superpowers.</P>
      <P>The PRC usurped the glory of the Sun Yat-sen-led  Xinhai Revolution and the
Chinese communists once tried to whitewash the history of the Xinhai Revolution
but later changed their attitude and decided to mark the event's 100th
anniversary next year with various activities.</P>
      <P>Obviously,  Beijing's leaders want to recognize the Xinhai Revolution's role in
China's history to enhance the legitimacy of their governance. The presence of a
huge image of Sun -- the ROC's national founding father -- at Beijing's landmark
Tiananmen Square epitomizes communist China's change toward history.</P>
      <P>When the ROC celebrates the centenary of the Xinhai Revolution in Taiwan next
year, we look forward to seeing both sides of the Taiwan Strait find more common
ground from the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution and Sun's ideals of building
China into a democratic republic. If so, the two sides will be able to find more
mutual goodwill and develop win-win strategies for their mutual benefit.</P>
      <P>For years, pro-independence activists have tried to deny the existence of the
ROC in order to justify their cause of seeking Taiwan's de jure independence.</P>
      <P>We earnestly hope they will come to understand that such advocacy will lead
nowhere. The ROC's historical role and status can never be denied. The ROC is an
irreplaceable link in cross-strait relations and ensuring Taiwan's peace and
stability.</P>

      <P>Judging from the kowtowing of the Ma administration over the past year and a
half, it might be more appropriate to say that the Ma administration is not only
"Findlandizing" Taiwan, it is Sinicizing the island.</P>
      <P>Gilley's suggestion of stopping arms sales to Taiwan is because continued sales
would be like selling the arms to China to be used against the United States in
the future.</P>
      <P>The late Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who had great insight into Taiwan's strategic
location, referred to Taiwan as an unsinkable aircraft carrier.</P>
      <P>This strategic importance means that the U.S. response to the Ma
administration's tilt toward China should not be to exclude Taiwan from among
its Asian allies, but to help maintain Taiwan's status quo of independence.</P>
      <P>Even if the Ma administration is tilting toward China, the majority of Taiwanese
people are still tilting toward independence. U.S. scholars and government
officials, while wary of the Ma administration, should address Taiwan's
mainstream opinion correctly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>25-year friendship bonds president, German lawmaker</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/31/09  19:38:48</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A love for Taiwan and 25 years of friendship with President Ma Ying-jeou are the
reasons Karl Lamers, a member of the German Parliament and President of the
Atlantic Treaty Association, decided to exchange his New Year holiday for a trip
to Taiwan, Lamers told CNA Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lamers, 74, who was in the middle of a six-day visit along with German MPs Anita
Schafer and Robert Hochbaum, lauded Ma's pragmatic methods of reducing problems
across the Taiwan Strait and bringing peace and stability to what was once one
of the world's most volatile flash points.</P>
      <P>It was more than 20 years ago when Lamers, a young Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) member with no function in the party and Ma, who was serving as an
interpreter to the late President Chiang Ching-kuo, struck up their friendship
in an inter-party collaboration that brought dozens of young Germans to Taipei
and young Kuomintang (KMT) members from Taiwan to the German city of Heidelberg.</P>
      <P>That was his most unforgettable experience of Taiwan, Lamers said, adding that
"later we both decided to go into politics and here we are."</P>
      <P>Recalling his first encounter with Ma, Lamers said he stood out because "he
realizes what he says, does what he says and knows how to convince people -- all
unique characteristics of a great politician."</P>
      <P>"And of course, he's good-looking, " he said.</P>
      <P>Last March, Lamers was in Ma's campaign office to witness his landslide win in
the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lamers, who is on his fifth visit to the country, has a connection to Taiwan
dating back as far as 30 years, when "China was still an enemy and Taiwan was
totally different from now in terms of democracy," he said.</P>
      <P>But now China is a part of cooperation and Ma deserves the credit for
implementing a "peace policy" that includes "three noes" (no independence, no
unification and no use of force) that has relaxed cross-strait tension, he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the future of Taiwan and China, Lamers said Ma made it clear that
"it's a question to be solved by the next generation."</P>
      <P>Just like the unification of Germany, "such development takes time and maybe one
day the door will open," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hochbaun said that timing is everything, adding that Germany was
unified at a time "when politicians had no opportunities to do anything against
it" and it was a step-by-step process instead of happening overnight.</P>
      <P>China has sent out a signal of goodwill toward Taiwan, Lamers observed, in
allowing Taiwan observer status in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and
"hopefully good things will happen in Taiwan's participation in the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the International Civil
Aviation Organization."</P>
      <P>In terms of China's missiles deployed against Taiwan and it's anti-secession
law, the veteran politician noted that there was a time when every Taiwanese was
in fear of China's use of missiles.</P>
      <P>"But in the past two years we have not had the feeling that the people were in
fear. Yes, the missiles are still there but they're no longer a threat to the
people of Taiwan because of the reduced tensions," he said.</P>
      <P>Lamers said Ma was doing the right thing in advocating a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement between the two sides of the strait because
"Taiwan should be incorporated into the global economic system and should not be
isolated."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's armed forces have good equipment, good training and educated soldiers,
observed Lamers, who also serves as deputy chairman of the German Parliament's
Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>However, Germany currently focuses its exchanges with Taiwan solely on trade and
culture, he went on, adding that arm sales or military cooperation is out of the
question at present.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will name its candidate for
the mayoral election of the new special municipality to be formed by merger of
Kaohsiung city and county by late March, DPP Secretary-General Su Jia-chyuan
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su made the announcement after visiting incumbent Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang

      <P>The county and city in southern Taiwan will be combined into a single
administrative area next year and the election of its first mayor will take
place next December.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the committee to field an eligible candidate who can meet voters'
expectations and stressed that the candidate must be produced without causing a
split within the party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both Yang and Chen have stepped up their efforts to increase their

    <HEADLINE>Law amendment will not abrogate beef agreement: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
12/31/09  19:54:00
(By Garfie Li and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that Taiwan's plan to amend a law to
restrict U.S. beef imports will not result in an abrogation of a Taiwan-U.S.
agreement signed in October, after the plan drew a strong negative reaction from
Washington.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, the proposed amendment, if passed, will not bar imports of
bone-in beef, Ma explained in an informal gathering with the media.</P>
      <P>The amendment targets only ground beef and bovine offal, which account for only
2 percent of all beef products exported by the United States to Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Ruling and opposition legislators reached consensus Dec. 29 to amend the Act
Governing Food Sanitation to ban the import of beef products  considered  at
risk of spreading  bovine  spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The move came in the wake of two months of controversy since Taiwan signed a
protocol with the United States to allow the entry of bone-in beef and other
beef products that had previously been banned for BSE concerns.</P>
      <P>Expressing deep concern and disappointment at the proposed amendment,  United
States Deputy Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis and Undersecretary  for
Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services Jim Miller released a joint statement
warning that the bill, if passed,  would constitute "a unilateral abrogation" of
the bilateral protocol.</P>
      <P>Marantis and Miller also urged Taiwan to consider the move's possible impact on
the country's reputation as "a reliable trading partner and responsible member
of the international community."</P>
      <P>Ma said the statement by the two U.S. officials shows that they understand the
situation in Taiwan quite well.</P>
      <P>However, they may not understand that people in Taiwan are probably "more
sensitive and apprehensive" about food safety than Americans, and that the
administrative and legislative branches have to respect public opinion, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said the government will continue to communicate the issue with Washington
through various means, including sending a delegation to the United States, in
the hope that the U.S. side can be made to understand that "scientific evidence
and professional evaluations alone are insufficient to resolve the doubts held
by the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>The president also said he hopes the U.S. government will limit any possible
retaliation to economic and trade areas.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in the United States, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Security Council are
studying ways to mend relations with Washington, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait peace agreement not possible at present: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin, Dec. 31 (CNA)
12/31/09  19:57:42
(By Lin Yu-li and Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said in an interview with the German magazine
"Internationale Politik" that he does not believe a cross-Taiwan Strait peace
agreement is possible under the present situation that China has deployed 1,300
missiles aimed at Taiwan and will not give up the threat of using force against
the country.</P>
      <P>The bimonthly, published by the German Council on Foreign Affairs, carries an
interview by Professor Gottfried-Karl Kindermann of Munich University with Ma,
titled "Cautious Approach, " in its January-February issue.</P>
      <P>Stressing the difference in political systems and social norms, Ma told
Kindermann that in resolving cross-strait problems, not only historical factors
but also the political reality and the feelings of the Taiwanese people must be
taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>He said the right way should be to build mutual trust and solve problems in a
democratic way on the basis of equal status and dignity.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government must recognize and respect Taiwan's democratic system, Ma
added.</P>
      <P>Regarding the possibility that in his capacity as chairman of the ruling
Kuomintang, he could meet Chinese President Hu Jintao, the president said that
such a meeting would be meaningful only if the people in Taiwan reach consensus
over it. "So far, the Taiwanese people still have different opinions on the
tempo of developing bilateral relations," he said.</P>
      <P>While the pre-unification experience of Germany is very often used to compare
the separation of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Ma said that the principle
of "one Germany, two nations" is not applicable to the cross-strait situation,
although the two sides can learn from the efforts of the two Germanys in
maintaining peaceful co-existence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao held an online chat with hundreds of millions of
Chinese netizens recently through Xinhuanet.com in an effort to learn about
people's concerns through the Internet.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's administrative team should feel ashamed, as while it often claims to
put itself in the people's shoes when formulating policy, it tends to lack
transparency in plotting policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>Wen's online interview is also symbolically significant as it manifests the
Chinese authorities' emphasis on the importance of the new media and their
efforts to win the hearts and minds of the large Chinese Internet population.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, even though Taiwan outpaces China in terms of Internet penetration,
its leaders have so far not paid due attention to the views and opinions of
local netizens, far less holding regular chats with them.</P>
      <P>During his two-hour chat with Chinese netizens, Wen responded to questions about
national policies, housing prices, medical care, education and his hobbies.</P>
      <P>He gave a clear indication that China will continue its stimulus policy to
bolster economic development in the coming year.</P>
      <P>This should benefit a number of Taiwanese investors in China and we hope our
government will study whether it can open up a window of opportunity for local
businessmen through China's experience.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A stateless sixth grader in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu County born to illegal
immigrants from Indonesia, has finally secured Republic of China nationality
with help from President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu Magistrate Chiu Ching-chun personally presented Huang Shih-han with her
brand-new ROC identification card at the population administration department of
the county's Singong township office Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih-han has been in the custody of her Indonesian "aunt" Hsu Ju-ya, who was
married to a Taiwanese man more than 20 years ago, since her parents were
repatriated in 1997.</P>
      <P>As her birth certificate identified her parents as Indonesians, the 13-year-old
girl has been unable to obtain a national ID card.</P>
      <P>At Hsu's request, Fuhing Elementary School in Hsinchu County agreed to admit her
when she turned 7 and the school then sought the help of the county government
to help Shih-han obtain an ID card to qualify for formal admission to the school
and national health insurance coverage.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, the county government repeatedly asked the Ministry of
the Interior to help resolve the issue, but to no avail.</P>
      <P>As Shih-han will soon graduate from elementary school, she wrote to President Ma
Ying-jeou early this year seeking his help.</P>
      <P>She wrote in the letter: "... Without an ID card, I cannot see a doctor and have
to buy drugs from stores when I am sick and I will be unable to enter junior
high school... Mr. President, can you help me? If I can get an ID card, I will
definitely study hard to return your kind-hearted help."</P>
      <P>The letter must have moved the president, as the National Immigration Agency's
(NIA's) Hsinchu branch received in March a notice from the Ministry of the
Interior instructing it to give the best possible assistance to Shih-han.</P>
      <P>The branch first asked Indonesia's representative office in Taipei to issue a
certificate proving that Shih-han is not an Indonesian citizen so that she could
apply for residency in Taiwan as a stateless person.</P>
      <P>After that, the NIA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to trace Shih-
han's parents, but discovered that the names her parents' used were fake, so
that they could not be found.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's nationality Act, a locally born child with unknown parents
can apply to become a citizen.</P>
      <P>The MOI notified the Hsinchu county government earlier this month suggesting
that Shih-han's aunt complete her adoption, and with the adoption procedures,
the girl was able to get an ROC ID card.</P>
      <P>According to MOI officials, there are 38 more cases similar to Shih-han's
pending resolution.</P>
      <P>"We plan to invite officials from the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and local governments to address them on a case-by-case basis,"
said MOI official said.</P>

      <P>Applying for passports will be easier for Taiwanese nationals from next May 3,
as they will be able to do so at 29 appointed depots around the country in the
initial stages of a new initiative,  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lo Yu-chung, director-general of the MOFA's Consular Affairs Bureau, told a
year-end news conference that from that date, residents outside Taipei City can
apply for new passports at the 29 household  registration  offices of the local
city and county governments, as well as at MOFA offices in Taichung, Kaohsiung
and Hualien.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, 369 house registration offices will later be permitted to
accept passport applications after a proposed law revision clears the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the electronic passports that the MOFA has been promoting for the
last year, he said close to 980,000 of this type of passport have been issued,
accounting for 10 percent of the total in circulation.</P>
      <P>Lo urged the public to apply for an ePassport, as it is safer and more effective
in preventing crime, and helps upgrade Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the 60th country in the world to adopt electronic passports, which
contain a contactless chip and antenna embedded in its back cover, with the
bearer's biographical data and facial image stored on the chip.</P>
