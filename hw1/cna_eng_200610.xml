deaths now 76

The number of displaced residents being given
assistance in 321 evacuation centers in areas severely
affected by typhoon "Milenyo" has swelled to more than
900,000 while the death toll rose to 76, the National
Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) and other sources
reported yesterday.


The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Bicol damage
extensive

SORSOGON CITY -- It was in Sorsogon yesterday where
President Macapagal-Arroyo saw what the fury of
Typhoon "Milenyo" (international name: Xangsane) had
truly wrought. And she was overwhelmed.

The Philippine Star: 'Milenyo' recovery crawls

Recovery operations in the aftermath of typhoon
"Milenyo" are being hampered by the slow clearing of
debris, fallen trees and collapsed billboards that
have damaged power lines and left millions of
residents still without electricity in Metro Manila
and other parts of Luzon.

The Manila Times: 'Milenyo' deaths reach 61;
61,000 families displaced

The official toll from Typhoon Milenyo
(international codename Xangsane) on Saturday rose to
at least 61 dead, 81 injured and 69 missing, as relief
efforts struggled to cope with the worst storm to hit
Metro Manila in a decade.</TEXT>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang traveled to Taiwan's
frontline island of Kinmen Sunday for an inspection tour prior to the
traditional Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on Oct. 6 this year.</P>
      <P>Flanked by a group of Cabinet officials, Su first visited the
headquarters of the Coast Guard operations in Kinmen, where he
listened to a briefing on law enforcement efforts around the coastal
areas of Kinmen -- an island stronghold lying near Xiamen City in
China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Su exhorted the Kinmen Coast Guard forces to do their best to
safeguard Taiwan's frontline as well as borderline, particularly
during the festive season when there tend to be more people exchanges
across the strait, as well as greater smuggling and trafficking
activity.</P>
      <P>The premier then visited the headquarters of the renowned Kinmen
Kaoliang Liquor Inc., which is a major cash cow of the former
anti-communist garrison island, and the newly constructed building at
Shueitou Harbor, from where direct shipping links between Kinmen and
Xiamen under the "mini three links" program are operated. The "mini
three links" program was initiated by Taiwan in January 2001.</P>
      <P>Su then inspected the operations of Kinmen's Shangyi Airport and
its expansion construction to gain a better understanding of whether
the airport is capable of accommodating the ever-increasing air
traffic as a result of the opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Su said he is glad to finally have the chance to visit Kinmen
after his two previously planned visits to the island since assuming
the premiership early this year were both canceled because of
typhoons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN BOYCOTTS LOCAL DAILY AFTER DEFAMATION CONTROVERSY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) called Sunday for support for the DPP
chairman's decision the day before to boycott the China Times, a
local Chinese-language daily, after a defamation controversy.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang said the China
Times has deviated from an independent newspaper's role of being a
neutral and objective source of information and has allowed itself to
become a campaign tool of the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Tsai said DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun has decided not to buy or read
the China Times nor run advertisements in the daily any longer
following what Yu called the newspaper's "repeating of a biased
report" on his remarks made last month even after the DPP issued a
statement to clarify the remarks.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 20, Yu described the on-going "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign aimed at forcing embattled President Chen
Shui-bian to resign as "the Chinese bullying the Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>On Sept. 21, Wang Li-ping, a deputy leader of the "Depose Chen"
campaign, lashed out at Yu at a news conference for using what she
described as "narrow-minded, inflammatory" remarks to alienate the
Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>"In describing the supporters of the campaign as 'Chinese pigs, '
Yu demonstrated himself to be a politician without conscience, " Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Many leaders of the round-the-clock "Million Voices Against
Corruption" sit-in -- initiated by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh
-- are either former DPP members or supporters.</P>
      <P>Immediately after Wang made the accusation against Yu on Sept.
21, the DPP leadership issued a press release to clarify that Yu had
absolutely not implied that the campaign supporters are "Chinese
pigs" as Wang claimed and to announce that the DPP would file a
defamation suit against Wang, according to Tsai.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the China Times still quoted Wang on its front page
Sept. 24 as saying that DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun had called the
anti-Chen campaign supporters "Chinese pigs, " prompting Yu to file a
defamation suit against the daily the same day, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The China Times has yet to respond to Yu's boycott announcement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Autumn is the traditional season to eat
crabs in Chinese society, and live, juicy, plump crabs have been
specially imported from China, Japan, and Southeast Asia for locals
to enjoy, seafood trade sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to culinary experts fall is the perfect time for crab
feasts, with the autumn months producing the best and largest crabs
of the season, and at very reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>A local hyper market manager said crab sales always hit a high
during autumn, with the most favored in the Taiwan market including
hairy crabs from China's Yangcheng Lake, king crabs from Japan, red
crabs from Southeast Asia and Taiwan's very own virgin crabs.</P>
      <P>During this season, the meat of the female crab ovaries and of
male crabs is much greater than normal, he added.</P>
      <P>Imperial Hotel executive chef Guo Tai-wang also remarked that the
autumn season is the best time to enjoy crabs, adding that the
highest quality crabs are shipped to restaurants.</P>
      <P>He said that the best crabs to buy weigh about half a kilogram,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Action Alliance (DAA) urged
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Sunday to take
action to depose Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li, who was sentenced by a
Keelung district court to seven years in prison last month on charges
of corruption in a land purchase scandal.</P>
      <P>DAA convener Huang Kuang-kuo told a press conference at the
Legislative Yuan that if Ma is really supportive of the ongoing
anti-corruption campaign seeking to oust President Chen Shui-bian, he
should also demonstrate his determination to rid his party of
corruption by forcing Hsu to step down.</P>
      <P>Huang said Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, cannot say that his
party has washed its hands of Hsu simply by stripping him of his KMT
membership.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the press conference, Chang Ya-chung, deputy
convener of the DAA, said that "if the KMT wants the scandal-ridden
president ousted, it should also force the Keelung mayor to step
down. We will not allow double standards in the fight against
corruption."</P>
      <P>The two DAA leaders indicated they will stage a parade Oct. 5 in
Keelung City and hold another rally in front of the Taipei City
government Oct. 9 to pressure Ma to force Hsu step down.</P>
      <P>Hsu was sentenced to seven years in prison Sept. 21 for
corruption in a NT$85 million (US$2.57 million) land deal. The KMT
immediately expelled him from the party and declared that if the
Keelung City Council decides to recall Hsu, the KMT will allow its
members to decide for themselves whether to vote against Hsu.</P>
      <P>Hsu has vowed that he will appeal the case to the Taiwan High
Court. He has refused to resign, insisting that he did not do
anything wrong.</P>
      <P>According to the law, Hsu's status as Keelung mayor will not be
affected unless he is convicted of corruption at a second trial by
the High Court.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman has apologized to Keelung's voters for openly
supporting Hsu and endorsing his "integrity" in the run-up to his
re-election in December last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD CHINESE TRADERS CONVENTION SLATED TO BEGIN IN TAIPEI OCT. 2</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 25th World Chinese Traders Convention is
scheduled to be held in Taipei Oct. 2-5, with the participation of
some 200 business leaders of Chinese or Taiwanese origin from more
than 30 countries.</P>
      <P>The Chinese and Taiwanese business leaders from around the world
are expected to exchange views during the four-day brainstorming
sessions on topics such as globalization of business and trade, brand
name development and cross-Taiwan Strait economic and trade
relations, as well as investment niches, officials from the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the structures of the businesses that
overseas Chinese and Taiwanese traders have engaged in have changed
dramatically over the past several years -- from traditional
retailing to manufacturing or international trade or service
businesses.</P>
      <P>Many of these businesspeople have expanded their ventures into
multinational companies and have consequently become prime movers of
local economies in many countries, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The goals of the upcoming convention, to be held at the Taipei
International Convention Center, will be to cement cooperation among
Chinese and Taiwanese businesspeople from different countries, help
bolster their business expansion and economic growth in their
countries of residence, as well as help stimulate Taiwan's economic
growth, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The convention, whose theme will be "creating opportunities
through global networking, " will feature three panel discussions on
successful experiences in brand name development, sharing the
successful experiences of Chinese traders in world and cross-Taiwan
Strait trade relations, and analysis of investment niches.</P>
      <P>The objective of the panel discussions is to unite the younger
generation of overseas Chinese with Taiwan's entrepreneurs and also
to give overseas Chinese and Taiwanese traders a better understanding
of the current state of cross-strait trade relations as well as the
benefits and risks involved in investing in China, according to the
TAITRA officials.</P>
      <P>Three speeches are also scheduled to be presented, by officials
from Taiwan's economic, trade and investment divisions, on "Grasping
Global Business Opportunities and Penetrating Global Markets, "
"Investing in Taiwan, " and "Development of Taiwan's Service
Industry," during the convention, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials, Taiwan trade authorities are also expecting to take the
opportunity of the gathering to encourage overseas Chinese and
Taiwanese businesspeople to relocate parts of their overseas
operations to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One-on-one trade meetings will be arranged during the four-day
convention to draw the participants' attention to investing in
Taiwan, they said.</P>
      <P>At the 23rd World Chinese Traders Convention, also held in
Taiwan, 21 overseas Chinese business leaders engaged in one-on-one

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD WILLING TO TALK WITH PREMIER OVER TAIWAN'S STALEMATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Ma
Ying-jeou urged Premier Su Tseng-chang Sunday to have one-on-one
talks with him to find a solution to Taiwan's political stalemate.</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as Taipei mayor, made the appeal at a time
when prospects for such dialogue have dimmed following criticism
leveled by Su's aides at the KMT for allowing a second motion to
recall scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian to be included in the
Legislative Yuan's agenda.</P>
      <P>Noting that the recall motion will be voted upon Oct. 13, Ma said
there is still enough time for himself and Su to sit down and talk in
an attempt to find a way out of Taiwan's current deadlock, which has
arisen from the president's refusal to accede to an anti-corruption
campaign's demand that he step down to answer for a series of
corruption and embezzlement scandals.</P>
      <P>While the president has made clear that he intends to complete
his second term, which ends in May 2008, leaders of the ongoing
campaign have vowed they will not cease their efforts until he agrees
to step down. The conflict between anti-graft protesters and Chen's
supporters has escalated following a series of street clashes last
month.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that it is too late to stop the recall motion,
introduced by the KMT's ally -- the People First Party (PFP), but
added that before the motion is voted on, there is still enough time
for him and Su to listen to each other and try to find some common
ground.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Ching-lung, a whip of the KMT's legislative
caucus, indicated that as a token of goodwill toward the premier, the
KMT is willing to put its own version of the recall motion on hold.</P>
      <P>Su said a week ago that he was willing to meet with leaders of
opposition parties and the anti-corruption campaign to try to find
ways to restore social harmony. The initial response from the various
parties was generally positive, but differences then emerged over the
topics to be discussed.</P>
      <P>While Ma wanted to talk about the motion in the Legislative Yuan
to recall Chen over corruption allegations, the PFP said Chen's
resignation must be the topic of any cross-party talks.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) insisted that the
talks should not touch on the proposed ouster of Chen and a so-called
exit mechanism for the embattled president.</P>
      <P>DPP leaders have criticized the KMT for "extending one hand for
handshakes while holding a pistol in the other hand."</P>
      <P>The recall motion is the second attempt by the opposition after
its first attempt failed in late June. The "pan-blue alliance" of the
KMT and the PFP controls only a slim majority in the legislature --
less than the two-thirds majority required to pass the motion and
pave the way for a national referendum to determine whether the
president should be ousted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS WON'T ENDORSE KMT'S 2ND RECALL MOTION: WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) will not endorse a second motion launched by
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to recall President Chen
Shui-bian at the Legislative Yuan, DPP legislative caucus whip Chen
Chin-jun said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun said he fully believes that no DPP lawmakers will
"dance to the tune of the KMT" and that the KMT is only trying to
split the DPP by claiming that some DPP lawmakers are likely to
support the KMT's presidential recall motion -- the second of its
kind since late June.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun's remarks came after his KMT counterpart Tsai
Chin-lung said earlier the same day that five or six DPP legislators
may endorse the KMT's second motion to recall Chen -- initiated last
week at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai also said that the various DPP lawmakers are
supportive of the idea of leaving Chen's fate to be decided by the
public in a referendum rather than favoring ousting him.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chin-jun, the KMT does not stand on solid
enough ground to raise a second presidential recall motion since its
first such bid failed to gain the required support of two-thirds of
the lawmakers in the 220-seat Legislative Yuan to have the motion put
to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>"Putting forward a second motion at this time would only add fuel
to the already fierce confrontation between pro-Chen and anti-Chen
forces," Chen Chin-jun argued.</P>
      <P>As an alternative to forcing Chen to step down, the KMT is very
likely to propose a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet led by
Premier Su Tseng-chang, Chen Chin-jun predicted, pointing out that if
it does so, the DPP legislative caucus will then ask Chen to dissolve
the legislature and hold new legislative elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WATER QUALITY AT THREE SWIMMING BEACHES UNSUITABLE FOR BATHING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three of Taiwan's 10 main bathing sites are
currently unsuitable for water sports, the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>An EPA spokesman said that in tests conducted Sept. 24-25, the
water quality at Fulong Beach in Taipei County, Chiting Beach in
Miaoli County, and Taan Beach in Taichung County were rated "below
average" because the water contained high levels of escherichia coli
-- a bacteria that could lead to intestinal diseases -- and
enterococci bacteria.</P>
      <P>He said Hsin Chinshan Beach in Taipei County received an
"excellent" rating, while the water quality was classified as "good"
at the other six swimming beaches: Masago Beach in Tainan County,
Tunghsiao Beach in Miaoli County, Kending Tiaoshih Recreational
Seashore in Pingtung County, Shanyuan Beach in Taitung County, and
two public bathing sites in Kaohsiung City -- Chichin and Hsitzuwan
beaches.</P>
      <P>The EPA has been conducting tests every two weeks during the
swimming season in order to protect bathers from health risks.</P>
      <P>The results of the water quality testing can be viewed online at
http://www.epa.gov.tw/beach.</P>
      <P>As a rule of thumb, the EPA generally advises bathers to avoid
going to a beach within three days of a storm, because rain can wash
pollutants into the sea, rendering the water unsuitable for swimming
and other water sports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS 30 AUTOMOBILES FOR EVERY 100 PEOPLE: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There were roughly three automobiles for
every 10 people in Taiwan as of the end of August, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The number of officially registered automobiles in Taiwan stood
at 6.73 million at the end of August, marking an increase of 2
percent over the year-earlier level, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The figure demonstrates that Taiwan car buyers have not been
daunted by skyrocketing oil prices, they added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to DGBAS tallies, the number of officially
registered motorcycles stood at 13.43 million in Taiwan as of the end
of August, representing a ratio of just over 88 motorcycles for every
100 people in the country. The figure reflects that motorbikes remain
the major mode of transportation for people in Taiwan, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, after compiling statistics from the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the DGBAS discovered that diesel sales have been rising
around Taiwan as gasoline sales have been declining.</P>
      <P>Diesel sales increased 10.5 percent in the first eight months of
the year, while gasoline sales dropped 2.2 percent during the same
period, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the trend to the fact that rising gasoline prices
have led many consumers to opt for diesel-powered vehicles, as well
as the fact that many car dealers have been aggressively promoting
diesel-powered vehicles.</P>

      <P>The International Cooperation and

issue, a spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the ICDF, a foundation financed by
Taiwan's government to carry out international development

magazine a week before the autumn issue's scheduled publishing date
demanding that the ICDF change the word "Taiwan, " mentioned several
times in the ad, as well as the foundation's logo to "Chinese
Taipei."</P>
      <P>"We deplore the World Bank's violation of the spirit of the
business contract simply for political reasons, " the spokesman said,
adding that the World Bank, as the world's largest development aid

      <P>In addition to condemning the World Bank magazine's

    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of an
ongoing anti-graft campaign said Sunday that he will launch a drive
to ask voters to recall those legislators of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who are opposed to having a national
referendum decide whether scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian
should be ousted.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, the former DPP chairman who initiated the "Million
Voices Against Corruption" campaign, made the announcement in
Changhua County while leading some 500 anti-graft protesters on an
tour around Taiwan to recruit more supporters in an attempt to depose
the president.</P>
      <P>Shih acknowledged that without the support of at least some 20
DPP lawmakers, a recall motion to be voted upon Oct. 13 in the
legislature is unlikely to get the needed two-thirds majority to pave
the way for a national referendum on the proposed ouster of the
president.</P>
      <P>He said that by opposing the motion, those DPP legislators would
be depriving the voters of their right to referendum .</P>
      <P>The headquarters of the anti-corruption campaign will monitor the
voting behavior of the DPP legislators, Shih said, adding that he
will launch a drive to recall those who fail to support the motion.</P>
      <P>Shih said that if the president really believes that he has the
support of the Taiwan people, as he has claimed, he should let the 23
million people determine whether he should step down to answer for a
series of corruption and embezzlement scandals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung City government is planning
to transform seven of 10 underground ammunition depots -- remnants of
World War II -- in the Taken scenic area into restaurants, a
municipal spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu got the idea
during a recent tour of Europe, where he saw many old anti-air raid
facilities from the Second World War that have successfully been
refurbished into high-class theme restaurants.</P>
      <P>As three of the 10 underground ammunition depots caved in
following the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake, the Taichung City government
has decided to only make the remaining seven depots into restaurants
through outsourcing, the spokesman said, adding that the restaurants
will add a new attraction to the mountainous Taken area, which is
already a popular spot because of its beautiful natural environment.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense has transferred the management
of the 10 underground ammunition depots to the Taichung City
government, he noted.</P>
      <P>Municipal economic development and transportation authorities

      <P>The number of Chinese tourist arrivals has
increased sharply in the past couple of days as China began a
nine-day holiday from Sept. 30, travel industry sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Early May and Early October have traditionally been China's

      <P>In the past two days, nearly 60 Chinese tour groups have come to
Taiwan for pleasure trips, up from an average of 10 groups on a usual
day.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has not yet formally opened its door to ordinary
Chinese tourists, they are allowed to enter Taiwan via a third place
for sightseeing purpose. Thailand and the Philippines have been
popular transit destinations for ordinary Chinese citizens intending
to visit Taiwan for sightseeing.</P>
      <P>Most Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan in the past two days were
first-time visitors. Many of them said upon arrival that they feel at

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER PROMISES REVIEW OF 'MINI THREE LINKS' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang promised Sunday that
the government will review the existing "mini three links" policy to
see if direct shipping services between two Taiwan-held outlying
islands and China's coastal Fujian Province can be further expanded.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during an inspection tour of the offshore
defense outpost of Kinmen where Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng
suggested that the "mini three links" services between Kinmen/Matsu
and Fujian's Xiamen/Mawei be expanded to help boost economic
development on the two Taiwan-help outlying islands which lie closer
to Fujian than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Lee said as the central government has imposed strict
restrictions on the service targets and scopes of the direct shipping
services between Kinmen/Matsu and Xiamen/Mawei, better known locally
as "mini three links," the policy has had limited effects on Kinmen's
economic development since the inception of the new service in 2001.</P>
      <P>"We hope the central government can expand Kinmen's functions as
a transit hub for cargo and personnel transport across the Taiwan
Strait," Lee said.</P>
      <P>In response, Su said Kinmen has accumulated a lot of experiences
in cross-strait engagements through the "mini three links" services
over the past five years which can serve as reference in adjusting
relevant policies.</P>
      <P>Su said the Executive Yuan is willing to review the policy in a
pragmatic manner under the premise that Taiwan's national security
will not be at stake. </P>
      <P>"Kinmen is crucial to Taiwan's security. It used to be an
anti-communist frontline and is now the frontline for civilian
cross-strait exchanges. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait no longer
open fire against each other and have instead encouraged goodwill
civilian exchanges. It's important for us to adjust our policy
adroitly and flexibly to cope with changing times and demand, " Su
said.</P>
      <P>As China is a big power and has declined to renounce its attempt
to use force against Taiwan, Su said Kinmen should continue serving
as a safety valve while playing the mediator role in cross-strait
engagements.</P>
      <P>"So long as national security will not be affected, the
government will consider expanding Kinmen's transit functions in
cross-strait transport links, " Su said, adding the government will
help improve hardware and software at Kinmen's Shuitou Wharf -- a
major hub for "mini three links" services, and cut red tape to make
cross-strait traffic more convenient and easier.</P>
      <P>During his half-day Kinmen inspection tour, Su also inspected
Kinmen coast guard operations and visited Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Co.
which has been Kinmen's cash cow. Su was accompanied by Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu and Transportation and
Communications Minister Tsai Duei on the Kinmen visit, his first
since assuming the premiership in January this year. He was forced to
cancel his previous two Kinmen travel plans because of inclement
weather.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang hopes that the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) can work to help defuse bitterness
between rivaling groups in order to pave the way for a cross-party
meeting to break the current political stalemate, a senior official
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Minister-without-Portfolio Lin Hsi-yao, he already
conveyed Su's hope to KMT Secretary-General Chan Tsun-po in a
telephone conversation earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is the premier's hope that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
can take concrete steps to foster an atmosphere favorable for
cross-party talks by defusing rivalry stoked by a second
opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian and an
ongoing street movement to force Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks were a response to Ma's call for a one-on-one
meeting between him and Su to thrash out a way to end controversy
over Chen's presidency.</P>
      <P>While an inter-party tete-a-tete is a good thing, Su was quoted
as having said that it would run against public expectation if the
meeting is just for each side to expound on its own stance and fails
to spawn any constructive results.</P>
      <P>Lin said Su doesn't want to have a meeting with Ma just for
"meeting's sake."</P>
      <P>If the Ma-led KMT can work to palliate rivalry between the
president's supporters and opponents, Lin said, it would contribute
to the creation of a favorable ambience for cross-party talks that
may eventually lead to an end to all the recent turmoil.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the KMT's calling up its lawmakers Sept. 29 to vote
for the inclusion of a presidential recall motion initiated by the
KMT's ally -- the People First Party -- into the legislative agenda,
Lin said it seems to him that the KMT "is extending one hand for
handshakes while holding a pistol in the other hand."</P>
      <P>Lin said society is watching whether the Ma-led KMT indeed
intends to help defuse political confrontation and work for domestic
political stability and social harmony.</P>

      <P>Su said the Executive Yuan is willing to review the policy in a
pragmatic manner under the premise that Taiwan's national security
will not be at stake. </P>
      <P>"Kinmen is crucial to Taiwan's security. It used to be an
anti-communist frontline and is now the frontline for civilian
cross-strait exchanges. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait no longer
open fire against each other and have instead encouraged goodwill
civilian exchanges. It's important for us to adjust our policy
adroitly and flexibly to cope with changing times and demand, " Su
said.</P>
      <P>As China is a big power and has declined to renounce its attempt
to use force against Taiwan, Su said Kinmen should continue serving
as a safety valve while playing the mediator role in cross-strait
engagements.</P>
      <P>"So long as national security will not be affected, the
government will consider expanding Kinmen's transit functions in
cross-strait transport links, " Su said, adding the government will
help improve hardware and software at Kinmen's Shuitou Wharf -- a
major hub for "mini three links" services, and cut red tape to make
cross-strait traffic more convenient and easier.</P>
      <P>During his half-day Kinmen inspection tour, Su also inspected
Kinmen coast guard operations and visited Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Co.
which has been Kinmen's cash cow. Su was accompanied by Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu and Transportation and
Communications Minister Tsai Duei on the Kinmen visit, his first
since assuming the premiership in January this year. He was forced to
cancel his previous two Kinmen travel plans because of inclement
weather.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES KMT TO HELP DEFUSE RIVALRY TO PAVE WAY FOR TALKS(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang hopes that the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) can work to help defuse bitterness
between rivaling groups in order to pave the way for a cross-party
meeting to break the current political stalemate, a senior official
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Minister-without-Portfolio Lin Hsi-yao, he already
conveyed Su's hope to KMT Secretary-General Chan Tsun-po in a
telephone conversation earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Lin said it is the premier's hope that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
can take concrete steps to foster an atmosphere favorable for
cross-party talks by defusing rivalry stoked by a second
opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen Shui-bian and an
ongoing street movement to force Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks were a response to Ma's call for a one-on-one
meeting between him and Su to thrash out a way to end controversy
over Chen's presidency.</P>
      <P>While an inter-party tete-a-tete is a good thing, Su was quoted
as having said that it would run against public expectation if the
meeting is just for each side to expound on its own stance and fails
to spawn any constructive results.</P>
      <P>Lin said Su doesn't want to have a meeting with Ma just for
"meeting's sake."</P>
      <P>If the Ma-led KMT can work to palliate rivalry between the
president's supporters and opponents, Lin said, it would contribute
to the creation of a favorable ambience for cross-party talks that
may eventually lead to an end to all the recent turmoil.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the KMT's calling up its lawmakers Sept. 29 to vote
for the inclusion of a presidential recall motion initiated by the
KMT's ally -- the People First Party -- into the legislative agenda,
Lin said it seems to him that the KMT "is extending one hand for
handshakes while holding a pistol in the other hand."</P>
      <P>Lin said society is watching whether the Ma-led KMT indeed
intends to help defuse political confrontation and work for domestic
political stability and social harmony.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STATUS QUO REMAINS PITCH OF DPP CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM INITIATIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Maintaining the status quo and peace across
the Taiwan Strait will remain the sales pitch of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) constitutional reform
initiative, a party official said Monday.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang was responding to
criticism about President Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks that it may
be high time to seriously consider the issue regarding the definition
of the nation's territory enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Critics said Chen's call for addressing the territorial issue
goes against his now famous "four noes" pledge made in his 2000
inaugural speech, in which Chen said if China has no intention of
using force against Taiwan, he will not declare independence, not
change the national title, not include the "two-state theory" into
the Constitution, and not hold an "independence vs. unification"
referendum on Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Tsai said speculation about the DPP's constitutional reform
initiative is not necessary, adding that the DPP will release its
constitutional amendment proposals Wednesday for legislative debate.</P>
      <P>"All of our recommendations are conceived under the pitch of
maintaining the status quo and cross-strait peace," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a senior presidential aide said Chen mentioned the
"territorial issue" at a Sept. 24 DPP-sponsored constitutional
re-engineering seminar only after the head of the DPP's arbitrary
commission said at a Sept. 20 DPP Central Standing Committee that the
party would be too constrained if its constitutional reform
initiative failed to deal with the "territorial issue."</P>
      <P>According to the aide, Chen's "four noes" pledge didn't cover the
issue of "territorial definition."</P>
      <P>The General Provisions of the Republic of China Constitution deal
with issues concerning the country's title, people, national flag and
territory. Among them, the aide said, the "territorial" provision is
the most absurd, far-fetched and surreal.</P>
      <P>Article 4 of the Constitution stipulates that the territory of
the Republic of China according to its existing national boundaries
shall not be altered except by resolution of the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>The definition of "existing national boundaries" is baffling and
outlandish, the aide said, adding that it's absurd that the
boundaries include Outer Mongolia, which is now home to the Republic
of Mongolia, and the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>"All these issues are debatable, and opposition parties and
private groups promoting constitutional reforms have come up with at
least four different versions for revisions to the territorial
provision. As the nation's head of state, Chen is obliged to listen
to different voices and should not ban rational debate on the issue,"
the presidential aide said.</P>
      <P>President Chen has articulated that all his compatriots are
protagonists and real deciders of constitutional re-engineering now
that any amendment proposal must be put to a national referendum.
Given the extremely high threshold for the passage of a
constitutional reform referendum, no change is likely without
majority support.</P>
      <P>In this democratic era, the aide said, all public issues, no
matter how abstruse or contentious, should be open to debate. "If we
leave issues untended simply because a national consensus on them is
hard to come by, this will eventually mar, spoil or suffocate our
democratic vitality," he claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY TO FOCUS ON UPGRADING JOINT OPERATION CAPACITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The building up of Taiwan's weaponry systems
will focus on the upgrading of the overall capacity of the joint
operations of the armed forces, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye
told the Legislative Yuan Monday.</P>
      <P>Depending on the financial situation of the nation, the ministry
will make the development of a missile defense system, joint anti-air
and anti-sea capacity, and information and electronic warfare
capacity top priorities so as to establish a streamlined but
effective modern military force, he added.</P>
      <P>He also reported that defense spending for next year will be
NT$328.4 billion (US$10.01 billion) , or 2.85 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>Assuming that defense spending will be increased to 3 percent of
GDP between 2008-2011, the defense budget will reach NT$1.81 trillion
in five years, he said.</P>
      <P>Of that spending, NT$643.7 billion will focus on upgrading the
overall capacity of the joint operations of the armed forces and its
capacity to counter immediate threat.</P>
      <P>Lee also spoke on the Chinese military buildup and the threat it
poses to Taiwan. He noted that China's defense spending this year
will be US$35 billion, up 14.7 percent from last year. This, coupled
with its covert military spending, will amount to more than US$100
billion, which he said will be more than 10 times that of Taiwan's
defense spending.</P>
      <P>With its military buildup and research and development in
high-tech, active deployment of high-tech weaponry, and strengthening
of joint operation training, China can effectively control sea areas
west of the "first island chain, " referring to the north-south line
running through the Sakhalin Islands, Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the
Philippines, and Indonesia, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also reported that China has deployed more than 800 tactical
missiles along its southeast coast, with the number increasing at
between 75 and 100 annually. China's test-firing of missiles has also
increased to 100 times annually from just over 20 times over the past
three years.</P>
      <P>A new land attack cruise missile (LACM) , called the Dong Hai-10
(DH-10) , a ground-launched second-generation LACM with a range of
1,800 km, has also been deployed, he said.</P>
      <P>The overall combat capacity of China is now on par with that of
the industrialized countries in Europe and that of the United States,
he added.</P>
      <P>He reported that overall, China's tactical missiles, cruise
missiles, bombers and submarines will pose the greatest threat to
Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has never said he
will not disband the Legislative Yuan if a possible no-confidence
vote against the Cabinet is passed, a news release from the
Presidential Office said Monday in an attempt to scotch rumors
triggered by Vice President Annette Lu's remarks a day earlier that
Chen will not dissolve the legislature.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
is to recruit volunteers in Hualien City, Chiayi City and Miaoli
County to participate in a "Taiwan Biobank" plan, a spokesman for the
program said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Shih-chia, the executive director of the Foundation of
Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan who is in charge of the
DOH-commissioned genetic research plan, made the announcement at a
news conference at the Tzu-Chi Buddhist General Hospital in eastern
Hualien City.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the "Taiwan Biobank" plan is to establish a local
biological database to conduct research on the types of illnesses
that prevail among Taiwan people and eventually find cures for them,
taking into consideration the country's unique geographic location,
lifestyles and genetic inheritance, Lin said.</P>
      <P>To achieve the aim, the alliance has invited residents in the
three communities to take part in the biobank plan, Lin said, adding
that efforts in the Hualien area will in particular focus on
improving health for local indigenous tribes.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the ethical, legal and social implications that
might arise from the project, Lin said that public trust must be
first built in this regard and that human rights must be fully
protected in relevant operations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan announced Monday the
establishment of a cross-agency epidemic control unit to prevent the
spread of dengue fever, prompted by a rapid increase in the number of
dengue fever cases in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The unit was set up in line with the epidemic prevention act with
the aim of controlling the number of dengue fever cases below 500
with zero fatalities this year nationwide at a time when the figure
of locally acquired dengue fever cases was expected to hit 300 this
week in southern Taiwan, with a growth rate of 41 new cases per week.</P>
      <P>Since early summer, the number of dengue fever cases has risen to
287 at present, most of them reported in southern Kaohsiung City,
Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County, according to statistics
compiled by the Center for Disease Control under the Department of
Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mao, who serves as the chief of the
cross-agency task force, said that the DOH has since the beginning of

counties in southern regions to prevent and eliminate dengue fever.</P>
      <P>In view of a breakout of dengue fever four years ago in southern
Taiwan that infected 5,336 people and caused 21 deaths, the DOH plans

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN DENIES HE WILL QUIT NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou denied a newspaper claim Monday that he will quit the KMT
chairmanship next year to concentrate on his presidential election
bid in 2008.</P>
      <P>The report by the Chinese-language Liberty Times quoted unnamed
sources within the KMT as saying that Ma will quit the party
chairmanship in March next year to concentrate on his election
campaign and to show that if he is elected president, he will
separate the party from the administration.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, will see his second four-year
mayorship expire at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the report, Ma said that "simply by looking
at which newspaper carried the report, one should be able to see its
intention."</P>
      <P>The pro-independence Liberty Times is considered a mouthpiece of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Huang Yu-chen dismissed the report as "groundless"
and claimed it was evidently intended to alienate the KMT and divert
attention from the long series of corruption scandals embroiling
President Chen Shui-bian and the DPP.</P>
      <P>Huang said the KMT has never discussed the issue of whether Ma
should resign as KMT chairman in order to run for president.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the KMT has its own nomination mechanism and
that there is precedent for the incumbent party chairman being
nominated to run for president, such as the two former KMT chairmen
-- Lee Teng-hui and Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Huang also disputed another Liberty Times claim that Ma's
approval rating has plummeted after the KMT and its ally -- the
People First Party -- introduced a second motion in the legislature
to recall the president.</P>
      <P>The KMT spokesman pointed out that the only polls showing that
Ma's approval ratings have dropped were carried out by the DPP, while
other surveys done by TVBS, the China Times and the United Daily News
all show otherwise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S PLAN TO BUY F16C/D SUSPENDED BY U.S. PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Sept. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's plan to buy 66 F16C/D jet fighters
from the United States has been suspended by President George W.
Bush, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a report to the Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee,
Lee said the U.S. stance is that until a long-stalled arms purchase
package clears the legislature, it does not see Taiwan as having a
consistent military procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Lee was referring to a package of six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile
batteries, a squadron of 12 anti-submarine P-3C aircraft and eight
diesel-electric submarines, which has been blocked by the
opposition-dominated legislature for more than two years.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that U.S. officials in charge of military purchase had
promised to sell the F16C/D aircraft.</P>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan, the quasi-official organization
authorized by the U.S. to handle ties with Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic ties, had also agreed to offer quoting price to various
allies to the island for reference. However, Taiwan has received no
response since late August.</P>
      <P>But Lee said he believes that if the three-item arms procurement
project clears the legislature, the F16 fighter procurement will also
be revived.</P>
      <P>The ministry is hoping to buy the F16C/Ds to replace the Air
Force's F5E and F5F aircraft, which are being phased out over the
next few years.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, even if Taiwan is permitted to buy
the F16C/Ds, they will not be delivered until 2011. By that time,
Taiwan's self-developed IDFs will have been in service for nearly 20
years and the F16A/Bs purchased from the U.S. will have been in
service for more than 15 years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry's plan to buy eight to 12 seal delivery
vehicles (SDVs) from the United Arab Emirates has been aborted, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the purchase of the SDVs -- a type of mini
submarine -- was suspended after news of the intended purchase was
leaked.</P>
      <P>Lee denied reports that the military has asked some government
agencies to pay a deposit of between US$4 million and US$5 million
for the mini subs, claiming that "we haven't paid anything, not even
one cent."</P>
      <P>A SDV is a safer version of the special suicide mini-sub the
Japanese Imperial Navy used in a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on
Dec. 8, 1941.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung
claimed Monday that public support for a strike proposed by
organizers of a campaign to pressure President Chen Shui-bian to step
down is "very low."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan's Economics and
Energy Committee, in his first report since assuming the post more
than one month ago.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chia-chin urged Chen to pay a visit to Shih
Ming-teh, leader of the ongoing "Million Voices Against Corruption"
campaign to attempt to dissuade him of the idea. Shih's campaign has
threatened what it calls a "soft strike" to step up pressure on the
embattled president to step down over his alleged parts in a spate of
corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>According to Chen "politics should not interfere in the economy"
and Taiwan cannot afford a strike. He also said all six major
industrial and business groups, as well as the majority of labor and
management groups, are vehemently opposed to Shih's scheme to stage a
strike.</P>
      <P>A strike would not only seriously disrupt production but would
also be a serious blow to the faith of both local and foreign
manufacturers, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the campaign organizers, the activity will take the
form of a 15-minute "flash mob, " with workers asked to take the day
off and students to take 30 minutes off to gather at designated sites
around the country at 11: 45 a.m. to chant "down with corruption to
save Taiwan. Chen Shui-bian, step down."</P>
      <P>The organizers said that the "soft strike" is not a labor strike
but a demonstration against "a corrupt regime, " claiming that "one
day of inconvenience will bring changes to Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Also cleared is Chen Che-nan, former deputy secretary-general of

      <P>The report said Lee Heng-lung, the former chairman of Pacific

taken NT$14 million worth of the store's gift vouchers between April
2002 and January 2004 as part of a "public relations fund." Of that
sum, NT$277,000 worth of vouchers indirectly wound up in the first

      <P>A biennial convention for global Chinese
traders is being held in Taipei to boost domestic investment
and encourage international business opportunities among ethnic
Chinese.</P>
      <P>The 25th World Chinese Traders Convention, with the theme of
"Creating Opportunities through Global Networking," is being held
from Oct. 2-5 at the Taipei International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>About 600 participants, including more than 300 local traders and
over 250 traders representing 28 countries, will take part in the
four-day event.</P>
      <P>"With this convention, we are trying to create a 'triple-win'
situation in which Taiwan, traders and the country of the [traders']

Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC).</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that traditionally Chinese traders have
excelled in the manufacturing industry but have gradually made their
mark in other sectors as well. By increasing peer cooperation and
investment in Taiwan among Chinese traders worldwide, everyone will
benefit, he said.</P>
      <P>The event seeks to play the role of "matchmaker" in business
opportunities, said Hsu Chun-fang, deputy director-general of the

      <P>The convention began in 1963 in Tokyo as the Asian Chinese

Roberts Court May Be Defined in Second Term
During the first term under the leadership
of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the
justices were able to find common ground with
some regularity by agreeing not to decide much.
By the time the term ended in late June, the
extent to which the members of the newly
configured court were prepared to confront
either precedent or one another remained unclear.
Chances are high that the new term, which
begins on Monday, will be different. The cases
that the court has agreed to decide -- 38 so far
-- offer few off-ramps, requiring instead that
the justices proceed to rulings that will define
the new court in both substance and style.

Wall Street Journal:In Northern Iraq,
A Rebel Sanctuary Bedevils the U.S.
Kurdish guerrillas have used the remote
mountains of northern Iraq as a base to attack
Turkey for years. Now their presence has become
a thorny problem for Washington.
Thousands of Kurdish fighters move openly in
dozens of camps spread throughout Qandil's
scrubby mountainsides and tree-covered ravines.
A day's hike to the north lies Turkey, where
most of these militants were born and where
they face terrorism charges for fighting for
Kurdish autonomy. Here in northern Iraq, with
grenades clipped to the belts of their matching
olive-green outfits, the guerrillas conduct
combat drills, restock arms or watch satellite
television. A few months ago they honored their
leader by painting his image on a giant concrete
slab they poured onto a hillside. It is visible

committee members decided to go ahead with all National Day
preparations now that information provided by intelligence
authorities suggests no security risks, Lin said.</P>
      <P>She added the preparatory committee will respond quickly to
any change in the situation or incidents that might interrupt or
threaten National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an anti-graft convoy composed of 20 buses carrying
about 500 supporters led by former Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Shih Ming-teh arrived the same day in southern Chiayi County
from neighboring Yulin County.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption convoy is on an islandwide tour to demand
that President Chen Shui-bian step down over a spate of corruption
allegations implicating himself, family members and associates, and
to gain steam for their plan to "besiege" the Presidential Office on
Oct. 10 -- National Day.</P>
      <P>The anti-graft campaign headquarters is calling on the public
across Taiwan to join forces in the siege plan in an attempt to
humiliate Chen, who has denied any wrongdoing and rejected calls for
his resignation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) will cooperate with city and county
governments to organize a series of conferences over the next year to
help the service industry overcome current investment impediments, a
CEPD spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD recently invited representatives from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, the Council of Agriculture, the Tourism Bureau and
local governments for a meeting, in which they decided to jointly
organize conferences focusing on the service industry's development
and to coordinate the cooperating mechanism between the central and
local governments, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>In Executive Yuan's campaign to upgrade the service industry,
which started in November 2004 with the vision of creating Taiwan's
second economic miracle, the two main objectives are to increase the
production value and to create job opportunities, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The CPED also has eight strategies to upgrade the service
industry, such as personnel training, regulation relaxation, the
establishment of a mechanism favorable for development,
inter-departmental coordination, investment encouragement,
globalization, and developing the service industry with local
characteristics.</P>
      <P>The CEPD will bridge gaps between central and local governments,
the spokesman said, noting the conference's first round will be held
in 10 counties and cities around Taiwan between Oct. 20 and Dec. 10,
while the second will be held next year in at least 7 counties and
cities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN'S INT'L EXPOSITION EXPERIENCE SERVES AS MODEL FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's rich and successful experience in
organizing expositions will serve as an excellent model for Taiwan,
which is also seeking to hold an international exposition in
the future, organizers of a show on Japanese expos said Monday.</P>
      <P>The special exhibition, titled "An Exposition for Taiwan: Through the
Japanese Experience," is being jointly sponsored by Uniplan Taiwan
Group, Yoshida Hideo Memorial Foundation, Marketing Communications
Executives International and the Taipei Fine Arts Museum (TFAM) from
Oct. 3 to Nov. 12 at TFAM.</P>
      <P>Most of the exhibits come from the collection of the Advertising
Museum in Tokyo, and include woodblock prints, posters, print
advertisements and memorabilia from Japanese expos over the course of
the last century.</P>
      <P>"Between 1970-2005, Japan hosted five of the 14 World Expos
accredited by BIE (International Exhibitions Bureau), making it one
of the most 'expo-crazy' countries, " TFAM director Huang Tsai-lang
said.</P>
      <P>"Japan was able to promote its wealth and power, build public
confidence, invigorate industry and develop tourism by organizing
such events and finally walked out of the post-war shadow of World
War II," he added.</P>
      <P>Specialists who played major roles in Japan's organization of the
World Expos -- including 2005 Aichi Expo director Shinya Izumi, Fukui
Shouhei, Shinji Fukukawa and Akira Fujitani -- were invited to
deliver speeches and share their expertise with local officials and
curators on Tuesday and Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Part of the exhibit focuses on a 1935 Expo in Taiwan when
Taiwan was a Japanese colony, and is expected to attract the most
attention during the exhibition, said Huang. Historical records
show that one-third of Taiwan's population at the time -- 6 million
-- visited the landmark event.</P>
      <P>The event will help Taiwan make strides in creating the
environment it needs to host expos in future, Huang said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(BY T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A hotline was opened to offer better, more
comprehensive assistance to Chinese spouses in Taiwan, officials from
the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) announced
Monday.</P>
      <P>At the inauguration ceremony, SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General 
You Ying-lung encouraged Chinese spouses to call (02) 2718-9995 
when having difficulty solving problems in the country.</P>
      <P>You said depending on the nature of the case, the foundation
would transfer telephone requests to relevant government bodies or
private organizations to find the best solution.</P>
      <P>When major issues arise, the foundation will hold a special 
meeting with officials from the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to work out problems, You stressed.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang, who also attended the ceremony, said he
hoped the government would now provide better services and help
more Chinese spouses by collaborating with the private sector.</P>
      <P>Also present at the ceremony were Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang
and MAC Chairman Joseph Wu. </P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chang Chun-hsiung noted that despite a lack of
official ties, cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges in private sectors have
been booming in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the foundation has received a steadily
increased number of requests for help; last year there were
300,000.</P>
      <P>As of August this year, a total of 260,000 Chinese who married
Taiwanese citizens applied to come to the island, Chang added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang explained that when Chinese spouses first come
to Taiwan, they often have trouble integrating into society owing to
differing values and lifestyles between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that Taiwan's government has already
launched many measures to help Chinese spouses. However, the
government wishes to extend its assistance by working with
non-governmental organizations, the chairman noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday that all
he can do now is concentrate on his work as premier, and that he
tries to remain unaffected by reports suggesting President Chen
Shui-bian may have to replace Su or disband the legislature, as a
proposed no-confidence vote against the Cabinet is "on the bowstring
like an arrow."</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" has collected enough
endorsement signatures for the proposal to be reviewed by the
Legislative Yuan at any time should the opposition's second
legislative motion to recall embattled Chen over alleged corruption
scandals fail to muster enough support again.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that the opposition has a good chance of
seeing the no-confidence vote pass. Should this occur, the president
has only two alternatives -- either replace the premier or disband
the Legistive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, Vice President Annette Lu was quoted
as having claimed that President Chen will not consider disbanding
the legislature if forced to make that choice, implying Su may be
replaced in Chen's efforts to settle political turmoil.</P>
      <P>However, the Presidential Office denied Monday that Lu's remarks

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided

      <P>Earlier in the day, the premier criticized Ma for agreeing to

    <HEADLINE>SNAP LEGISLATIVE ELECTION COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED: CEC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Snap legislative elections could be held
even if corresponding electoral regulations have not yet been fully
in place following last year's constitutional amendments that
downsize the legislature and introduce a new electoral system, the
head of the Central Election Commission (CEC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a legislative interpellation session, CEC
Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung said snap elections can be accomplished
within 60 days as stipulated by the Constitution if the current
legislature is dissolved as a result of a no-confidence vote against
the current Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in response to questions by opposition
Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-hua who asked how to proceed with a
legislative election if President Chen Shui-bian chooses to dissolve
the legislature should a proposed no-confidence vote against the
Cabinet pass.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the no-confidence proposal has obtained enough
endorsement signatures from lawmakers and will "definitely" be
carried out should a second motion to recall Chen, who is embroiled
in a series of alleged corruption scandals, fail again at the
legislature Oct. 13. Lee expressed doubt that it would be possible
to hold a legislative election in the next few months, since no
required amendments to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law
have been made, nor have the constituencies been redrawn to reflect
the smaller number of seats.</P>
      <P>In reply, Chang said even if the complementary law revisions
regarding legislative elections aren't quite complete, following last
year's constitutional amendments which cut the number of legislative
seats to 113 and adopted a "single-member constituency, two vote"
system.</P>
      <P>If the redistricting process cannot be concluded in time, Chang
said, the issue may be settled through consultations between the
legislative speaker and premier in accordance with Article 42 of the
Public Officials Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>In order to meet constitutional requirements, Chang said, the
government can also issue administrative orders making up for some
legal deficiencies so that snap legislative elections could be held
within 60 days of dissolving the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, in the event the current legislature is
dissolved as a result of a no-confidence vote, the next (seventh)
legislature will be elected under the "single-member constituency,
two vote" system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Yeh Yi-chin, a whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) legislative caucus, said the
caucus will suggest that President Chen dissolve the legislature if
the no-confidence vote against the Cabinet is passed, in an attempt
to stop the ongoing rivalry between pro-Chen and anti-Chen camps.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-Jen was not indicted in
the Pacific Sogo Department Store case because she had not intervened
in the corporation's ownership fight, the Taipei Public Prosecutors'
Office indicated Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecution's report, although the first lady,
her daughter and son had spent NT$277,000 worth of gift vouchers
they had obtained from Lee Heng-lung, former chairman of Pacific
Distribution Investment Co. which formerly owned the department
store, there was insufficient evidence to prove the first family had
played any role in Sogo's ownership transfer.</P>
      <P>The first lady is not a public servant, and all those accused of
involvement in the ownership battle have acknowledged they were not
acquainted with her, the report said.</P>
      <P>The NT$277,000 in gift vouchers constituted only a small amount
of the NT$14 million worth of vouchers Lee gave away to promote
public relations. Furthermore, the first lady and her two
children used the vouchers between Oct. 25, 2002 and Aug. 11, 2004,
when the dust had already settled over the issue of Pacific Sogo's
ownership, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Also cleared of wrongdoing in the case are Chen Che-nan, former
deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office; Chang Ching-sen,
vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development;
and Huang Fang-yen, a doctor and the first family's close friend.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Monday prosecutors indicted six other suspects on
charges of breach of trust and forgery, seeking terms of three
years and six months for Walter Lin, former chief of Waterland
Financial Holding Co.; a sentence of two years and six months for
Douglas Hsu, chairman of Far Eastern Group, which purchased Sogo;
and a two-year sentence each for lawyer Huang Mao-teh and financial
consultant Champion Lee.</P>
      <P>As for Lee Heng-lung and former Pacific Sogo Chairman Lai
Yung-chi, the facts about offenses they have committed will be
combined into another court case pending over who should own Pacific
Sogo, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTION: FIRST LADY NOT INVOLVED IN SOGO OWNERSHIP FIGHT(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-Jen was not indicted in
the Pacific Sogo Department Store case because she had not intervened
in the corporation's ownership fight, the Taipei Public Prosecutors'
Office indicated Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the prosecution's report, although the first lady,
her daughter and son had spent NT$277,000 worth of gift vouchers
they had obtained from Lee Heng-lung, former chairman of Pacific
Distribution Investment Co. which formerly owned the department
store, there was insufficient evidence to prove the first family had
played any role in Sogo's ownership transfer.</P>
      <P>The first lady is not a public servant, and all those accused of
involvement in the ownership battle have acknowledged they were not
acquainted with her, the report said.</P>
      <P>The NT$277,000 in gift vouchers constituted only a small amount
of the NT$14 million worth of vouchers Lee gave away to promote
public relations. Furthermore, the first lady and her two
children used the vouchers between Oct. 25, 2002 and Aug. 11, 2004,
when the dust had already settled over the issue of Pacific Sogo's
ownership, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Also cleared of wrongdoing in the case are Chen Che-nan, former
deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office; Chang Ching-sen,
vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development;
and Huang Fang-yen, a doctor and the first family's close friend.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Monday prosecutors indicted six other suspects on
charges of breach of trust and forgery, seeking terms of three
years and six months for Walter Lin, former chief of Waterland
Financial Holding Co.; a sentence of two years and six months for
Douglas Hsu, chairman of Far Eastern Group, which purchased Sogo;
and a two-year sentence each for lawyer Huang Mao-teh and financial
consultant Champion Lee.</P>
      <P>As for Lee Heng-lung and former Pacific Sogo Chairman Lai
Yung-chi, the facts about offenses they have committed will be
combined into another court case pending over who should own Pacific
Sogo, the report said.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said
Tuesday that it has notified its counterpart in China that it will
provide all necessary assistance to the family members of Chinese
tourists who died or were injured in a bus crash in Nantou County
Monday.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General You Ying-lung noted that the SEF
immediately informed the Association for Relation Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) about the tragedy, which left five dead and 15
injured. A Taiwan tourist guide also died.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official bodies set up by Taipei and
Beijing respectively to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence
of official ties. </P>
      <P>The bodies of the dead have been placed in a Nantou morgue to
await identification by family members.</P>
      <P>All 15 injured are at a hospital in Nantou's Chushan township for
treatment of fractures and bruises.</P>
      <P>The SEF visited the injured at the hospital Monday night and
presented them with red envelopes containing money, You said.</P>
      <P>Li Zhihung, a female Chinese tourist, will undergo surgery in the
afternoon, You said. All the other tourists who sustained mild
injuries will be able to return to China in three days at the
earliest, he added.</P>
      <P>Two buses carrying 37 Chinese tourists from Liaoning province were
returning from scenic Mount Ali, better known locally as Alishan, in
southern Chiayi County when the accident occurred at around 7: 50
p.m.</P>
      <P>One of the buses skidded off Highway No. 21, also known as the
Taiwan Cross-Island Highway, and plunged into a ravine while en route
to Shuili from Tungpu. Police suspect the accident was caused by
brake failure. They are still investigating the cause.</P>
      <P>The five Chinese tourists who died included two men -- Zhao
Shifeng and Wang Lixian-- and three women -- Wang Shaofei, Li Huimei
and Liu Hung, a spokesman for the ROC Travel Agent Association (TAA)
said. Also killed was Chen Yun-hsuan, a female Taiwanese tour guide.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Tuesday that it has prepared contingency plans to be used in the
event that foreign dignitaries attending the Oct. 10 National Day
banquet are disturbed by anti-graft protesters.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks amid plans by leaders
of an ongoing anti-corruption campaign to besiege the Presidential
Office Oct. 10 as a way to step up pressure on President Chen
Shui-bian to resign over a spate of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the anti-graft campaign are trying to recruit 5,000
"nonviolent activists" -- mostly women -- to block the front and rear
entrances of the Presidential Office Oct. 10, an action they claim
will prevent President Chen from entering or leaving his office. The
activists will be at the forefront of tens of thousands of other
protesters.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that preparations for the Oct. 10 National Day banquet
have been going smoothly and that they will not be affected by the
ongoing campaign.</P>
      <P>He said that the National Day banquet will be held at the Taipei
Guest House, near the Presidential Office, as in past years. "The
ministry has prepared contingency plans to deal with the possibility
of foreign dignitaries facing difficulties in entering or leaving the
National Day banquet," he added.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that dignitaries from diplomatic allies of
Taiwan in Central and South America who will attend the Double Ten
celebrations may include the Belizean governor general, Nicaraguan
vice president and Honduran president.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Stephen Young, director of the Taipei Office of the
American Institute in Taiwan, who is currently in the United States
for consultations, will return to Taiwan for the National Day
banquet, Lu said that he is not sure whether he will attend or send
a representative to the banquet.</P>

      <P>Construction of the Taipei Dome, a
multi-purpose indoor stadium, will start next year, and its
completion is expected in 2010, a contract builder for the
long-awaited project said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Far Glory Group Chairman Chao Teng-hsiung made the remarks after
he signed a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract with Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Saying that he is confident about building "the best dome in the
world, " Chao said that he will invest NT$23 billion (US$701.22
million) for the project, which he said will create between 7,000 and
8,000 job opportunities for Taipei City.</P>
      <P>During the company's 50 years of operation of the dome, the
project will also pump in between NT$200 billion and NT$300 billion
in tax revenues into the government's coffers.</P>
      <P>Ma said after the signing ceremony that it was a significant day
for Taipei City, noting that Taipei first spent NT$20 billion to buy
the land lot, the old site of Sungshan Tobacco Factory in downtown
Taipei, and then spent nearly seven years planning the dome.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the Far Glory Group will make good use
of its creativity to build a stadium with Taipei features.</P>
      <P>He also said that with the recent outstanding performance of
Chien-ming Wang, a Taiwan-born ace pitcher for the New York Yankees,
the time for building a large dome has arrived. Last Wednesday, Wang
set the record for most Major League wins in a single month by an
Asian born pitcher.</P>
      <P>Ma added that for a city of a population of 2.6 million, the
40,000 seat stadium will not only serve as an indoor stadium for
baseball, it will also serve as a good venue for concerts,

    <TEXT>
      <P>One in every four undergraduates in Taiwan
experiences serious depression and tends to spend more time on the
Internet, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the John Tung Foundation in April and
May on 6,543 students from 58 colleges and universities around the
country.</P>
      <P>The survey found 20 percent of undergraduates spend more than
five hours daily on the Internet, with 90 percent spending two to
three hours a day and 27 percent spending more than 29 hours per week
online.</P>
      <P>The most frequent reasons they cited for using the Internet
include communicating with friends, entertainment purposes and
killing time.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ya-hsin, director of the foundation's mental health section,
said the survey indicates undergraduates who spend a longer time
using the Internet display more of a tendency to feel depressed and
skip classes.</P>
      <P>The depression is most acute among those spending more than 29
hours per week or five hours a day using the Internet, and their
condition may be serious enough to require professional psychological
counseling, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>However, undergraduates who go online to communicate with friends
have the least tendency to feel depressed, she said.</P>
      <P>With the Internet becoming an inevitable part of college life,
Yeh urged students, parents and teachers to pay closer attention to
how students' schoolwork and inter-personal relationships can be
affected if they overindulge themselves in a cyberworld and isolate
themselves from reality.</P>

      <P>Law enforcement cannot afford to continue
mobilizing more police forces to maintain law and order amid an
ongoing nationwide anti-corruption campaign against President Chen
Shui-bian, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Since a sit-in protest aimed at deposing Chen was launched Sept.
9, 190,000 police officers have been deployed to deal with
contingencies in the streets, Su told a legislative committee while
fielding lawmakers' questions.</P>
      <P>Su also told the committee that law enforcement cannot afford to
dispatch more personnel to serve that purpose now because the primary
responsibility of the police is to maintain social order and direct
traffic.</P>
      <P>Su's remarks came after a police officer in Yulin County died of
a stroke Sunday evening while on duty during an anti-Chen
demonstration in Touliu, Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>That day, a convoy of anti-Chen protesters from Taipei led by
former Democratic Progressive Party Shih Ming-teh staged a
demonstration in Touliu calling for Chen's resignation, while their
chants were often matched by those of infuriated pro-Chen supporters.</P>
      <P>Although the government should protect people's right to take to
the streets, Su said that local governments are also entitled not to
approve applications for street protests, taking into account the law
and the specifics of each case.</P>
      <P>The premier was referring to Shih's sit-in protests aimed at
ousting Chen over a series of corruption allegations embroiling
himself, members of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>Shih is currently leading a 20-coach convoy on an eight-day tour

      <P>A dengue fever outbreak in southern Taiwan
could have been triggered by dengue virus transmitted from Vietnam, a
Center for Disease Control (CDC) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CDC tallies show that from the start of summer until Oct. 3, the
number of indigenous dengue fever cases has totaled 291 in the
country, with 175 reported in Kaohsiung City, 110 in Kaohsiung
County, four in Pingtung County and one in Tainan City, all in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao, people
over the age of 65 are the main age group affected by the disease
this year, and the dengue virus type 3 strain has been found in most
of the patients.</P>
      <P>An RNA comparison indicates that the virus strain discovered in
the Taiwan patients is 99.4 percent similar to the strain prevalent
in Vietnam, which shows that Vietnam could be the source of the
outbreak, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He reasoned that some travelers to Vietnam could have been
carrying the disease when entering the country but were not detected
by quarantine authorities at the airport because they were not
displaying any obvious symptoms.</P>
      <P>He noted that almost all indigenous dengue fever outbreaks
occurring each year in Taiwan have been traced to imported cases and
that the Philippines has been identified as the source of the

      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.

Intermediate (WTI) crude price.</P>
      <P>The CPC reached the decision after making the first weekly review

      <P>On the other hand, the service sector, which accounted for 73
percent of Taiwan's national gross domestic product (GDP) , ranked

preferential measures with regard to land acquisition, labor and
financing to attract Taiwanese and Chinese expatriates as part of
efforts to revamp private-sector investment, Minister of Economic
Affairs Chen Ruey-long said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during the 25th World Chinese Traders
Convention held in Taipei, noting that foreign investment in Taiwan
amounted to US$8.8 billion from January to August 2006, double that
of the same period last year and hitting a record high.</P>
      <P>Chen said many multinational corporations have decided to set up
shop in Taiwan, including a Japanese semiconductor manufacturer that
is collaborating with Taiwan to build a 12-inch wafer fab.</P>
      <P>In the next two to three years, the number of 12-inch wafer
fabrication plants in Taiwan is expected to surpass 18, making it the
country with the highest density of them, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Other investors who have decided to invest in Taiwan include a
European vaccine producer, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, many enterprises are facing a situation where
they need to adjust their global investment strategies since China's
preferential measures have begun to expire, so the government should
seize this opportunity to attract an influx of investment.</P>

      <P>"The barbed wire is to protect the legitimate protesters from
illegal actions, " she said, noting that people have the right to

conflict. There has been conflict at some of the rallies between
anti-corruption and pro-Chen supporters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT INVITES ASIAN BANKERS TO INVEST IN TAIWAN'S FINANCE SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian invited banking and
financial businesses in the Asian region to join exchanges of
technology development concerning a new package of eight major plans
aimed at boosting Taiwan's financial market.</P>
      <P>Chen issued the invitation at a ceremony held Tuesday in Taipei
to mark the 25th founding anniversary of the Asian Banker's
Association (ABA).</P>
      <P>In his address, Chen introduced the package formed in the two-day
National Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic Development July
27-28 and approved by the Executive Yuan earlier this week to begin
work to reinforce the competition mechanism of the financial sector,
build a diversified, globalized, stable and reliable financial market
and strengthen Taiwan's services in the sector.</P>
      <P>The package is comprised of eight master projects, which include
reconstructing the banking market structure, developing the fixed
income market, promoting protection-oriented insurance and pension
insurance products, developing the international bond market,
speeding up the internationalization of the financial sector, raising
the investment ratio of institutional investors in the stock market,
encouraging more companies to list their shares, and establishing a
competitive taxation environment for the financial sector.</P>
      <P>Chen said Asian banking business operators are welcome to join in
Taiwan's efforts to carry out the plans through technology exchanges,
since such efforts are believed to be able to help upgrade regional
competitiveness in the international financial market.</P>
      <P>Speaking to more than 200 banking representatives of 17 ABA
member-states, Chen also lauded the celebration as "significant"
because the regional organization was born in Taipei a quarter of a
century ago.</P>
      <P>Coinciding with the celebration of its founding anniversary, the
ABA also opened its 23rd annual meeting, which will include four
seminars on topics including general economic challenges, trading
chances facing merging Asian markets, financial reforms and regional
financial integration.</P>
      <P>ABA members are made of around 100 banks from 23 economies in the
Asia-Pacific region. Twenty-six of the member banks are from Taiwan.</P>

unseating President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>According to police, the anti-Chen motorcade was allegedly

    <HEADLINE>SERIAL RAPIST'S PAROLE APPLICATION TO BE DECIDED SOON: MOJ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will make a
final decision this week on whether to grant parole for a notorious
serial rapist, a ministry official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The applicant, known locally as the "Huakang Wolf" because most
of the crimes he committed in the mid-1990s took place at Huakang,
which is the Chinese Culture University's campus in suburban Taipei,
filed his seventh parole application in August, but the ministry has
so far yet to make a response.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Lee Chin-yung said the Taipei Prison has
tentatively approved the application and referred the case to the MOJ
in August for endorsement.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, Lee said, the MOJ has convened meetings
of criminologists and other relevant professionals to conduct an
overall review of the case.</P>
      <P>"The case has been screened with great prudence based on the
results of the inmate's correctional education and the chances of his
repeating the crime, " Lee said, adding that although he didn't know
what the result will be, a decision will definitely be announced this
week.</P>
      <P>The inmate, identified only by his family name of Yang, was
sentenced on more than 30 counts of sexual assault and robbery. He
has served more than half of his 16-year prison term and qualifies
for parole application.</P>
      <P>Yang, now in his 30s, made headlines five years ago when he
passed exams to enter prestigious National Taiwan University, but was
later denied admission because the MOJ turned down his parole
application amid social misgivings about the chances of recidivism.
His subsequent five applications were all rejected, too.</P>
      <P>In his latest application, Yang said he is willing to wear an
electronic tag and hopes to enter a theological college if he is
granted parole.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MOJ has been developing an electronic surveillance
system that will require some paroled criminals to wear an electronic
tag to facilitate tracking and make sure that they will not repeat
their offenses.</P>

association executives, is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan at 10 p.m.
Wednesday to assist in handling the aftermath.</P>
      <P>Two buses carrying 39 Chinese tourists from Liaoning Province
were en route to Shuili from Tungpu in central Nantou County when one
of the buses skidded off Highway No. 21, also known as the Central
Taiwan Cross-Island Highway, and plunged into a ravine. Police
suspect the accident was caused by brake failure. They are still
investigating the cause.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the dead have been placed in a Nantou morgue to
await identification by family members.</P>
      <P>All the 15 injured are at a hospital in Nantou's Chushan township
for treatment of fractures and bruises.</P>
      <P>The five Chinese tourists who died included two men -- Zhao
Shifeng and Wang Lixian-- and three women -- Wang Shaofei, Li Huimei
and Liu Hung, a spokesman for the ROC Travel Agent Association (TAA)
said. Also killed was Chen Yun-hsuan, a female Taiwanese tour guide.</P>
      <P>The Chinese tourists were on a six-day visit to Taiwan and
originally planned to return to China Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 21 tourists aboard the unaffected tour bus will depart for
home this afternoon.</P>
      <P>A tourism official said only two injured tourists are listed in

    <HEADLINE>DPP FORMS RESPONSE PANEL TO DEAL WITH 'RECALL MOTION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has formed a special response panel to deal with an impending
legislative vote on a motion to recall embattled President Chen
Shui-bian over alleged corruption scandals, a party whip said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, convener of the DPP legislative caucus, said DPP
Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung has organized a response panel to
weigh developments in the opposition-initiated recall motion which
will be put to a vote in the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
Oct. 13.</P>
      <P>According to Ker, the DPP legislative caucus will meet Oct. 11 or
Oct. 12 to discuss some technical problems with regard to the recall
vote -- the second of its kind since June -- and will definitely
"stage a tableau of unity" on the voting day.</P>
      <P>Ker said his colleagues have decided to adopt a "three noes"
policy toward the upcoming recall vote, namely, "no written rebuttal
from President Chen against the recall motion, " "no participation by
DPP lawmakers in the Committee of the Whole's screening of the
motion," and "no attendance by DPP lawmakers on voting day."</P>
      <P>The "three noes" policy was applied in the first recall vote on
June 27, which led to the defeat of the first-ever presidential
recall motion in the country's history.</P>
      <P>According to existing constitutional provisions, a recall motion
requires the support of two-thirds of lawmakers to pass the
legislature and be put to a national referendum to decide whether the
sitting president should step down before the end of his official
tenure.</P>
      <P>Claiming that no country in the world has ever initiated two
recall motions against its head of state within three months, Ker
said the opposition-initiated recall motion is "nothing but a
political dogfight."</P>
      <P>Ker said he deplores the absurdity of the country's
constitutional provisions with regard to the recall of a sitting head
of state.</P>
      <P>"In our country, it seems to me that removing a president is
easier than unseating a borough chief. Under our local government
system, a second recall motion against a borough chief cannot be
launched within a year of the failure of the first attempt, "Ker
said, adding that the opposition campaign against Chen will only
aggravate the rivalry between the country's two major political
camps.</P>
      <P>By a vote of 106 to 82, the legislature agreed last Friday to
debate another opposition-backed motion to recall Chen. The main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has appealed to DPP lawmakers to back the
motion in order to give people a chance to be heard through the
ballot box. The KMT claimed that a national referendum would be the
most effective way to end three weeks of street demonstrations
calling for Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>As the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally -- the People First Party --
control only a slim majority in the 220-seat legislature, the second
recall motion, like the first attempt in June, will most likely fail
now that DPP lawmakers have resolved not to support such a drastic
move.</P>
      <P>Were the legislature to pass the recall motion, a majority vote
of at least 50 percent of the electorate would be necessary to oust
Chen. The embattled president has consistently denied any wrongdoing
and insists that he will stay on until his term ends in May 2008.</P>
      <P>On Monday, prosecutors cleared Chen's wife, Wu Shu-jen, of
involvement in a scandal surrounding the takeover of an upscale
department store.</P>
      <P>The opposition has accused the first lady of accepting free
vouchers from the management of Sogo Department Store in return for
her using her influence in a takeover bid for the store.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Lin Ching-chun said that Wu received NT$277,000
(US$8,393) worth of free Sogo vouchers but that there is no evidence
that she tried to use her influence in a takeover bid for the store.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States hopes Taiwan's ongoing
constitutional reform will comply with President Chen Shui-bian's
commitments with regard to maintaining the cross-Taiwan Strait status
quo, a U.S. official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We are looking to see that when that reform package is presented
and what changes are eventually made, that they do comply with the
promises that President Chen made not only to us but to the rest of
the world," U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesman Tom Casey said.</P>
      <P>Casey reiterated that the United States does not wish to see
tensions increase across the strait or see anything occur that would
change the status quo.</P>
      <P>"He (Chen) has made a number of public commitments, including
those commitments he made in his inaugural address. And we very much
look to him and look to his leadership to carry out those
commitments," Casey said.</P>
      <P>Casey made the remarks when asked to comment on a statement by
Liu Shih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
that President Chen will fulfill his "four noes" commitments and will
seek to negotiate with his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to
ensure that the constitutional reform package to be proposed by the
party does not violate the "four noes."</P>
      <P>In his 2000 and 2004 inauguration addresses, Chen pledged that if
China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, he will not
declare Taiwan independence, not change the official name of the
country, not include the "state-to-state" concept on cross-strait
relations in the Constitution, and not promote a referendum to change
the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>On several occasions, Chen has promised that sensitive issues
concerning sovereignty and changes to territorial boundaries and the
national title will be excluded from the process of constitutional
reform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL DAY RALLY TO BE STAGED AS PLANNED: CHIEF ORGANIZER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
chief organizer of the Oct. 10 National Day celebrations, reaffirmed
Wednesday that the National Day rally will be held as planned.</P>
      <P>Wang said the rally, held every year at the square in front of
the Presidential Office, is "the nation's major event and should not
be scrapped without any compelling reasons."</P>
      <P>He noted that the rally has only been canceled once, in the wake
of the devastating Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake, over the past five
decades.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks amid reports that President Chen Shui-bian
is concerned about the situation getting out of control after
anti-graft protesters said they would stage a "besiege the
Presidential Office" rally on Oct. 10 to step up pressure on the
embattled president to resign over corruption and embezzlement
allegations.</P>
      <P>The reports said that the president has asked his chief of staff
Tan Sun Chen and ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun to lobby Wang privately to carefully consider scrapping the
National Day rally. Their request has placed Wang in a dilemma, the
reports also said.</P>
      <P>Both the Presidential Office and the DPP have denied the reports.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Tan Sun Chan and Yu had both said that they
respect the views of the National Day rally organizing committee and
have no preset stance.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the Double Ten rally should not be scrapped,
adding that "I'll do what I have to do, and there is nothing
difficult about it."</P>
      <P>He said that as long as the "besiege" plan does not affect the
peripheral security of the square, it should not be relevant to the
National Day rally.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said ensuring the safe and smooth staging of the
National Day celebration is not only the responsibility of the
organizing committee and security agencies but also of all the
people.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the anti-graft campaign are trying to recruit 5,000
"nonviolent activists" -- mostly women -- to block the front and rear
entrances of the Presidential Office Oct. 10, an action they claim
will prevent President Chen from entering or leaving his office. The
activists will be at the forefront of tens of thousands of other
protesters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BETEL NUT CHEWERS IGNORE MOUTH CANCER THREATS: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwan's "betel nut tribe" has
exceeded 1 million, but fewer than 5 percent of them have undergone
an oral examination to detect the disease over the past year,
according to the findings of a 2005 study made public Wednesday by
the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, over 15 percent of men aged over 15 and 1 percent of
women chew betel nuts, the vast majority of whom have failed to
receive an oral soft-tissue examination over the past year to
diagnose the disease early, with "good health condition," "no time,"
and "slim chance of getting cancer" the most often cited reasons, the
study shows.</P>
      <P>Compared to a similar poll conducted in 2002, the number of betel
nut chewers in Taiwan has been dropping, with eastern regions having
the highest ratio of 25 percent of betel nut consumers, outnumbering
20 percent for central and southern regions. Taipei City and
Kaohsiung City record the lowest percentages in this regard.</P>
      <P>Incidence of oral cancer has been rising the most rapidly among
local males -- a 20 percent increase in the last five years, the
results show. The 31-45 age group makes up the bulk of Taiwan's male
betel nut lovers, with as many as 25 percent of them consuming the
nut.</P>
      <P>The mortality rate of oral cancer among Taiwan men is expected to
become the world's highest in the not so distant future, should this
growth rate continue to climb, DOH officials warned.</P>
      <P>About 40 percent of Taiwan's betel nut chewers admit to having
tried to quit the habit, but half of them failed within three months,
according to the investigation.</P>
      <P>Betel nuts, popularly dubbed "Taiwanese chewing gum, " is a major
cause of oral cancer among Taiwan men. The production value of
Taiwan's betel nuts hits tens of billions of new Taiwan dollars each
year, making it one of the country's principal cash crops.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMANY, E.U. MODELS FOR CROSS-STRAIT TIES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that
the unification model of Germany and Europe's integration are
examples that Taiwan can follow for a peaceful resolution of
cross-Taiwan Strait differences.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that before unification, East and West Germany had
signed treaties to pave the way for their unification and were both
members of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the European Union is formed by 25 nations based on
the principles of sovereignty, democracy, peace and parity, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He said Europe's integration has been successful mainly because
it recognizes all member states as independent and respects the free
choices of the peoples of different countries on whether to join the
European Union, never resorting to the use of force.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, all members are equal regardless of their size
and are not divided into central and local governments, he said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving a delegation led
by German parliamentarian Christian Lange.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government is very thankful to the German
Parliament for its objection to the European Union's plan to lift its
arms embargo against China, which was adopted after the Tiananmen
massacre of 1989.</P>
      <P>Claiming that China has not improved its human rights record over
the past 17 years and remains one of the least free countries in the
world, Chen said the European Union should not lift the arms embargo
under these circumstances.</P>
      <P>While the European Parliament has on several occasions called for
a peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, China's military
spending has maintained double-digit growth every year for the past
decade, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Also, China has deployed more than 800 missiles targeting Taiwan
along its southeastern coast, more than quadruple the number in 2000,
he went on.</P>
      <P>Beijing enacted its Anti-Secession Law in March 2005 to provide a
"legal basis" for any attempt to use force against Taiwan and has
completed a three-phase preparation for the use of force against
Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, it would violate the founding principle of the
European Union if the European Union were to allow arms sales to an
undemocratic China to be used against a democratic Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) is stepping up emission checks on diesel vehicles using the
country's freeways.</P>
      <P>The EPA said that since the start of the month, it has mobilized
environmental protection agencies and the police to monitor emissions
from diesel vehicles at freeway exits as well as toll stations.</P>
      <P>If the vehicles cannot be pulled over for inspection because of
safety reasons, but are photographed and shown to be releasing
excessive pollutants, the owners of the vehicles will be told to go
to designated locations to have their vehicles inspected.</P>
      <P>Those who fail the tests will be fined between NT$1,500 and
NT$60,000 (US$45-US$180) and told to improve before a designated
date.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Hastert
Fights to Save His Job in Page Scandal
Backed by measured words of support from
President Bush, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert opened
an intense drive on Tuesday to hold on to his
post, but behind the scenes senior Republicans
weighed whether he could survive the scandal
surrounding former Representative Mark Foley.
Among the options being considered by senior
Republicans is for Mr. Hastert to announce that
he will stay on as speaker through this year but
not seek re-election to the post assuming
Republicans retain control of the House, said
people on and off Capitol Hill who were involved
in the discussions. They said the advantage of
such a step would be to postpone a disruptive
leadership fight until after Election Day.
Wall Street Journal:Israeli Investors
Find Opportunity In Romanian Roots
In 1993, Moshe Arbel returned to Romania, 45
years after he arrived in Israel with thousands
of other children orphaned by the Holocaust. He
found his mother's grave, hired caretakers to
maintain it for $12 a month, and spotted
something else -- opportunity.
Romania was a country stirring to life
economically after the fall of communism, he
told his employer, Givat Haim, a kibbutz that
makes Prigat-brand fruit juice. "I said, 'Back
me and I'll make money in Romania.' They said,
'Romania? There's more money in Netanya [a
nearby town] than in all of Romania.' Meshuga
-- crazy -- they called me," Mr. Arbel recalls.</TEXT>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The release of sky lanterns, a common folk
practice to seek good luck, will be regulated according to a Fire
Fighting Law amendment approved Wednesday by the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, which will be sent to the legislature
for enactment, anyone wishing to release sky lanterns must obtain a
permit from the government and those who fail to do so could be fined
up to NT$3,000 (US$90.53).</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that sky lanterns pose a risk of fire to
forest areas, oil tanks, residences and factories, their release
should be prohibited unless approved by the authorities, according to
a statement accompanying the amendment.</P>
      <P>This amendment also covers other activities that pose similar
fire risks.</P>
      <P>Sky lanterns are made of treated paper and wire, with a dish of
kerosene hanging below. The lanterns drift up into the sky when the
kerosene is lit because of the hot air produced by the fire and are
supposed to stay aloft until the kerosene burns out.</P>
      <P>Often, however, the lanterns catch fire or are blown down by the
wind and earlier this year, one such failed lantern started a
grassfire at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. The fire
briefly disrupted flights, although it did not cause any property
damage.</P>

      <P>Rising drunken driving fatalities on
Taiwan's roads have prompted an opposition lawmaker to call for an
amendment of the law to increase the penalties for repeat drunken
drivers.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang, who left the opposition People First
Party (PFP) and joined the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in April, told
a press conference Wednesday that the number of fatalities from
drunken driving has continued to rise over the past six years.</P>
      <P>Citing national statistics, Hsieh pointed out that drunken
driving accidents claimed 443 lives in 2002, 461 in 2003, 454 in 2004
and 547 in 2005.</P>
      <P>However, in the first eight months this year, drunken
driving-related fatalities had already reached 480, with the death
toll for the whole year expected to surpass 700, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged the Ministry of Justice and the National Police
Agency under the Ministry of the Interior to support his proposal to
amend Article 185, Section 3, to increase the penalties for drunken
drivers.</P>
      <P>According to the section, drunken driving is punishable by
imprisonment up to one year, labor service under detention, or a fine
of up to NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislator pointed out that although 30,443 drunken
drivers were charged last year, only 65 of them received sentences of
between six months and one year, showing that the law has failed to
combat drunken driving.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
Wednesday that it will invest more than NT$100 million (US$3.05
million) in improving the working environment of the "3K" industries,
referring to dangerous, tough and dirty industries.</P>
      <P>CLA officials noted that many traditional industries in Taiwan,
including the printing, dying and finishing, rubber, synthetic resin,
casting, forging and heat handling sectors, have risk factors such as 
high temperatures, noise and high pollution in their working
environments.</P>
      <P>Vocational hazards in these sectors are also higher than in other
jobs, so that local workers are unwilling to work in them.
More than 40 percent of the manufacturers in these sectors
hope to introduce foreign laborers to meet their labor shortages.</P>
      <P>To improve safety and health in the working environment and to
attract more local workers to these sectors, the CLA has worked with
the Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) to form a counseling team to improve working
conditions in the sector, with the budget for improvements shouldered
by the government.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-chi, director of the CLA's Department of Labor Safety
and Health, said appropriated counseling expenses of NT$75 million
will be financed by the CLA and the MOEA with professionals
serving as counselors.</P>
      <P>The CLA will appropriate another NT$100 million to invite 150
inspectors to examine the improvements and will spend more than
NT$200 million in total next year, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the CLA will first target 2,800 3K businesses that need
foreign laborers. When they apply to hire foreign laborers, they will
approve half of them and ask the operators to improve working
conditions. The CLA will only allow the other half of foreign
laborers to be hired after the improvements have been made.</P>
      <P>If the operators fail to improve, the CLA will impose punitive
measures, he added.</P>
      <P>The CLA estimated that there are 19 categories of tough work in
Taiwan, with around 15,030 operators and an annual production value
of NT$1.48 trillion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved Wednesday a package
aimed at boosting the country's industrial development with the
provision of various incentives.</P>
      <P>The package consists of two master plans, one on creating a
favorable investment environment and the other on opening a new phase
for industrial development, according to Minister without Portfolio
Ho Mei-yueh.</P>
      <P>There are five sub-plans under the plan on creating a favorable
investment environment, namely providing preferential measures to
facilitate land acquisition, increasing the labor supply, offering
financing assistance, enhancing the efficiency of environmental
impact assessments and establishing a mechanism to promote business
investment, Ho said.</P>
      <P>To facilitate land acquisition, the government will provide 100
hectares of cheap or rent-free state-owned land to businesses and
will have the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp.
release more than 1,000 hectares of land for rent to businesses.
Also, the government will continue to offer preferential rates for
land rental in industrial parks, with the goals of drawing investment
worth NT$175 billion to create an annual production value of NT$210
billion and an extra 35,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>To increase the labor supply, the government will improve the
work environment to enhance the employment of local workers, review
its policy toward foreign workers, and continue importing foreign
workers for the "laborious, dangerous and dirty" industries.</P>
      <P>To provide financing assistance, the government will strengthen
credit guarantees for small- and medium-sized businesses and relax
the qualifications for businesses intending to apply for credit
guarantees. The Executive Yuan's Development Fund has also earmarked
NT$20 billion to invest in traditional industries.</P>
      <P>To enhance the efficiency of environmental impact assessments,
the government will speed up the assessment process, while to
establish a mechanism to promote business investment, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs will help local governments map out development
strategies and meet regularly to seek to remove any investment
barriers.</P>
      <P>Also, the Cabinet will offer cash rewards to local governments
for assisting in recruiting investment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the plan on opening a new phase for industrial
development is comprised of three sub-plans, namely boosting the
development of rising industries, promoting industrial upgrading and
transformation, and balancing industrial development.</P>
      <P>On the development of rising industries, the government aims to
boost the production value of the wireless, broadband and related
services industries to NT$128 billion by 2009, that of the digital
life industry to NT$640 billion, that of the health care industry to
NT$320 billion, and that of the green industry to NT$192 billion.</P>
      <P>On industrial upgrading and transformation, the government will
promote a "new agricultural campaign," enhance the added value of the
manufacturing industry and deregulate the services sector.</P>
      <P>On balancing industrial development, the government will help
disadvantaged industries develop common technologies and materials
and provide trade relief to industries suffering losses from the
competition from imported products.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the government will guide the development of products
having locally specific properties, with one specialty product
for each township. The government aims to increase the production
value of locally specific industries by NT$1 billion and create an
extra 5,400 jobs.</P>
      <P>The government will also guide the development of small- and
medium-sized businesses, with the goal of setting up four business
incubation and backup centers in three years, providing assistance to
2,000 new businesses with global competitiveness, inducing new
investment worth NT$15 billion, creating 4,200 new jobs and winning
390 new patents. The government aims to increase the number of small-
and medium-sized businesses using e-commerce by 75,000 over the next
three years and creating new business opportunities worth NT$3
billion for the information services industry.</P>

      <P>Opinions on cross-strait trade relations
differed widely in a forum of the World Chinese Traders Convention
Wednesday, suggesting a consensus on the long-standing issue still

      <P>Speaking at the event, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu reiterated the government's priority to enforce the policy
of "proactive management with effective liberalization."</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chin-ho, chief executive officer of the business monthly
Wealth magazine, advocated full-scale liberalization.</P>
      <P>Other opinions were somewhere in between.</P>
      <P>Traders already investing in China are now facing new challenges
as Chinese businesses have become more globally competitive, said
Chiao Yu-chun, president of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers' Association.</P>
      <P>And they always face the possibility of being affected by
the currency exchange for the Chinese yuan, Chiao said, adding that
smart traders will use government limitations to their advantage and
still reap a profit, instead of simply complaining.</P>
      <P>Trade relations between Taiwan and China can be described as a
"co-petitive" (cooperation and competitive) relationship, said David
Weng, president of Essence Technology.</P>
      <P>"In fact, Taiwan has a very good investment environment as it has
a solid education system, a highly competitive computer hardware
manufacturing industry and top talent in international management
and design," he said.</P>
      <P>"All we need do is understand what role we should play in a new
business model and what leverage we have on the China market," Weng

      <P>Foreign investors still harbor optimism
toward Taiwan's economic climate despite the country's recent
political disturbances, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At the closing ceremony of the 25th World Chinese Traders
Convention held in Taipei, Su told ethnic Chinese businesspeople from
around the world that Taiwan's current political turmoil is quite
normal for a young democracy.</P>
      <P>Although some media reports have depicted the country as
undergoing much political conflict, foreign investors still have
faith in Taiwan's investment climate, judging from Chunghwa Telecom's
recent overseas raising of capital and London-based Standard
Chartered Bank's plan to purchase Hsinchu International Bank in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su said his Cabinet has made Taiwan's sustainable economic
development its priority, and that it recently proposed several major
investment projects, offering preferential treatment to investors.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan boasts a sound economic infrastructure, Su
said the sporadic political conflict represents a normal phenomenon

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu
said Wednesday that although there is room for adjustment in
Taiwan-China economic exchanges, overall national security still
takes precedence over economic benefits.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks during a panel discussion of the four-day
25th World Chinese Traders Convention.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government's "active management, effective
opening" policy remains the top damage-control guidelines in Taiwan's
economic exchanges with China, Wu said however that he will also
exercise flexibility in negotiations with China over sovereignty
issues.</P>
      <P>"As long as I'm serving in the post I will do my best to help
mitigate the investment risk for Taiwan businesses in China while
displaying flexibility in talks with China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that China has a great magnetism for Taiwan
investors and that China absorbed as much as 71 percent of Taiwan's
total outbound investments last year. The ratio will further pick up
this year, worsening unemployment and crowding out investment in the
Taiwan market, he predicted.</P>
      <P>The MAC is poised to push for a further opening of Taiwan to

      <P>The Tainan District Prosecutor's Office
searched 12 medical facilities and one university Wednesday, aiming

    <HEADLINE>MOJ REJECTS PAROLE APPLICATION OF 'HAUKANG WOLF'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) rejected
the parole application of a serial rapist Wednesday for the seventh
time in five years over concerns about recidivism.</P>
      <P>The applicant -- known locally as the "Huakang Wolf" because most
of the crimes he committed in the mid-1990s took place at Huankang,
Chinese Culture University's campus in suburban Taipei -- filed his
seventh application in August.</P>
      <P>After more than two months of consultation with criminologists
and other relevant professionals, the MOJ decided to turn down the
application on grounds that social misgivings remain about the chances
of the applicant repeating the crime.</P>
      <P>The 36-year-old inmate, identified only by his family name of
Yang, was sentenced on 34 counts of rape and robbery. Only nine of
the criminal cases he committed purely involved theft or robbery,
while all the remaining 25 cases involved both robbery and sexual
assault.</P>
      <P>Yang, who has been imprisoned since November 1996, has served more
than 11 years of a 16-year prison terms and qualifies for parole
application.</P>
      <P>He made headlines five years ago when he passed exams to enter
prestigious National Taiwan University, but was later forced to
give up his study plan after the MOJ rejected his parole
application amid social misgivings about the chances of
recidivism. His subsequent parole application were also rejected for
similar reasons.</P>
      <P>In his latest application, Yang said he is willing to wear an
electronic tag and hopes to enter a theological college if granted 
parole.</P>
      <P>According to current regulations, Yang will be eligible to apply
for parole again four months later.</P>
      <P>MOJ officials said the MOJ has been developing an electronic
surveillance system that would require some paroled criminals to wear
tag to facilitate tracking in an effort to ensure that they do not
re-offend. </P>
      <P>As Yang will return to his hometown in Hualien County if granted
parole in the future, MOJ officials said the ministry will arrange
for guidance personnel in the eastern county to work at the Taipei
Prison where Yang has been serving his time as part of preparatory
work.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 492 passports of local citizens
were robbed by four gunmen on the doorstep of a noted travel agency
in Taipei Thursday evening, police said.</P>
      <P>Staff of Cola Tour Agency were preparing to send the passports,
wrapped in two bags, to Taoyuan International Airport when they were
robbed of the bags at their company's very doorstep. The armed
robbers managed to escape from the scene quickly, eyewitnesses said.</P>
      <P>Taipei city police authorities have formed a special task force
to investigate the rare passport robbery that took place on one of
the city's busiest streets -- Section 2 of bustling Nanking East
Road.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations showed that the robbers were quite
familiar with Cola Tour's passport delivery operations. They ambushed
Cola Tour staff and escaped via a sedan after the bold robbery,
eyewitnesses said.</P>
      <P>Police have checked surveillance videotapes provided by stores in
the vicinity in order to determine the robbers' escape route.
According to the auto license plate number offered by eyewitnesses,
the car was registered in southern Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Cola Tour Vice President Lee Chi-po said all of the robbed
passports belonging to passengers scheduled to depart Friday for
overseas vacation trips at the beginning of the five-day holidays for
Mid-Autumn Festival and Double Ten National Holiday celebrations.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the incident will affect 24 tour groups -- 10
groups to Japan, five to South Korea, six to Thailand and one each to
Singapore, Canada and Europe.</P>
      <P>As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unlikely to issue new
passports for affected passengers overnight, they would be unable to
go abroad Friday as scheduled.</P>
      <P>"In addition to offering our customers a full refund of travel
fees, we'll also given them cash compensation amounting to 50 percent
of travel fees as stipulated in the contract, " Lee said, adding that
the company will apply new passports for all of the affected
passengers.</P>
      <P>Cola Tour will incur an estimated loss of NT$10 million because
of the incident, Lee said.</P>
      <P>None of the passengers who will depart Saturday for Cola
Tour-organized travel packages will be affected, Lee said.</P>
      <P>To prevent human trafficking and document forgery rings from
using the robbed passports to smuggle wanted criminals out of Taiwan,
the Aviation Police Bureau has been ordered to tighten immigration
inspections at the country's main gateways after the incident.</P>

      <P>Firefighters rushed him to nearby Mackay Memorial Hospital for

      <P>Police said Nguyen's attempt to flee from the detention center

      <P>City police authorities said they will cooperate with the

      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih
Yen-hsiang is scheduled to lead a group of experts to the United
States Saturday to inspect the operations of Sino Swearingen Aircraft
Corp. (SSAC) , a joint venture in which Taiwan holds an over
90-percent stake.</P>
      <P>Shih and the experts are expected to visit Sino Swearingen's
headquarters in San Antonio, Texas to gain a better understanding of
the company's operations after the schedule for the mass production
of SJ30-2 twin-engine light business jets was delayed.</P>
      <P>Sino Swearingen received a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
type certificate (TC) for the new SJ30-2 business jet in August this
year authorizing it to conduct in-house flight training for customers
seeking SJ30 type ratings.</P>
      <P>Although the SSAC completed its first test flight of the high
performance twinjet SJ30 aircraft in 2000 and received the TC from
the FAA recently, the company is having trouble delivering the first
order, scheduled for this month, for various reasons, including
wrongly-installed wings, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long said earlier this month that
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will not sit idly by over
this matter since the SSAC is a joint venture planned and authorized
by the ministry. He also said that MOEA officials will report to the
Legislative Yuan as requested before the end of this year on the
development of the joint venture.</P>

      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) for September
declined 1.22 percent from the level for the same month last year,
marking the biggest year-on-year drop since March 2003, according to
tallies released Thursday by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The September CPI was 0.53 percent lower compared with the
previous month, marking the second consecutive month that the CPI has
declined, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>For the first nine months of this year, the CPI was 0.83 percent
higher than the figure for the same period last year, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>They said good weather in September resulted in sufficient
supplies of fruit and vegetables, which led to lower prices than for
the same month in the previous year, when the supply was affected by
a string of typhoons.</P>
      <P>The cut in oil prices and end-of-summer clothing sales in
September also helped relieve inflation pressure, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted that food prices will continue to go down
in October if the weather remains stable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the wholesale price index (WPI) for September was down
0.17 percent from August but up 6.69 percent compared with the same
month last year, they said.</P>
      <P>For the nine months to September, the WPI was 5.47 percent higher

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye has
again reminded all military personnel, regardless of their rank,
position and pay level, to stay out of politics in accordance with
constitutional provisions.</P>
      <P>Lee issued the call while addressing a ceremony at the Ministry
of National Defense Thursday in celebration of the country's Double
Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>The appeal came amid turmoil arising from an anti-corruption
campaign aimed at pressuring President Chen Shui-bian to resign over
alleged corruption scandals. Sporadic clashes between Chen's
opponents and faithfuls have been reported at rival street rallies in
some southern cities. The presence of a handful of those in military
uniform at anti-Chen rallies has drawn criticism.</P>
      <P>Noting that members of the armed forces are required by the
Constitution to be above personal, regional and partisan affiliation,
and to be loyal to the country and protect the people, Lee said every
service member should refrain from taking part in any political
activities and should be free of any political interference.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan is a liberal democracy, Lee said, all military
personnel should uphold the rule of law and stay out of politics.
"All men and women in uniform should dedicate themselves to serving
the country and the people and transcend partisan affiliations while
working to uplift military professionalism and hone their combat
skills.</P>
      <P>In another news development, the MND declined to make any comment
Thursday on a media report that progress has been made on a mid-life
upgrade project for the locally developed Ching-kuo indigenous
defense fighters (IDF).</P>
      <P>According to a Chinese-language Liberty Times report, an upgraded
version of the IDF fighters, equipped with fuel tanks for in-flight
refueling, has been developed and has undergone test flights.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, MND spokesman Wu Chi-fang said the IDF
mid-life upgrade program, code-named "Project Shiang Sheng, " is a
classified program aimed at upgrading the IDF fighter's performance.</P>
      <P>"The project is still ongoing, and the ministry is not in a
position to elaborate on its implementation," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Military sources said the military-run Chungshan Institute of
Science and Technology has developed know-how for the IDF mid-life
upgrade and commissioned the state-owned Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp. to undertake the project.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the project is to improve the strike
capability of the IDF, turning it into the so-called "joint
countermeasures platform" as a part of the new strategy to "conduct
decisive battles outside the territory," the sources said.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Hastert,
a Political Survivor, Vows to Overcome Scandal

J. Dennis Hastert, who was installed as House
speaker eight years ago through backroom
maneuvering in a moment of crisis for his party,
has no distinct power base in Congress, not much
of a national reputation and, in an age of
television politics, little polish in front of
the camera.

But Mr. Hastert has survived and survived to
become the longest-serving Republican speaker.
And on Thursday, standing outside his district
office in Batavia, Ill., he made it clear that
he did not intend to become a casualty of the
Mark Foley scandal, saying he expected to win
re-election to his seat and run for speaker
again when the new Congress convenes in
January.

Wall Street Journal:In Foley Scandal,
Republican Leader Comes Under Fire

When reporters in suburban Buffalo, N.Y.,
gathered Monday night to hear local Rep. Tom
Reynolds explain his role in the House page
sex scandal, they were surprised to see the
local congressman flanked by dozens of children,
some squirming in their parents' arms.

"I'm not going to ask any of my supporters
to leave," a defiant Mr. Reynolds told
reporters, who had suggested that the topic
-- about former Florida Republican Rep. Mark
Foley's sexually charged computer messages to
a male page -- wasn't appropriate for children.
For 45 minutes, the crowd stood by as the coos
and occasional cries of the children provided
background noise and Mr. Reynolds fielded
questions.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WOMEN HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT CERVICAL CANCER: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While cervical cancer remains the most
common form of cancer among women in Taiwan, the majority of Taiwan
women have little knowledge about the disease, according to the
results of a survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Formosa Cancer Foundation in
cooperation with the pharmaceutical firm GlaxoSmithKline in August on
1,081 women aged 16 or above. It has a margin of error of plus or
minus 2.97 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 75 percent of the respondents were not
aware that human papillomavirus infections are the major cause of
cervical cancer.</P>
      <P>Although 40 percent of the respondents knew that they should
receive Pap smears regularly after they become sexually active, most
of them did not have their first Pap smear until after the age of 35,
with less then 20 percent receiving Pap smears before the age of 30,
the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Also, 70 percent of the women surveyed did not know that cervical
cancer can be classified into several stages.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-fang, a gynecologist and obstetrician at National
Taiwan University Hospital, noted that the cure rate of cervical
cancer reaches almost 100 percent if the disease is detected when it
is still limited to surface cells.</P>
      <P>When the cervical cancer has developed into an invasive one, the
five-year survival rate for the cancer patients is 85 percent if it
is diagnosed at stage I, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The five-year survival rate drops to 65 percent if the cancer is
diagnosed at stage II, further to 50 percent if diagnosed at stage
III, and further to 10 percent if diagnosed at stage IV, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Receiving cervical screening regularly will help in early
diagnosis and treatment of the cancer, she said.</P>
      <P>Lai Gi-ming, CEO of the Formosa Cancer Foundation, said although
the survey found that 70 percent of the respondents had their first
sexual experience between age of 15 and 29, only a low percentage
received Pap smears before the age of 30, probably because the
Department of Health (DOH) only covers the cost of Pap smears for
women aged 30 or above.</P>
      <P>DOH tallies show that 50 percent to 60 percent of Taiwan women
aged 30 or above have received Pap smears over the past three years.</P>
      <P>More than 6,000 new cases of cervical cancer are reported in
Taiwan every year, making it the most common form of cancer among
Taiwan women. Meanwhile, approximately 1,000 women in Taiwan die from
cervical cancer every year, according to the DOH.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN SUPPORTS SIGNING OF U.S.-TAIWAN FTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Rep. Peter T. King (R-NY)
expressed support recently for the signing of a free trade
agreement (FTA) between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During a speech delivered at the House of Representatives on the
eve of the Sept. 29 recess, King, chairman of the Committee on
Homeland Security, said he fully supports the notion that the United
States should launch FTA negotiations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>King said that for more than 50 years, a close relationship has
existed between the United States and Taiwan, which has been of
enormous economic, cultural and strategic advantage to both
countries.</P>
      <P>The United States was Taiwan's third-largest trading partner in
2005, while Taiwan was the eighth-largest trading partner of the
United States, with two-way trade between the two countries totaling
US$56.9 billion that year, King added.</P>
      <P>He noted that President George Bush has begun to deliver on his
promises to expand U.S. free trade relations with Asian countries,
beginning with an FTA with Singapore and followed by FTA talks with
Malaysia and South Korea. It is therefore high time for the U.S. to
talk with Taiwan on the issue, he added.</P>
      <P>King quoted an annual report issued by the U.S.
International Trade Commission in 2002 as showing that some
sectors of the U.S. economy would increase significantly in
percentage terms (motor vehicles, rice, fish and other food imports
to Taiwan would increase by more than 100 percent) if the United
States entered into an FTA with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that so far, 23 state councils across America have
expressed support for the signing of an FTA between the U.S. and
Taiwan, adding that his constituency, New York State, which exported
over US$1 billion-worth of products and services to Taiwan in 2005,
would definitely increase exports to Taiwan and consequently create
more jobs in the state if a U.S.-Taiwan FTA were to be signed.</P>
      <P>He said that it is the feeling of Congress that the United States
should increase trade opportunities with Taiwan by launching
negotiations to enter an FTA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top representative office in Washington has offered
appreciation to King for his support, which has been incorporated
into congressional records.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of drug addicts in Taiwan
suffering from AIDS has been growing rapidly in recent years,
prompting law enforcement authorities to step up a clampdown on drug
trafficking, prosecutors said Friday.</P>
      <P>The number of addicts infected with AIDS began increasing sharply
in 2003, according to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Justice.
In 2004, there were 544 reported cases around the island, a
seven-fold growth over the 2003 level and exceeding the combination
of the aggregate number posted during the 1998-2003 period.</P>
      <P>A prosecutor exclusively in charge of fighting drug abuse said
that most addicts acquire AIDS through sharing needles with other
infected addicts.</P>
      <P>With society getting more open and widely diversified, bars,
nightclubs and house parties have become places where young men and
women can abuse illegal drugs due to the rampant spread of narcotics,
the prosecutor claimed.</P>
      <P>Although the investigation authorities have done their best to
eradicate the abuse of illicit drugs to prevent the spread of AIDS,
the prosecutor contended that crackdowns alone are not enough to
achieve the goal.</P>
      <P>"Law enforcement alone will not remove the root cause of the drug
abuse problem in society, " he said, pointing out that the problem
has further worsened as a result of a growing number of drug abusers
and more expensive prices of narcotics due to increased consumption.</P>
      <P>"More and more drug addicts turn to crime such as robbery in
order to feed their habits," he said.</P>
      <P>To effectively contain the spread of AIDS through drug abuse, the
prosecutor suggested cooperation with health authorities to raise
public awareness of new concepts about treating and curing AIDS, such
as providing free needles for addicts at some specific sites, in
addition to cracking down on drug trafficking.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged opposition lawmakers Friday to "show a sense of
propriety" lest their actions turn the Oct. 10 National Day
celebration into a joke and hurt the nation's image.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang made the appeal
amid reports that main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the
People First Party (PFP), will don red clothes to attend the National
Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Since an anti-graft campaign asked supporters of its cause to don
red Sept. 9 to show their indignation at President Chen Shui-bian
over a spate of alleged corruption scandals, the color red now
implies a connotation of "depose Chen" -- the aim of the campaign
organizers.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed hope that the opposition will not attend the
National Day celebration "with a mind of hatred or troublemaking."</P>
      <P>He noted that local and foreign dignitaries will attend the
celebrations and said the actions of the opposition will not only
embarrass the president but the nation itself.</P>
      <P>"If the opposition legislators have a sense of honor, they should
know where to stop," he added. </P>
      <P>He said that if the actions of the opposition lawmakers and the
"anti-Chen" campaign seriously affect law and order or the national
image, the DPP will suggest to the president that he only attend
indoor National Day celebrations and stay away from the outdoor
celebrations.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the campaign said they would unveil details of a
"besiege the Presidential Office" plan Saturday to step up pressure
on Chen to resign over a series of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>The organizers hope to recruit 5,000 "nonviolent activists" --
mostly women -- to block the front and rear entrances of the
Presidential Office Oct. 10, an action they claim will prevent Chen
from entering or leaving his office. The activists will be at the
forefront of tens of thousands of other protesters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUT ASIDE DIFFERENCES FOR CELEBRATION OF NATIONAL DAY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged the public
Friday to put aside their differences and join together to celebrate
Oct. 10 National Day.</P>
      <P>The premier made the appeal as organizers of an anti-graft
campaign said they will unveil the details of a "besiege the
Presidential Office" plan Saturday to step up pressure on President
Chen Shui-bian to resign over alleged corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>The organizers hope to recruit 5,000 "nonviolent activists" --
mostly women -- to block the front and rear entrances of the
Presidential Office Oct. 10, an action they claim will prevent
President Chen from entering or leaving his office. The activists
will be at the forefront of tens of thousands of other protesters.</P>
      <P>The premier, after hosting a tea party for foreign students in
Taipei, said National Day is a major event for the nation and that
the celebrations will be attended by foreign dignitaries from the
nation's allies.</P>
      <P>"Irrespective of one's political stance, one should put aside
that political stance to create a good atmosphere," he said.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Huang Chih-fang said the issuance of
invitations to the foreign dignitaries has been going smoothly and
added that two national leaders will also come.</P>
      <P>Asked if the ministry has explained the plan to besiege the
Presidential Office to the foreign dignitaries, Huang said they had
not been told about the possibility of disturbances, adding that
political squabble is normal in a democratic country. </P>
      <P>Huang also said that since renovation work at the venue of the
National Day banquet -- the Taipei Guest House -- was only completed
this year, the invited guests will enter in two stages, in order to
protect the historic site.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Apart from parks along Tamsui River, locals
and foreign tourists in Taipei have a new venue for watching this
year's fireworks show for Oct. 10 National Day -- the Taipei 101
building, which is the world's highest skyscraper.</P>
      <P>According to the public relations manager of the tower, not just
locals -- such as foreign tourists and in particular those from Japan
-- have begun inquiring about ticket prices for a seat on top of the
building to view the magnificent event Tuesday evening in Taipei.</P>
      <P>To prevent the audience from being disturbed during the fireworks
show, the number of visitors allowed in the tower will be kept under
control with a maximum of 2,400, the manager said, urging those
interested in spending a wonderful National Day evening on the top of
the world to purchase their tickets as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>This year's National Day fireworks display will be the first to
be held by the Democratic Progressive Party administration in the
capital since it came to power in 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO DEVELOP TAIWAN INTO MECCA FOR MEDICAL TOURISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The administration is planning to make
Taiwan a Mecca for medical tourism for Chinese people around the
world, the head of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The government plans to invest some NT$10.5 billion (US$318
million) over the next several years to develop Taiwan's medical
services, particularly in the areas of laser eyesight correction,
health checks, dentistry, plastic surgery and traditional Chinese
medicine, to attract visitors from around the world to Taiwan for
tourism as well as medical attention, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>Through a strong publicity campaign, the administration is
determined to globalize the five medical sectors, which are well
developed and already well-known around the world, to attract foreign
tourists, particularly people of Chinese origin, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will try to emulate Thailand, South Korea and Singapore in
medical tourism efforts, borrowing their successful experiences in
plastic surgery, health checks and cancer treatment to accelerate the
country's efforts, they noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also consider establishing hospitals in Vietnam or
Mongolia to help "export" Taiwan's medical expertise and skills, they
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROGRAM ON TAIWAN'S NEW LED INDUSTRY TO BE SHOWN ON FTV</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Tsai Hui-ju)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's light-emitting diode (LED) industry
has become one of the nation's hottest new sectors and the world's
greatest producer of this new technology, which will be featured in a
TV program on Formosa TV at 10: 30 p.m. Sunday evening, a spokesman
for the National Applied Research Laboratories (NARL) said.</P>
      <P>The TV program "Lightening the Future -- Lighting and
Electricity" was produced under NARL's supervision and is one episode
of a distinguished program series called "Technology as Taiwan's
Driving Force." It is also highly recommended by the Broadcasting
Development Fund, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>NARL Chairman Lai Yi-hsiung said Taiwan's optoelectronics
industry has rapidly developed, and currently supplies a lion's share
of LEDs in the world, accounting for 30 billion LED bulbs per year --
one-fifth of the world's production value in this sector.</P>
      <P>Lai added that the LED industry is currently hotting up among
transnational technology companies due to its future potential as a
replacement for traditional bulbs.</P>
      <P>He explained LED bulbs have a lifespan 100 times longer than
traditional bulbs, need only 10 percent of the electricity, and when
tested in traffic lights LEDs used 89 percent less energy.</P>
      <P>The brightness and saturated color of LED bulbs also make them
suitable for LCD TVs, and Taiwan's chances in the industry depend not
only in future production capacity, but also innovative design, for
which it has already won many awards in international competitions,
Lai added.</P>

prime minister.

1950: Communist Chinese troops enter Tibet.

1958: Communist Chinese begin to launch a mass movement in

policy. He also emphasizes the ROC will never negotiate with the

Office of the President to help plan the policy framework for

perfect divine moral nature who is able to combine in himself
quickness of magnanimity, generosity, benignity, and gentleness:
qualities necessary for the exercise of patience."</TEXT>

      <P>Chiayi County agricultural authorities urged

an outbreak of an unknown disease infecting pigs in southern China,
where 40 percent of affected livestock have died and the outbreak has

      <P>High fever, high mortality and fast spreading are the main

Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangtong, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian

    <HEADLINE>DPP HOPES ANTI-PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN WILL NOT GO `TOO FAR'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged the organizers of an ongoing anti-corruption campaign
Saturday not to "overdo" its protest to pressure President Chen
Shui-bian to step down over a spate of alleged corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang made the remarks
amid reports that the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign
will launch a "besiege the Presidential Office" during Oct. 10
National Day celebrations and at the same time begin an islandwide
signature solicitation drive to recall DPP legislators as part of its
efforts to boot out the embattled president, who has denied
wrongdoing and vowed to serve out his term until May 2008.</P>
      <P>As a recall of the DPP lawmakers will take time, the sit-in
protest, which started Sept. 9, will be extended at least until next
February, according to reports.</P>
      <P>"The campaign organizers should stop before going too far," Tsai
urged.</P>
      <P>"All related activities aimed at ousting President Chen should
stop so as to give a breather to Taiwan society," he continued.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that the campaign has "gradually lost its
legitimacy and that the public resents such activities" and he lashed
out at the organizers for attempting to prolong the protests
regardless of public sentiment.</P>
      <P>"If the series of protests do not stop, they will be bound to
fail," he claimed.</P>
      <P>An opposition-initiated motion to recall Chen failed June 27
because it could not muster 148 votes, or two-thirds of the votes in
the 221-seat Legislative Yuan required, to put it to a national
referendum. The opposition maintains only a slim majority while all
86 DPP as well as two Non-Partisan Solidarity Union lawmakers
abstained from voting. All 12 Taiwan Solidarity Union legislators and
two former DPP legislators cast invalid votes.</P>
      <P>A second recall motion is scheduled to be put to a vote in the
legislature Oct. 13. If that also fails, the opposition has
threatened a third recall.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S RELATIONS WITH TUVALU NORMAL: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Saturday that relations with Tuvalu are normal and without problems.</P>
      <P>However, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu also said Taiwan will be on
guard against China's relentless efforts to lure away Taiwan's
allies.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to media reports that relations
with the South Pacific ally are "in jeopardy" and that the ministry
abruptly replaced its ambassador in a bid to thwart China's attempt
to undermine Taiwan diplomatically ahead of the Oct. 10 National Day
celebrations.</P>
      <P>Reports said that the MOFA announced earlier this week that
Ambassador Feng Tai will be replaced by Liao Tung-chou, deputy
director of the ministry's Department of International Organizations.</P>
      <P>Lu said that "personnel changes are normal" and that Feng's
return to the ministry has nothing to do with what the paper claimed 
"floundering diplomatic relations."</P>
      <P>During his term as ambassador to Tuvalu, Feng has 
helped cement bilateral relations, Lu said, adding that his return to
the ministry is the result of normal rotation of diplomatic staff. </P>
      <P>On reports that relations between Taiwan and Tuvalu have been
shaky for some time, and that when President Chen Shui-bian visited
Palau to attend a summit with leaders of Taiwan's allies in the South
Pacific in early September, the Tuvalu premier nearly missed the
summit, Lu explained that Tuvalu had just completed an election
then and that the premier nearly missed the summit because of a busy

      <P>The Presidential Office urged
anti-corruption protesters to take the nation's image and reputation,
as well as the maintenance of harmony in society, as top priorities
while planning a "siege" of the Presidential Office on Double Ten
National Day.</P>
      <P>The office's Department of Public Affairs made the call Saturday
after organizers of the anti-graft campaign announced that the siege
will go ahead Tuesday, the day the country celebrates its 95th
birthday.</P>
      <P>The organizers said they hope 2 million people will take part in
the siege in the Poai district, in which the Presidential Office and
some other key government institutes are located, to step up pressure
on President Chen Shui-bian to resign over his alleged role in a
spate of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Responding to the announcement, the department said people should
"greet National Day with joy and delight " and suggested that people
who have differing political opinions put aside their prejudices
while celebrating the occasion.</P>
      <P>All activities should have the goal of maintaining the national

the Presidential Office.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday the party will ask its members not to
attend a Double Ten National Day rally in front of the

      <P>Yu made the remarks as an anti-graft campaign announced a
"besiege the Presidential Office" plan that day to step up pressure
on President Chen Shui-bian to resign over a spate of alleged
corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Yu said that while DPP local chapters and members normally attend
the National Day rally every year in the square in front of the
Presidential Office, this year the DPP has asked its members not to
attend the rally out of concern over possible clashes between the DPP
members and "depose Chen" protesters.</P>
      <P>Noting that Shih Ming-teh, leader of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign, has continued to apply to march and assemble,
and that Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has continued to approve the
applications, he asked them "not to overdo it."</P>
      <P>As Shih has threatened to extend the protest until next February
as part of his effort to boot out the embattled president, Yu accused
him of being ignorant of public sentiment and of hurting the nation.</P>

      <P>The State-run Taiwan Water Corp. (TWC) will
build two seawater desalination plants this year in Makung and Hsiyu
on the outlying Penghu islands, in the wake of Penghu's increasing
demand for water following the development of tourism, a spokesman

      <P>In addition, two old seawater desalination plants in Makung and
on Wanan island will also be renovated, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>The corporation's deputy chief manager, Chen Fu-tien, said
Penghu's demand for water has been increasing along with its
development of tourism, prompting the need for more seawater
desalination plants.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the cost of desalinating seawater is high, but
has fallen somewhat due to the latest technological developments, so
the corporation decided to build the plants to solve the water
problem.</P>
      <P>After the Hsiyu desalination plant is completed this December,
750 tons of water can be provided per day, while the Makung plant
will be able to provide 5,500 tons of water per day upon completion,

      <P>Taiwan people have gradually tilted toward
"identifying themselves as Taiwanese" in terms of national identity
over the past decade, according to the results of a survey released
Saturday by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The result was found in DPP's latest poll, the 77th survey
conducted by the DPP's Survey Center on Taiwan people about their
national identity since 1995.</P>
      <P>The survey center said the first-stage change in national
identification took place in 1996, when the first popular
presidential election was held.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1996, those who identified themselves as Taiwanese and
Chinese each accounted for 30 percent, but after 1996, nearly half of
the people identified themselves as Taiwanese, far outnumbering those
who identified themselves as Chinese.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, after the 2000 presidential election, more
than 50 percent of the people tended to identify themselves as
Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>After the DPP proposed the crafting of a new constitution in
September 2003 to drum up support for the 2004 presidential election,
the number of those who identified themselves as Taiwanese climbed to
over 60 percent, the ratio of those who identified with Chinese had
been kept at between 18 and 20 percent.
Those who identified with both was cut below 15 percent.</P>
      <P>These figures showed drastic changes each time during 
the presidential elections, especially after the 1996 presidential
election, according to the Survey Center.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Moves to topple the Cabinet must be taken at
the most opportune time; otherwise, they could be a disservice to the
opposition and the entire country, the main opposition Kuomintang's
legislative whip said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung made the remarks after some leading figures of a
so-called anti-corruption campaign to pressure President Chen
Shui-bian to resign over corruption allegations announced earlier in
the day that they would force opposition parties to come up with a
no-confidence vote against the Cabinet if the motion to recall the
embattled president fails again in the Legislative Yuan Oct. 13.</P>
      <P>In addition to threatening to launch initiatives to recall
lawmakers from Chen's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over their
boycott of the presidential recall motion, the anti-Chen activists
also threatened to unveil for "public censure" the names of
opposition lawmakers who decline to endorse the "topple the Cabinet"
proposal.</P>
      <P>Responding to the anti-Chen protesters' pitch for using a
no-confidence vote against the Cabinet as a way to keep heat on Chen,
Tsai said "toppling the Cabinet" has always been one of the KMT's
options to unseat the president.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, the initiative to topple the Cabinet must be
planned and carried out prudently; otherwise, a rash action with
regard to that end could boomerang," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Since Shih Ming-teh, the top leader of the so-called
anti-corruption campaign, has repeatedly said Chen's ouster is the
only goal of his current campaign, Tsai reminded Shih and his
followers that toppling the Cabinet does not logically related with
that goal.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Tsai warned that mounting a no-confidence vote
against the Cabinet at an inopportune time could end up allowing Chen
to expand his executive power.</P>
      <P>According to constitutional provisions, the premier can either
resign or ask the president to dissolve the Legislative Yuan if the
legislature passes a no-confidence against the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"If the president chooses to dissolve the legislature instead of
replacing a premier, the president could benefit from a snap
legislative election now that the redistricting of electoral
constituencies has yet to be finalized," Tsai contended.</P>
      <P>He urged the Shih-led anti-Chen protesters to remain rational and
refrain from taking reckless moves at this turbulent time.
"Otherwise, an immature 'toppling the Cabinet' move could backfire,"
he warned.</P>
      <P>In his view, Tsai said, a publicity campaign must be launched
first to help the public understand why the Cabinet should be
toppled. "Otherwise, we cannot win their support for such a drastic
move," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that
the threat by some radical opponents of President Chen Shui-bian to
push for recall of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers over their boycott of a motion to recall the embattled
president would only exacerbate social turmoil.</P>
      <P>Su was commenting on media reports that the so-called
anti-corruption campaign to pressure Chen to resign over corruption
allegations will launch drives to recall DPP lawmakers if a second
motion to recall Chen fails again in the Legislative Yuan Oct.13.</P>
      <P>By a vote of 106 to 82, the legislature agreed last Friday to
debate another opposition-backed motion to recall Chen. The main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has appealed to DPP lawmakers to back the
motion in order to give people a chance to be heard through the
ballot box. The KMT claimed that a national referendum would be the
most effective way to end three weeks of street demonstrations
calling for Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>As the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally -- the People First Party --
control only a slim majority in the 220-seat legislature, the second
recall motion, like the first attempt in June, will most likely fail
now that DPP lawmakers have resolved not to support such a drastic
move.</P>
      <P>Some leading figures of the so-called anti-corruption campaign to
unseat Chen have threatened to launch signature drives to push for
recall of DPP lawmakers after the Oct. 13 presidential recall vote in
order to keep pressure on Chen.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view on such drives, Premier Su said while
attending the inauguration of the campaign office of a DPP candidate
running in the year-end Taipei City council election that the moves
to recall DPP lawmakers over the presidential recall issue is
inappropriate and would only add up to social division and turmoil as
well as aggravate bitterness between rival political camps.</P>
      <P>"If radical anti-Chen protesters indeed launch moves to recall
DPP lawmakers after the presidential recall motion fails in the
legislature, such moves would be like 'throwing the baby out with the
bath water' and would do a disservice to out country as a whole, " Su
said.</P>
      <P>He also urged opposition lawmakers to stop any further action to
recall Chen now that the first attempt already failed.</P>
      <P>"The Constitution has set a strict threshold on the recall issue
out of concern of political stability. Against this backdrop, the
opposition should refrain from taking further furtile action with
regard to this issue to waste social and political costs," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Sunday, Oct. 8, or the 17th day of
the eighth month of the Year of the Dog according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1836: John Hay, U.S. statesman and diplomat, is born. As
secretary of state from 1898 to 1905, he promoted the "Open Door
Policy" toward China.

1858: The "Arrow Incident" occurs, in which a Hong
Kong-registered ship, the Arrow, is searched in Kwantung by Ching
soldiers and 12 of the vessel's sailors are arrested. The incident
led to an Anglo-French expedition against Peking and the burning of
the Imperial Summer Palace by invading troops.

1869: Franklin Pierce, 14th president of the United States, dies
at the age of 65. He was unable to reconcile the issue of slavery
that divided his country.

1895: Queen Min of Korea, who had tried to stem the tide of

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER WARNS AGAINST THREAT TO RECALL DPP LAWMAKERS(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that
the threat by some radical opponents of President Chen Shui-bian to
push for recall of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers over their boycott of a motion to recall the embattled
president would only exacerbate social turmoil.</P>
      <P>Su was commenting on media reports that the so-called
anti-corruption campaign to pressure Chen to resign over corruption
allegations will launch drives to recall DPP lawmakers if a second
motion to recall Chen fails again in the Legislative Yuan Oct.13.</P>
      <P>By a vote of 106 to 82, the legislature agreed last Friday to
debate another opposition-backed motion to recall Chen. The main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has appealed to DPP lawmakers to back the
motion in order to give people a chance to be heard through the
ballot box. The KMT claimed that a national referendum would be the
most effective way to end three weeks of street demonstrations
calling for Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>As the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally -- the People First Party --
control only a slim majority in the 220-seat legislature, the second
recall motion, like the first attempt in June, will most likely fail
now that DPP lawmakers have resolved not to support such a drastic
move.</P>
      <P>Some leading figures of the so-called anti-corruption campaign to
unseat Chen have threatened to launch signature drives to push for
recall of DPP lawmakers after the Oct. 13 presidential recall vote in
order to keep pressure on Chen.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view on such drives, Premier Su said while
attending the inauguration of the campaign office of a DPP candidate
running in the year-end Taipei City council election that the moves
to recall DPP lawmakers over the presidential recall issue is
inappropriate and would only add up to social division and turmoil as
well as aggravate bitterness between rival political camps.</P>
      <P>"If radical anti-Chen protesters indeed launch moves to recall
DPP lawmakers after the presidential recall motion fails in the
legislature, such moves would be like 'throwing the baby out with the
bath water' and would do a disservice to out country as a whole, " Su
said.</P>
      <P>He also urged opposition lawmakers to stop any further action to
recall Chen now that the first attempt already failed.</P>
      <P>"The Constitution has set a strict threshold on the recall issue
out of concern of political stability. Against this backdrop, the
opposition should refrain from taking further furtile action with
regard to this issue to waste social and political costs," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIMING CRUCIAL FOR OPPOSITION TO TOPPLE CABINET: KMT(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Moves to topple the Cabinet must be taken at
the most opportune time; otherwise, they could be a disservice to the
opposition and the entire country, the main opposition Kuomintang's
legislative whip said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung made the remarks after some leading figures of a
so-called anti-corruption campaign to pressure President Chen
Shui-bian to resign over corruption allegations announced earlier in
the day that they would force opposition parties to come up with a
no-confidence vote against the Cabinet if the motion to recall the
embattled president fails again in the Legislative Yuan Oct. 13.</P>
      <P>In addition to threatening to launch initiatives to recall
lawmakers from Chen's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over their
boycott of the presidential recall motion, the anti-Chen activists
also threatened to unveil for "public censure" the names of
opposition lawmakers who decline to endorse the "topple the Cabinet"
proposal.</P>
      <P>Responding to the anti-Chen protesters' pitch for using a
no-confidence vote against the Cabinet as a way to keep heat on Chen,
Tsai said "toppling the Cabinet" has always been one of the KMT's
options to unseat the president.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, the initiative to topple the Cabinet must be
planned and carried out prudently; otherwise, a rash action with
regard to that end could boomerang," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Since Shih Ming-teh, the top leader of the so-called
anti-corruption campaign, has repeatedly said Chen's ouster is the
only goal of his current campaign, Tsai reminded Shih and his
followers that toppling the Cabinet does not logically related with
that goal.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Tsai warned that mounting a no-confidence vote
against the Cabinet at an inopportune time could end up allowing Chen
to expand his executive power.</P>
      <P>According to constitutional provisions, the premier can either
resign or ask the president to dissolve the Legislative Yuan if the
legislature passes a no-confidence against the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"If the president chooses to dissolve the legislature instead of
replacing a premier, the president could benefit from a snap
legislative election now that the redistricting of electoral
constituencies has yet to be finalized," Tsai contended.</P>
      <P>He urged the Shih-led anti-Chen protesters to remain rational and
refrain from taking reckless moves at this turbulent time.
"Otherwise, an immature 'toppling the Cabinet' move could backfire,"
he warned.</P>
      <P>In his view, Tsai said, a publicity campaign must be launched
first to help the public understand why the Cabinet should be
toppled. "Otherwise, we cannot win their support for such a drastic
move," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YOUNG MAC VICE CHAIRMAN MOST INTERESTED IN GETTING THINGS DONE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new vice chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Sunday that he is more serious about
"getting things done" than being a Cabinet official.</P>
      <P>Chen-Yuan Tung, 37, the youngest ever MAC vice chairman -- a
status equivalent to a Cabinet vice minister -- said he devotes
himself to his job as the No. 1 right-hand man to MAC Chairman Joseph
Wu, Taiwan's top China policy planner, but that he cares relatively
less about "being an official."</P>
      <P>Tung, a China expert and Ph. D. degree holder from Johns Hopkins
University's School of Advanced International Studies who assumed his
current post in August, said he is resolved to serve the country and
people, particularly when the Democratic Progressive Party
administration is undergoing a most difficult time.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said Tung used to be his research partner
at the Institute of International Relations, National Chengchi
University.</P>
      <P>Wu said after working with Tung at the institute, he discovered
Tung possessed rich knowledge and shrewd insight about Chinese
politics and cross-Taiwan Strait relations; plus, Tung speaks fluent
English and had been a visiting scholar in China. These factors
prompted Wu to invite Tung to become his right-hand man at the
Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tung's friends said the soft-spoken Tung is always
gentle with others despite the fact his expertise and professionalism
may seem relatively daunting for his age.</P>
      <P>For his part, Tung said most of his time is divided between the
office and teaching, and that he regrets only being able to spend
"quality time" with his kids in his office on weekends.</P>
      <P>"Hiking with the family has been the most luxurious pastime for
me in recent years," he added.</P>
      <P>Tung said he cares least about how his career will unfold as a
public official or how long it will last, adding that teaching and
doing research as a political scientist are still his greatest
interests.</P>
      <P>"I will return to the campus completely when I feel it's the
right time," he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA ON FULL ALERT TO PREVENT BREAKUPS IN DIPLOMATIC TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With Double Ten National Day just around the
corner, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has been on high alert
to prevent any new breakups in diplomatic ties between Taiwan and its
allies, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>As China has been using every possible means to lure away
Taiwan's diplomatic partners -- mostly in Central and South America
and in Africa -- the MOFA has instructed its overseas outposts to
closely monitor developments in bilateral ties between Taiwan and its
host countries, especially as National Day is approaching, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks came after a local newspaper reported earlier the
same day that diplomatic links between Taiwan and various countries
have taken a more dangerous turn since late September, and that the
MOFA has ordered its embassies and overseas offices to stay on full
alert to fend off sudden changes in bilateral ties in the run-up to
Oct. 10 National Day.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, relations between Taiwan and its diplomatic
partners in Central and South America have remained normal despite
the fact the Costa Rican president and Guatemalan foreign minister
recently met with Chinese foreign minister Li Zhaoxing to discuss
Chinese exports to their countries during the latest U.N. general
assembly.</P>
      <P>Both governments of the two Central American countries have
explained the issue to Taiwan's ambassadors stationed there, Lu said,
adding that bilateral relations have remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>At present, cooperative projects between Taiwan and its
diplomatic allies have been proceeding well, and several new programs
will be launched in the near future, he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Taiwan-U.S. ties, Lu said that two-way
communications have been smooth and that the United States is very
aware that President Chen Shui-bian will be fully committed to
sticking to his "five-noes" policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAITRA TO INVITE AFRICAN BUSINESS LEADERS TO TAIWAN TO BOOST EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) has invited business leaders from Africa to visit
Taiwan next week to participate in a business workshop aimed at
boosting Taiwan investment in Africa and Taiwan exports to that part
of the world.</P>
      <P>The workshop, slated for Oct. 13 in Taipei under co-sponsorship
of TAITRA and the Africa Taiwan Economic Forum (ATEF), is expected to
bring together influential business leaders from South Africa,
Nigeria, Swaziland, Malawi, the Gambia, Burkina Faso and Sao Tome and
Principe, and provide Taiwan investors with tips about investing in
Africa. The business leaders will also be shopping around to
facilitate future imports from Taiwan, TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>TAITRA officials said Africa as a whole has become increasingly
attractive to world investors and business executives after countries
there underwent a series of reforms and business integration,
although it remains remote to most Taiwan companies.</P>
      <P>At the forthcoming workshop, they added, the African business
leaders will introduce the investment climate and industrial
development in these seven countries to help orient Taiwan business
leaders in terms of investing or conducting business in Africa.</P>
      <P>Each of the seven African countries offers opportunities for
trade and investment, with the combined population of 200 million
people providing a potentially lucrative market for Taiwan's
commerce, said an ATEF official.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's trade and investment relationship with Africa
is minute when compared with other regions in the world, the ATEF
official said, adding that ATEF was consequently established in
recent years to correct this imbalance.</P>
      <P>By co-sponsoring the Oct. 13 business workshop, ATEF intends to
offer a one-stop service to Taiwan's business community by providing
invaluable information on trade and investment opportunities
presented by these African countries, as well as guidance to
prospective investors and businesspeople who seek to expand their
interests in Africa.</P>
      <P>This applies particularly to identifying centers in Africa that
could serve as bases for the manufacturing industry, while putting to
use Taiwan's well-developed technological and international marketing
expertise, the ATEF official said.</P>
      <P>In general, TAITRA officials said, labor-intensive or
export-oriented manufacturing industries -- such as textile and
garment manufacturing, footwear production, wood processing and
canned food processing industries -- are suitable choices when Taiwan
businesses are planning investment in Africa.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they noted, the African business leaders are expected
to gain a better understanding of purchasing and importing products
made in Taiwan, including construction materials, information
technology (IT) and telecommunications products, textile machinery,
medical equipment, agricultural machinery, metal processing machines,
sewing machines and food or beverage processing machines.</P>

      <P>An AMiBA radio telescope array on
Mauna Loa in Hawaii is ready for operation, the nation's top research
institution Academia Sinica said Sunday.</P>
      <P>This is the completion of the first stage according to the
construction schedule. Next, Academia Sinica's Institute of
Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) plans to establish seven
interferometers by late 2006, and in the second stage the institute
will add another six units by 2007. The full capacity will be 19
units, which will be fulfilled after an evaluation of the
post-second-stage performance.</P>
      <P>AMiBA, which stands for "Array for Microwave Background
Anisotropy," is designed to measure the distribution of high red-shift
clusters of galaxies via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect. The results 
could help to better understand the primordial and early structure
of the universe.</P>
      <P>AMiBA is also able to observe the polarization properties of
the cosmic microwave background, which may be vital to revealing the
universe's ionization history, as well as the detection of gravity
waves.</P>
      <P>The institution's officials said because there is no suitable
site in Taiwan for the project -- which requires a higher atmospheric
transparency and minimum radio frequency interference -- they chose
to develop it in Hawaii, where ASIAA and the U.S. Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory have established and operated the
Submillimeter Array on 4,080-meter high Mauna Kea.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost 13 percent of homosexual college
students are suffering from severe depression and are three times
more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual counterparts,
according to a survey released by the Ministry of Education Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ko Hui-chen -- a member of the ministry's student affairs
committee -- and a group of graduate school students developed a
questionnaire and conducted the survey on over 4,900 college and
university students across Taiwan, with 1,353 valid samples collected
from male students and 1,303 from females.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 2,220 or 83.6 percent, said they are "absolutely
heterosexual;" 264 or 9.9 percent said they are "heterosexual most of
the time;" and 54 or two percent responded they are "bisexual."</P>
      <P>Those who claimed they are "homosexual most of the time" numbered
only 16, or 0.6 percent of all respondents, with 19 or 0.7 percent
saying they were "absolutely homosexual or lesbian, " and 39 or 1.5
percent uncertain about their sexual orientation.</P>
      <P>Ko said after analyzing the results, her team found that
homosexuals are much more likely to feel depressed or attempt
suicide, with 12.9 percent of homosexuals responding they were deeply
depressed, compared to 4.8 percent of heterosexuals.</P>
      <P>She noted that homosexual students are more emotionally disturbed
than heterosexuals and their self-evaluations are more likely to be
negative because they tend to experience greater pressures due to
their love life.</P>
      <P>Another finding was that people close to homosexuals, such as
family members and friends, and even homosexuals themselves, are less
likely to accept their own sexuality than heterosexuals.</P>
      <P>Ko said the Ministry of Education was trying to create a more
tolerant campus environment by offering more courses and
extracurricular activities to promote gender equality in hopes that
faculty members and students will not hang on to biases, stereotypes
or discrimination against gays and lesbians.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also devote more resources to helping students,
parents and faculties better understand the pressures faced by
homosexual students and the difficulties they may have in adapting.</P>
      <P>She suggested that homosexual students learn to be more
independent and persevering so they will not be easily discouraged by
other people's disapproval or negative attitudes.</P>
      <P>Besides advising homosexuals not to deny their orientation, she
also recommended they seek professional assistance to overcome any
tendency toward depression.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTRY OF JUSTICE CALLS FOR LAW AND ORDER ON NATIONAL DAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Sunday urged members
of the public intending to take part in a "siege" on the Presidential
Office on Double Ten National Day to conduct themselves in accordance
with the law and avoid any clashes with police or rival supporters of
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the call in a news release after the
anti-corruption campaign headquarters announced a day earlier details
of its plan to besiege the Presidential Office on National Day, in an
attempt to oust Chen over a spate of corruption scandals allegedly
involving himself, members of his family and close aides.</P>
      <P>The ministry has ordered all prosecutor's offices, investigative
authorities and police across Taiwan to step up security and
information gathering prior to Oct. 10 National Day to prevent any
contingencies during a celebration rally Tuesday, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Anyone who uses violence or tries to disrupt law enforcement
officers' performance of their duties will be severely punished in
compliance with the law, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, Taipei City Police Department Director Wang
Cho-chiun also called on anti-corruption protesters to act based on
their promises of "love, peace and non-violence" when participating
in the National Day siege.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the siege activity is unlawful as it failed to
gain approval from Taipei police authorities and that law enforcement
must not be challenged, Wang vowed to apprehend people who break the
law so that law and order will be maintained that day in the streets
of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wang also asked all policemen on duty to maintain neutral when
securing public order on National Day.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the Taipei City Policy Department,
some 5,000 policemen will be deployed to maintain law and order in
Taipei on Oct. 10 and to tackle any riots that may arise from the
"siege." </P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who has led the nationwide anti-corruption
campaign against Chen, told a news conference later the same day that
campaign supporters would stop their continuous protests -- begun
since Sept. 9 -- as long as DPP lawmakers vote in favor of a motion
to recall Chen, initiated by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Should the presidential recall motion be approved by over
two-thirds of the lawmakers, it will allow the people to decide
Chen's fate in a referendum, Shih said, adding that anti-corruption
supporters would be willing under such circumstances to put an end to
their month-long protests.</P>
      <P>If DPP legislators refuse to vote in favor of the presidential
recall motion so as to allow the people to exercise their
constitutional right to recall the president, the anti-corruption
campaign headquarters in turn will launch a drive to recall DPP
lawmakers starting Oct. 10, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In response to Shih's remarks, DPP legislative caucus whip Yeh
Yi-jin claimed that holding a referendum to serve that end would only
cause greater social unrest.</P>
      <P>According to DPP lawmaker Cheng Yun-peng, they will certainly not
support the second presidential recall motion put forward by the
pan-blues in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"It is unnecessary to waste NT$1.2 billion on a public
referendum," he claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE FACE OFF OVER PRESIDENTIAL RECALL MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday it opposes holding a
national referendum on whether to recall President Chen Shui-bian,
but the opposition "pan-blue alliance" claimed this is the only way
to break the current political gridlock.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the DPP and the alliance's Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (PFP) gave their respective reasons for
and against a legislative vote Oct. 13 on whether to give the people
a chance to decide Chen's political fate, in response to former DPP
Chairman Shih Ming-teh's pledge to end his "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign if the legislature approves a PFP-proposed
motion to recall the president.</P>
      <P>The motion, if approved by a two-thirds vote in the Legislative
Yuan, would authorize the government to hold a national referendum on
recalling the scandal-ridden president. If over 50 percent or more of
voters vote "yes" in the referendum, it would force Chen to step
down.</P>
      <P>However, without a substantial number of "defecting" votes from
the DPP caucus' 88 members, the PFP motion is unlikely to pass the
221-member legislature.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, secretary-general of the DPP caucus, said holding
such a referendum would only create social turmoil.</P>
      <P>"Shih is only voicing his personal views, " she said, reiterating
her caucus' opposition to the PFP motion.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yun-peng, a caucus member, said if the DPP wanted to recall
the president, it might as well ask the president to step down
without having to waste NT$2 billion to hold a national referendum.</P>
      <P>As for Shih's demand on DPP lawmakers to "give the people a
chance to express their views through a referendum, " Cheng said Shih
need not "intimidate" DPP legislators like a gangster.</P>
      <P>Shih has threatened to kick off a campaign to recall DPP
lawmakers who oppose Chen's recall.</P>
      <P>Cheng suggested that Shih return to the campus to study basic
political science so he will realize that an "exit" from his own
anti-Chen campaign simply does not exist.</P>
      <P>Wang Shih-chien, another DPP legislator, ridiculed Shih for
contradicting himself. Shih vowed he would not "exit" until Chen
steps down, but now he is saying he can quit if the DPP caucus gives
the green light for the recall motion, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Shih's proposal to recall DPP lawmakers is not
legitimate and will not be supported by the people.</P>
      <P>Both KMT and PFP caucuses challenged the DPP to "dare to give the
people a say, " claiming that passing the recall motion in the
legislature does not mean Shih's "exit" from his campaign but rather
means "the public's entry" into the picture.</P>
      <P>KMT and PFP caucus leaders said they will get their members onto
the floor of the legislature Oct. 13 to ensure each of them casts a
"yes" vote on the FPF motion, and as a show of respect for the
people's right to decide the president's fate.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, a PFP spokesman, said allowing the people to vote
on the president's future is the "most peaceful and quickest way" to
break the political impasse.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP thinks only a minority of people want to depose the
president, then it should not be afraid of a public vote," Lee added.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-chen, a KMT spokesman, said holding a referendum would
be an efficient way of solving Taiwan's political deadlock and "the
right thing to do" in a democracy.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , the DPP's ally in the
"pan-green camp" which has been standing on the sidelines over the
recall issue, said if Shih and his "red army" keep creating
disturbances in society, it might consider standing on the side of
the DPP.</P>
      <P>Liao Pen-yen, convener of the TSU's legislative caucus, said his
caucus initially wanted to abstain from the legislative vote. If the
"red army" -- referring to the red clothes of Shih's supporters --
continues to disrupt social order in Taiwan, Liao said his caucus may
change its mind and cast a "no" vote.</P>

      <P>A singing competition for the country's

for the purpose of giving locals a glimpse into the cultures
immigrants have brought to this island.</P>

      <P>Tseng Chao-yuan, the president of the Awakening Foundation

Southeast Asia has become the leading source of Taiwan's immigrants,
accounting for 500,000 of them.</P>
      <P>These immigrants, mostly women married to Taiwanese or workers
brought in by local firms, have added valuable elements to the local
culture, Tseng said. 
Generally, a country receiving immigrants would like
to see the newcomers assimilate into local society by learning
the local language and culture as quickly as possible, Tseng said. </P>
      <P>That trend runs against a diversification of cultures and
society, Tseng claimed, adding that her group would like to see the

    <HEADLINE>CPC POISED TO BID FOR NEW CRUDE MINES IN LIBYA AND OTHER COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) is preparing to bid around the world for the ownership of crude
mines in order to secure sufficient and steady oil supplies for
Taiwan consumers, a CPC source said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Among countries such as Australia, Venezuela, Libya, Indonesia
and Angola, where CPC has actively prepared for bidding, Libya has
made such efforts a top priority and a CPC tender may be submitted
for a Libyan crude mine area this December if the company okays the
move in the next two months, the CPC official said.</P>
      <P>CPC -- Taiwan's major oil refiner, supplier and distributor --
currently owns and operates four crude mines in Indonesia, Ecuador
and Venezuela, where commercial production of crude oil has already
begun.</P>
      <P>These CPC-contracted or operated crude mines have actually
contributed significantly toward its revenues. Of the company's
annual business profits totaling NT$9.599 billion (US$292 million) in
2005, some 33 percent came from its overseas oil-drilling operations,
the CPC official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said, CPC has also been exploring or
tapping potential new crude mines in Australia, Venezuela, the United
States and Chad in a bid to secure more crude supplies from around
the world, particularly at a time when oil prices have spiraled
upwards since late last year.</P>
      <P>According to CPC authorities, the state-owned company would
invest at least NT$16 billion (US$487.8 million) in the following
five years to facilitate its overseas oil-drilling operations.</P>
      <P>Although international oil prices have fallen in the past two
weeks, the world should ready itself for an era of high oil prices in
the long run, the CPC official said, adding that the company's move
to secure steady supplies of crude oil by controlling crude drilling
operations overseas will remain one of its top corporate policies.</P>

      <P>To unite behind the government would be the
best way for Taiwan people to ward off China's possible invasion, a
former defense chief of Japan said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tokuichiro Tamazawa, the former defense minister of Japan who is
visiting Taipei as a member of the Japan-ROC Diet Members'
Consultative Council said in a public speech that people's
determination to defend their county is the best weapon to deter any
outside attackers.</P>
      <P>Although some people in Taiwan believe that Japan and the United
States would come to their defense in case of the country coming
under the military attack from China, Tamazawa quoted former U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage as telling him that
Washington is under no obligation to protect Taiwan despite the
Taiwan Relations Act requiring it to help Taiwan to defend itself.</P>
      <P>As a democracy, both Japan and the United States have to follow
its domestic legal process in sending military for overseas
operations, that means it will take some time even if they want to
help Taiwan in its war against China.</P>
      <P>He suggested people on the island to united together in the face

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO HELP TRAIN HI-TECH TALENT FOR GAMBIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has decided to help Gambia nurture
high-tech specialists to pave the way for the African country to
establish its own "Silicon Valley, " an academic source said Monday.</P>
      <P>Under financial support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) , the National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT) will be
sponsoring the program starting next August by offering four-year
university education to 25 Gambian citizens.</P>
      <P>NTUT President Tsu-tian Lee, who visited Gambia during the
summer, said Gambian President Yahya Alphonse Jamus Jebulai Jammeh
had told him that he keenly hopes the Gambian people can establish a
"Silicon Valley" by 2020, a goal which has made the nurturing of
high-tech talent imperative.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the Gambian president told him that Taiwan is
one of the world's leaders in high technology and related industries
and is always ready to help and that he is grateful that the MOFA and
NTUT are devoted to sponsoring an exclusive information technology
class for Gambian students to help Gambia realize its dream.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the English IT class exclusively
designed and reserved for Gambian students, they will also be able to
take other NTUT classes, such as electronic engineering, electrical
engineering and optoelectronics, as elective courses, Lee said.</P>
      <P>NTUT has since 2004 helped Gambia nurture specialists in crude
oil exploration and other areas of the petroleum industry by offering
four-year university education to 25 Gambian citizens, also under the
co-auspices of the MOFA.</P>
      <P>The West African country of Gambia, formerly a British colony,
possesses huge deposits of crude oil in its offshore areas.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the Gambian government has attached great
importance to Gambian students' receiving education in Taiwan, as do
the MOFA and NTUT.</P>
      <P>Lee said he led a 30-member group of NTUT faculty and students to
accompany these Gambian students home in July for the summer break.
Many of the Gambian students are members of the royal family or
children of business magnates.</P>
      <P>During that visit, Lee said, President Jammeh asked Vice
President Isatou Njie-Saidy to decorate him as a token of
appreciation for NTUT's efforts in the academic exchange program.
Njie-Saidy even entertained Lee and the NTUT group at his ranch.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, most of these Gambian students can now speak
Mandarin Chinese and some can even speak the Taiwanese dialect,
although the IT class is taught in English.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
said it is "not healthy" for the supporters of an ongoing campaign to
take to the streets to pressure Chen Shui-bian to resign over
corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general to the president, made the
remarks in an interview with U.S.-based Bloomberg Television, which
aired the 10-minute interview Sunday night.</P>
      <P>On the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign launched by
former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh,
Chen said the Taiwan people should have faith in the judicial system,
noting that a spate of corruption allegations implicating the
president, his family members and senior aides are now being
investigated.</P>
      <P>He noted that the "anti-Chen" campaign undermines Taiwan's
democratic system, saying that the public should have faith in
Taiwan's democracy and that the nation will continue to pursue the
path of democracy.</P>
      <P>Their act is a challenge to the judicial system and shows no
respect for the rule of law, he said, adding that it is not a
healthy approach.</P>
      <P>He also said that political unrest won't hurt Taiwan's economy,
pointing out that although it might have a minor effect on it,
overall, Taiwan's economy is sound. He added that since the campaign
started Sept. 9, there has not been any marked decline in foreign
investment, and the stock market has been performing well.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should have no problem achieving economic growth of 4.2
percent for this year, he said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the ruling DPP is cautiously optimistic about
winning the year-end mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung. He
further said that the Taipei mayoral race will be more difficult,
adding that he is confident the party will retain its hold on the
Kaohsiung mayorship.</P>

      <P>A number of supermarket chains in Taiwan
announced Monday that they have not imported nor sold possibly
tainted green-leaf lettuce from the United States, while some chains
said they are checking whether they have stocked these suspected
imports.</P>
      <P>The supermarkets RT Mart, Costco Wholesale and Shin Kong

from the United States.</P>
      <P>Several other chain stores, including Carrefour, Hypermart and

has been imported from the U.S. state of California.</P>
      <P>The California-based grower Nunes Co. Inc. recalled its

company said the lettuce does not appear to have caused any

      <P>The lettuce scare comes only weeks after tainted spinach from the

      <P>Four supermarkets in Taiwan that had imported fresh spinach from

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is still assessing
whether to take part in Oct. 10 National Day celebrations in view of
a planned siege targeting him, Presidential Office officials said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen will make public his decision as soon as he has made it, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported that same day that Chen will not
decide whether or not to attend the celebrations until Tuesday
morning, pending the scale of the siege to be staged by supporters of
an anti-corruption campaign demanding Chen's resignation over a
series of corruption scandals linked to himself, members of his
family and close aides.</P>
      <P>The campaign led by Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has called on 2 million people to
participate in the siege in an attempt to force Chen to step down.</P>
      <P>The anti-graft campaign headquarters have promised Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who heads a preparatory committee in
charge of National Day celebrations activities, that they will stick
to a "love, peace and non-violence" principle when leading protesters
to stage the siege in streets adjacent to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>It was reported that the campaign headquarters might consider
staging a sit-in on the spot on National Day if Chen continues to
refuse to respond to strong calls for his resignation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Su Tseng-chang said that he will lead all
Cabinet officials to attend National Day celebrations activities on
the occasion of the nation's 95th birthday.</P>
      <P>Su called for law and order and expressed his hope that all
national day celebrations will proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference later the same day, Shih vowed to
take all legal responsibility if "any contingency" breaks out during
the National Day celebrations, but he urged the public nevertheless
to "bravely" stand up and take part in the siege.</P>
      <P>Shih also praised Wang for his moral strength and political
wisdom for his guts in brushing aside pressure from the Presidential
Office and the National Security Bureau to put off the celebrations
out of grave concern that "unexpected incidents" may arise from
the siege.</P>
      <P>He also called on military and police on duty Oct. 10 to maint
ain neutrality, and urged the Ministry of Justice and the National
Police Agency not to use force to deal with protesting crowds,
claiming that they are people committed to peace even in
demonstrations.</P>

      <P>Taipei's international electronics show may
be held in China or India next year in order to help Taiwan
businesses tap into those markets, Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) Chairman C.J. Hsu announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks at the opening ceremony for the 32th Taipei
International Electronics Autumn Show (TAITRONICS AUTUMN 2006) being
held at Taipei World Trade Center. The five-day electronics
exhibition has been jointly organized by TAITRA and the Taiwan
Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association (TEEMA).</P>
      <P>In view of the warm response to a Taipei international
electronics show held for the first time outside Taiwan in Bangkok in
July, Hsu said TAITRA and TEEMA are considering holding similar
electronics shows in China and India next year.</P>
      <P>However, as Chinese authorities have not been active in
interacting with TAITRA, the possible Taipei international
electronics exhibition in China might use the names of TEEMA and the
Taipei World Trade Center to "prevent any obstacles, " TEEMA Chairman
Hsu Sheng-hsiung said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government originally planned to negotiate with
Beijing via TAITRA over the island's agricultural exports to China,
but it has yet to receive any positive response from the Chinese
side.</P>
      <P>At the TAITRONICS AUTUMN 2006, more than 1,100 manufacturers are
taking part, showcasing a wide variety of electrical and electronic
products, including telecommunications and satellite devices,
computer peripherals, audio and video apparatus, as well as
automobile electronics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>North Korea's nuclear test heralds a new "age of
uncertainty" in which China's and South Korea's foreign policies will
face acid tests, a financial services company said Monday.</P>
      <P>Citigroup Global Markets Inc. said that when North Korea
announced last week that it would conduct a test of nuclear weapons,
the financial markets responded with calm, thinking Pyongyang was
repeating its "push the envelope to the edge" strategy aimed at
expanding its leverage for negotiations.</P>
      <P>Most of the market watchers thought that there was little
likelihood North Korea would go ahead with its plan to test nuclear
devices, according to Citigroup Global.</P>
      <P>Pyongyang's announcement that it had finished testing caught the
market off guard, particularly in light of a joint statement by China
and Japan warning North Korea against such testing.</P>
      <P>The nuclear test challenges China and North Korea's "blood
alliance" forged during the 1950s, according to Citigroup Global.</P>
      <P>North Korea's test of nuclear weapons will have an impact on the
global financial market, because the end of its "edge" strategy means
it will have no other strategies and that South Korea's sunshine
policy has failed, it added.</P>
      <P>Also worth watching is whether the latest incident will lead to
an arms race in North Asia, said Citigroup Global.</P>

      <P>There is no timetable for lifting a ban on

Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Tung-ming, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Food

a fresh assessment will help lift the ban.</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that the DOH has held eight meetings to screen
Canadian beef imports. In September, the National Health Research

Canadian beef.</P>

information of its cases of mad cow disease before a final decision
can be made.</P>
      <P>Hsiao also said that in addition to Canada, the Netherlands and
Japan have also applied to export beef to Taiwan and that the DOH
will screen their applications on a case by case basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA SPOKESMAN REFLECTS ON A DIPLOMATIC LIFEBy Deborah KuoCNA staff reporter</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>He is a very youthful 59. But the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman was not just active and energetic
as a young man, he is as kind as a "next-door uncle," always ready to
help.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu has demonstrated the personality traits of a warm,
hardworking and optimistic Taiwanese, totally revitalizing the image
of the Foreign Ministry in over two years of working as a MOFA
spokesman.</P>
      <P>Lu probably has what some people might think is one of the most
difficult jobs in the world being the spokesman for Taiwan's Foreign
Ministry, which faces daunting difficulties in the diplomatic arena
due to the situations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu, however, approaches his job seriously but with great
confidence, saying often that "with diplomatic situations like
Taiwan's, all of the MOFA jobs are understandably tough, but I always
believe that we will achieve our goals eventually as long as we try
hard enough."</P>
      <P>His powers of patience and endurance are fully demonstrated in
his relations with the media. In addition to answering questions from
reporters at regular news conferences, Lu keeps his cell phone on
around the clock to enable him to respond to inquires. He once
repeated his answer 20 times to 20 similar questions on one identical
issue without allowing any trace of irritation to show.</P>
      <P>Lu studied French literature and language at Tamkang University
before entering the Foreign Ministry in 1976. He obtained a doctorate
from the University of Paris VII in 1988 when he was serving as an
officer of the Republic of China diplomatic mission there.</P>
      <P>He spent 18 out of his 30 years as a MOFA staffer overseas.
During that time, he was twice assigned to France, twice assigned to 
Haiti, and once each to the Netherlands and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>He describes his assignation as ROC ambassador to Haiti in 2000
soon after the Democratic Progressive Party took the power as
"unforgettable." Back then, Haiti was socially and politically
chaotic, but Lu managed to do his job efficiently.</P>
      <P>During his two terms as ROC ambassador to Haiti, Lu earned the
full trust and friendship of then-Haitian President Jean-Betrand
Aristide. According to media reports, at one point Lu was
unexpectedly reassigned back to Taipei, whereupon Aristide sat
"transfixed" for 10 minutes upon hearing the news of Lu's imminent
departure.</P>
      <P>Aristide hosted a party in person to bid farewell to Lu.</P>
      <P>As a diplomat of Taiwan -- an "orphan" in the international
diplomatic arena -- you have to have a unique strategy working in
foreign countries that maintain no formal diplomatic relations with
Taiwan, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>Lu said, for example, that he was not allowed to take part in
nation-to-nation activities where statehood was required when he was
posted in Geneva.</P>
      <P>As the inaugural director of the preparatory office of Taiwan's
representative office to be established in Geneva, Lu created his own
strategy of approach -- he grasped every possible opportunity to take
part in seminars or workshops that did not stipulate the requirement
of statehood, using a business card carrying his photo with an
ear-to-ear smile. It worked perfectly.</P>
      <P>Lu recalled that once when he was posted in France, he went to
help and console an elderly man from Taiwan, a tourist who had lost
his passport but spoke no French or English.</P>
      <P>Lu helped the fellow obtain temporary travel papers so that he
could depart France for home with his tour group. Upon departure, the

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT COMMITTED TO REDUCING DIGITAL GAP: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To effectively bridge the digital gap
between Taiwan's urban and rural areas, the government has allocated
NT$2.72 billion for the 2005-2008 period, a spokesman for the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the program will be carried out among
the Ministry of Education, the Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission, the Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Environmental
Protection Administration in the coming years. Some 300 digital
opportunity centers will be eventually opened in 168 remote villages
and townships under the program to provide local residents with
e-learning and related applications, he said.</P>
      <P>With successive openings of 50 digital opportunity centers around
Taiwan -- mainly scattered throughout Changhua, Yunlin, Chiayi,
Pingtung and Penghu counties in central and southern Taiwan, as well
as among aboriginal tribal areas in mountainous regions -- the
government hopes to better reduce the digital gap between urban and
rural areas, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>So far, the combined number of visits by users to these digital
opportunity centers has exceeded 32,300 nationwide, he noted.</P>
      <P>The CEPD official said that the digital center program will
effectively help sharpen the country's competitive edge in the
"computerized" 21st Century.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey conducted by the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, Taichung City, Taipei City and
Hsinchu City have the highest percentages of local population ever to
have used a computer, while Chiayi County, Yunlin County and Penghu
County have the lowest.</P>
      <P>In terms of the ratio of each city's or county's Internet users,
Taichung City, Taipei City and Hsinchu City take the lead with
percentages of over 70 percent, well ahead of the last three --
Chiayi County, Penghu County and Yunlin County -- all of which
register levels below 50 percent, according to the survey results.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
watching closely and gaining further understanding of the nuclear
test North Korea reportedly conducted early Monday morning, an MND
spokesman said later in the day.</P>
      <P>It is believed that Pyongyang's underground nuclear testing was
probably aimed at exerting fresh pressure on Washington and Seoul, as
North Korea had claimed it was goaded into nuclear tests by what it
considers a U.S. threat of nuclear war and economic sanctions, said
MND spokesman Wu Chi-fang.</P>
      <P>The tests conducted by the reclusive Stalinist state have
certainly triggered new concerns in Northeast Asia that are worthy of
extra attention, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wu noted, however, that Taiwan still considers China as its
pseudo-enemy requiring first-grade attention.</P>
      <P>The South Korean government confirmed around noon that day that
North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test at 10:35 a.m.
Korean time Monday, a test that Pyongyang announced last week would
take place at an unspecified time.</P>

      <P>A Thai laborer working in Taiwan has been
sentenced to 15 years in jail by the Taiwan High Court for stabbing
to death his Filipina ex-girlfriend, court officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to court documents, Pradit Chokchai became acquainted
with a woman identified by the officials only as "Evelyn" from
the Philippines in 2004 at an electronic company in Tucheng, Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>The couple's romance has been interrupted after Pradit

Taiwan after being employed by another Taiwanese company located in
Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan, but Pradit refused to accept
rejection and began threatening the woman.</P>

Evelyn with a fruit knife more than 10 times in a frenzied attack

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's itinerary will
not be affected by organizers of an ongoing campaign to launch a
"besiege the Presidential Office" plan on Oct. 10 National Day
celebration ceremony, the Presidential Office claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>The office made the statement in a press release in response to
media reports that the president will wait until he sees how many
red-clad supporters of the "Million Voices Against Corruption" show
up Tuesday before deciding whether to attend the National Day
celebration ceremony, held every year at the square in front of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The protesters, led by former Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Shih Ming-teh, are set to "besiege" the Presidential Office
in a bid to step up pressure on the embattled president to step down
over a spate of corruption allegations against him, members of his
family and close aides.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office press release said the "decision on the
president's itinerary will by no means be affected" but did not say
whether the president will attend the celebration ceremony.</P>
      <P>Reports said that the National Security Bureau has three
contingency plans: the president will not attend; the president will
attend but only to greet the participants; and the president will
attend and deliver his customary speech.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, chief
organizer of the National Day celebration ceremony, said that
legislators of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) had promised that
they will not disrupt the ceremony should Chen address the
participants in the rally.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that he cannot restrict the legislators of the
opposition "plan-blue alliance" of the KMT and its ally, the People
First Party, from donning red clothes, which have become a symbol of
"anti-Chen" campaign, to express their sentiments.</P>
      <P>But he expressed the hope that they would not "go too far."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said she will pledge on behalf of
other KMT legislators that they will give due respect during the
addresses of Chen and Wang.</P>
      <P>She said they will not use "exaggerated hand signs or chant
slogans" against the president, but will respect the "dignity and
peace" of the ceremony.</P>
      <P>But once the ceremony is over, the KMT legislators will join the
siege, Hung said.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun said that PFP Chairman James Soong
will lead party legislators to depart from the Legislative Yuan
Tuesday at 8 a.m. and that he might also deliver a speech.</P>
      <P>The measures the PFP take will be in line with the "anti-Chen"
campaign, Lee said, although he declined to disclose them.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hopes a fresh assessment will help
lift its ban on Canadian beef imports, President Chen Shui-bian said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received a group of
Canadian parliamentarians at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan used to be the fifth-largest market for Canadian
beef, with annual beef exports to Taiwan totaling more than C$20
million (around US$17.86 million).</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned Canadian beef after Canada reported a mad cow
disease case in May 2003.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the Department of Health has convened meetings on
the matter several times and that the National Health Research
Institute made a favorable assessment report on the risks of eating
Canadian beef.</P>
      <P>He expressed appreciation for Canada's support for Taiwan's bid
to join the World Health Organization and for its concern about
cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>He also said that substantive relations between the two nations
are close, with more than 100,000 Taiwan tourists going to Canada
annually. </P>
      <P>If the Canadian government would grant Taiwan tourists visa-free
treatment, it would help attract even more Taiwan tourists, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Currently, around 15,000 Taiwan students are pursuing advanced
studies in Canada, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to educational exchanges, the two countries are also
working on several technical cooperation agreements, Chen said,
adding that both countries could make further progress in customs,
tax and health areas, especially in the signing of a mutual judicial
assistance agreement.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan International Electronics Autumn
Show, the largest electronic trade show in Asia, has transformed into
a showcase of the island's latest electronic technologies, organizers
said Monday.</P>
      <P>In its 33rd year, the "Taitronics Autumn" is spotlighting what
the electrical and electronic industries -- two of Taiwan's most
competitive sectors -- have to offer in digital, wireless, and green
technology from Oct. 9- 13 at the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC).</P>
      <P>Organizers have set up eight themed pavilions along with a
cross-strait section. More than 1,100 local and foreign manufacturers
are participating in the five-day event and setting up more than
2,600 booths. Organizers estimate the number of participants will
exceed 60,000.</P>
      <P>Farglory Realty, a Taiwanese realty company, demonstrated the
"future digital home" while Shin Kong Security presented the digital

    <HEADLINE>FATE OF MAJOR BILLS UNCERTAIN AS ANTI-CORRUPTION CAMPAIGN LINGERSBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> Several major bills are facing an uncertain fate on the
legislative floor as the political atmosphere has been soured by a
"Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign calling on
scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian to step down -- a fierce
battle in which the anti-Chen opposition is pitted against the
pro-Chen ruling party.</P>
      <P>Buoyed by the campaign's mass sit-in and march against the
president that began Sept. 9, the opposition parties launched a new
presidential recall motion right after the Legislative Yuan
reconvened Sept. 19, and are poised to file a no-confidence motion
against the premier if the recall motion fails to gain approval.</P>
      <P>In spite of the political turmoil, Premier Su Tseng-chang has
asked his Cabinet to put forward 78 priority bills, including
sunshine laws and a proposal to set up an anti-corruption agency in
response to a popular demand for a clean and competent government.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties also proposed their version of
clean-government laws and an anti-corruption agency, but used their
numerical advantage to block the government's defense investment bill
and refused to screen nominations for Control Yuan members as well as
for prosecutor general.</P>
      <P>This means that even though there have been "convergences" in
both sides' legislation proposals, there are as yet no signs the
stand-off is finally approaching an end.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) central policy committee, said President Chen
claimed he would respect the opposition by renominating Control Yuan
members, but has failed to act on his word.</P>
      <P>The same "bad faith" argument could be detected in the
government's refusal to withdraw its bill requesting a NT$610.8
billion budget to purchase key weapons, he said.</P>
      <P>"We've refused to screen the president's nominations for Control
Yuan members and the Cabinet's new budget proposal on arms purchases
because we found procedural problems concerning these two issues, "
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Ko Chien-ming, convener of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) legislative caucus, blamed KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
for worsening the ruling-opposition stand-off because none of the
major bills have been passed since he took over the party's helm last
year.</P>
      <P>In a show of teeth for teeth, the DPP initiated a proposal to
hold a national referendum on the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets, a
proposal that was being handled by the Central Election Commission.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers focused their attacks on Keelung Mayor Hsu Tsai-li,
who has been sentenced to seven years behind bars after being
convicted on corruption charges, stressing Ma's efforts to help Hsu
win re-election and questioning the KMT's qualification in demanding
Chen's ouster.</P>
      <P>As ruling and opposition parties have refused to compromise on
the legislation agenda, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's efforts
to seek a common ground have gone nowhere. The anti-corruption
campaign's rallies and sit-ins have made it even more difficult for
political parties to reach an agreement on legislating any major
government initiatives.</P>
      <P>Another primary tool for the opposition to check and balance the
government was its 2007 budget bill. Huang Yi-chiao, Tseng's
counterpart at the PFP, said the opposition parties will have to
watch more closely how the government plans to spend taxpayer money
in the aftermath of a controversy over the president's use of a
special "state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, when Chen was sitting in the
Presidential Office, the legislature has been dominated by the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and PFP, who have joined together in
frustrating the Chen administration's attempts to pass major bills.</P>
      <P>With another election campaign heating up and new confrontations
created by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh's campaign to depose the
president, relations between ruling and opposition parties have
become even more tense than before and chances for passing major
government bills have grown ever dimmer.</P>

A year ago, it took 20 to 30 craftsmen to put

Over the course of about eight days, separate

Then, inspired by car maker Toyota Motor Corp.

    <HEADLINE>FULL TEXT OF PRESIDENT CHEN'S NATIONAL DAY ADDRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, facing a "Besiege
the Presidential Office" campaign to pressure him to resign over
alleged corrpution scandals, said Tuesday he has always striven for
clean politics.</P>
      <P>"I myself have always insisted on clean politics, " Chen told
government officials, parliamentarians and representatives from all
walks of life while presiding over a ceremony marking the country's
Double Ten National Day inside the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>As the president, Chen went on, he must safeguard the
constitutional system and maintain national stability.</P>
      <P>"It's my inescapable duty and also the demand of the people, "
Chen said, suggesting that he will complete his remaining 19 months
in office.</P>
      <P>The following is the full text of the president's National Day
Address:</P>
      <P>Distinguished Guests, Fellow Citizens, Colleagues, Ladies and
Gentlemen:</P>
      <P>Happy Double Tenth and greetings to you all!</P>
      <P>Today marks the 95th National Day of the Republic of China
(Taiwan) . With reverent yet joyous hearts, we are gathered here to
welcome and celebrate this glorious day and to wish our nation a
happy birthday.</P>
      <P>In the past few months, I have had opportunities to pay visits to
local communities in order to come into direct, intimate contact with
this land, and to listen to people's truest voice. Whether it was
having a friendly chat with elderly farmers out in the fields or
under a tree, or showing my concern for elderly people and children
living on offshore islands or in remote villages without families to
care for them, or engaging in discussions with small and medium-sized
business operators in industrial zones, I have learned that although
the issues they were concerned about may have differed, they were of
one heart in wishing the best for Taiwan. They wished Taiwan the best
not only with respect to furthering its presently enjoyed freedom,
democracy, peace, and prosperity, but also with regard to
safeguarding the right of its 23 million people to be the masters of
their own destiny.</P>
      <P>According to the Freedom in the World 2006 report recently
published by Freedom House, in the two main categories of political
rights and civil liberties, Taiwan is a "free" country on a par with
the United States and Japan, and in the subcategory of freedom of
speech and religion, Taiwan received the highest possible score. This
great honor is the result of the long-term striving and struggling of
Taiwan's people, and is the most precious asset Taiwan has for
asserting its place in the international community.</P>
      <P>Under the authoritarian system of the past, not only were the
people deprived of freedom of speech, but freedom of the press was
also subjected to tight control and oppression. During the three
years following the lifting of martial law, from 1988 to 1990, the
number of politically related magazines and books that were banned
and confiscated came to 284,243 copies. During the martial law era,
the number of publications banned and confiscated by the Taiwan
Garrison Command of course exceeded this amount by many hundreds of
times.</P>
      <P>This government, therefore, has always striven to maintain an
ever forbearing attitude with respect to the freedoms of speech, the
press, publication, and assembly in hopes of liberating Taiwan's
people from the spiritual shackles that have bound them. The
government has done so not only to enable the people to dare to
speak, but to ensure the protection of every person's right to truly
speak his or her mind and express views different from those of
others.</P>
      <P>In the past, there was no freedom, so we struggled to get
freedom. In the past, we were oppressed by the political system, so
we opposed the system. But today's Taiwan is a democratic nation.
Besides seeking freedom, we must also consolidate the rule of law,
accept the responsibilities associated with that, and work together
to sustain our system of democratic, constitutional government.
Political disagreements or disputes should be handled in accordance
with constitutional procedures and the provisions of laws. In cases
that involve judicial action, the judiciary's independence in
conducting investigations and trials must be respected. This is both
a basic tenet of democracy as well as its core value.</P>
      <P>While others may advocate resorting to mechanisms that circumvent
the political system or transcend the constitution in order to
further their political goals, the President is bound by his office
to uphold the Constitution. Defending the Constitutional system and
maintaining the stability of the nation and society are duties that
the President cannot shirk. They are also the strictest demands
placed upon him by the people.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan abhor corruption, and I myself have stood
firm against corruption throughout my entire political career. When I
served as Taipei City mayor, I was never soft on corruption, but
dealt with such cases strictly and swiftly. Since becoming President,
I have remained determined to do so. Anyone who transgresses the law,
regardless of his or her social status or relationship with me, is
subject to the strictest application of the nation's legal sanctions.
For all people are equal before the law, and the President and the
President's family members are no exceptions.</P>
      <P>Corruption is a matter for the judiciary to deal with, and the
judicial system places emphasis on evidence and due process. I am
certain that the vast majority of the people, while adamant in
demanding that corruption be curbed, do not endorse trials by public
opinion based on tabloid reportage. Those who hold high expectations
of anti-corruption efforts should place their confidence in the
judicial system, trust the judicial system, and support the judicial
system, allowing it the space to conduct investigations and trials
independently. The judicial system is the final line of defense in
protecting social fairness and justice. To lightly dismiss or be
suspicious of the judiciary merely because its findings and verdicts
do not turn out as one had hoped--this would be the greatest insult
and injury to the democratic rule of law.</P>
      <P>A motion to recall the President will soon be voted on in the
Legislative Yuan--the third time such action has been taken since I
took office as President. This is the latest episode in what has been
a vicious rivalry between political parties ever since the
alternation of political power between parties in 2000. Over the past
six years, political chaos and turmoil have continued unabated.
Besides indicating that the ruling and opposition parties have not
grown accustomed to the reversal of roles, these ongoing problems
reveal that Taiwan is facing predicaments similar to those faced by
other new democracies during the transition from authoritarian rule
to democracy. These difficulties include the realization of
transitional justice, vicious political rivalries, the choice between
constitutional systems, and the clashing senses of national identity.
These predicaments continually challenge and test the wisdom and
ability of political leaders, while at the same time trying the
people's faith in and commitment to freedom, democracy, fairness and
justice, and human rights.</P>
      <P>History shows that the injuries, rifts, confrontations, and
suspicions caused by authoritarian rule will not automatically
disappear with the passage of time. Like the newly matured butterfly
that must struggle to break out of its cocoon, we must struggle to
shake off longstanding fetters in order to free ourselves and emerge
from our democratic metamorphosis.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan marches toward becoming a normal democratic country, we
cannot neglect or try to escape the need to re-evaluate our past
history. Whether with respect to assigning responsibility for harm
caused during the authoritarian era, continuing to dismantle the
party-state system, enhancing the quality of the multiparty political
system, or rehabilitating the legitimacy and reasonability of the
constitutional system, our society needs to undertake deeper
reflection on and assessment of these issues. By no means is this an
attempt to settle old scores or stir up hatred. Only by bravely
facing up to the past will we truly be able to soothe our injuries,
bridge the rifts between us, and mark past episodes with a decisive
period, so that we can begin to write a new chapter.</P>
      <P>If we are to achieve reconciliation, forgiveness, and justice,
the truth has to be told. That is why, over the past six years, the
government has declassified and made public secret documents related
to major political cases in Taiwan's history, such as the February 28
Incident, the Kaohsiung Incident, and the Lei Jhen case. In the past
two months, at my instruction, the Ministry of National Defense has
gone a step further, declassifying remaining documents of 73 files
concerning prominent political cases, as well as 424 confidential
dossiers of other cases, including those involving Chen Yi and Henry
Liu. These documents are now placed in the care of the National
Archives Administration, and will be made public once that agency has
completed its collation work. These actions exemplify this
government's commitment to and efforts in pursuing transitional
justice.</P>
      <P>The pursuit of truth is bound to have repercussions on the unity
of a society. The handling the issue of divergent views of national
identity may exacerbate inter-ethnic tensions, or even intensify the
atmosphere of confrontation in the debate over unification versus
independence. In a constitutional democracy, the room for a diversity
of opinion and advocacy is fully guaranteed by the constitution.
Nonetheless, when divisions over national identity begin to severely
undermine efforts to strengthen national defense, bolster national
security, develop the economy, and promote trade, it then becomes
imperative to reflect very seriously on contradictions that exist
between national identity and democratic values.</P>
      <P>While divergent views of national identity can co-exist, the
nation must not be allowed to break apart. Regardless of whether one
arrived, or one's ancestors arrived, in Taiwan before or after 1949,
and regardless of whether one is a recent immigrant or child of a
recent immigrant, everyone who has come to this land to start a new
life is a member of our big family, even though we may have differing
ideals or sentiments for our original homelands. As the children of
an oceanic nation, let us open our hearts to each other, put
ourselves in each other's shoes and support each other. Let us
transform identities based on ethnicity, bloodline, and historical
sentiment into an identity based on the universal values of freedom,
democracy, human rights, and peace. And let us thereby mold a new
sense of national community that can be shared by the 23 million
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By the same token, while divergent views of national identity can
co-exist, the government cannot be allowed to keep spinning its
wheels and going nowhere. There is no cure-all to remedy the growing
pains experienced by all emerging democracies, including Taiwan, and
we are still in the process of learning as we go. Time will not stop
its steady march for us, however. In the face of the increasingly
fierce competition accompanying globalization, we cannot afford to
let political turmoil continue to undermine our national
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Democracy is Taiwan's defining value, and economic development is
our lifeline. In July of this year, prior to the opening of the
Executive Yuan's Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's Economic
Development, I identified four concrete benchmarks that can be used
to evaluate the success of the government in facilitating the
sustainable development of Taiwan's economy: increasing investment in
Taiwan, creating job opportunities, lessening disparities between
rural and urban areas, and narrowing gaps between the rich and the
poor. Moreover, these four benchmarks, or principles of development,
have been, and will continue to be, this government's core ideals and
goals in drawing up administrative policies.</P>
      <P>With regard to increasing investment in Taiwan, development of
the Central Taiwan Science Park, from the commencement of planning to
the launching of construction, was accomplished in just ten months
and five days. Although the park has been under development for only
three years, it is already home to 83 businesses, which have brought
in investment worth some NT$1.6 trillion. The park provides 11,000
jobs and will create 50,000 in the future. It not only has enabled
Taiwan to maintain its leading position in the global flat-panel
industry, but has also breathed new life into the development of the
entire central Taiwan region.</P>
      <P>As for traditional industries, the "006688 Program", which offers
land-leasing incentives in industrial zones, was introduced in 2001.
As of the end of June this year, the government had approved the
applications of 730 businesses, generating investment of NT$282.5
billion and a production value of NT$453.6 billion, while creating
51,000 new job opportunities. On this foundation, the Executive Yuan
also formulated the so-called "Big Investment Plan", which includes a
scheme aimed at helping county and city governments attract
investment by granting lease exemptions to businesses renting
government-owned land for the first four years and 50-percent
exemptions for the following six years. Under the plan, the
government will also make available 1,000 hectares of land belonging
to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for use by businesses and developers;
will extend and expand the scope of Phase II of the "006688 Program";
will largely increase the Small and Medium Business Credit Guarantee
Fund within three years; and will assist small and medium-sized
enterprises in obtaining loans of over NT$1.6 trillion. These efforts
will create a sound investment environment that helps keep businesses
in Taiwan and stimulates national development as a whole.</P>
      <P>As for creating employment opportunities, Taiwan's unemployment
rate in August of this year was 4.09 percent, which was the lowest
level for that month in the past six years. The average unemployment
rate from January to August was 3.92 percent, still within the target
range of less than 4 percent. Although the unemployment rate in
August was only 0.2 percent lower than the same month last year,
fluctuations in the labor market mean that, in reality, 198,000 more
people were employed in August 2006 than in August 2005. Employment
conditions will definitely see a significant improvement with the
implementation of the "Big Investment Plan". Moreover, in
coordination with planning to ensure the sustainable development of
Taiwan's economy and related human-resource demands, the government
will need to re-examine the status of technical and vocational
education and increase investment in this sector of the education
system in order to strengthen and refine the quality of teaching.
This constitutes a critical aspect in the endeavor to achieve
across-the-board improvement in the capabilities of Taiwan's
workforce.</P>
      <P>With regard to lessening the disparities between urban and rural
areas, the newly opened Taipei-Yilan Expressway, and the High Speed
Rail soon to begin operations, will transform the northeastern and
western regions of the island into a unified living space in which
people can commute anywhere within a day's time. This will bring
about a revolution in spatial freedom and spur the development of new
communities. It will also highlight the imperative to improve
transportation in the areas of Hualien and Taitung counties in the
east. It is incumbent upon the government to promote an express
transportation system of highways and railways in eastern Taiwan, if
environmental impact assessments reveal that we have no cause for
concern and that the region's scenic beauty is not unduly affected by
such development.</P>
      <P>All citizens, especially our children--regardless of whether they
live on Taiwan proper or its offshore islands, in special
municipalities or other areas--should enjoy equality in terms of the
quality of education, cultural activities, medical care, and public
facilities available to them. We must bring to an end the
longstanding and erroneous policy of "favoring the north, neglecting
the south, forgetting the center, and ignoring the east." We must
strive to achieve a balance in the revenues and expenditures of local
governments, so that the nation's resources may be utilized more
fairly and effectively.</P>
      <P>As for narrowing income inequality, while it is inevitable that
in a market economy some will lag behind others, it is the
government's responsibility to exert itself to prevent individual
misfortune from accumulating to the point of national catastrophe.
Although Taiwan has become a genuinely free and democratic country,
we have not done enough to utilize our collective strength to ensure
that individuals can maintain a basic standard of living, to build a
comprehensive social security system, and to provide adequate care
for an aging population. We must do more to ensure that such
obligations to promote human welfare are fulfilled. Concerning these
deficiencies, the government has made great efforts over the past six
years to establish a social security system. These include welfare
allowances for the elderly, increased stipends for elderly farmers,
partial or complete subsidization of medical treatment for children
under the age of three, and the implementation of a new pension
system for workers.</P>
      <P>We have yet to introduce a national pension that will provide for
those without any form of retirement protection when they reach old
age, particularly for homemakers who devote their lives to caring for
their families. Such a national pension will become the third pillar
of Taiwan's social security system, the first two being the national
health insurance program and workers' pension program. The importance
of the national pension goes without saying. It is to be hoped,
therefore, that, by 2007, the Executive Yuan will be able to surmount
all difficulties in pushing through and implementing legislation in
support of the consensuses relating to this national pension system
that were reached during July's Conference on Sustaining Taiwan's
Economic Development--and simultaneously transform the existing labor
insurance system's stipends for the elderly into a regular pension
system.</P>
      <P>As an oceanic island nation, Taiwan's potential for national
development can be cultivated only through external economic and
trade links and international cooperation. Sound self-defense
capabilities, a stable international environment, and peace in the
Taiwan Strait are the essential foundations on which Taiwan will be
able to ensure its survival and steadily pursue its development.</P>
      <P>There has been no large-scale military conflict in the Taiwan
Strait for almost fifty years now. The all-important turning point
was Taiwan's victory in the 1958 Battle of the Taiwan Strait, which
allowed Taiwan to fend off danger, ensure peace, and lay the
foundation for its future survival and development. We must never
forget that bloody lesson: A robust national defense capability is
our only shield and our only assurance of securing lasting peace.</P>
      <P>Until this very day, however, China has never renounced its
objective of annexing Taiwan by force. In recent years, it has
ceaselessly deployed ballistic missiles along its southeast coast
targeted at Taiwan. There are more than 800 such missiles at present,
which is four times the number in 2000. China also continues to
augment training and preparations to launch a war against Taiwan,
scheming to utilize military intimidation and threats to achieve its
goal of forcing Taiwan to surrender without having to fire a shot.</P>
      <P>Here, once again, I earnestly call upon the opposition parties to
expedite and complete their reviews of all major military procurement
bills so that the nation's armed forces can finish upgrading their
armaments and enhance their combat preparedness as soon as possible.
Moreover, only by doing so will we have the substantive power and
bargaining chips needed to engage in consultations and dialogues with
China. Our investment in national defense is intended neither to
spark an arms race with China nor to aggravate cross-strait tensions.
Rather, it is an investment in peace, security, and stability. Only
by possessing a strong self-defense capability can the outbreak of
war effectively be prevented, and lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait
be achieved.</P>
      <P>In recent years, China has continually resorted to dollar
diplomacy and money politics to squeeze and limit Taiwan's
international space. In face of this new challenge and condition,
Taiwan is not willing, nor has it the need, to engage in a foreign
aid contest. We need new ideas and approaches, and must make
democracy, human rights, and humanitarian concerns as the basis of
our future diplomatic efforts. In addition to consolidating our
diplomatic allies, we should take further steps to establish a
values-based alliance with the global community of democracies.
Further, we should utilize multilateral cooperation mechanisms, such
as summits with the leaders of our diplomatic allies in Latin
America, Oceania, and Africa, as well as through the Democratic
Pacific Union (DPU) to deepen Taiwan's bilateral relations with each
of its allies. Programs designed to promote mutually profitable trade
and enhance humanitarian assistance can also help us succeed in
creating reciprocal regional advantages and shared prosperity.
Thereby, Taiwan will be able to play a more positive, constructive
role in the international community, and to open up new diplomatic
vistas more energetically.</P>
      <P>As to the development of cross-strait relations, this surely
cannot be confined to the mere interactions within the narrow
framework of Taiwan-China relations. We must broaden our scope of
action and expand our field of vision to the comprehensive level of
the evolution of international political and economic dynamics.</P>
      <P>Following upon the success of its policy of economic reform and
opening up to the outside world, China's overall national power,
especially its military power, has grown rapidly, giving rise to
widespread misgivings in the international community. Although
Beijing has repeatedly claimed that this process is a "peaceful
emergence," most nations of the world perceive it as a threat.</P>
      <P>Without democracy, there is hardly any prospect of peace. China
is a totalitarian state that persists in its hostility toward
freedom, democracy, and human rights. As long as China fails to
democratize, the basic nature of this threat will never change, and
relations between China and the world, including Taiwan, cannot
possibly be normalized.</P>
      <P>No matter how lively the economic and trade relations and the
movements of peoples are between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
as long as China continues to be ruled by a one-party dictatorship,
the obstacles and barriers standing between the two sides can never
be eliminated, and it will be extremely difficult to achieve any
genuine, significant breakthrough in the basic nature of cross-Strait
relations. Constructing a meaningful, substantive relationship will
be possible only if China's leaders adopt the universal values of
freedom, democracy, human rights, and peace to create a language
shared by both sides of the Strait and, based on this language,
cooperate in developing a framework of interactions for peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>My dear fellow citizens:</P>
      <P>Lately, we have been paying a great deal of attention to the
performances of Taiwan's baseball players Wang Chien-ming and Kuo
Hong-chih in the U.S. Major Leagues. The joy and pride that comes
from watching the outstanding performances of these "sons of Taiwan"
are beyond the power of words to express. Every step of the way in a
ball player's career--moving up from the minor leagues to the major
leagues and going on to become a pitching champion--represents the
honing of ball-playing skills that take him to a higher plane of
performance. At the same time, however, each step implies taking on
an even tougher, more acute challenge.</P>
      <P>Hasn't this been the story of Taiwan's development during the
past half-century? Its movement from authoritarianism to democracy,
and its upstream struggle to transform itself from an insular,
withdrawn "orphan of Asia" into an outward-looking "world island"
that has turned its vision to the ocean and the world beyond--these
developments likewise were self-tempering, self-improving processes.
Today, similarly, we must prepare ourselves to meet even more
demanding challenges.</P>
      <P>From the examples of Wang Chien-ming and Kuo Hong-chih, we can
see that success does not come by chance. The difficulties and
miseries they have suffered remain in the background, unseen by
others. This is especially true of the times when they were injured,
underwent surgery, and endured a long period of rehabilitation. Such
struggles have made their ensuing success all the more precious.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the democracy that Taiwan enjoys today was hard-won by
dint of the blood, sweat, and tears of preceding and present
generations. It is so very precious! Aware of the injuries and
defeats we have suffered on the road to democracy, mindful of how
heart-rending they were--we must cherish everything we have today
with the desire to protect it as we would a fragile object. We must
do our utmost to protect Taiwan and safeguard our democracy, freedom,
peace, and prosperity. Under no circumstance can we allow it to
suffer any harm.</P>
      <P>Every hand that I have shaken over the course of my political
career has been a source of wisdom and strength for me. Every cry of
"Go, Taiwan!" and "Stand up, Taiwan!" has been the greatest motivator
for me to forge ahead. How fortunate it was for this child of a
tenant farmer in the Tainan countryside to become the first president
following Taiwan's first-ever transfer of power between political
parties. Four years later, the great people of Taiwan gave me another
chance to lead them toward the promised land. I am willing to
dedicate my life to bearing the cross for Taiwan. No matter how much
more the pain, how difficult the tests, and how formidable the trials
are, I am willing to shoulder this responsibility. May Heaven give us
the wisdom and strength to fulfill this great historic mission.</P>
      <P>At this moment, the people of Taiwan need to feel safe and
secure, the society needs stability, and the governing and opposition
parties need to cooperate with each other, so that our country can
have hope and Taiwan can have a future. I sincerely call on all our
fellow citizens to put aside partisan differences, join hands for the
sake of our country, work hard for our people, rise above color-coded
confrontation, and revive social harmony and warmth. Let us enable
Taiwan to shine forth a rainbow splendor and create a new Taiwan
miracle.</P>
      <P>In closing, let me wish the Republic of China (Taiwan) a happy
birthday. May our great nation enjoy peace and everlasting
prosperity. To all of our distinguished guests, fellow citizens, and
colleagues, may you enjoy good health and success in all of your
endeavors. And may God bless Taiwan!
Thank you!</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
no major breakthrough in cross-strait relations will be possible as

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SUGGESTS NATIONAL DAY RALLY BE SCRAPPED FROM NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian suggested Tuesday
that the Double Ten National Day rally in front of the Presidential
Office be scrapped from next year.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the suggestion as he addressed the National
Day rally while opposition legislators sitting on the two sides of
the grand stands unfurled red banners and flashed 'thumbs down" signs
to show their support for an ongoing campaign to depose the embattled
president over a spate of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>The president said that there are many ways to celebrate a
National Day and that if the mobilization is compulsory and
participation is not voluntary, then the practice should cease to
exist.</P>
      <P>"With so many divergent views and so many unwilling rally
participants, " the president said, the National Day rally, a
remnant of the infamous martial law era, should be "reviewed at
once."</P>
      <P>The National Day rally has been held every year at the square in
front of the Presidential Office, except in 1999 when Taiwan was hit
by a devastating earthquake on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The president noted that many schools and groups had
unequivocally stated that they would not take part in the rally,
which he said was an "manifestation of freedom and democracy."</P>
      <P>The schools and groups had reportedly declined to participate in
the rally out of fear of possible clashes between the supporters and
opponents of President Chen as the ongoing "anti-Chen" campaign
called upon its red-clad supporters to come out to encircle the
Presidential Office on the National Day.</P>
      <P>"At least the public will not have to grudgingly attend the
National Day rally as they did over the past five decades, " the
president said, adding that a lot of people have bad memories of
being mobilized for the activity when they were students.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has moved from the authoritarian era to a democratic
one," he said, adding that student mobilization is the legacy of the
authoritarian era, which is "anachronistic, " and should be reviewed
and changed.</P>
      <P>He noted that Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, chief
organizer of the National Day celebration ceremony, and his staff had
made great efforts in preparing for the celebration and that their
efforts should not be brushed aside.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Brief scuffles broke out between
legislators from the ruling and opposition parties while President
Chen Shui-bian was addressing the National Day rally in front of the
Presidential Office Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally,
the People First Party (PFP) , acted to lend their support to an
ongoing campaign to pressure the embattled president to step down
over a spate of corruption allegations, but ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislators sitting next to them fired back.</P>
      <P>Red-clad opposition legislators were sitting on both sides of the
grandstand, separated completely by a large, white cotton curtain
from the main section where the president, Vice President Annette Lu,
and the heads of the Executive, Legislative, Judicial and Examination
yuans, as well as foreign dignitaries sat.</P>
      <P>The curtain was set up by the National Day Organizing Committee
in a move to avoid any embarrassment for the president during the big
event as the KMT and PFP legislators had said that they would show
their support for the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign,
which began a sit-in protest Sept. 9 to pressure Chen to step down.</P>
      <P>The campaign, led by former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh, called
upon its red-clad supporters to come out to encircle the Presidential
Office on the ROC National Day to step up pressure on Chen, who has
vowed to serve out his term which ends May 2008.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislators Lee Ching-hua and Chen Chao-jung and PFP
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, upset by the cotton curtain arrangement,
which completely blocked their view of the main section of the rally,
knocked on the curtain repeatedly even before President Chen began
his address.</P>
      <P>During Chen's address, opposition legislators continued to chant
"step down" slogans, unfurled "depose Chen" banners, and flashed the
"thumbs down" sign for several minutes.</P>
      <P>There actions triggered angry responses from DPP Legislators Lin
Kuo-Ching, Wang Shih-chien, Chiang Chao-yi, Lee Ming-hsien and Lu
Po-kee. Brief scuffles broke out between DPP lawmaker Lin and KMT
Legislators Lee Ching-hua and Feng Ting-kuo.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong led party legislators to leave the
grandstand abruptly during Chen's address, which caused nervousness
among security personnel.</P>
      <P>After Soong left the rally, he led the PFP lawmakers to one
entrance of the Presidential Office on Kueiyang Street, asking to
meet with President Chen.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office responded by sending Commissioner Han
Kuo-feng to meet Soong, who told Han that he wanted to protest the
absence of Republic of China national flags at the rally as well as
the president's suggestion that the National Day rally be scrapped
from next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR TAIWAN'S INCLUSION IN REGIONAL SECURITY MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the
international community to conduct a thorough review of the flaws and
deficiencies of the existing general security mechanism in East Asia,
which he claimed has never taken Taiwan into account.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call in his address to the ROC National Day rally
held in front of the Presidential Office to celebrate the 95th
birthday of the Republic of China. </P>
      <P>In the address, Chen strongly denounced North Korea's underground
nuclear test the previous day, describing it as a serious threat to
regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>At 10: 36 a.m. Monday, North Korea formally announced that it had
completed its first underground nuclear test. Chen called the test a
"malicious" move that goes against the international community's
all-out efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.</P>
      <P>He noted that it was the second time this year that Pyongyang has
threatened peace and stability in the region by flexing its military
muscles, following its test-firing of missiles into the Sea of Japan
in July.</P>
      <P>Chen said that despite the "six-party" diplomatic mechanism,
formed by North and South Korea, the United States, Japan, China and
Russia, and aimed at negotiating a resolution to the standoff in the
Korean Peninsula, progress has been limited because of Pyongyang's
strong resistance.</P>
      <P>He also noted that no such mechanism has ever been formed to deal
with the security issue involving the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
adding that Beijing has never given up the option of the use of
military force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Calling on the international community to pay as much attention
to issue of cross-strait security as it does to the Korean Peninsula,
the president suggested that Taiwan be brought into a regional
security system and mechanism in order to ensure stability and peace
in the whole Asia-Pacific region.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has targeted four rising
industries under its recently approved industrial development
package, with the goal of seeing their total production value reach
US$40 billion by 2009 and US$157 billion by 2015.</P>
      <P>The four rising stars are the wireless broadband industry, the
digital life industry, the health care industry and the "green" or
renewable energy industry, according to the package.</P>
      <P>On the development of the wireless broadband industry and related
services, the Cabinet's "M-Taiwan" project aims to promote the
establishment of wireless broadband networks, and the development of
various application plans and business models to provide a convenient
wireless networking service and environment for mobile phones, PDAs
and notebook computers. The industry's production value is expected
to reach US$4 billion by 2009.</P>
      <P>With regard to the digital life industry, the Cabinet will
encourage the development of digital families and smart spaces.
Methods to be employed include integrating homes and technological
applications, applying information technology in living, security,
energy conservation and health management, as well as developing
information applications and integration technologies, audio/video
technology and household automation technology. The industry's
production value is expected to total US$20 billion by 2009.</P>
      <P>In terms of the health care industry, targeted fields include
care services for senior citizens, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals
and health food, with the industry's production value expected to
reach US$10 billion by 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN'S CALL FOR 'NO MORE CELEBRATIONS' SHOWS HE'S UNFIT FOR JOB: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's call for "no
more National Day celebrations" shows he is no longer fit for the
job, the spokesman for the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-chen was commenting on Chen's proposal made during his
speech at the National Day rally Tuesday in front of the Presidential
Office, an event attended by foreign dignitaries, overseas
compatriots and leaders from various sectors of Taiwan's society.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chen had made the proposal while in his capacity as
the nation's top leader.</P>
      <P>"Was he forecasting that next year he will no longer be there so
it will be unnecessary to celebrate the nation's birthday? " Huang
said.</P>
      <P>Huang said it was "weird" that long, white draperies were hanging
on both sides of the platform to keep red-clad opposition legislators
out of the president's sight -- a "sad and shameful scene" for which
the KMT wants to protest on behalf of Taiwan's people, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the scandal-tainted president had made the
"biggest National Day joke ever" earlier during another speech inside
the Presidential Office, when he claimed he had always insisted on
cracking down on corrupt officials.</P>
      <P>The president has also shown himself to be a man "totally
incapable of examining his own behavior" by attributing the
legislature's recall motion against him to "political strife, " Huang
said.</P>
      <P>He claimed the scandal-ridden president was "hiding beneath the
umbrella of a Constitution" that he has always wanted to do away with
but was unable to.</P>
      <P>"And today, he was hiding behind the police cordons and white
draperies, a clear gesture that he wanted to hear neither the
people's angry calls [for him to step down] nor the legislators'
views expressed on behalf of their electorate," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Saddest of all is that most members of the ruling party chose to
stand on the side of their corrupt leader in spite of the public
outcry, he said.</P>
      <P>If the DPP keeps refusing to distance itself from the president,
insisting instead on "a race to the bottom," it will create a tragedy
for Taiwan's democracy, Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEEDS TO NURTURE MORE TALENT VERSED IN EUROPEAN AFFAIRS: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The importance of the European
Union to Taiwan has continued to increase, and Taiwan has to
nurture more talent in this regard, an official of Taiwan's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said here Monday.</P>
      <P>Winston Dang, DPP legislator and director of the DPP's
Department of International Affairs, made the remarks in an interview
with the CNA.</P>
      <P>Dang led 12 young DPP members to Geneva last Saturday as part of
a field training program to familiarize them with the European Union
and international affairs. The past three training camps were held in
Washington D.C., and this is the first time the training camp was
held in Europe.</P>
      <P>Over the past three days, Dang and the DPP members visited
Taiwan's representative offices to Switzerland as well as the World
Trade Organization to get a better understanding of the situation
concerning Taiwan's bid to gain entry into international
organizations and the challenges it faces. Taiwan entered into the
WTO in 2002.</P>
      <P>Dang noted that the European Union has continued to expand, with
its membership soon increase from 25 to 27 states. He added that its
stature and influence in the international community will also
increase, making the group more important to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Faced with the new situation, Dang said that the DPP has to
adjust its approach. The party has to step up the nurturing of talent
versed in international affairs, and it should list European affairs
and international organizations as the targets, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization and the
country's participation in the WTO are the focus of the training
course, he said, adding that they also held a seminar with young
leaders of the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland in Berne.</P>
      <P>Dang and the DPP members will proceed to Brussels, where the E.U.
headquarters are located, after concluding their visit in
Switzerland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office blasted Tuesday an
anti-corruption drive's "siege" launched on National Day by former
Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih Ming-teh against President
Chen Shui-bian, saying that the campaign's acts have damaged the
national image.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office made the comments in a press release
after National Day celebrations ended earlier the same day in the
square in front of the Presidential Office, in which hundreds of
thousands of protesters led by Shih filled streets adjacent to the
President Office demanding that scandal-tainted Chen step down.</P>
      <P>According to the Presidential Office, tussles, clashes and chaos
caused by red-clad protesters and opposition "pan-blue alliance"
lawmakers on the occasion have greatly hurt Taiwan's national image.
It also criticized protesters who shouted and gestured at foreign
dignities attending the rally as "extremely uncouth, " and denounced
the disrespectful conduct as having destroyed the solemnity of the
National Day rally.</P>
      <P>The unlawful siege also caused great inconvenience to shops,
hospitals, traffic and residents' everyday life in that neighborhood,
it added.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption campaign headquarters must take full
responsibility for its irresponsible "stakeout" strategy and for all
contingencies taking place during National Day celebrations, the
Presidential Office said.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou also criticized the scattered violence
breaking out during the National Day rally.</P>
      <P>Asked whether or not he would order Taipei police to dislodge
protesters taking part in the siege after midnight, Ma said that "it
depends on the situation as there are too many protesters, " adding
that "dispelling them by force will lead to greater chaos."</P>

      <P>Nothing unusual has been found in radiation
levels around Taiwan since North Korea conducted an underground
nuclear test yesterday, the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pyongyang has claimed the test did not result in any radioactive
leaks while other media reports warned of a possible radiation leak
because the reclusive Communist country -- which has suffered from
constant poverty -- "does not have enough money to erect a proper
facility to shield off radiation" during nuclear testing.</P>
      <P>At all 23 radiation monitoring stations around the island, there
have been no abnormal changes detected, nor anything unusual found in
more sophisticated analyses of air samples, the AEC Radiation
Monitoring Center said.</P>
      <P>The South Korean government confirmed Monday that North Korea had
conducted an underground nuclear test earlier that day, a move
believed to be aimed at exerting fresh pressure on Washington and
Seoul. North Korea claimed it was goaded into nuclear tests by what
it considers the U.S. threat of nuclear war and economic sanctions.</P>

      <P>This year's Double Ten National Day has
turned out to be "a day of national shame" due to disturbances by
protesters and opposition "pan-blue" lawmakers, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Acts by red-clad protesters and lawmakers of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and People First Party (PFP) aiming to humiliate President Chen
Shui-bian during National Day celebrations have seriously hurt the
nation and its people, Yu told a news conference at the DPP

      <P>"Taiwan's people will certainly pass judgment on KMT Chairman Ma

National Day into a farce," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chen's remarks made earlier the same day in his
National Day speech suggesting that the National Day rally should not
be held next year, Yu said that the DPP will respect the decision by
authorities in charge of the issue.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung expressed sorrow and deplored
the way National Day celebrations have turned out, accusing the
red-clad protesters and their leaders of using every possible means
to oust Chen, whom they said must be held accountable for a series of
corruption scandals linked to himself, members of his family and
close aides.</P>
      <P>"This kind of approach has crippled the Republic of China as well

      <P>A soldier serving at the Taichung military

his family orchard in Chiayi, southern Taiwan, holding a list of six
soldiers in his hand, according to police.</P>
      <P>Kuo Jen-huang was a 19-year-old soldier from Chiayi County. His

service in the army, and whether his death was resulted from the
army's improper discipline needs further investigation by military
prosecuters, a police spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Kuo's family said Kuo had served in the army for four months and
was scheduled to return to camp after the holidays, but his family

dead in his family's orchard.</P>
      <P>His father added that Kuo had often complained about life in the

asked his family not to intervene again.</P>
      <P>Kuo's family said they hope military prosecuters will investigate

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Day celebrations are not an
issue per se, but the conduct of the president is, said a spokesman
Tuesday for the second largest opposition People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun said it is "beyond imagination" that the nation's
top leader would propose to have "no more National Day celebrations"
after red-clad protesters and lawmakers made a scene during his
National Day speech.</P>
      <P>A beleaguered President Chen Shui-bian remarked that since so
many participants of this year's National Day rally seemed so unhappy
about being there, he would suggest that such rallies not be staged
starting next year.</P>
      <P>Lee said over the past five years there have been no problems
with National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>"Today's protests and conflicts were caused by controversies
surrounding himself [Chen] and his family, " he said, adding that
instead of asking himself why people were demanding that he step
down, the president could just blame others for causing him the
trouble.</P>
      <P>If a president does not have the ability to reflect upon himself
and to accommodate different opinions, "how can he be a national
leader?" Lee argued.</P>
      <P>In response to a Presidential Office statement denouncing
supporters of an anti-corruption campaign for damaging the nation's
international image, Lee said the president and his family members'
suspected role in various corruption scandals have hurt the country's
reputation even more.</P>
      <P>Protesters shouting slogans and lawmakers' failure to honor the
rules of the celebration ceremony are "a minor matter compared to the
first family's suspected role in the alleged corruption cases" that
have seriously tarnished Taiwan's international image, he said.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP lawmaker, said the rally was sponsored by
the people, not the president, and whether to hold it next year is
not the president's decision to make.</P>
      <P>He demanded the president apologize for having made such an
unreasonable proposal.</P>

      <P>Organizers of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign announced Tuesday that they have given out all 1
million petition forms printed up for the recall of legislators from
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The activity was launched after the legislators expressed
opposition to a motion backed by the opposition People First Party
(PFP) and Kuomintang (KMT) to recall President Chen Shui-bian over a
string of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>Emile Sheng, deputy commander in chief of the campaign, said the
petition forms were picked up by the public within two hours of their
being made available that day and that the campaign is currently
preparing an additional 1 million forms.</P>
      <P>Sheng said it was not known how many of the forms had been
completed and turned in.</P>
      <P>However, the group will begin the next stage of action -- a
signature campaign -- as soon as the number of petitioners in any
constituency reaches the required threshold, he said.</P>
      <P>According the Public Officials Election and Recall Law, voters
can put forward a motion to recall their legislators if more than 2
percent of the eligible voters in the legislator's constituency
initiate such a petition and over 13 percent of them sign to endorse

      <P>A legislator will be removed from office if more than 50 percent
of the voters participate in the recall vote and more than 50 percent
of them vote in favor of the motion.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to review Wednesday and
Thursday a second motion put forth by the opposition to recall Chen.
The motion will be put to a vote Friday.</P>
      <P>The PFP and KMT last initiated a motion to recall Chen during a

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A report on the government's newest package
of projects aimed at boosting industrial development has estimated
that Taiwan's service industry is expected to create over NT$10
trillion-worth of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2009, when there
will be 6.32 million people serving in the sector.</P>
      <P>In the recently released report, the Executive Yuan expresses
great confidence in the future of the service sector. The report
notes that the service sector accounts for 73 percent of the nation's
industry, a level similar to that of an economically developed
country.</P>
      <P>According to the report, there were more than 5.79 million people
working in the service business in 2005, who created NT$8.2 trillion-
worth of GDP, representing productivity of over NT$1.41 million per
person.</P>
      <P>The goal will be achieved by making more effort to develop the
key sectors of finance, telecommunications, information services,
digitalized content, medical care and research and development, as
well as design and popular culture.</P>
      <P>At that point, the level of productivity will have been boosted
to NT$1.63 million per person, according to the report, which notes
that the largest production value was seen in the financial service
sector -- NT$1.2 trillion, which is expected to have increased to
NT$1.5 trillion by 2009.</P>
      <P>In the industrial package, the most attractive plans are those
for the development of tourism and popular culture, which demonstrate
the Executive Yuan's ambition to built Taiwan into a key tourist
destination in Asia.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Taiwan generated a total income of NT$356.1 billion from
tourism, attracting 3.37 million foreign visitors. The Executive Yuan
hopes the tourism income will have surged to NT$448.3 billion by 2009
while the number of foreign tourists will have increased to 5.2
million people per year.</P>
      <P>In the sector of popular culture, plans have been mapped out to
cultivate local talent in film-making, publishing and pop music as
part of efforts to encourage domestic consumption and create globally
recognized Taiwanese brand names, according to the industrial
development package.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged all those
who hold high expectations for anti-corruption efforts Tuesday to
place their confidence in the country's judicial system.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call in his annual Double Ten National Day address
delivered at a celebration ceremony held inside the Presidential

      <P>"When I served as Taipei mayor, I was never soft on corruption,

in demanding that corruption be curbed, do not endorse trials by
public opinion based on tabloid reportage. Those who hold high
expectations of anti-corruption efforts should place their confidence
in the judicial system, trust the judicial system, and support the
judicial system, allowing it the space to conduct investigations and
trials independently," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since the judicial system is the final line of defense in
protecting social fairness and justice, Chen said that lightly
dismissing or being suspicious of the judiciary merely because its
findings and verdicts do not turn out as one had hoped would be "the
greatest insult and injury to the democratic rule of law."</P>
      <P>Referring to the motion to recall him to be voted on in the
opposition-controlled legislature Oct. 13, Chen said: "In the past,
there was no freedom, so we struggled to get freedom. In the past, we
were oppressed by the political system, so we opposed the system. But
today's Taiwan is a democratic nation. Besides seeking freedom, we
must also consolidate the rule of law, accept the responsibilities
associated with that, and work together to sustain our system of
democratic, constitutional government."</P>
      <P>Stressing that political disagreements or disputes should be
handled in accordance with constitutional procedures and the
provisions of the law, Chen said that in cases involving judicial
action, the judiciary's independence in conducting investigations and
trials must be respected. "This is both a basic tenet of democracy as
well as its core value," he added.</P>
      <P>While others may advocate resorting to mechanisms that circumvent
the political system or transcend the Constitution in order to
further their political goals, Chen said that as president, he is
bound by his office to uphold the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen said defending the constitutional system and maintaining the
stability of the nation and society are duties that he cannot shirk
and "are also the strictest demands placed upon me by the
people."</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, Chen said, political chaos and turmoil
have continued unabated. Besides indicating that the ruling and
opposition parties have not grown accustomed to the reversal of
roles, Chen said these ongoing problems reveal that Taiwan is facing
predicaments similar to those faced by other new democracies during
the transition from authoritarian rule to democracy.</P>
      <P>"These difficulties include the realization of transitional
justice, vicious political rivalries, the choice between
constitutional systems and the clashing senses of national identity.
These predicaments continually challenge and test the wisdom and
ability of political leaders, while at the same time trying the
people's faith in and commitment to freedom, democracy, fairness and
justice, and human rights," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the conclusion of his speech, Chen said every hand he has
shaken over the course of his political career has been a source of
wisdom and strength for him and that every cry of "Go, Taiwan! " and
"Stand up, Taiwan!" has been the greatest motivator for him to forge
ahead.</P>
      <P>"I am willing to dedicate my life to bearing the cross for
Taiwan. No matter how much more the pain, how difficult the tests,
and how formidable the trials are, I am willing to shoulder this
responsibility. May Heaven give us the wisdom and strength to fulfill
this great historic mission," Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-GREENS' WILL NOT SCREEN SECOND PRESIDENTIAL RECALL MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Pan-green" lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) will not attend a legislative meeting to screen a motion to
recall President Chen Shui-bian, legislative caucus whips of the two
parties said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun, DPP
lawmakers will boycot the screening meetings Wednesday and Thursday
prior to a vote on the motion slated for Friday.</P>
      <P>The presidential recall motion -- the second of its kind
initiated by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) since late June -- is simply
political wrangling dreamed up by the pan-blues to create social
chaos, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen also criticized a siege called by former DPP Chairman Shih
Ming-teh against the president earlier in the day during a National
Day rally as "shameful, " saying that "irrational acts" by Shih's
red-clad supporters have severely hurt the nation's image and will
scare away foreign investors and intensify social confrontation.</P>
      <P>Calling for an end to a month-long series of street protests
launched by Shih aimed at ousting the president, the DPP lawmaker
said it is time to allow national mechanisms to deal with the
situation.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus whip Liao Pen-yen echoed Chen's view and
called the second presidential recall bid by "pan-blue" legislators a
"senseless" move intended to worsen the political situation.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmakers will not take part in the screening meetings in the
coming two days so as to allow the public to know better who are
actually the troublemakers in society, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the Presidential Office has "reversed
cause and effect" by blaming anti-corruption protesters for spoiling
the National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Ma was responding to a Presidential Office statement accusing
supporters of the "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign of
staging illegal demonstrations and tarnishing Taiwan's international
image.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that no public demonstration had ever taken place during
the National Day celebrations over the past 56 years. "If you just
blame the people without trying to understand why they are airing
their grievances, you are reversing the cause and effect," he added.</P>
      <P>If Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators could hurl
their disgruntlement at former President Chiang Ching-kuo, why cannot
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) lawmakers do the same
to President Chen Shui-bian? he asked.</P>
      <P>He said it is very clear that Shih Ming-teh, leader of the depose
the president campaign, is a former chairman of the DPP and not a
member of the KMT or the PFP.</P>
      <P>Although the two opposition "pan-blue alliance" parties have
launched a motion to recall the president in the legislature, many
campaign supporters who have taken to the streets to demand Chen's
ouster are not KMT or PFP members, Ma said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE HAVE LEGAL RIGHT TO RECALL LEGISLATORS: DPP MAYORAL CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan people have the legal right to
recall their legislators, former Premier Frank Hsieh, who is the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate in the
year-end Taipei mayoral election, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in response to an announcement earlier in
the day by organizers of an anti-graft campaign that they had
collected the required number of signatures for their petition to
initiate a recall motion against legislators in the Taipei City
constituencies.</P>
      <P>According to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law, voters
can put forward a motion to recall their legislators if more than 2
percent of the eligible voters in the legislator's constituency
initiate such a petition and over 13 percent of voters sign to
endorse the petition.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that although there are different views concerning the
"Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign organizers' move to
recall DPP legislators, the ruling party should refrain from reacting
to the move too strongly.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he urged the campaign organizers to ensure that
their campaign does not disrupt the daily lives of the residents of
Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Under the Public Officials Election and Recall Law, a legislator
will be removed from office if over half of eligible voters
participate in the recall vote and more than 50 percent of the
ballots cast are in favor of the recall.</P>
      <P>The "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign organizers said
the day before that they had handed out all 1 million petition forms
printed up for the move to recall DPP legislators from Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The activity was launched after the DPP legislators expressed
opposition to a motion backed by the opposition People First Party
(PFP) and Kuomintang (KMT) to recall President Chen Shui-bian over a
string of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to review Wednesday and
Thursday a second motion put forth by the opposition to recall Chen.
The motion will be put to a vote Friday.</P>
      <P>The PFP and KMT last initiated a motion to recall Chen during a
special legislative session held in June. The motion failed to obtain
the required support of two-thirds of all lawmakers for it to be put
to a national referendum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CONDEMNS DISTURBANCES AT NATIONAL DAY RALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang on Wednesday
condemned the disturbances caused by opposition politicians during
the National Day rally a day earlier, saying the incident has become
an "international joke."</P>
      <P>Su told a weekly Cabinet meeting that it is regrettable that
opposition legislators deliberately caused a disturbance at the most
serious and important moment of the rally just because of their
differences with the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Also, he continued, it was very disrespectful to the foreign
dignitaries and guests attending the ceremony that some participants
in an anti-corruption demonstration pounded on the windows of the
cars carrying them to the rally and attempted to block their way.</P>
      <P>Su said the incident has damaged Taiwan's international image as
a friendly country, and he ordered the Ministry of the Interior and
Ministry of Justice to bring anyone involved in the vandalism and
violence to justice.</P>
      <P>Led by opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong,
a group of legislators from the PFP and opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
disrupted President Chen Shui-bian's address Tuesday by chanting
"step down" slogans, unfurling "depose Chen" banners and flashing the
"thumbs down" sign at the National Day rally.</P>
      <P>The acts even led to brief scuffles with legislators from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party at the scene.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers made the move to lend support to the
"Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign, led by former DPP
Chairman Shih Ming-teh, which was holding a large-scale parade around
the city of Taipei on that day to step up pressure on Chen to resign
over a string of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the campaign organizers held the activity
without obtaining a permit from authorities and infringed upon the
rights of pedestrians and motorists in the city.</P>
      <P>Accusing Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of failing to fulfill his
promise to enforce the law properly by allowing the unlawful
demonstration to take place in the city, Su said Ma should have
requested assistance from the Cabinet to help maintain order in the
city.</P>
      <P>Su said that despite their political differences, the central and
local governments should cooperate for the sake of the best interests
of the country.</P>
      <P>While urging the Taipei City Government to take up its
responsibility to put an end to the chaos that has continued in the
city for more than a month, Su promised that the Cabinet will render
any necessary assistance to the city in this regard.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged all related
government agencies Wednesday to work together to "break the curse"
of the four-year cycle of dengue fever outbreaks in Taiwan. </P>
      <P>The premier made the call after listening to a report at the 
Executive Yuan by a central command center on Dengue fever control. </P>
      <P>Su noted that during the last dengue fever outbreak in 2002, more
than 5,000 people were infected and 21 people died. </P>
      <P>According to exports, outbreaks of the mosquito-born disease
occur in four-year cycles, so Taiwan is expected to be hit as the
last outbreak happened in 2002.</P>
      <P>He noted that more than 300 dengue fever cases have been reported
in Taiwan so far this year, adding that as the island has experienced
a lot of rainfall and a possible warm winter, the threat of a major
outbreak looms. </P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on media reports that the Shueishan Tunnel has shown
signs of water leakage in recent years, the premier said that the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications should form a team
comprised of experts to carry out an overall inspection of the tunnel
without hesitation. </P>
      <P>The 12.9-km Shueishan Tunnel, the centerpiece of the Peiyi
Freeway that links Nankang in the northern city of Taipei and Suao
in the northeastern county of Yilan, is the longest tunnel in
Southeast Asia and the fifth longest in the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOUBLE TEN CELEBRATION SCUFFLE 'CAUSED BY WHITE DRAPES': LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition People First Party (PFP)
lawmaker claimed Wednesday that long white drapes hung on the
platform for the National Day celebration served as a "fuse" that
ignited scuffles between opposition and ruling party lawmakers
a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun said he and other "pan-blue alliance" legislators
were disgruntled by the white drapes because they kept them from
seeing President Chen Shui-bian when he bowed to the portrait of Dr.
Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the Republic of China, and made his
National Day speech.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" was formed mainly by the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP, both of which attach great importance
to the legacy of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted PFP Chairman James Soong, who staged a tantrum from
his seat during the ceremony, as complaining that he had never seen a
ceremony platform arranged in that way. According to Chinese customs,
white drapes are used on sad occasions such as funerals.</P>
      <P>Lee said the PFP legislators initially planned to spread red
banners and beat at the white drapes to vent their anger, "without
shouting anti-Chen slogans or disrupting the celebration ceremony."</P>
      <P>As things turned out, PFP and KMT lawmakers chanted anti-Chen
slogans as they displayed banners calling on Chen to step down,
angering ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers sitting
nearby, who engaged their "pan-blue" colleagues in a fist fight and
kicking scuffle.</P>
      <P>Other "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers said they had not expected
that white drapes would be erected on the platform to separate them
from the president and vice president on the central podium.</P>
      <P>They all blamed the Presidential Office and the DPP for
"provoking a fight" by seating DPP lawmakers close to them.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who served as the National Day
rally organizer, said he had worked hard to reach a deal that was
acceptable to all sides and to calm them down.</P>
      <P>Since things had not turned out as peacefully as he would have
liked, Wang said he was willing to take all of the responsibility.</P>
      <P>Wang stressed that he had not promised "anything concrete" to
Presidential Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen. "Some KMT lawmakers had
pledged they would not make a scene during the ceremony and I wasn't
aware of the PFP lawmakers' plans," he said.</P>
      <P>Looking back on the unhappy happenings, Wang advised the
"pan-blue alliance" legislators to remember that "tranquility is the
greatest strength."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he suggested that the DPP look into "what
caused the KMT and PFP legislators to go out of their way to make a
scene" in front of the foreign guests at the country's birthday
party.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group petitioned the Ministry of
Justice Wednesday for the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>Chu Hai-yuan, convener of the Taiwan Alliance to End the Death
Penalty, said that only 22 countries in the world used the death
penalty in 2005, of which Taiwan was one.</P>
      <P>He said that since the government started to promote the
abolition of the death penalty in 2000, it has achieved some
effect, but not enough, as there is insufficient public support for
the motion.</P>
      <P>He claimed that countries that use "lack of public support" as an
excuse are mostly undemocratic countries.</P>
      <P>He admitted that according to a public poll conducted in June, 67
percent of the respondents were opposed to the abolition of the death
penalty and that only 21 percent of the respondents were in favor.</P>
      <P>If the death penalty were to be replaced by life imprisonment
without parole, 53 percent said they would agree to the arrangement,
compared with 44 percent who said they would not agree.</P>
      <P>He gave no further information on how the poll was conducted, by
whom, among whom, or the margin of error, but expressed the hope that
the Ministry of Justice will consider views from all sides in its
decision-making.</P>
      <P>Alliance officials noted that Taiwan has yet to conduct any
executions this year, making 2006 "the most successful year" since
the Democratic Progressive Party administration promoted the
abrogation of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The FIDH, an international human rights organization, and Amnesty
International, also wrote open letters to the Ministry of Justice
Oct. 9, the eve of the World Day Against the Death Penalty.</P>
      <P>The alliance brought with them 19 paper cranes, signifying 19
people on death row, imploring the ministry to spare their lives.</P>
      <P>Alliance members also walked around the ministry to highlight its
call to end the death penalty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang called for the
promotion of alternative fuels Wednesday, saying that it is
imperative that Taiwan strives to develop biofuels in the face of
diminishing energy resources as a result of past wasteful usage.</P>
      <P>Alternative fuels or biofuels should be developed and used in
order to secure Taiwan's sustainable development, Su noted.</P>
      <P>He made the call at an Executive Yuan meeting after hearing a
report provided by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on a green
energy development plan.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials reported at the meeting on a comprehensive plan on
the development of bioenergy and biofuels, a plan that would require
concerted efforts from the country's energy, agricultural,
environmental protection and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, biodiesel will first be used by public
buses in certain cities and counties starting later this month,
followed by a program under which one city and one county will have
gas stations where biodiesel will be available beginning next year.</P>
      <P>Biodiesel is diesel made of recycled waste animal fat or waste
vegetable oil via an esterification process, MOEA officials said. For
example, B1 diesel is a blend of 99 percent ordinary diesel and 1
percent biodiesel, they said. B1 diesel has higher performance
efficiency than ordinary diesel, but is cheaper and causes less
pollution, they added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the plan, some public office automobiles
will be using gasoline containing ethanol processed from starch or
cellulose beginning next year, while ethanol gasoline will be
available at some gas stations in Taipei City and Kaohsiung City by
2009, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>For example, they said, E3 gasoline is a blend of 97 percent
ordinary gas and 3 percent bio-ethanol.</P>

      <P>The ruling party should not be upset by the
protest that took place at the National Day rally because there is
nothing unusual for the head of state to be confronted by the people
in a democratic society, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) used to resort
to various street movements to fight for the country's democracy when
it was in the opposition, Ma said it is not right for the DPP to
"change its mind" after coming to power and put all the blame on the
opposition.</P>
      <P>Ma recalled that during a ceremony held Dec. 25, 1987 to
commemorate the implementation of the Constitution, then-DPP National
Assembly deputies Huang Chao-hui and Chou Ching-yu raised white
banners to protest to then-President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, such incidents are not unusual in a democratic
society and should not be considered a loss of face to the head of
state.</P>
      <P>Even U.S. President George W. Bush has faced protests by the

      <P>Lending support to the "Million Voices Against Corruption"

irregularities in the use of the president's state affairs fund will
do their jobs independently and will not be threatened or broach
interference by anyone, the Ministry of Justice stated Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued a statement in the wake of mass
demonstrations by supporters of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign calling on President Chen Shui-bian to step down
over a string of corruption allegations involving himself, his family
and close aides.</P>
      <P>In response to remarks by the campaign leader, former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh, that if the
prosecution concludes its investigation into the state affairs fund
case without charging any first family members he will lead a crowd
to "besiege the prosecution authorities, " the ministry said Shih had
made "extremely inappropriate remarks."</P>
      <P>Evidently, Shih's remarks were aimed at influencing and
threatening the independent exercise of the prosecution authorities,
said Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung.</P>
      <P>"We would like to reiterate that the exercise of the duties of
the prosecution authorities will not be interfered with by anyone --
it will be done independently and prosecutors will not be threatened
by anyone, " he said.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the prosecutors probing the insider trading in
Taiwan Development Corp. stocks as well as those in charge of the
Sogo Department Store vouchers case have become "criminals of
Taiwan's justice system" and if Chen Jui-jen, prosecutor in charge of
the state affairs fund case, becomes another "criminal, " he will
lead a crowd to "seize the prosecution office" so that Taiwan's
justice system "can work independently."</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-chung, media coordinator for the anti-graft campaign,
said that campaign leaders will not decide what to do next until they
have read Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen's indictment.</P>
      <P>Lee called on the people to abide by the law when they
participate in public protests and he promised that law-enforcement
officers will "strictly remain neutral" by protecting people's rights
to march and assemble and by punishing lawbreakers.</P>
      <P>He expressed regret that violent attacks took place during
Tuesday's street demonstrations and that social order was disrupted.
He said charges will be brought against individuals who have used
violence or disrupted public order.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education is slated to
earmark an additional NT$100 million (US$3.03 million) from its
budget next year to help elementary schools across Taiwan enrich
their library resources, a ministry spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Pan Wen-chung, director of the ministry's Elementary

amount earmarked by the ministry for this purpose next year to NT$150
million, representing the largest amount in recent years.</P>
      <P>The NT$100 million fund will in principle go to elementary
schools with over six classes to help them buy more fine-quality
books and reading materials for school children, while the NT$50
million will be used to serve that end exclusively for 300 grade
schools in remote areas, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education in conjunction with the Taiwan Public
Television Service has also launched a campaign encouraging
elementary schools in urban areas to collect children's books and
donate them to their counterparts in the countryside that they adopt.</P>
      <P>Since early September, 33 elementary schools in 18 cities and

      <P>The leaders of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" drive said Wednesday that they will decide what to do in
their bid to oust embattled President Chen Shui-bian pending any
indictment prosecutors might bring against Chen over his alleged role
in a scandal related to the Presidential Office's state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-chung, one of the deputy leaders of the anti-graft
campaign launched by former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Shih Ming-teh seeking to depose Chen over a series of
corruption allegations, said that the campaign leaders will decide
their next move after Chen Jui-jen, the prosecutor in charge of the
state affairs expenses case, has come out with his judgment on the
matter.</P>
      <P>"Chen Jui-jen's judgment on the state affairs case will have a
decisive impact on the anti-corruption headquarters' decision
regarding its next step," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that they will petition the Legislative Yuan Friday,
asking lawmakers, including those of the DPP, to vote in favor of a
presidential recall motion -- the second of its kind launched by the
main opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party since late
June.</P>
      <P>If the second presidential recall motion fails to clear the
Legislative Yuan, red-clad supporters of the anti-graft campaign
against Chen will return to Ketagalan Boulevard Saturday in front of
the Presidential Office, where they plan to continue their street
protests that began Sept. 9, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Under the leadership of Shih, who repeatedly stressed "love,
peace and non-violence" as their action guidelines, an estimated
124,000 protesters flocked into the streets of Taipei to besiege the
Presidential Office Tuesday -- Oct. 10 National Day -- in a further
attempt to pressure Chen to resign.</P>
      <P>Crowds of protesters remained in the streets to stage a sit-in

      <P>The development of Taipei City is very
impressive compared to the last time he visited, an Australian
official visiting Taiwan said in an interview with the CNA Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The city is improving. I can tell by the number of new buildings
since the last time I was here, " said Michael Sutherland, Deputy
Lord Mayor of the Western Australian city of Perth.</P>
      <P>"And of course, the Taipei 101 building is the ultimate tourist

      <P>Sutherland also was impressed by the National Day celebration he

    <HEADLINE>GROUP ESTABLISHED TO SERVE AS CROSS-STRAIT TRAVEL NEGOTIATION WINDOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A quasi-official group designed to serve as
a window for cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations on Chinese citizens
making sightseeing trips to Taiwan was formally established Oct. 10
to help expedite the tourist opening.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Strait Tourism Association (TSTA) will serve as a
counterpart agency to the Beijing-based Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange
Association (CSTEA) established in August by the National Tourism
Administration of China and will be in charge of talks with CSTEA on
technical details regarding Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-sheng, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, will serve
concurrently as chairman of the TSTA, which is scheduled to become
formally operational Friday, according to a TSTA source.</P>
      <P>The TSTA -- grouping several official and private tourist
associations and associations of airline operators in Taiwan -- is
expected to immediately serve as a boost to expedite the opening of
Taiwan to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the TSTA marks a crucial step forward in the
process of allowing Chinese citizens to make sightseeing trips to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The TSTA has a paid-in capital of NT$1 million, with the
government contributing NT$500,000 and five major travel services
associations investing NT$100,000 each.</P>
      <P>"The TSTA will contact its Chinese counterpart immediately after
its inauguration on the schedule for bilateral negotiations on the
tourist opening measures, " Hsu said, adding that the chief delegate
to the talks will be determined depending on the topics to be
addressed.</P>
      <P>As China refuses any official contact with Taiwan, the two sides
have to set up quasi-official travel associations to negotiate and
manage the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC Travel Agent Association (TAA), which has been
responsible for laying the groundwork for tourist opening, said it
has completed its "trailblazing" function. Hereafter, the association
said, it will play a support role, taking charge of delivering travel
papers, allocation of travel quotas, management of absconding
prevention deposits and discipline of travel agents. The TAA head is
among the five TSTA board directors representing the private travel
sector.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's plan, a maximum of 1,000 Chinese tourists
will be allowed to enter Taiwan per day for a maximum 10-day stay.
Chinese tourists are required to "enter and leave in group, " and the
host Taiwan travel agency will be fined NT$200,000 for any absconding
Chinese tourist.</P>
      <P>To ensure travel quality, travel agencies must sign a discipline
agreement. Any travel agency that violates the minimum daily travel
expenses of US$80-to-US$100 will have its tourist quota allocation
suspended for one month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD URGES PRESIDENT TO LEAVE HIS FATE TO NATIONAL REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou urged President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday re-read a
statement he made in June and leave his fate to a national
referendum.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while speaking in his capacity as an expert
witness at the Legislative Yuan to screen a motion to recall the
president over a string of alleged corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to Chen's televised speech June 20 in response
to the first recall motion initiated by the opposition, during which
he said he would leave his fate to the people.</P>
      <P>The first recall motion vote failed June 27 because the
opposition only maintains a slim majority in the 221-seat
legislature. The opposition managed to obtain only 119 ballots for
the motion, far short of the 148 votes, or two-thirds, to put the
motion to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Ma reminded Chen that he said in 2004 that "there
are two missions for the March 20 presidential election -- a national
referendum and my bid for re-election."</P>
      <P>Chen said at the time that he would rather have the establishment
of national referendum as his major legacy to Taiwan's history, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>If both the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
president have attached so much importance to a national referendum,
"how could they just brush it aside when the time to decide the fate
of the president has come?" Ma asked.</P>
      <P>The legislature held its first screening meeting on the recall
motion Wednesday, when a dozen DPP legislators unfurled protest
banners in a failed attempt to prevent Ma from getting to the podium.</P>
      <P>Ma was disrupted several times by the DPP legislators, who then
withdrew from the meeting after being warned by Vice Legislative Yuan
Speaker David Chung to behave themselves.</P>
      <P>The second recall motion will be put to a vote Friday, although
its passage is deemed unlikely as the DPP legislators have vowed to
boycott it again.</P>
      <P>The embattled president, facing a month-long campaign to pressure
him to resign to answer a string of corruption allegations
implicating himself, his family members and senior aides, has denied
any wrongdoing and vowed to serve out his term until it expires in
May 2008.</P>

      <P>The service center of the main opposition

      <P>According to the KMT officials, it was the second time since

damaged after a large-scale demonstration against President Chen
Shui-bian began since early September.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwanese know little about the booming
state of Western Australia (WA) , and it's about time to change all
that, an Australian offical visiting Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Most people in Taiwan don't know that Western Australia's
domestic economy grew at a rate of 14 percent in the second quarter
of 2006, higher than China's 11.3 percent, said Michael Sutherland,
deputy mayor of Perth.</P>
      <P>Most people know more about eastern Australia, where most
Taiwanese tourists visit, Sutherland said.</P>
      <P>In fact, Taiwan and Western Australia have already established
strong links. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics,
Taiwan is WA's sixth largest export market. In 2005-2006, it exported
A$1.2 billion worth of goods to Taiwan, including iron ore,
petroleum, nickel, copper, gold and seafood.</P>
      <P>In return, Western Australia bought back from Taiwan iron
construction materials as well as motorcycles, rubber tires, sporting
goods and electrical equipment.</P>
      <P>For tourists, Western Australia -- especially Perth -- is also a
place well worth the visit, Sutherland said.</P>
      <P>"Perth has great scenery, clean air, outdoor living, good food
and wine. It is also easy to move around the modern city where there
are no traffic jams. It's the place to go for an easy holiday," he
said, adding that Perth and Taipei are in the same time zone,
another plus.</P>
      <P>These reasons are why Perth was ranked in the top five "most
livable cities" by the Economist Magazine in 2005, he noted.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese population in Western Australia has been
consistently increasing in recent years. Sutherland said local
governments in Western Australia will be encouraging people there to
learn more about and experience Taiwan first-hand as well.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former spokeswoman of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) was sentenced to three months in jail Wednesday
after a court in central Taiwan found her guilty of running a
newspaper advertisement defaming a ruling party candidate during a
local election campaign last year.</P>
      <P>The lawsuit against Cheng Li-wen was brought by Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) candidate for Taichung city mayor Lin
Chia-lung, who accused four KMT officials of running the ad in an
attempt to scuttle his chances of being elected.</P>
      <P>Lin sued KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, KMT Secretary-General Chan
Chun-po, Cheng and her assistant Chang Sze-kang for violating the
election law by running the ad claiming that Lin and Lo Wen-chia, the
DPP's candidate for Taipei county magistrate, were behind a
corruption group suspected of embezzling assets.</P>
      <P>The Taichung District Court found that Ma, Chan and Chang had not
participated in the scheme but decided that Cheng's role merited
punishment.</P>
      <P>Cheng argued that Lin, who quit as minister of the Government
Information Office to run for Taichung mayor, had been a key member
in the DPP government that gave people an impression that as a whole
it was an "embezzling group" and that she was not attempting to spoil
Lin's chances of getting elected.</P>
      <P>The court did not agree, saying she had damaged Lin's reputation,
a key reference for voters in an election, without producing evidence
that he had been involved in any embezzlement cases.</P>
      <P>The court said Cheng had "obviously tried to make Lin lose the
election, " for which she deserved a three-month sentence plus
deprivation of her political rights for one year. The sentence can be
commuted into a monetary fine and can be appealed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWSUIT WINNER DEMANDS KMT HEAD APOLOGIZE FOR SMEAR TACTICS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling party official who won a lawsuit
against the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) former spokeswoman demanded
Wednesday that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou apologize for allowing her
to run a defamatory advertisement which was ruled illegal.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung, secretary-general of the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) who was defeated in a Taichung City mayoral election,
made the demand after the court sentenced Cheng Li-wen to three
months in jail for violating election law. Cheng said she would
appeal the ruling.</P>
      <P>Lin filed the lawsuit against Ma, Cheng and two other KMT
officials for running a newspaper ad claiming that Lin and DPP
candidate for Taipei County magistrate Lo Wen-chia were behind a
corrupt group suspected of embezzling assets.</P>
      <P>The Taichung District Court found Ma and the other two KMT
officials "not guilty" but ruled that Cheng merited punishment.</P>
      <P>Lin said Ma gave his party officials a free hand to stage a smear
campaign against him and other DPP candidates, spoiling Taiwan's
political culture.</P>
      <P>He said Ma should make an apology to show his party is sincere
about renouncing its smear tactics.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the ruling was "off-base." The ad was about a
"political party's image" -- content that should be protected as part
of the freedom of expression, she said.</P>
      <P>"Is Taiwan under martial law now? " she said, adding that it is
"small wonder" people do not possess confidence in the justice
system.</P>
      <P>She was particularly bitter about the court's suspension of her
political rights for one year, punishment that she claimed was the
result of a "politically motivated sentence."</P>

      <P>Both the Ministry of the Interior and
Taipei City Government cited laws Wednesday claiming their respective
jurisdiction over the process of granting permits for anti-president
rallies in the capital city.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang accused Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou,
who is also chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , of
giving free rein to leaders of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign to stage month-long rallies, which have resulted
in numerous violence incidents and disruption of social order.</P>
      <P>He said some rally participants have unleashed a "red terror" on
Taipei streets, referring to their red clothes and banners calling on
scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian to step down.</P>
      <P>Lee told the National Police Agency to demand that local police
in Taipei's Chung Cheng District issue no more permits to campaign
organizers and to revoke those permits already issued to them to
ensure Taipei residents are able to lead a normal life.</P>
      <P>According to laws governing the administration of law enforcement

not grant permits to campaign organizers and take back permits issued
to them to use public places from Oct. 14 to Oct. 27, Lee said.</P>
      <P>But the Taipei City Government said according to the law

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE PATHOLOGIST ARRIVES TO EXPOSE CHINA'S ORGAN HARVESTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  11  (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The woman who created a scene by
interrupting a White House welcoming ceremony for visiting Chinese
President Hu Jintao in April arrived in Taipei Wednesday to begin
a lecture tour aimed at exposing the inhumanity of China's
organ-harvesting operations.</P>
      <P>Wang Wenyi, a China-born pathologist who has lived in America for
20 years, said upon arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
that she hopes people around the world will work in concert to demand
that China halt its brutal harvesting of human organs from imprisoned
Falun Gong practitioners -- while they are still alive.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is also a journalist with the Epoch Times -- a Falun
Gong-affiliated newspaper, said this is her first-ever visit to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I'll deliver speeches on how China has harvested organs from
imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners while they are alive," Wang said,
adding that she will also travel around Taiwan to get a taste of life
here and visit local friends during her stay.</P>
      <P>Wang is visiting Taiwan at the invitation of Legislator Lai
Ching-teh of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>On April 20, 2006, during Chinese President Hu Jintao's visit to
the United States, Wang got a valid journalist pass that gave her
access to the welcoming ceremony on the White House's South Lawn and
loudly shouted for about 45 seconds during a speech given by Hu. She
condemned Hu's human rights policies and China's persecution of the
Falun Gong spiritual movement.</P>
      <P>Her shouts in Chinese and English were also directed toward
American President George W. Bush with comments such as "President
Bush, stop him from killing" and "President Bush, stop him from
persecuting the Falun Gong."</P>
      <P>On April 21, 2006, Wang Wenyi was charged in federal court with a
misdemeanor of willfully intimidating, coercing, threatening and
harassing a foreign official. After waiting overnight in jail, Wang
was formally charged with "knowingly and willfully intimidating,
coercing, threatening or harassing a foreign official performing his
duties," a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in prison and a
fine of $5,000.</P>
      <P>Then Wang read a prepared statement to reporters. "What I did was
say just a few words at a moment in history. It was an act of
conscience and an act of civil disobedience...I've devoted much of my
time trying to stop the persecution of Falun Gong in China,
especially the harvesting of organs," she said.</P>
      <P>Wang was later released without bail pending further proceedings.
On June 21, 2006, the U.S. Court in Washington D.C. cancelled the
charge on Wang. "Today is not the important thing, " Wang said. "The
important thing is all the Falun Gong practitioners who are losing
their lives."</P>

    <HEADLINE>COURT RULES MIDWAY HOME FOR AIDS PATIENTS MUST RELOCATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court has ruled that a
midway home for those who are either HIV-carriers or have full-blown
AIDS must relocate away from its current site in a Taipei apartment
complex because of public health concerns.</P>
      <P>The court made the ruling Wednesday on the grounds that the
midway home for those with a contagious disease like AIDS could
affect environmental sanitation and pose a threat to other complex
residents' psychological health.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the court ruling as "outrageous and discriminating
against AIDS patients, " Nicole Yang, founder of the Harmony Home
Association which operates the midway home in Taipei's Wenshan
District, said the association will appeal the case to a higher
court.</P>
      <P>The midway home was set up in the Chaihsing apartment complex in
June 2005. The apartment was rented to the association by Wang
Chi-tong, the son of Wang Tao-yuan, a former Judicial Yuan vice
president.</P>
      <P>After learning that the midway home provides shelter and care for
more than 10 HIV-infected children and adults, the complex's
management commission called two rounds of landlord meetings in July
and August of that year, in which landlords unanimously decided to
demand that the midway home be relocated away from the community
within three months.</P>
      <P>However, Yang refused to relocate the midway home on the grounds
that the resolution lacked any legal basis and that the community's
code of conduct which bans its residents from sheltering any patients
with a contagious disease runs against Article 10 of the ROC
Constitution which protects freedom of residence and the right to
move at will.</P>
      <P>The management commission then filed a lawsuit to seek a court
order for the midway home to be relocated away from the complex. The
court issued its ruling after four rounds of hearings.</P>
      <P>In the ruling, the court said that the community's demand that
the midway home be relocated does not violate residential apartment
management regulations.</P>
      <P>As to the constitutional provision regarding freedom of
residence, the verdict said the Constitution defines relations
between the government and private citizens rather than regulates
relations among private citizens.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the verdict claimed that allowing patients with
contagious diseases to live in a densely populated community could
threaten environmental hygiene and even affect other residents'
psychological health.</P>
      <P>Yang expressed deep regret over the court's failure to send its
judge to conduct a field survey before making its ruling. In the
course of the hearings, Yang recalled, a judge even suggested that
the midway home be relocated to a remote or sparsely populated area
to avoid "scaring" others or causing anxiety in the neighborhood.</P>
      <P>"I disagree with such a suggestion because it would deprive
HIV-carriers and AIDS patients of freedom of residence, " Yang said,
adding that the verdict simply reflects local society's ignorance and
lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS transmission.</P>
      <P>Noting that HIV can only be contracted through sexual
intercourse, blood transfusions or breast feeding, Yang said people
are not at risk of contracting HIV by simply having an AIDS patient
living next door.</P>
      <P>"I hope that the public can show some love to AIDS patients and
HIV-positive people and allow them to rebuild their lives in the
community residence," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA PRESSURING VIETNAM TO EXCLUDE TAIWAN FROM APEC SUMMIT: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has tried to pressure the Vietnamese
government into excluding Taiwan from this year's informal leadership
summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, slated
for next month in Hanoi, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chung, director-general of the MOFA's
Department of International Organizations, Beijing has attempted to
block Vietnam -- the host country of the 2006 APEC meetings -- from
sending an envoy to Taiwan to extend an invitation to the country for
the summit.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MOFA is still communicating with the Vietnamese
government on the matter and that Vietnam has promised it will deal
with it properly.</P>
      <P>Despite some delay, Vietnam is expected to decide soon when to
send an envoy to Taiwan to discuss details regarding who will
represent Taiwan at this year's summit, Chen said.</P>
      <P>This year's APEC informal leadership summit is scheduled for Nov.
18-19. Prior to that, a senior officials meeting will be held Nov.
12-13 and a ministerial meeting will be held Nov. 15-16.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few international bodies that admit both
Taiwan and China. Because of China's opposition, Taiwan's president
has been barred from attending APEC summits in person and has instead
had to name a special envoy to attend on his behalf.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian had planned to send Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng as his proxy to the 2005 APEC summit held in
Busan, South Korea, but Beijing objected to the plan, thus forcing
Chen to assign the mission instead to Lin Hsin-I, convener of a
Presidential Office economic advisory group.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bilateral ties between Taiwan
and Australia have been solid and are steadily growing, Taiwan's
representative to Australia said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a cocktail party held in Canberra to mark the Double
Ten National Day of the Republic of China, Gary S. H. Lin said
Australia and Taiwan have signed 27 memorandums of understanding on
various cooperative projects between the two countries in areas
including science and technology, civil aviation, intellectual
property rights protection, agriculture and fisheries, fair trade,
quarantine, education and holiday work programs.</P>
      <P>Lin said two-way trade between Taiwan and Australia topped
US$7.077 billion in 2005. He further said that Australia is one of
most popular tourist destinations for Taiwan nationals, attracting
some 100,000 Taiwan tourists last year, and that there are currently
about 11,000 Taiwan students studying at colleges in Australia.</P>
      <P>Lin called for people in Australia to gain a better understanding
of Taiwan and its people, particularly Taiwan's unusual diplomatic
situation, as well as the Taiwan people's resolve to safeguard
freedom and human rights and their aspiration to participate in
international organizations and related activities.</P>
      <P>Margaret May, chairwoman of the Australia-Taiwan Parliamentary
Friendship Group, was also invited to make a speech at the cocktail

and political freedom and should continue to help secure Taiwan's
social stability and economic growth given that the two countries
have maintained close and cordial relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEXT U.N. CHIEF URGED TO ACTIVELY SAFEGUARD CROSS-STRAIT STABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-Moon
was urged Thursday to help maintain stability across the Taiwan
Strait after he assumes his new post as the next secretary-general of
the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The 192-member U.N. General Assembly is expected to approve in a
meeting Friday Ban's nomination as the new U.N. secretary-general to
succeed Kofi Annan, whose term is scheduled to end in December,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said. Ban will become
only the second Asian ever to hold the post, after U-Thant of
Myanmar, who served as U.N. secretary-general between 1961-1971.</P>
      <P>The MOFA keenly expects that Ban will demonstrate courage and
farsightedness as the top U.N. official by actively safeguarding
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, said John Chen, director
general of the MOFA's Department of International Organizations.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes that Ban who is known to be very familiar
with cross-Taiwan Strait affairs -- is well aware of how the Taiwan
people feel living under constant military threat from China, in the
same way that the South Korean people feel after Pyongyang conducted
a nuclear test Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in the wake of the North Korean nuclear test,
major powers, including Japan and the United States, have spelled out
sanctions and other punitive measures against Pyongyong, but China
seems to have taken a reserved stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan included peace in the Korean Peninsula in its peace
proposal submitted to the United Nations in September as part of its
bid to gain U.N. membership, Chen said. In the proposal, Taiwan urges
the United Nations to play a more active role in maintaining peace in
East Asia, he added.</P>
      <P>Following the North Korean nuclear test, Chen said, the United
Nations should pay closer attention to the Taiwan-initiated peace
proposal and launch a debate on its contents.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is a peace-loving country which spelled out in
2002 a "five noes" policy against nuclear arms -- namely no
development, no production, no stocks, no acquisition and no usage of
nuclear weapons. This policy remains resolutely unchanged, he added.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the international community in his
Double Ten National Day address Tuesday to conduct a full review of
the shortcomings and flaws in the general security mechanism in East
Asia.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the president's call, Chen urged the international
community to also pay attention to the Taiwan issue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An estimated 500,000 people in Taiwan own
wealth worth more than NT$100 million (US$30 million) including real
estate, a local economist said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, director of National Central University's Research
Center for Taiwan Economic Development, noted that 7 million
households in Taiwan, or 80 percent of the total, have self-owned
residences.</P>
      <P>Based on this figure, the number of people with wealth of more
than NT$100 million is estimated at between 300,000 to 500,000, Chu
said, adding that a recent report by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. showing that
59,000 people in Taiwan owned net financial assets of over NT$100
million in 2005 fails to provide a full picture of the financial
strength of Taiwan's private sector.</P>
      <P>According to tallies from the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , Taiwan's national net worth
totalled NT$4.27 million per capita in 2004, up NT$160,000 from the
year-earlier level, with the net worth per household amounting to
NT$7.89 million.</P>
      <P>In 2005, the dispensable income per household in Taiwan amounted
to NT$895,000, up 0.4 percent from NT$891,000 in 2004, the DGBAS
tallies show. However, the wealth gap also increased over the
previous year. The average income of the top 20 percent of households
in Taiwan amounted to NT$1.8 million in 2005, or over six times
higher than that for the bottom 20 percent of households which stood
at only NT$298,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PAN-GREEN LAWMAKERS BOYCOTT LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON RECALL MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislature held a second-day session to
screen an opposition-initiated motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian without the presence of legislators from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its "pan-green camp" ally the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Thursday.</P>
      <P>During the session, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First
Party lawmakers focused their questions on the Presidential Office's
use of bogus receipts and invoices to claim "state affairs expenses,"
the president's "secret diplomacy" project and his "dishonest"
registration of family assets with the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DPP has adopted a "three-no" strategy in preparation for
Friday's open vote on the motion by the members of the Legislative
Yuan -- the president will not defend; party lawmakers will not
attend the screening session; and they will not vote.</P>
      <P>Instead, DPP Legislator Lee Ming-hsien held a press conference to
explain why the ruling party does not support the recall motion. Lee
said that even if the legislature wants to strike at what it claims
to be "corruption, " the issue should be dealt with by the judicial
system, not the legislative branch.</P>
      <P>"Compared with previous presidents and other political leaders,
President Chen is neither dictatorial nor corrupt, " Lee said, citing
that President Chiang Kai-shek, who was considered by many in Taiwan
as a dictator, and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, during whose rein
occurred the political assassinations of writer Chiang Nan, scholar
Chen Wen-cheng and mother and daughter of Lin Yin-hsiung, former DPP
chairman, were much hated.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning the TSU's "spiritual leader," former President
Lee Teng-hui, Lee Ming-hsien lambasted KMT Honorary Chairman Lien
Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong, claiming that the Lien family has
accumulated massive wealth and that Soong squandered all of Taiwan
Province's budget when serving as governor.</P>
      <P>In comparison, he claimed, whether Chen is corrupt or not should
be judged by the judicial authorities, and "there simply are no good
reasons to recall the president at this point in time."</P>
      <P>However, evidence that emerged during the legislative screening
session was not quite favorable to Chen and his wife. For example,
Wang Yung-hsing, a senior auditing official of the Control Yuan, told
the session that since 2002, whenever Yuan officials tried to audit
the Presidential Office's accounting books regarding the use of the
"state affairs fund, " Chen's staff would only show them half of the
receipts or invoices while refusing to offer the other half on the
grounds of "national security and state secrets."</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun asked what the Control Yuan could do
if a senior government official refused to register his or his wife's
jewelry by stating it was "borrowed from a friend whose privacy must
be kept."</P>
      <P>In reply, Control Yuan official Hsieh Yu-nan said it is the Yuan
officials' duty to investigate whether an official has not registered
any item of his assets that is worth NT$200,000 or more. "We can
cooperate with private assessment professionals to determine the
price of the jewelry," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Lee Hui-fen, a businesswoman, told the legislature that she does
not believe banker Kung Chin-yuan has served as an "informant" in
Shanghai for President Chen, nor could she imagine that her
ex-husband Chiu Ta-wei has ever worked as a spy for Chen's so-called
"southern line" secret diplomacy project.</P>
      <P>Despite these revelations, DPP legislative caucus convener Ko
Chien-ming advised lawmakers of the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and PFP not to waste their time and energy trying to muster support
for Friday's vote. The motion must win the support of at least
two-thirds of all the lawmakers in order to be put to a national
referendum to decide Chen's political fate.</P>
      <P>"Don't ever think of launching a third or fourth motion to recall
the president. You would just be incurring insult on yourselves.
People simply could no longer stand it," Ko said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Substandard learning and education products
and services are the main causes of distress among Taiwan consumers,
the non-profit Consumers' Foundation said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a "consumer misery index" survey,
conducted by the foundation between Aug. 5-25, the top three sources
of consumer distress were matters related to learning and education,
housing and living, and medical attention and services.</P>
      <P>The foundation has compiled a "consumer misery index" annually in
terms of prices, quality and current conditions in 10 categories --
food and beverages, clothing, housing and living, transportation and
communications, learning and education, leisure and entertainment,
medical attention and services, finance, public order and government
efficiency, and the environment -- to reflect the general feelings of
consumers.</P>
      <P>The survey found that substandard learning and education products
and services -- including no-refund or difficult refund policies of
private cram schools, substandard or inconsistent quality of
computers and peripheral products, and inconsistent quality in
overseas learning services -- topped the list in terms of causes of
consumer distress.</P>
      <P>Second on the list was housing and living problems, which include
building and quality defects in newly-constructed houses and
apartments, as well as disputes arising from real estate brokerage,
followed by problematic medical attention and services, which include
bogus weight-loss programs and products and medical disputes.</P>
      <P>For this year's misery index, the foundation sent out
questionnaires to adults selected randomly around the country,
and collected 1,404 valid samples, from 512 males and 892 females.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PAP SMEARS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING CERVICAL CANCER DEATH RATE: OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The death rate from cervical cancer among
women having received Pap smears is 60 percent lower than that of
those who have not, according to the results of a study released
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The study was conducted by National Science Council Chairman Chen
Chien-jen by analyzing the records of 3.87 million women aged 30 or
above who received Pap smears between 1995 and 2001 and the records
of another 2.98 million who did not received the tests.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 134.6 out of every 100,000 women having
received Pap smears died from cervical cancer, compared with a death
rate of 331.1 out every 100,000 women who had not received the
screening.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another study by the International Agency for Research
on Cancer indicates that receiving Pap smears every year can reduce
the occurence rate of invasive cervical cancer by 93 percent, while
receiving the tests every three years can reduce the occurence rate
by 91 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsiu-hung, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Health
Promotion, said both studies prove that Pap smears remain an
effective method to screen for cervical cancer, and she urged women
aged 30 or above to receive the tests every year, or at least once
every three years.</P>
      <P>From 1995, the government has covered the cost for one Pap smear
per year for women aged 30 or above.</P>
      <P>However, Department of Health tallies show that as of 2005, only
54 percent of women in this age group had received Pap smears in the
last three years, which was much lower than the 90 percent registered
in the United States.</P>
      <P>Jacqueline Whang-Peng, director of Institute of Cancer Research
at National Health Research Institutes, suggested that all women aged
13 or above be vaccinated against cervical cancer after the cervical
cancer vaccine become available in the market.</P>
      <P>According to Whang-Peng, the vaccine is 100 percent effective in
protecting women against cervical cancer if they are vaccinated
before their first sexual experience, with the effectiveness dropping
to only 30 percent if they are vaccinated after they have had sexual
intercourse.</P>

      <P>With the DPP and its "pan-green camp" ally the Taiwan Solidarity
Union boycotting the vote, the recall motion has little chance of
passing the legislature.</P>
      <P>The PFP and its "pan-blue alliance" ally the KMT failed in June
to pass their motion to recall the president.</P>
      <P>If the motion fails again Friday, the PFP will push ahead with
its no-confidence motion against the premier.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said the no-confidence motion is more
likely to pass since it only requires half the legislature's
approval. The KMT and PFP enjoy a slight majority in the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>If the Cabinet is toppled, Yu said he will recommend the
president dissolve the legislature so people will have the chance to
elect a new one.</P>
      <P>During a testimony in the legislature Thursday, KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said he would not rule out the possibility of launching a
third attempt to recall the president.</P>
      <P>Government Information Minister Cheng Wen-tsan called on the
pan-blue alliance to put the brakes on their second or third recall
attempts, saying these campaigns only serve to create political
confrontation and social unrest.</P>
      <P>Social division has already worsened following month-long street
protests by supporters of the "Million Voices Against Corruption"
campaign, Cheng said, urging opposition parties to "stand on the side
of the people" and stop their legislative maneuverings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERIOR MINISTRY HAS NO SAY IN TAIPEI PROTEST PERMITS: MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City Police Headquarters, not
the Ministry of the Interior, has the legal jurisdiction to grant
approval for street rallies or protests that are held in the city,
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while fielding reporters' questions about
recent month-long anti-corruption protests led by former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih Ming-teh and aimed at ousting
President Chen Shui-bian over various corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>Ma's remarks came one day after Minister of the Interior Lee
Yi-yang instructed the National Police Agency to order the Taipei
police department to stop issuing permits for future anti-Chen
protests and to rescind those already granted.</P>
      <P>Claiming that "Lee has gone too far by making an instruction that
does not fall in line with the Municipal Self-governance Law, " Ma
said that Taipei City has the administrative power to approve
demonstration permits, not the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>"Instead of being a centralized country, Taiwan is a country
ruled by local governments," Ma said, adding that "this is something
the Ministry of the Interior should know very well."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Chung Cheng district first police
precinct said that they are collecting evidence to decide whether a
"universal siege" staged by anti-Chen protesters Tuesday on Double
Ten National Day violated the Demonstration Law.</P>
      <P>If any evidence proves the Tuesday siege damaged public interest
and order, the spokesman said that the Chung Cheng district first
police precinct will make a fair and reasonable judgment on the
matter and decide whether to allow follow-up demonstrations by
anti-Chen protesters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou awarded a total
of NT$5 million (US$150,000) in prizes to 10 bio-tech companies
Thursday in recognition of their outstanding performance.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 2006 Taipei bio-tech award presentation ceremony,
Ma hailed Taipei's central location in East Asia for the development
of the bio-tech industry and expressed hope that the industry would
further flourish in the city.</P>
      <P>For this year's award, 45 bio-tech companies from pharmaceutical,
gardening, foodstuff, medical equipment and recycling sectors vied
for top honors in four categories -- commercial production, research
and innovation, technology transfer and academic-industrial
cooperation.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Taipei City's bio-tech industry has been booming
in recent years thanks to a six-year development program. A task
force set up in 2001 has greatly helped to prop up the local bio-tech
industry by offering attractive incentives and measures to lure more
investment, he explained.</P>
      <P>In terms of actual development projects with the private sector,
Neihu Technology Park and Nankang Software Industrial Park in
suburban Taipei have been operating smoothly, Ma said, adding that
more companies are expressing a keen interest in opening shop in the
two compounds.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of Taipei's good location, the Taipei city
government also hopes to build the city into a global business
operations hub for Taiwan businessmen around the world and make it
into a business operations center for foreign companies in
Asia-Pacific, Ma said</P>
      <P>In view of the two parks' success, the Taipei city government
will fully collaborate with the central government to pursue stronger
competitiveness for Taiwan, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DO NOT REMAIN SILENT ON CHINA'S ORGAN HARVESTING: PHYSICIANBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> "An organ transplant can save a life, but removing an organ from
a living person for transplant is manslaughter, " said Wang Wenyi, a
China-born pathologist who became famous last April when she created
a scene by shouting at visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao and his
American host George W. Bush during a White House welcoming ceremony.</P>
      <P>Wang arrived in Taiwan Wednesday for a lecture tour aimed at
invoking people's consciences to halt the alleged practice in China
of harvesting human organs from imprisoned Falun Gong spiritual
movement followers while they are still alive.</P>
      <P>Her proof of China's live human organ harvesting comes from just
two Falung Gong practitioners from Shengyang in northeast China. The
husband of one of them is a surgeon who claims to have personally
removed organs from a living person.</P>
      <P>After hearing their horrifying accounts, Wang said she
immediately searched the Internet for relevant information and found
that the Chinese government has a long-established Web site for organ
sales.</P>
      <P>"U.S. dollar prices for five different organs are listed and the
contents translated into five languages, apparently aimed at
soliciting patients from around the world to visit China to receive
organ transplants, " she said, noting that on a Web page is
acknowledgement to the Chinese government, China's public security
bureau, the police authorities and prisons.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has lived in the United States for 20 years, is a
pathologist at the Mount Sinai Hospital and knows that in some
countries, strict tests must be done before an organ can be
transplanted. In the United States, she said, a patient usually has
to wait five years before a suitable new organ is available for
transplant, yet some Chinese hospitals claim that it can be done
"within a week or two, or a month at the maximum" as long as the
patient is willing to pay for it.</P>
      <P>Wang also works as a reporter for the Epoch Times, the mouthpiece
of the Falun Gong movement -- a title that enabled her to cover the
White House event and stage her antics on the South Lawn. She said
Epoch Times journalists have confirmed that at least 15 Chinese
hospitals offer the "money for quick transplant" service. "Answers
from these hospitals were all tape recorded," she said.</P>
      <P>She quoted China's Ministry of Health statistics as reporting
that between 1993 to 1999, some 18,000 patients received organ
transplants in China. From 1999, when China started to crack down on
Falun Gong, to 2005, the figure jumped to 60,000.</P>
      <P>The average number of death-row prisoners executed each year was
less than 2,000, therefore it could explain the number of organ
transplants for the 1993-1999 period. But how can the sudden surge
for 1999-2005 be explained when death row executions had not sharply
increased? she asked.</P>
      <P>"The only reasonable explanation is harvesting organs from living
persons," Wang Wenyi claimed in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>She said China has set up nearly 40 "concentration camps" where
Falun Gong practitioners are imprisoned and brutally tortured if
"brainwashing" sessions designed to make them renounce the practice
fail.</P>
      <P>One "special treatment" for jailed Falun Gong followers is
regular blood tests and checks on their hearts and lungs, a practice
she claimed is aimed at establishing a huge "live organ databank"
that makes it possible to realize how the fast transplants can be
carried out.</P>
      <P>In China, life is not sacred. Rather, it is a commodity that can
be window shopped, Wang claimed.</P>
      <P>She said that when she condemned Hu Jintao's human rights policy
in Chinese and shouted "President Bush, stop him from killing, " and
"President Bush, stop him from persecuting the Falun Gong" at the
White House ceremony, she was speaking for justice and human
conscience.</P>
      <P>As a physician, "it is my job to save lives, " but harvesting
organs from living human beings simply is against humanity. "This is
why I have no fear of China's persecution or about my personal safety
when I decided to expose China's brutality to the world," she said.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as a medical professional and as a journalist, she
did not choose to remain silent and to evade the harsh reality. "I
have chosen to stand on the side of truth, justice and human rights.
I hope more people will do the same."</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu urged Beijing Thursday to quickly open tourism talks with
Taiwan to allow Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Wu issued the call at an informal meeting with reporters after
local media reported a day earlier that the Taipei-based Taiwan
Strait Tourism Association had begun operating as a counterpart to
the Beijing-based Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association -- both
of which are new semi-official organizations in charge of holding
bilateral tourism talks representing their respective governments.</P>
      <P>Although five Chinese tourists, who entered Taiwan from South
Korea, were killed recently in a bus crash in Nantou County, central
Taiwan, Wu contended that the matter should not affect Beijing's
stance on tourism exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At present, only Chinese visitors from a third country or area
can enter Taiwan for pleasure trips.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu said, China has been slow to respond to Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>CDC TO OFFER LEGAL AID TO HALFWAY HOME FOR AIDS PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) questioned
the legality Thursday of a court ruling demanding that a halfway home
for AIDS patients relocate away from its current site within three
months, pointing out that AIDS patients are entitled to the same
freedom of residence as anyone else.</P>
      <P>Noting that constitutional provisions protect freedom of
residence and the right to move at will, a DOH spokesman said the
AIDS prevention and control regulations also prohibit discrimination
against HIV-carriers and AIDS patients with regard to schooling,
employment, medical care and all other fields.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the DOH's Center for Disease Control
(CDC) will offer all necessary legal aid to the Harmony Home
Association, which operates the halfway home in an apartment complex
in Taipei's Wenshan District.</P>
      <P>Disputes between the halfway home -- which provides shelter and
care for seven AIDS children and 22 adults who are either
HIV-positive or have full-blown AIDS -- and the apartment complex
management have often arisen since the halfway home relocated from
Sanchung, Taipei County into the complex in June 2005.</P>
      <P>After the halfway home's founder, Nicole Yang, twice rejected the
complex management commission's demand that they get out of the
building, the commission filed a lawsuit seeking a court order for
the halfway home to be relocated away from the complex. The court
issued its ruling Wednesday after four rounds of hearings.</P>
      <P>In the ruling, the court said that the halfway home should
relocate away from the complex within three months because of "public
health concerns."</P>
      <P>Although the Constitution protects freedom of residence, the
verdict claimed that the Constitution defines relations between the
government and private citizens rather than regulates relations among
private citizens. Therefore, the verdict claimed that the
constitutional provisions are inapplicable to this case.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the verdict claimed that allowing patients with
contagious diseases to live in a densely populated community could
threaten environmental hygiene and even affect other residents'
psychological health.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said they deeply regret the court's ruling and will
study its legitimacy.</P>
      <P>As Yang has vowed to appeal the case to a higher court, the
officials said the CDC will offer all necessary legal aid in its
pursue of legal justice.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the officials said, the CDC will cooperate with the
Ministry of the Interior to arrange for halfway home tenants who are
unable to live on their own to move to government-run care centers.</P>
      <P>Blasting the court ruling as "outrageous and discriminating
against AIDS patients, " Yang said she deeply regrets the court's
failure to send its judge to conduct a field survey before making its
ruling.</P>
      <P>In the course of the hearings, Yang recalled, a judge even
suggested that the home be relocated to a remote or sparsely
populated area to avoid "scaring" others or causing anxiety in the
neighborhood.</P>
      <P>"I disagree with such a suggestion because it would deprive
HIV-carriers and AIDS patients of freedom of residence, " Yang said,
adding that the verdict simply reflects local society's ignorance
about HIV/AIDS transmission.</P>
      <P>Noting that HIV can only be contracted through sexual
intercourse, blood transfusions or breast feeding, Yang said people
are not at risk of contracting HIV by simply having an AIDS patient
living next door.</P>
      <P>"I hope that the public can show some love to AIDS patients and
HIV-positive people and allow them to rebuild their lives in the
community," she added.</P>

expansion and international growth in mind are encouraged to invest
in the United Kingdom, which offers great opportunities for Taiwanese
companies, British ICT experts said Thursday.</P>
      <P>One hundred and seventy-five Taiwanese companies that currently
invest in the U.K. primarily do so for the country's "cutting-edge
and world-leading R&amp;D capabilities, " said David Percival, head of
the Inward Investment Section of the British Trade and Cultural
Office (BTCO).</P>
      <P>Among the Taiwanese ICT companies that have invested in Britain
are MITAC Computer, ASUS, D-Link, BenQ, Inventec, Trend Micro and
Arima Optoelectronic.</P>
      <P>Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can also make their
marks as well, as the British government offers incentive programs
such as tax breaks and provides free and confidential assistance in
finding partners for foreign investors, Percival said.</P>
      <P>Britain is the perfect location for Taiwanese enterprises to
expand overseas. Just as foreign investors see Taiwan as a gateway
into China and Asia, Britain can be Taiwan's gateway into the
European market, said John Davies, an ICT advisor.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies traditionally rank Europe behind the United
States, Japan, China and South Korea in terms of overseas expansion,
Davies noted.</P>
      <P>As Britain has reinvented itself to move up the value-added

environment to establish global partnerships, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health authorities in eastern Taitung
County asked police Thursday to search for an HIV-positive Indonesian
woman who has remained unaccounted for since her Taiwanese husband
died of AIDS earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Taitung county government's public health
bureau said they learned that the woman, identified by her surname of
Teng, and her husband, known by his family name of Tseng, were HIV
carriers after receiving notice from National Taiwan University (NTU)
Hospital about a month ago.</P>
      <P>"The couple were placed on a 'watch' list. We regret that the
woman ran away after her husband's death early this month, " said a
county health official.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng's daughter, Tseng married the Indonesian woman
five years ago. At that time, the woman was known by the surname of
Yang. But two years later, she went to the population registration
office to have her surname changed to Teng.</P>
      <P>Tseng's daughter said only her father and stepmother lived in
Taitung, while she and her brother reside in Taipei. When her father
fell ill this spring, she said her stepmother prevented her from
taking her father to Taipei to see a doctor.</P>
      <P>She managed to take her father to NTU Hospital in mid-August when
her father's health deteriorated further. A thorough health checkup
at the hospital confirmed that Tseng was infected with the deadly HIV

      <P>Only when the hospital asked Teng to undergo a similar test did
she admit that she had contracted the virus before coming to Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>JUDICIAL CASE DEPENDS ON EVIDENCE, NOT PUBLIC OPINION: PROSECUTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Evidence, not public opinion, decides the
fate of a judicial cases, the prosecutor in charge of investigations
into alleged irregularities in the use of the president's special
state affairs fund said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Jui-jen was responding to remarks by Shih Ming-teh, the top
leader of a so-called "Million Voices Against Corruption" campaign to
pressure President Chen Shui-bian to resign over accusations of
graft.</P>
      <P>Shih said earlier this week that if the prosecution concludes its
investigation into the state affairs fund case without charging any
first family members, he will lead a crowd to "besiege the
prosecution authorities."</P>
      <P>Noting that evidence is the most important thing in judicial
proceedings, Chen said no street demonstrations or mass movements can
affect the pace of his investigations and his judgment based on his
conviction after listening to the arguments of all those concerned
and poring over all the evidence collected.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the "state affairs fund" probe, Chen said he
will make known the truth based on available evidence. Anyone found
guilty of irregularities, regardless of his or her position and
status, will be dealt with in accordance with the law. If nobody is
found guilty, Chen said, no charges will be leveled and the case may
be closed.</P>
      <P>As a prosecutor, Chen said he can never endorse "trials by public
opinion" based on tabloid reportage.</P>
      <P>Stressing that judicial probes are intrinsically different from
political matters, Chen said that what he is worried about is the
possibility of failing to collect sufficient evidence, not pressure
from the president's opponents or "anti-corruption" protesters.</P>
      <P>In the course of the "state affairs fund" investigations, Chen
said he has found both evidence that is favorable and unfavorable to
the accused. "As the investigations are still ongoing, I have yet to
reach any definitive conclusions," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan
confirmed Friday that Kaohsiung City has decided to invite
Taiwan-born New York Yankees pitcher Wang Chien-ming to serve as the
voice for the 2009 World Games to be held in the southern Taiwan port
city.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Yeh said that inviting Wang -- who
is now a source of pride for Taiwan -- to endorse the Kaohsiung 2009
World Games is a pleasant move to fully demonstrate the "Taiwan
spirit."</P>
      <P>Wang, who was born in Tainan City, southern Taiwan, has put
himself on the world map of baseball by performing brilliantly with
the Yankees this year, and his composure under pressure has won him
huge numbers of fans in the United States and Taiwan, including
President Chen Shui-bian, who lauded Wang several times in his
National Day address Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With "Wang Chien-ming fever" sweeping the nation, the Kaohsiung
City government decided to invite Wang to serve as the voice of the
2009 World Games and will have him appear in a series of commercials
for the event.</P>
      <P>Yeh declined to confirm rumors that Kaohsiung City must pay
Wang's agent US$500,000 for the endorsement activities, saying only
that the important thing is to figure out how Wang can use his free
time most efficiently to accomplish the task of promoting the World
Games and boosting Kaohsiung's international profile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECOND RECALL MOTION AGAINST PRESIDENT FAILS IN LEGISLATIVE VOTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A second recall motion against President
Chen Shui-bian failed as expected to gain the required support of
two-thirds of all lawmakers in a vote in the 220-seat Legislative
Yuan Friday.</P>
      <P>The opposition-initiated recall motion was put to a vote in the
legislature in the morning. But as the opposition only commands a
slim majority in the legislature and as ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmakers had vowed earlier that they would be absent
from the vote, the motion was doomed to fail from the start.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng announced after the vote
count that 130 legislators were present for the voting, with only 116
legislators voting in support of the motion -- far short of the
required 147 votes necessary for it to be put to a national
referendum. There was also one vote against the motion and 13 invalid
ballots.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , a DPP ally,
wrote "opposing second recall motion" on their ballots, chanted "no
more trouble-making" prior to the vote and unfurled banners to
express their stance. Meanwhile, main opposition Kuomintang
legislators chanted "supporting the third recall motion" in a largely
amicable atmosphere.</P>
      <P>The first recall motion against President Chen over a spate of
corruption allegations was put to a vote in the legislature on June
27. A total of 119 legislators voted in favor of the motion, with no
votes against it and 14 invalid ballots. A total of 88 lawmakers were
absent, including all 86 DPP legislators who had earlier decided to
boycott the vote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CALLS FOR HIGHER-LEVEL CONTACTS WITH U.S.: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Lin Chieh-yu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior Taiwan officials believe more
routine higher-level contacts should be established between Taiwan
and the United States to facilitate bilateral communication,
according to a report on Taiwan-U.S. relations released Oct. 10 by
the U.S. Congressional Research Service.</P>
      <P>The report said some Taiwan officials have criticized the United
States for being too careless concerning Taiwan's democracy and
either overly solicitous of China or "afraid of Beijing."</P>
      <P>It cited Taiwan officials as suggesting that Washington establish
"better and more direct channels" specifically with President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"Many on the Taiwan side appear anxious that U.S.-Taiwan
communications have eroded in some ways through a combination of
circumstances; they are concerned that Taiwan now has an 'image
problem' in the United States," the report said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the status of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) as Taiwan's full
representative to the United States has been eroded after Chen's
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in 2000, because the
DPP administration is suspicious that the several chief
representatives appointed since 2000 have allegiances to the former
ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"Some informed observers feel that the Chen administration does
not 'trust' TECRO, either to be a faithful communicator of Taiwan's
message in the United States or to present an accurate picture of
U.S. views to Chen administration officials," it said.</P>
      <P>To deal with its suspicions of TECRO, the Chen administration has
appointed a DPP loyalist to the deputy position in the Washington
TECRO office to monitor information flow there and by-passed TECRO
and sought information from others in the United States more in tune
with DPP interests, the report noted.</P>
      <P>"The actions of the Chen administration and the proliferation of
messages from Taiwan have helped undermine TECRO's effectiveness, in
particular its effectiveness with Congress," it said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report cited U.S. officials as saying that Chen's
unpredictable political style has become "somewhat problematic for
the U.S.-Taiwan relationship."</P>
      <P>For example, although Chen made the so-called "five noes"
commitments, including not to declare independence for Taiwan, in his
2000 inaugural address, Chen in August 2002 defined the relationship
between Taiwan and China as "one country on either side of the
strait, " the report pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to a former official in the George W. Bush
administration interviewed in the report, that statement "fatally
hurt" the relationship between the Chen administration and the White
House.</P>
      <P>"The Bush White House at this juncture reportedly began to see
the Taiwan leadership as more inclined to put personal political
interests ahead of more strategic objectives and U.S. concerns, " the
report said.</P>
      <P>Also, the report said U.S. officials are concerned that the
corruption allegations against Chen will affect Taiwan's political
development.</P>
      <P>They are worried that Chen's rivals will take advantage of the
ongoing anti-corruption demonstrations to escalate anti-Chen
sentiment and that Taiwan's judicial and democratic process may not
be able to function properly to deal with the corruption allegations
under these circumstances, the report said.</P>
      <P>"In addition to raising the risks of political and economic
instability, growing political polarization in Taiwan could further
erode the quality of U.S.-Taiwan contacts," the report said.</P>
      <P>It said pressure may build for U.S. officials to reassess all the
fundamentals of U.S.-China/Taiwan policy in light of changing
circumstances.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT RESPECTS LEGISLATURE'S REJECTION OF SECOND RECALL MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office said it respects
the Legislative Yuan's rejection of a second recall motion against
President Chen Shui-bian in a vote Friday morning.</P>
      <P>The recall motion only received 116 votes in favor, far short of
the 147 votes, or two-thirds of all lawmakers, needed for it to pass
and be put to a national referendum. There was one vote against the
motion and 16 invalid ballots. All 85 lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had earlier decided that they
would boycott the vote.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said in a press release issued early
Friday afternoon that it "respects the result of the legislative
vote."</P>
      <P>Noting that the legislature has rejected recall motions against
the president twice within four months, the Presidential Office
expressed the hope that the opposition, which initiated the motion,
will respect the decision by the legislature, where the opposition
holds only a slim majority.</P>
      <P>The office said that the opposition lawmakers should have
understood the public's desire for stability, urging them to refrain
from initiating any more such motions, including moves to topple the
Cabinet or recall DPP legislators, so as not to exacerbate the
rivalry between the ruling and the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"The public has high expectations for the legislature and hopes
lawmakers from across the party spectrum will make national
development and the people's welfare their top priority, " the office
said in the statement.</P>
      <P>It urged all legislators to work together on several urgent
tasks, including the screening of the government's general budget for
the next fiscal year, the arms procurement package, the organic
statute of a monitoring committee for the labor retirement fund,
national pension bill and the confirmation of Control Yuan nominees,
so as to mend the rifts in society and promote national cohesion.</P>
      <P>The first recall motion against President Chen over a spate of
corruption allegations was put to a vote in the legislature on June
27. A total of 119 legislators voted in favor of the motion, with no
votes against it and 14 invalid ballots.</P>

      <P>A new species of spider, aphantaulax
tainanica, has been discovered in the southern Taiwan city of Tainan,
according to a report in Endemic Species Research, published by the
Endemic Species Research Center under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The first such spider, a female, was discovered by Ueng
Yih-Tsong, an assistant professor at Kun Shan University in Yungkang,
Taina County, and his son Tzu-yang while collecting spider
specimens in Tainan's Su-Tsao Wild Life Reservation
between October 2001 and August 2003.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Uengs found a male of the species, measuring 0.38
cm in length, and another female, measuring 0.46 cm, as well as
several larvae -- a find which provided solid evidence that the
species of spider inhabits the reservation.</P>
      <P>Their research results were published by Endemic Species Research
in July.</P>
      <P>During the first specimen-collecting period, the Uengs collected
some 200 spiders, which they sorted into 20 species in eight

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign said Friday that almost NT$50 million (US$1.5
million) of public donations have been used to organize street
protests over the past month and that as of Oct. 2 the campaign's
account book had a surplus of NT$62 million. </P>
      <P>Supporters have donated more than NT$111 million to the campaign
after former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Shih
Ming-teh urged them to donate NT$100 each in support of his call for
President Chen Shui-bian to step down over his alleged involvement in
a series of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>A substantive part of the campaign fund -- NT$21 million -- was
spent on newspaper advertisements, while other big-item spending
included guarantee deposits for the use of public places (NT$390,000)
and salary payments to campaign workers (NT$406,000) , said Lu
Tai-nian, a deputy commander who is also in charge of keeping tabs on
campaign finances.</P>
      <P>The campaign spent NT$13.1 million to set up stages at rally

NT$205,000 on fuel and telecommunications, and NT$217,000 on repairs.</P>
      <P>It spent NT$48,000 on insurance, NT$31,000 on designing ads,
NT$2.3 million on raincoats and cleaning sit-in sites, while
commuting, meals, and newspapers/magazines cost campaign workers and
participants NT$173,000, NT$218,000 and NT$5,300 respectively.</P>
      <P>Lu said some of the campaigners had demanded a total of NT$46,000
in refunds and after deducting NT$41 million in spending, the
campaign had a surplus of NT$62 million.</P>
      <P>Campaign organizers had promised to donate the surplus to poor
children who cannot afford to pay for lunches at school, but had not

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CONDEMNS CHINA'S HUMAN ORGAN HARVESTING: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan condemns in the strongest possible
terms China's harvesting of human organs from executed Falun Gong
practitioners, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also gravely concerned about prevalent infringements
upon human rights across China and the development of related
situations, Wu said when he met with three human rights activists
from Canada and the United States.</P>
      <P>Wu met with David Kilgour, a former Canadian secretary of state
for Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and David Matas, an international
human rights lawyer, who co-authored the Report into Allegations of
Organ Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China, and Wang
Wenyi, a China-born pathologist who became famous last April when she
created a scene by shouting at visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao
and his American host George W. Bush during a White House welcoming
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan is not only concerned about organ harvesting in
China but is also worried about other human rights issues there, such
as the shooting of Tibetans by Chinese paramilitary police, arrests
of human rights lawyers and a purge of Muslims and Christians.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kilgour, who has addressed the United Nations and
the U.S. Congress about religious freedom and China's organ
harvesting, said he and Matas had tried to enter China in May to
verify the factuality of the claims contained in their report, but
were denied entrance by the Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>Even more ridiculous was that Chinese human rights lawyer Gao
Zhicheng, who invited Matas and Kilgour to visit China to compile
their report, was arrested and indicted by the Chinese authorities on
charges of "sedition to overthrow the government" recently, Kilgour
said, adding that Gao was only calling for the Chinese authorities to
uphold freedom, human rights and rule of law in China.</P>
      <P>Kilgour said Beijing has totally denied the accusations of organ
harvesting from executed Falun Gong practitioners because China is
preparing to host the 2008 Olympic Games. Ironically, he said, if
people search the Google search engine for China's denial by typing
in the keywords "China denied, " they will get more than 8.2 million
entries.</P>
      <P>For his part, Matas said that while harvesting organs is
reportedly guided by the Chinese government, demands for the organs
come from around the world, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To cease this practice, Matas said, it must be done from the
justice side and from the demand side as well. Matas said he is glad
that Taiwan has been active in this regard.</P>
      <P>Matas said he hopes that Taiwan will ban organ exchanges with
China and ban organ transplants using organs from China. He expressed
hope that the Taiwan authorities will warn Taiwan people from
traveling to China for organ transplants while encouraging Taiwan
people to donate their organs to help cut demand for Chinese organs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Wenyi, who is also a journalist with the Epoch
Times -- Falun Gong's mouthpiece -- claimed that most of China's 1.3
billion people are not aware of the organ harvesting because of
Beijing's tight control of the media.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, blessed with full democracy, is the only window to
openness of news and the only gateway from where "the truth" about
China can be known, Wang claimed.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has lived in the United States for 20 years and is a
pathologist at the Mount Sinai Hospital, is visiting Taiwan at the
invitation of Legislator Lai Ching-teh of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>"I'll deliver speeches on how China has harvested organs from
imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners while they are alive," Wang said,
adding that she will also travel around Taiwan to get a taste of life
here and visit local friends during her stay.</P>
      <P>Kilgour and Matas have made no field investigations for their
report, so it was compiled based purely on second-hand accounts and
hearsay of Falun Gong practitioners from around the world, reports
from an organ transplant Web site in China and recorded dialogue that
allegedly took place between hospital authorities and jail officers
in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most fermented milk products sold in Taiwan
contain a high amount of sugar and empty calories, with the highest
content found in light yogurt drinks, according to the results of a
survey released Friday by the John Tung Foundation.</P>
      <P>Hsu Huei-yu, director of the foundation's nutrition section,
pointed out that after a similar survey conducted by the foundation
four years ago, local dairy manufacturers had reduced the sugar
content of yogurt drinks by up to 30 percent and began promoting
light yogurt drinks and yogurt to meet the needs of weight-conscious
consumers.</P>
      <P>With light yogurt drinks now accounting for 44 percent of the
Taiwan market for fermented milk products, the latest survey found
that the ratio of sugar in light yogurt drinks is double that of
average yogurt drinks, although the product may contain less fat
because of the lower dairy content, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the dairy content in light yogurt drinks is only
one-quarter that of milk.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although yogurt is a 100 percent dairy product, it
also contains a large amount of sugar "to give it a good taste, " Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that some beverages labeled "lactic acid"
drink do not contain any probiotics, she said.</P>
      <P>As there are only a few sugar-free or low-sugar fermented milk
products available, Hsu suggested that consumers drink milk and eat
fresh fruit instead to help their bodies produce probiotics.</P>

alliance, " said that it backs follow-up moves at the Legislative
Yuan to have Chen removed from office.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Cheng Chin-ling made the comments at
a news conference at the Legislative Yuan prior to the vote on a
motion to recall Chen -- the second of its kind called by the
"pan-blue alliance" since late June.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the PFP will seek to put forward a
no-confidence vote at the Legislative Yuan to topple the Cabinet or
support a third presidential recall bid by the KMT to oust Chen.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Hsu Yao-chang suggested that the PFP, the KMT and
the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union work together to boycott the
central government's budgets for next year.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Lu Hsueh-chang contended that as a "capable"
opposition party, the PFP should continue seeking to depose Chen
either through a recall motion, a no-confidence vote or an
impeachment vote.</P>
      <P>While reluctant to comment on the possibility of that he replace
Premier Su Tseng-chang to form a Cabinet if the current Cabinet is
toppled, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said later the same
day that he will deal with new motions referred by lawmakers --
either to recall the president or to topple the Cabinet -- with due
process.</P>
      <P>Wang was also tight-lipped about a proposal raised by Shih
Ming-teh, the former DPP chairman leading an anti-graft campaign
against Chen, that he sponsor political negotiations and invite the
parties concerned to discuss an end to the persistent gridlock
between anti-Chen and pro-Chen forces.</P>
      <P>Wang promised to do his best to help stabilize the situation but
added that he will look to new developments, as KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong are slated to meet in the
short term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSERVATIONIST CALLS FOR BAN AGAINST CIRCUS ANIMAL SHOWS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The founder of the Life Conservationist
Association urged the legislature Friday to amend the law on wildlife
conservation to ban animal shows in circuses.</P>
      <P>Shih Chao-hui, a Buddhist nun and a professor at Hsuan Chuang
University, made the call along with legislators Wang Shu-hui and
Tien Hsiu-chin of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party at the
Legislative Yuan, while she urged people to boycott the Great Moscow
Circus, which began a two-month round-the-island trip Oct. 6 at the
invitation of the New Aspect Cultural and Educational Foundation.</P>
      <P>Shih described circus animal performances as animal abuse and
denounced New Aspect, which arranged for the Moscow Circus to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih said New Aspect has an undesirable history in bringing
foreign circuses to Taiwan, noting that in 1994, New Aspect invited
the Russian Circus, which was later found to have come from an area
affected by an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
      <P>At that time, many of the animals employed by the circus were
refused entry because they had not undergone quarantine before being
shipped to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two years later, New Aspect introduced another circus from
Europe. This time, the group's wildlife trainers and some of bears
working for the circus were held up for some six months after the
group was trapped by a financial crisis and contract disputes.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the broker of cultural and art activities brought into
Taiwan a third foreign circus, whose animals were held in an airport
cargo terminal over a document dispute.</P>
      <P>With such an atrocious records, Shih expressed doubt as to how
New Aspect could be permitted to bring circus animals into the
country over and over again.</P>
      <P>Responding to the question, Hsia Jung-sheng, an official of the
Council of Agriculture's wildlife conservation task force, said that
since New Aspect had applied for the Great Moscow Circus' Taiwan trip
based on the law, there was no reason for the council not to give the
green light.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The quasi-official Taiwan Strait Tourism
Association (TSTA), established to serve as a window for cross-Taiwan
Strait negotiations on Chinese citizens making sightseeing trips to
Taiwan, became operational Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-sheng, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, who serves
concurrently as TSTA chairman, expressed hope that the TSTA will
reach a consensus with its Chinese counterpart, the Cross-Strait
Tourism Exchange Association (CSTEA) at the earliest possible date to
help expedite the tourist opening.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the TSTA will engage in intensive negotiations on
technical details regarding Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists with
the CSTEA, which was established by the National Tourism
Administration of China in August under the authorization of the
Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>The TSTA -- which groups several official and private tourist
associations and associations of airline operators in Taiwan -- is
expected to serve as a boost to expedite the opening of Taiwan to
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The TSTA has a paid-in capital of NT$1 million, with the
government contributing NT$500,000 and five major travel services
associations investing NT$100,000 each.</P>
      <P>As China refuses any official contact with Taiwan, the two sides
have to set up quasi-official travel associations to negotiate and
manage the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's plan, a maximum of 1,000 Chinese tourists
will be allowed to enter Taiwan per day for a maximum 10-day stay.
Chinese tourists are required to "enter and leave in group " and the
host Taiwan travel agency will be fined NT$200,000 for any absconding
Chinese tourist.</P>
      <P>To ensure travel quality, travel agencies must sign a discipline
agreement. Any travel agency that violates the minimum daily travel
expenses of US$80-to-US$100 will have its tourist quota allocation
suspended for one month.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One in every seven concrete workers in
Taiwan have fallen victim to skin disease as a result of allergies
owing to a lack of hazard awareness and prevention methods among the
workers, according to the results of a survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health, shows that the itchiness and pain caused by the disease makes
sufferers lose sleep, which seriously undermines the quality of their
work and life.</P>
      <P>Officials at the institute noted that the hexavalent chromium
contained in concrete is the main source of the allergy and that the
body's absorption of the chemical increases after the skin is eroded
by alkaline, also contained in concrete.</P>
      <P>While some European countries have restricted the level of
hexavalent chromium in concrete to under 2 ppm, the hexavalent
chromium level in locally produced concrete can reach up to 20 ppm,
they pointed out.</P>
      <P>They said the institute has provided guidance to concrete
manufacturers to monitor the hazardous substances in their products,
promoted an improved concrete formula and urged concrete workers to
use plastic gloves or apply barrier cream while at work.</P>
      <P>Experiments have proved that the improved formula does not affect
the firmness, hardening time or color of concrete, and that 84
percent of workers with skin disease have seen their conditions
improve after the switch to safer concrete, they said.</P>

      <P>The Miaoli Prosecutor's Office said Friday
that it would appeal after the Taiwan High Court's Taichung office
overruled a verdict that no compensation should be paid to the
families of six Chinese women who drowned off the coast of northern
Taiwan three years ago. </P>
      <P>At issue was six Chinese women who drowned off Tunghsiao in
Miaoli County after being dumped overboard by human smugglers to
avoid being caught by pursuing coast guard officers in June 2003.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China demanded
compensation on behalf of the victims but the Miaoli District Court
rejected the demand for NT$8 million (US$243,000) in compensation.</P>
      <P>Miaoli Chief Prosecutor Tsai Hsin-hua noted that all 24 Taiwanese
tourists on a cruise ship on scenic Quiendao Lake in China's Zhejinag
Province were robbed and murdered March 31, 1984, and that China paid
no compensation. </P>
      <P>The Chinese women, who were attempted to sneak into Taiwan, were
collaborating with the human smugglers and to compensate them would
not be in conformity with the social perception or in legal context,
he added.</P>
      <P>Although the verdict was overturned by the High Court and most of
the public are sympathetic to the plight of womens' families, the
Miaoli Prosecutor's Office said the women are considered illegal

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The headquarters of an anti-graft campaign
aimed at ousting President Chen Shui-bian will scale down its sit-in
protests from Saturday after being banned by the police, although
campaign spokesman Fan Ker-chin claimed Friday that the decision was
made by the campaign and was to "mitigate the social cost."</P>
      <P>From Oct. 14, the sit-in protest will be held only from 6 p.m. to
10 p.m. at the Taipei Train Station each day -- a development that
came after the Taipei police authorities rescinded a day earlier its
permits for round-the-clock protests originally organized by the
campaign headquarters from Oct. 14-27 on Ketagalan Boulevard in
Taipei, Fan told a news conference.</P>
      <P>The campaign headquarters made the decision the previous evening
after taking into consideration the social costs and public
irritation over the anti-Chen protests that have lasted more than one
month in Taipei, according to Fan.</P>
      <P>The campaign headquarters will not make any new moves until Chen
Jui-jen, a prosecutor in charge of investigating Chen's suspected
role in a scandal related to state affairs expenses claimed by the
Presidential Office on behalf of the president, has come out with a
final judgment on the matter, he went on.</P>
      <P>However, the campaign headquarters will remain firm in its
determination to remove Chen from office, said Chang Fu-chung, one of
the deputy leaders of the anti-corruption campaign.</P>
      <P>But he warned that public disgruntlement might be exacerbated if
the judiciary is believed to be falling short of handling the state
affairs expenses case fairly.</P>
      <P>Chang also criticized the Taipei police authorities' decision to
revoke permits for anti-corruption protests planned by the campaign
headquarters for the Oct. 14-27 period as infringing upon freedom of
expression and the people's constitutional right to demonstrate.</P>
      <P>As the sit-in protests in front of the Taipei Train Station -- a
transit hub of railway and mass rapid transit service -- are allowed
to proceed only until Oct. 18, the campaign headquarters will apply
for an extension through Nov. 1 at the venue, said Lee Hsin, another

      <P>Education authorities in the southern city

parents of schoolchildren over the past two days, seeking ransom
money by falsely claiming that they have kidnapped their children.</P>
      <P>Wang Shui-wen, head of the Education Bureau under the Tainan city

more than 200 phone calls from parents of schoolchildren to check the
whereabouts of their children after being told by ring members to
remit ransom money to a designated account to prevent their
"kidnapped" children from being harmed.</P>

Tainan had received telephone inquires from 80 parents checking to
see whether their children were in school.</P>

The American push to win Security Council

obstacles the United States faces in a similar
push to punish Iran.
The United States circulated a softened

conducted a nuclear test on Monday. The United
States pressed for a vote by Friday, but China
and Russia immediately signaled their
opposition to critical parts of the measure and

a new draft resolution was circulated, and
Reuters quoted the Chinese and Russian

      <P>Taiwan's vision problem is the most serious
in the world, with one-fourth of first-year elementary school
students and 90 percent of college students suffering from poor
vision, Department of Physical Education Director Ho Chuo-fei said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest vision examination report released by the
Ministry of Education (MOE) , 25.7 percent of first-year elementary
school students have vision problems, while in 1996 the percentage
was only 21.28.</P>
      <P>In addition, 64 percent of junior high school students suffer
vision problems, with the percentage growing to 74 percent among
senior high school students and 90 percent among college students.</P>
      <P>Department of Physical Education Director Ho Chuo-feu claimed
that Taiwan students start watching television and using computers at
an earlier age than students in other countries and are exposed to
these radiation devices for a long time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan students also do too many indoor activities that requires
them to use their eyes for a long time, such as reading books and
practicing the piano, while they seldom have time to do outdoor
exercise and give their eyes a rest, he claimed.</P>
      <P>To solve the problem, the MOE is launching a vision project,
hoping to slow down the increase in students' vision problems, and to
decrease the percentage of elementary school students with vision
problems to 24.12 by 2009, he said.</P>

Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday after a second recall motion

      <P>Su made the remark during an interpellation session at the

      <P>Su said that he fully respects the Legislative Yuan's operations
in dealing with the Cabinet-toppling case because it is proceeding

are successful in holding a no-confidence vote on the Cabinet, Su
declined to comment.</P>
      <P>It is the legislature's right to decide whether or not to hold a
no-confidence vote on the Cabinet, while the right to disband the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CAN LEARN FROM AUSTRALIA'S SPORTS SUCCESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's sports development experience
could provide Taiwan with something to learn from, a visiting
Australian university president said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Australia wanted to be good at sports internationally. It
invested and waited for the results. Along the way, a new industry --
the sports-related industry -- was created, " Brian Stoddart,
president of La Trobe University, said in a speech titled "Developing
Sports Success: Thinking about Taiwan and Australia,"</P>
      <P>Australia's failure in the 1976 Montreal Olympics was a turning
point, said Stoddart, who has more than 20 year's experience in
research on sports culture, journalism and policy-making.</P>
      <P>The government decided that the priority was to gain
international recognition in sports, so the bulk of sports budget
went to the top 3 percent or 4 percent of elite athletes. The results
did not show until the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, when Australia climbed
up on the medal chart, Stoddart said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the Australian sports administration has shifted
more of its focus to grassroots and community-based sports,
especially after the success of the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he went on.</P>
      <P>In 20 years, Australia has gone from a "sports failure" to a
country that exports its expertise to the United Kingdom, where many
Australians have been hired in sports administration, Stoddart noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP TO PROPOSE NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
lawmakers will raise a no-confidence motion Oct. 20 at the
Legislative Yuan to topple the Cabinet as a means of pressuring
President Chen Shui-bian to step down, PFP Chairman James Soong said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The no-confidence vote proposal has gained the endorsement of 76
lawmakers out of a total of 220, exceeding the one-third legal
threshold to make it a motion for the lawmakers to vote on, Soong
said. He also thanked opposition Kuomintang lawmakers and
independents for their support for the proposal.</P>
      <P>Soong's remarks came after a motion to recall Chen failed earlier
in the day at the Legislative Yuan after failing to achieve a
two-thirds majority approval -- the second of its kind since late
June -- required for it to be put to a referendum for the public to
decide Chen's fate</P>
      <P>Soong stressed his party's determination to remove Chen from
office, saying that "the PFP is disappointed with the failure but
will never lose its determination to meet the strong public desire
for Chen's ouster."</P>
      <P>"The PFP will not mind losing all its seats in the Legislative
Yuan if a new legislature has to be elected should a no-confidence
vote pass the Legislative Yuan," he added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on concern that Chen will not dissolve the Legislative
Yuan even if a no-confidence motion is voted through by lawmakers,
Soong pointed out that "we are poised to topple the Cabinet as many
times as we can every time Chen appoints a new premier."</P>
      <P>"Top priority for new lawmakers is to push the no-confidence vote
through the Legislative Yuan so as to allow the people to have the
final say on Chen's fate through a referendum," he said.</P>
      <P>"The PFP's resolve to promote a no-confidence vote is not aimed
at Premier Su Tseng-chang, but rather it is a method to depose a
corrupt president through institutionalized means in the face of an
unprecedented constitutional crunch," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>After repairs, clean water free of sediment
is now flowing from four leakage points inside the Hsuehshan tunnel
at 0.3 liters to 0.5 liters per second, an indication that the
tunnel's structure remains safe, a senior government engineer said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Ta-jen, chief engineer of the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications' (MOTI) National Freeway Engineering Bureau, was
talking about leaks 26.2 km into the north-bound tunnel that have
caused safety concerns.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Lee hung-chun, who once
worked as an engineer, claimed that the leaks could lead to a
disaster if they were not fixed properly.</P>
      <P>Workers drilled 14 holes around the leaking spot and water was
flowing from only four of them and not from the other 10, while the
water pressure behind the tunnel wall was also falling, so that the
tunnel's structure can be strengthened, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Since there are no more safety concerns in the leaking area,
traffic on the one lane need not be blocked, he went on. However, he
added, his bureau will ask a team of experts to double check the area
to ensure safety.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Wen-cheng, an area engineering director, said
displacement sensors will be installed at the leaking spot to monitor
geological changes as experts have recommended, so that scientific
data will be available to dispel public doubts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT APOLOGIZES FOR STALLED ARMS PROCUREMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian apologized Friday
to the U.S. government, Congress and people for Taiwan's delay in
passing a bill on procuring three big-ticket weapons that the United
States has agreed to sell Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of young
political elite of the U.S. Republican Party who are on a goodwill
visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush approved a robust arms sales
package to Taiwan in 2001. Since his re-election in 2004, Chen
said his administration has been seeking the
opposition-controlled legislature's approval of a bill that
would pave the way for Taiwan to strike a deal with the Bush
administration on the package, which comprises eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft.</P>
      <P>"Two and half years have passed, but the bill is still pending
legislative approval. I apologize to Bush, the U.S. Congress and
people who have shown their concern and support for Taiwan's
security," Chen told his guests.</P>
      <P>To signify the Taiwan people's will and resolve to defend their
own national security, Chen said, his administration will continue to
communicate with the Legislative Yuan in hopes of winning its consent
to the critical arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>In addition to pushing for an early passage of the bill, Chen
said his administration will also take other concrete steps to beef
up the country's defense capability and prevent the military balance
across the Taiwan Strait from tilting in favor of China, adding that
his administration is determined to raise the country's defense
budget to 2.85 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) next year
and to 3 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Referring to a second failed opposition-initiated recall motion
against him in the legislature, Chen said he hopes the legislature
will from now on focus on deliberation of major bills related to
people's livelihoods and national well-being, including the arms
bill.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan-U.S. relations, Chen said he believes the
coming two years will be a crucial juncture for political
developments in both countries, with the United States holding
mid-term elections later this year and Taiwan holding elections for
mayors of its two largest cities -- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- late this
year, legislative elections next year and presidential election in
2008.</P>
      <P>On North Korea's recent claim that it conducted a nuclear test,
Chen condemned the act as provocative and atrocious. "North Korea's
nuclear development will not only threaten stability in the Korean
penisula but will also impact peace and security in entire Asia, " he
warned.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed worries about China's continued military
buildup and its even-mounting missile deployment against Taiwan,
saying that there have not been any collective security mechanism to
deal with cross-Taiwan Strait disputes. He said a multilateral
dialogue mechanism similar to the six-party talks on the Korean
penisula issues should be created to ensure cross-strait peace and

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE DENIES MISTRUST PROBLEM WITH REP OFFICE IN U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has never
mistrusted the country's two most recent representatives to the
United States, Presidential Office spokesman Lee Nan-yang said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to a U.S. congressional research report that
claimed that the status of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office (TECRO) as Taiwan's full representative to the
United States has been eroded after Chen's Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) came to power in 2000, because the DPP administration is
suspicious that the several chief representatives appointed since
2000 have allegiances to the former ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"The comments were not factual," Lee said, adding that the report
was just a paper compiled by a U.S. congressional research unit that
doesn't reflect the opinions of the U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, there have been many communications channels
between Taiwan and the United States, and all of them have functioned
smoothly and effectively.</P>
      <P>"There have never been mistrust problems with our overseas
representative offices or diplomatic staff, " Lee said, adding that
President Chen fully trusts the country's present representative to
the United States David Ta-wei Lee and his predecessor Chen
Chien-jen.</P>
      <P>Given the country's difficult diplomatic situation, Lee said all
diplomatic personnel deserve recognition and exhortation.</P>
      <P>The report released Oct. 10 by the U.S. Congressional Research
Service was authored by Kerry Dumbaugh, a scholar familiar with the
Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu said U.S.
congressional reports are often written by academics and may not
necessarily reflect Congress' views or stances.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the TECRO is the Republic of China's formal
representative office in the United States, Lu said that the office
has functioned well and that its two most recent chiefs -- David
Ta-wei Lee and Chen Chien-jen -- have consistently enjoyed the
government's full trust and authorization, while their performance
and achievements have received official recognition and applause.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, reports from Washington, D.C. said David Ta-wei Lee
brushed aside the "mistrust" report, pointing out that all the TECRO
staff have high morale and have not been affected by the latest
congressional report.</P>
      <P>"All representative office staff, including myself, have always
put national interests above anything else. We have dedicated
ourselves to fulfilling all the missions and duties authorized by our
government," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP URGED TO SCRAP PLAN TO LAUNCH NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged the opposition People First Pary (PFP) Saturday to scrap
its plan to initiate a no-confidence vote against the premier,
warning that such a move would leave the country inoperative.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, claimed that if
legislators were to pass the no-confidence vote against Premier Su
Tseng-chang, the Legislative Yuan would have to be dissolved in order
to put an end to the ongoing political chaos.</P>
      <P>However, with the law governing the new "single-district,
two-vote" system for legislative elections yet to be enacted, holding
new legislative elections would not be possible, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>This would lead to a situation in which there would be no
legislators and no premier, as well as no Control Yuan members, as
the appointments of the latter have been pending the legislature's
approval over the past year, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong announced Friday that the party will put
forth a motion for a no-confidence vote against Su next week, in the
wake of the failure of a second motion to recall President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the PFP is prepared for the dissolution of the
legislature and new elections after the passage of the no-confidence
vote and that the party will continue to promote a campaign to recall
Chen after the new legislature is formed.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, if the legislature passes a
no-confidence vote against the premier, the premier should resign
within 10 days and can request that the president dissolve the
legislature. New elections should be held within 60 days after the
legislature is dissolved.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday, opposition Kuomintang legislative caucus whip Tsai
Chin-lung said the caucus will call a meeting to decide whether to
support the no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the party is concerned that if the legislature is
dissolved before the enactment of a law on the new electoral system,
it will undermine the fairness of the elections.</P>
      <P>Also, Chen might become even more powerful after the premier is
toppled and the legislature is dissolved, Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT PROPOSES CONSULTATIONS TO RESOLVE POLITICAL DEADLOCK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu suggested
Saturday that the president call a ruling-opposition consultative
meeting to seek to resolve the current political deadlock.</P>
      <P>Lu said she had made the proposal in a letter to President Chen
Shui-bian Friday.</P>
      <P>Calling on both the ruling and opposition parties to "take a step
backward," Lu said the opposition should stop promoting a campaign to
recall Chen and should instead sit down for talks with the ruling
party in a rational manner to facilitate the passage of a number of
important bills.</P>
      <P>Also, the legislature should review and approve Control Yuan
nominations and the appointment of a state public prosecutor-general
as soon as possible to facilitate the fight against corruption, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while attending a conference on human rights
held by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy and the Taiwanese Society
of International Law.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the peaceful conclusion of a month-long
demonstration staged by the "Million Voices Against Corruption"
campaign calling for Chen's resignation is the best testimony of
human rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a victim of the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident who was jailed on
sedition charges for participating in an activity commemorating Human
Rights Day, Lu said it was a comfort to see that law enforcement
authorities used a "rational and gentle" method to advise the
anti-corruption protesters to end their rally themselves Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With many incidents of human rights persecution occurring during
the 38-year period of martial law in Taiwan, the truth behind most of
these incidents still remains unclear to this day, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>While President Chen has ordered the military to "restore the
truth" about these incidents, the government is planning to set up a
human rights memorial park and human rights museum and has made
fairness, justice, happiness and dignity the objectives of its
policy, Lu said.</P>
      <P>To remove the remaining human rights barriers, the country should
review and amend laws that were enacted during the martial law era
and should enact an organic law for the national human rights
commission, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Also, administrative and judicial agencies should promote human
rights education, and educators should make human rights a basic
value of education, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD PUTS FORWARD VISION ON DEVELOPING TAIWAN'S ENVIRONMENTAL INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Tsai Hui-ju)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The total production value of Taiwan's
environmental industry is expected to reach NT$72 billion (US$ 2.18
billion) for this year, and the government has put forward its vision
for developing Taiwan into a main technique-support center of the
industry in Asia, a Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the environmental industry is part of the
service sector, which now contributes over 70 percent to the nation's
GDP. He added that although the environmental industry is often
ignored, its performance, especially in the areas of refuse
incineration and recycling, has been very strong this year.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the council show that the production value
of the environmental industry is expected to grow to NT$72 billion
for this year, up from NT$71.2 billion last year, providing 2,030,000
job opportunities.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that although the industry in Taiwan has a
localized character, it also has an international competitive edge in
technique, equipment and systems integration, adding that the
government is aiming to make the industry more internationalized.</P>
      <P>The government has put forward three visions for achieving this
goal, with the first one being to make Taiwan a leading country in
the industry in Southeast Asia and to build up its brand names by
offering support in environmental systems, equipment and materials,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The second, he continued, is to build Taiwan into a coordination,
promotion and operations center of the industry in Asia, and the
third is to make Taiwan the main technique-support center in Asia.</P>
      <P>The government is also endeavoring to increase Taiwan's
competitive edge in the industry by attending more international
environmental activities, organizing more international fairs in
Taiwan, and attracting foreign investors which can bring in the
latest management and techniques to Taiwan's companies, the spokesman
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOME 90% OF KIDNEY DISEASE PATIENTS NOT AWARE THEY'RE SICK: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent report conducted by the National
Health Research Institutes (NHRI) found that there may be some 1.5
million people with chronic kidney disease in Taiwan and that nearly
90 percent of them are not aware they have the disease.</P>
      <P>According to the NHRI report, the prevalence rate of dialysis
treatment in Taiwan is the second highest in the world, and chronic
kidney disease is the eighth major cause of death in the country.</P>
      <P>The report showed that the chronic kidney disease death rate
surged from 11.39 out of every 100,000 people in 1980 to 20.7 in
2004.</P>
      <P>The NHRI estimated that some 1.5 million people in Taiwan are in
the third to fifth stages of chronic kidney disease, with 6,000 of
them having to receive dialysis treatment, representing the second
highest prevalence rate in the world behind only that of Japan.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chih-cheng, an assistant researcher at the NHRI's Center for
Health Policy Research and Development, noted that among the more
than 1.5 million people with possible chronic kidney disease, nearly
90 percent of them are unaware of their disease, thereby causing
delay in treatment.</P>
      <P>Delay in receiving treatment could lead to uremia, for which
patients require regular dialysis treatment for the rest of their
lives, or even cardiovascular complications, thus increasing the
death rate of the disease, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Among the possible chronic kidney disease patients, nearly 80
percent are in the third stage of the disease, for which there are no
clear symptoms, Hsu said, adding that without being aware of the
threat of the disease, most of these people do not change their
lifestyle and diet to prevent their condition from deteriorating.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the lack of awareness of having the disease is a major
problem, and he suggested the public take advantage of the free
medical checkups provided by the national health insurance system.
People over the age of 40 can receive free health checkups once every
three years, while those over the age of 65 can receive free checkups
once a year.</P>
      <P>The NHRI report will be published in American Journal of Kidney
Disease next month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE CAUTIOUS ON CROSS-STRAIT AGRICULTURAL EXCHANGES: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 60 percent of the Taiwan people
think that the problems resulting from the increase in agricultural
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait cannot be
resolved in the upcoming forum between Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang
and the Communist Party of China, according to results of a survey
released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey was conducted by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) between Oct. 3-5 on 1,018 randomly selected
people around Taiwan. The survey has a margin of error of 3.13
percentage points.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the forum, slated to be held Oct. 17-18 in Boao on
Hainan Island in southern China, can resolve the cross-strait
agricultural disputes, only 26.1 percent of the respondents said that
it can, while 61.5 percent said they don't think so.</P>
      <P>Over 86 percent of the respondents said cross-strait agricultural
exchange problems should be dealt with via a government-to-government
negotiation mechanism, which they claimed is the best way to protect
Taiwan farmers' rights and interests, while 9 percent of the polled
said there is no need for such a mechanism.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether they are concerned about the safety of
"substandard" products imported from China, 88.6 percent of the
respondents said "yes, " while 9.4 percent said they are not
concerned.</P>
      <P>Regarding China's dumping of agricultural products on the Taiwan
market, 76 percent said they are worried about the problem, while
22.3 percent said they are not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 60.6 percent said they are concerned about the
transfer of Taiwan's agricultural technology to China, fearing that
it will gradually erode Taiwan's competitive edge in the sector,
while 30.5 percent said they don't think it is a problem.</P>
      <P>Lai Yi-chung, director of the DPP's China Affairs Division, said
Saturday while releasing the survey results that there are three
serious problems affecting cross-strait agricultural exchanges,
namely the sale of counterfeit Taiwan agricultural brand name
products in China, China's dumping of substandard agricultural
products on the Taiwan market, and Beijing's aggressive move to lure
Taiwanese agricultural technicians to China.</P>
      <P>"If these problems cannot be properly addressed before beginning
efforts to promote cross-strait agricultural exchanges, then
Taiwanese farmers will soon be the victims of such exchanges, " Lai
claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former President Lee Teng-hui expressed Saturday that
he is not opposed to cross-strait agricultural exchanges. However, he
advised in a written statement that all exchanges between Taiwan and
China should be conducted on a reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>Lee also suggested that the government reinforce the mechanism
for protecting the intellectual property rights of Taiwanese farmers
and relevant businesses and set strict regulations on relevant
personnel to prevent technological secrets from being leaked to
foreign countries as part of efforts to maintain Taiwan's
competitiveness in the world market.</P>
      <P>The statement was read at a symposium on agricultural development
held in the southern city of Tainan by Taiwan Advocates, a think tank
founded by Lee in 2001 to promote Taiwan democracy and independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, U.K. REACH CONSENSUS ON SEVERAL ISSUES AT TRADE TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By J.J. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and the United Kingdom reached
consensus on several issues during the just concluded trade talks
between the two sides, visiting Taiwan Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT)
Director General Huang Chih-peng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks one day after the conclusion of the 13th
Taiwan-U.K. trade talks which were held at Britain's Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) in London.</P>
      <P>Huang, Taiwan's representative to Britain Edgar Lin, and other
Taiwanese officials represented Taiwan at the one-day meeting. The
British side was represented by Rosalind McCarthy-Ward, who is the
DTI's director of Trade Operations, Europe
&amp; World Trade; Michael Reilly, representative of the British Trade
and Cultural Office in Taipei; and Asif Ahmad, director of Asia
Pacific, UK Trade and Investment.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that Taiwan's representative office in the United
Kingdom conducted a survey on 155 Taiwan businesspeople operating in
Britain last August. The results of the survey showed that the
average processing time for their applications to work in the United
Kingdom was between one and two weeks, representing a marked
improvement over the waiting period of one to two months previously.</P>
      <P>However, the survey also showed that residence visas still take
between four and seven weeks to process, and Britain's Home
Department also demands that applicants leave their passports with
the department, resulting in inconveniences for Taiwan businesspeople
who need to travel overseas.</P>
      <P>British officials agreed to relay Huang's suggestions on the
matter to the Home Department.</P>
      <P>In addition, the international driver licence issued by Taiwan
is valid for only one year in Britain. If Taiwan national's want to
operate a vehicle in Britain beyond a period of one year, they must
apply for a British driver license and pass the relevant tests,
which Huang said is both time consuming and costly.</P>
      <P>With eight European countries, including France, Italy and
Belgium, recognizing Taiwan's driver licence, Huang urged the
Britain to follow suit.</P>
      <P>The British officials agreed to relay Huang's suggestion to the
related government agencies and estimated that mutual recognition by
Taiwan and Britain of each other's driver licenses will be achieved
within one year.</P>
      <P>On British concerns regarding the protection of intellectual
property rights (IPR), Huang also explained the government's progress
in enforcing relevant laws and cracking down on violators.</P>
      <P>The government will also inaugurate an IPR court in March or
April of next year, and there will be around 40 judges versed in the
field, he said.</P>
      <P>He also said that IPR protection will require cross-border
cooperation, suggesting a strengthening of customs affairs
cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang spoke on the government's strenuous efforts in
promoting the signing of free trade agreements (FTAs) with other
countries.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's FTA with Panama came into effect in
January 2004 and that its FTA with Guatemala came into effect on July
1 of this year. Taiwan's FTA with Nicaragua is expected to come into
effect next year, he added.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan has conducted three rounds of FTA talks
with El Salvador and Honduras and that it will soon begin a fourth

    <HEADLINE>NSC TO ENCOURAGE INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) has
initiated a drive to increase the number of international
collaborative research projects, as well as to boost the number of
such projects between Taiwan and Central and Eastern European
countries, NSC Deputy Minister Yang Hung-duen said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the percentage of published papers and theses
co-authored by Taiwanese and foreign researchers rose from 14.7
percent of the total in Taiwan in 1996 to 18.2 percent in 2005.
However, most of these international collaborations were between
Taiwan and U.S. researchers, he added.</P>
      <P>Yang explained that the figures spell out two problems: namely
that the increase in the number of collaborations between Taiwan and
foreign researchers has not been large enough, and that there is a
need for Taiwan researchers to collaborate with researchers from
other countries besides the United States.</P>
      <P>The total number of published theses produced by Taiwan topped
15,000 last year, ranking the country 18th in the world, Yang said,
adding however that the number of times the published papers were
cited averaged only 2.74 per paper, ranking Taiwan 102nd in the world
in this category.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that since researchers tend to quote the research
results of international teams rather than those from a single
country, the best way to increase the number of times published
papers are cited is to boost the number of collaborative projects
between researchers from Taiwan and other countries.</P>
      <P>To this end, the NSC has already signed dozens of cooperative
memorandums of understanding with governments, institutions and
universities in Central and Eastern European countries, including
Germany, Russia and the Czech Republic to name a few.</P>
      <P>The MOUs usually concern bilateral visits for academic purposes,
grants and scholarships, and funds for international research
projects.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has no need to focus on the Chinese
market in terms of agriculture exports, Council of Agriculture (COA)
Minister Su Jia-chyuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan after he reported on the COA's operations.</P>
      <P>Su noted that the Chinese market only represents part of the
Taiwan agriculture sector's efforts to reach out to the world.</P>
      <P>Currently, Japan is the largest export market for Taiwan
agricultural products, he said. Taiwan's agricultural exports to
Japan accounted for 36 percent of its total agriculture exports,
while its agricultural exports to China only accounted for 10 percent
of the total.</P>
      <P>"It might not be right for Taiwan to rely too much on the Chinese
market, " he said, adding that although Taiwan welcomes China buying
Taiwan's agricultural products, the Chinese market is only part of
Taiwan's efforts to reach out globally.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has no need to deliberately ignore the Chinese market,
nor should it emphasize it," he said.</P>
      <P>Su also questioned the benefits of China's offer of zero tariff
treatment for more than a dozen categories of Taiwan fruit exports to
China since last year, saying that Taiwan growers have not benefited
from the preferential treatment and that their products have
encountered competition from cheap products overseas.</P>
      <P>In the same session, Su also said that the council will soon send
two officials from the Bureau of the Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine to the mouth of the Yangtze River in China
to study the movements of migratory birds there to facilitate
Taiwan's efforts to prevent the outbreak of bird flu on the island.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health's (DOH's) position
is not to encourage Taiwan nationals to receive organ transplants in
China, the director general of the DOH's Bureau of Medical Affairs
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Jui-yuan made the explanation at a public hearing on organ
transplants, which was held by Legislator Lai Chin-teh of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party at the Legislative Yuan after Mainland
Affairs Council chief Joseph Wu condemned a day earlier China's
alleged harvesting of organs from executed Falung Gong practitioners.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said that although China has hosted more Taiwan patients
for organ transplant than any other country has in recent years, his
bureau refuses to list China as a place to receive organ transplants
because of its controversial human rights reputation and questionable
quality in terms of performing operations.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the DOH has also instructed professional medical
care personnel to refrain from arranging organ transplants in China
for Taiwan nationals, Hsueh noted.</P>
      <P>The hearing was also attended by Chou Chang-chin, a prosecutor of
the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, and Taiwan Society of Nephrology
Secretary-General Chen Yung-ming, as well as three human rights
activists from Canada and the United States -- David Matas, a human
rights lawyer who co-authored the Report into Allegations of Organ
Harvesting of Falun Gong Practitioners in China; David Kilgour, a
former Canadian secretary of state for Asia-Pacific and Latin
America; and Wang Wenyi, a China-born pathologist who had worked at
Mount Sinai Hospital in the United States.</P>
      <P>Explaining Taiwan's existing laws regulating citizens receiving
organ transplants in China, Chou warned that it is possible for them
to be charged with murder, or complicity in murder, if it is
discovered that their organ transplants had been the cause of an
individual's execution or murder.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chou's remarks, Chen urged Taiwanese patients to be very
cautious in receiving organ transplants in China, otherwise they
might be "killing another person in order to save their own lives
without even knowing it."</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
both the government and the business sector should seek innovation
and higher efficiency and that the government will do its best to
help industries obtain loans to invest for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with representatives of
more than 20 companies with operations at the Kaohsiung Science Park
in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he has been seeking peace between the two sides
of Taiwan Strait since assuming the presidency in 2000 as he is well
aware that Taiwan's economic development depends on political
stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan should develop itself into an island focused
on high-tech and environmental industries, Chen hailed Kaohsiung
Science Park's efforts in attracting eco-friendly industries.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen also hailed the establishment of the Telecom
Technology Center at the Kaohsiung Science Park, which he said will
significantly help develop the telecommunications industry in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Frank Liao, chairman of the global optoelectronics giant Chi Mei
Group, who was also present at the meeting, said Chi Mei has been

      <P>In view of the great potential of the optoelectronics industry

can obtain loans under a case-by-case project from the government to

      <P>In response, President Chen said the government will do its
upmost to extend help to those industries seeking innovation.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An annual film festival featuring movies
that talk about peace-related subjects can help Taiwanese look at
other parts of the world and reflect on the true meaning of peace,
organizers said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 2006 Peace Movie Festival will screen 14 foreign and domestic
films and documentaries in Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung and Kaohsiung
from Oct. 14 to Nov. 19. The opening film -- a Norwegian movie title
"Gervenkt" -- premiered Saturday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Movies selected in this year's festival feature peace-related
issues from countries such as Norway, Sweden, Serbia, Hungary and the
Baltic countries, said Chien Hsi-chieh, chief executive officer of
the Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan, the festival organizer.</P>
      <P>"I think the Taiwan people can learn a lot from these films. As
the debate on independence and reunification is going on around
Taiwan, we should ask ourselves whether there is a third option, "
Chien said.</P>
      <P>"Everyone has a different definition of peace. However, the
foundation of peace lies in understanding the differences [of both
parties], " he said, adding that the timing of the festival couldn't
be better as the mass rally against President Chen recently halted
after more than a month.</P>
      <P>"The highest realm of culture is that a person understands how to
reconcile with himself, others and nature harmoniously. Peace can be
a hard lesson to learn. It is going to take time and wisdom, " said
Sebastian Liao, commissioner of the Taipei City government's
Department of Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Among the films being shown at the festival are some well-known
movies that created an international buzz in recent years, such as
"Hotel Rwanda" and "Goodbye, Lenin."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MULTILATERAL TRADE SYSTEM TAIWAN'S ONLY OPTION: WTO CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, Oct. 14 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In his first extensive remarks on Taiwan's
position in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Doha Round of
WTO negotiations, Pascal Lamy, director general of the WTO,
pinpointed agriculture and bilateral trade agreements as Taiwan's
major challenges in its external trade.</P>
      <P>Noting "a variety of reasons, " Lamy told a group of journalists
from Taiwan on Friday that bilateral trade agreements is a "less open
road" for Taiwan, increasing the importance of the multilateral trade
regime.</P>
      <P>He further indicated that Taiwan would be even more vulnerable
than other WTO members should the currently stalled Doha negotiations
fail, emphasizing that the multilateral trade system is the only
option for Taiwan, which he said is "absolutely true."</P>
      <P>Lamy urged Taiwan to join the "club of movers" by engaging in
political lobbying and calling more loudly for a resumption of the
stalled negotiations.</P>
      <P>Facing a surge of bilateral trade agreements, Taiwan's government
has decided that pursuing bilateral free trade agreements is its top
priority, despite the tremendous international political obstacles.
Lamy's realistic and candid observation however indicates another, if
not opposite, direction.</P>
      <P>Trade experts have warned that the failure of the Doha round will
incite a new wave of bilateral and regional trade agreements. Lamy
said that he is not worried about the number of bilateral trade
agreements, as long as they are complements, not substitutes, to the
multilateral trade regime.</P>
      <P>Due to the suspension of the negotiations, some voices in Taiwan
supporting agricultural subsidies and high tariffs may feel it is all
over and safe now, but Lamy warned that this impression will make it
difficult when the talks resume and Taiwan has to engage in the
necessary landing zone.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan to "keep sending steam into the machine so that
the temperature will not decrease."</P>
      <P>How to revitalize the negotiations apparently is the biggest
challenge for the head of the international trade body. Lamy insisted
that "failure is not an option, " but he seemed not to be so certain
at one point, as he said "we all hope the resumption of the
negotiations will happen but I'm not sure at all."</P>
      <P>Since the suspension of the negotiations in July, Lamy has
actively conducted what he called "quiet diplomacy" to relaunch the
negotiations. He recently told WTO member states that the window of
opportunity is limited. If there is any chance of completing the
negotiations in 2007, the space to move is somewhere between November
and springtime.</P>

Can't Stave Off New Peril in Senate
As their prospects dim for holding control of

they also could lose their Senate majority on

edge isn't going as far as it used to.
The late cash crunch shows just how much an
already difficult political environment has
worsened for Republicans since the scandal over
Rep. Mark Foley's emails to pages erupted two
weeks ago. For the first time since taking
control of Congress in 1994, party leaders are

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists is
expected to happen soon if cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations on the
matter are conducted shortly, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Tsai Duei said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan and China have recently established the
quasi-official Taiwan Strait Tourism Association (TSTA) and the
Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association (CSTEA), respectively, to
serve as windows for cross-strait negotiations on Chinese citizens
making sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The tourist opening could be realized in November at the
earliest, since all is set concerning this cross-strait effort except
for last-minute talks, " Tsai said at the airport prior to departure
for Hanoi to attend the fourth APEC Tourism Ministerial Meeting
slated for Oct. 16-18.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that the sponsors of the Taipei International
Travel Fair 2006 have invited China to take part in the fair slated
for Nov. 3-6 and that if everything goes as scheduled, Shao Qiwei,
director of China's National Tourism Administration, is expected to
lead the Chinese delegation to the fair.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Wen-sheng, director-general of the Tourism Bureau
under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and
concurrent chairman of the TSTA, who was traveling to Hanoi with
Tsai, said both the TSTA and the CSTEA have become operational
recently and that the TSTA is awaiting a green light from the
Mainland Affairs Council to authorize it to represent Taiwan in
bilateral talks with the CSTEA.</P>
      <P>Tsai, Hsu and other Taiwan officials are expected to exchange
views with their Chinese counterparts on the issue of tourism
exchanges between Taiwan and China during the APEC meeting.</P>
      <P>The host country, Vietnam, has mapped out four main policy goals
for the meeting, including removal of impediments to the tourism
business and investment, increased mobility of visitors and demand
for tourism goods and services, sustainable management of tourism and
enhanced recognition and understanding of tourism as a vehicle for
economic and social development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKERS TO TAKE STRAW VOTE ON NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) will take a straw vote Monday to determine whether they should
support a motion in the legislature seeking to topple the premier and
his Cabinet through a no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Ching-lung, a whip of the KMT's legislative
caucus, told reporters Sunday that there will be no debate prior to
the vote, which will be unrecorded.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that if more than half of the KMT legislators agree
that the Cabinet should be toppled because of its close connection
with scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian, the KMT legislative
caucus as a whole will support the motion for a no-confidence vote
against Premier Su Tseng-chang to be introduced in the legislature
Oct. 20 by the KMT's ally, the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>If the poll results show that fewer than half of the KMT
legislators want the Cabinet toppled, the KMT caucus will ask those
caucus members who have endorsed the PFP motion to withdraw their
sponsorship immediately, he said, adding that the KMT will also put
its own version of the motion on hold.</P>
      <P>Tsai added that it is necessary to gauge the opinion of the KMT
legislators on the issue through the straw vote because it could
affect their own interests if the president decides to dissolve the
legislature after the Cabinet is toppled.</P>
      <P>Whatever the results, the collective decision of the KMT
legislative caucus will be submitted to the KMT's Central Standing
Committee at its Oct. 18 meeting, he said.</P>
      <P>As of Oct. 14, the PFP's motion to topple the Cabinet had
garnered the support of 75 co-sponsors and had passed the required
threshold of having at least 74 sponsors in the 220-seat legislature.
The motion came after a second legislative attempt in four months to
recall the president failed to obtain the required two-thirds
majority support in the legislature last week.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP hold only a slight
majority in the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NCTU ROBOT 'EXPLORER' WINS GRAND PRIZE IN TECO AWARDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A team from National Chiao-tung University
(NCTU) took first prize Saturday in the annual TECO awards with their
innovative design of "Explorer, " a robot combining both two-pad and
wheel movement ability.</P>
      <P>The TECO award was set up by the TECO company 13 years ago to
honor distinguished research and service in areas such as
electrical engineering, biochemistry, biology, urban design, music
and literature.</P>
      <P>The company added a new category of "technological creativity"
this year and awarded its prizes to three teams from NCTU, National
Taiwan University (NTU) and Tam- kang University (TKU), respectively.</P>
      <P>The NCTU team was led by Hu Jwu-Sheng, a professor at the
Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, dedicated
to research and development of robotics. Their creation, Explorer,
has been accepted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) and they have been invited to present the results at
the IEEE 2006 annual forum.</P>
      <P>While explaining the functions of Explorer, Wu Li-Wei -- the
doctoral candidate who created it -- said that Explorer is actually a
combination of two robots -- a two-padded "Papaman" and a wheeled "
Starfish" -- and that the robot can switch between moving on its feet
or on its wheels, depending on the terrain.</P>
      <P>Wu added that while "Starfish" is more like a vehicle, Papaman
could be described as the "mind" of the creation.</P>
      <P>"Papaman" is designed to offer day-care services for babies, he
said. The robot, equipped with a camera capable of wireless
communication, can follow the baby and transmit instant video feeds
either to a mobile phone, PDA, or PC.</P>
      <P>The second and third TECO award prizes went to "PAL 1," made by a
team at NTU's Department of Computer Science and Information
Engineering, and "soccer-playing robots," made by research fellows at
TKU's Department of Electrical Engineering.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BILATERAL TALKS HELP SET UP KMT-PFP COOPERATIVE MECHANISM: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that a recent meeting he had with opposition
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong has helped set the
scene for cooperative mechanisms between the two parties in the
future.</P>
      <P>Ma's comments came after the two met the previous evening to
discuss the recent political situation and reached a five-point
consensus to set a basic tone for future two-way collaboration.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the two parties will continue cooperating to
block a major military procurement bill and on screening the
presidential list of nominees for the Control Yuan members at the
Legislative Yuan. But issues related to toppling the Cabinet or
recalling President Chen Shui-bian must be decided by the KMT's
Central Standing Committee, he said.</P>
      <P>The five-point consensus will help step up KMT-PFP cooperation at
the Legislative Yuan in the future, Ma said, noting that they might
also hold talks about the December's Taipei mayoral election,
although he added that this was not touched upon during Saturday's
talks.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of various public opinion polls, Ma claimed
that the people are tired of the frequent political maneuvering and
said that the legislature has more important tasks to deal with, such
as sunshine bills, central government budget bills and the major
military procurement bill, than launching a presidential recall
motion or a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Ma said that it is more appropriate to consider initiating a
third presidential recall motion or calling a no-confidence vote only
after the prosecution authorities have come up with a final judgment
on Chen's alleged role in suspect state affair expenses claimed by
the Presidential Office on behalf of the president.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's politics must return to normal, " Ma went on, despite
the fact that the PFP is slated to put forward a no-confidence vote
proposal to topple the Cabinet Oct. 20 at the Legislative Yuan in a
bid to put strong pressure on Chen after a motion to recall him --
the second of its kind since late June -- failed last Friday at the
Legislative Yuan to obtain the required two-thirds majority approval.</P>
      <P>Soong announced last Friday that the PFP would raise a
no-confidence motion at the Legislative Yuan the following Friday
after more than one-third of the 220 lawmakers signed up to lend
their support to the motion proposal.</P>
      <P>But the PFP needs the KMT's collaboration to help the motion
clear the Legislative Yuan with the approval of at least 110
lawmakers, as the PFP controls only 22 seats in the legislature,
while the KMT commands 90 seats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEALTH GAP WIDENING ALARMINGLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The gap between Taiwan's rich and poor has
continued to widen in recent years, reaching an enormous 36 times in
2005, according to statistics compiled by a government agency and
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The richest 720,000 households in Taiwan had an average annual
earning of NT$2.1 million (NT$64,024) in 2005, while the poorest
720,000 households made an average annual earning of NT$58,000
(US$1,768) the same year, leaving a gap of 36-1 between the rich and
poor, according to statistics compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The richest NT$2.1 million earnings in 2005 represented an
increase of NT$40,000 from that posted in 2004, while the poorest
NT$58,000 represented a decline of NT$3,000 from the year-earlier
level, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>While there are 500,000 people in Taiwan whose individual wealth
totals over NT$100 million, there are also numerous people who have
committed suicide out of despair over poverty.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the widening gap to the result of the
"winners circle effect" caused by increasing globalization.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the alarming 36-1 times in 2005, Chu Yun-peng,
director of the Center for Economic Development under National
Central University, attributed it to poorly designed government
policies and inefficient implementation of useful policies.</P>
      <P>For example, Chu said, poorly designed tax policies have failed
to tax the rich proportionally, while the poor have been heavily
burdened with taxes.</P>
      <P>Rising unemployment due to the change of industrial structures
has also been another reason for the widening gap, Chu said.</P>
      <P>He cited the result of a survey that his center conducted in
September as indicating that the confidence index for the prospects
for household economic situations for the next six months stands at
54.85 points, the lowest of its kind in five years.</P>
      <P>The professor suggested that relevant government agencies craft
new policies that are more helpful to the poor than the rich in a bid
to turn around the situation of the widening wealth gap.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent Legislator Li Ao registered his
candidacy for Taipei mayor with the city's election committee Sunday,
claiming that he "means business" in his bid to win the year-end
election.</P>
      <P>Li, a noted dissident writer and historian who spent eight years
in prison and has written more than 100 books, is credited for his
contributions to the democratic movement in Taiwan between the 1960s
and 1980s.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he really means business, Li countered with the
question: "Would you spend NT$2 million (US$60,240) just to pretend
you are running?"</P>
      <P>The election law requires each mayoral candidate to pay a NT$2
million deposit, which will be forfeited if he or she fails to get at
least 5 percent of the votes.</P>
      <P>Li said he will go all the way in his election campaign but will
stick to his own style and refrain from canvassing votes or using
posters and banners, although he said he will try to win voter
support by appearing in television talk shows and engaging in public
debate.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is too old to run for Taipei mayor at the age of
69, Li cited examples, saying that Charles de Gaulle was elected
French president at 79, while Ronald Reagan was elected U.S.
president at 74.</P>
      <P>Claiming to represent "a force of righteousness, " Li said
Taiwan's capital city needs a mayor that dares to "confront a bad
central government."</P>
      <P>He said he will do everything he can to defeat the other
candidates -- former Environmental Protection Administration chief
Hau Lung-bin, who represents the opposition Kuomintang, and former
Premier Frank Hsieh, a candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>Li joined the presidential election in 2000 as a candidate for
the New Party. As he usually plays the role of a political gadfly,
his election campaign was seen as largely symbolic and intended as an
attempt to "educate" the people of Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) promised Sunday to help prop up prices of locally produced
bananas in the domestic market after continued falls in recent weeks
due to overproduction.</P>
      <P>According to a COA spokesman, banana prices are expected to
stabilize soon as the council is planning to help promote sales at
home and abroad, including increasing exports to Japan and requiring
more purchases by the military and other public agencies.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported earlier that same day that the average
wholesale price of bananas in central the Taichung and Nantou regions
has dropped to NT$6 per kilogram from NT$12 in the last two weeks as
a result of oversupply.</P>
      <P>The COA official attributed the glut to fine weather this year
and farmers' willingness to grow the fruit as a result of strong
market demand last year.</P>
      <P>He estimated that production for the whole of this year will
increase by 16 percent compared to the average of the last three
years, on the grounds that a total of 10,823 hectares were given over
to bananas this year, a 5 percent expansion over the 2003 level.</P>
      <P>He also urged the public to consume more locally produced fine
quality bananas and said that in addition, the COA would be glad to
see exports to China rise.</P>

forum between the main Taiwan opposition party and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) to demand that the Chinese authorities impose
strict controls on intellectual property rights infringements on
Taiwan products.</P>
      <P>The KMT-CPC forum is slated to be held in Boao on Hainan Island
in southern China Oct. 17-18.</P>
      <P>Liu said it is also hoped that the KMT and CPC delegates will
talk about the establishment of a regular dialogue mechanism to allow
officials from the two sides to exchange views regularly to help
resolve cross-strait agricultural disputes.</P>
      <P>Liu said a great number and variety of renowned Taiwanese
agricultural products have been counterfeited in China and some
Taiwan brand names have even been registered by Chinese traders as
Chinese brand names.</P>
      <P>As the Chinese authorities have made no attempt to stamp out such
illicit practices, these Chinese traders have gone even further by
exporting counterfeit or substandard agricultural and fishery
products overseas carrying Taiwanese trade marks or brand names,
according to Liu.</P>
      <P>This has not only caused concern about the quality of Taiwan
products in the global market, it has also left Taiwan's
international image compromised, he added.</P>
      <P>Liu said that since both Taiwan and China are members of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) , the two sides should talk under the
WTO framework about issues including the transfer of Taiwan's
agricultural technology to China and infringements on the
intellectual property rights of Taiwan-originating agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>Noting that all Southeast Asian countries are allowed to export
their agricultural products to China duty free under the terms of the
WTO, Liu said China granted Taiwan farmers the same privilege only
after a KMT-CPC forum was held in Beijing last year.
This "privilege" -- insecure and full of uncertainties -- was
apparently one of Beijing's "political maneuvers" against Taiwan,
Liu claimed.</P>
      <P>In addition, Liu said, China has been promising Taiwan farmers
that they will see to it that Taiwan agricultural and fishery
products will be exported to China via "speedy and transparent
conduits" to protect Taiwan farmers' interests. This is the basic
practice that any normal country in the world should do, but Beijing
has intentionally politicized it to make it look as if Beijing is
doing Taiwan farmers a big favor, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu has also said recently that Beijing
announced during the first KMT-CPC forum last year that 15 categories
of Taiwan fresh fruit will be allowed to be exported to China duty
free. However, Taiwan's fruit exports to China posted in 2005
declined by 18.7 percent from the year-earlier level, indicating that
Beijing has paid only lip service to Taiwan farmers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung city government sponsored
Sunday an "international vigor day" for school children born to
foreign spouses and their parents in the hope of helping them
integrate into local society quickly.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the fair held at the Jen Ai Elementary
School, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu expressed welcome to the immigrants
settling in the city and promised that the municipal authorities will
do their best to help their children adapt to the local education
system.</P>
      <P>In addition to helping children of foreign spouses, Hu said, the
Taichung city government has also set up a network to offer

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called for the
public Sunday to demonstrate esprit de corps amid the "varied voices"
from different parts of the country.</P>
      <P>During a trip to Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung, Chen
expressed his wish that if divided opinions on the national identity
issue cannot be smoothed out temporarily, the country should at least
try to avoid dividing further.</P>
      <P>He reportedly made the remarks after hearing complaints from
leaders from the Hakka community in the county's Liuduei township
about the recent activities of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign aimed at pushing Chen to step down in the wake
of a string of corruption allegations against himself, his family and
close aides.</P>
      <P>The red-clad members of the campaign, who have rallied and
demonstrated not only in Taipei in northern Taiwan but also in other
cities around the nation, are disturbing social order and the
serenity of Taiwan society, the Hakka community leaders reportedly
complained.</P>
      <P>They also complained during talks with Chen that the Hakka
language will be on the verge of extinction if nothing is done.</P>
      <P>On this issue, Lee Yung-te, minister of the Cabinet-level Council
for Hakka Affairs, claimed that his council has pulled out all the
stops in an attempt to reverse the situation.</P>
      <P>Lee said that in 2002, 90 percent of the Hakka elderly in Taiwan
could speak the Hakka dialect, but only 11 percent of Hakka people
aged below 13 spoke the dialect as their mother tongue.</P>
      <P>As a result of the council's strenuous efforts, Lee said, 15
percent of Hakka people aged under 13 in Taiwan could speak Hakka as
of 2005, making Hakka, along with Welsh and the Maori language, the
third dialect in the world to be saved from extinction.</P>
      <P>Lee said that trying to save the language has been a daunting
task for his council, especially as the council is granted a budget
totaling only NT$1.5 billion annually.</P>

companies to operate some of Taiwan's retirement reserve funds from

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan women are thinner and therefore are
much healthier than their U.S. counterparts, according to a study
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The study, conducted by Dr. Liu Hua-yen, president of the Chinese
Taipei Association for the Study of Obesity, concentrated on the
three measurements of women.</P>
      <P>Liu found most Taiwan women have a rectangular figure, with
chest, waist and hip of the similar sizes . They account for 41.2
percent of all, followed by women with triangular figure, which has
a narrow upper part and a wider bottom, at 38.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Women with an upside down triangular figure which is only seen
among sport players and is considered the healthiest shape stand only
at 1.7 percent.</P>
      <P>However, apple-shaped women who have a large waist relative to
hip size and are considered at a higher risk of diabetes, high blood
pressure and heart disease, account for only 0.8 percent compared to
the 12 percent for U.S. women.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, 18.1 percent of Taiwan women boast the most
attractive and relative healthier sandglass-shaped figure compared to
8 percent among U.S. women.</P>
      <P>The study also showed that 24.1 percent of rectangle-shaped women
have a body mass index of 25 and above and therefore are categorized
as being overweight.</P>
      <P>These women's bodies are likely to become apples in shape unless
they control their diet and exercise more, Liu warned.</P>

The resolution, drafted by the United States,
clears the way for the toughest international

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS PROPOSE RELOCATING CAPITAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 70 legislators have signed a
proposal to relocate the capital to central or southern Taiwan to
help achieve the goal of balanced development in the country.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Tsai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), who initiated the proposal, said at a news conference held at
the Legislative Yuan Monday that relocating the capital away from
Taipei City would also help the international community hear the
different voices of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also noted that many countries around the world have different
political and economic centers. For example, he said, the United
States' political center is Washington, D.C., while its economic
center is New York City, and China's political center is Beijing,
while its economic center is Shanghai.</P>
      <P>He further said that Taipei's development is nearing the
saturation point and that moving the capital to central or southern
Taiwan, where transportation and communications are now convenient,
would help these regions further develop.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that Taipei City is now more like a "Chinatown, "
with 26 percent of the city's population being mainland Chinese and
their offspring, compared with the rest of Taiwan, where "the
mainlanders" constitute only about 13 percent of the population.</P>
      <P>"Relocating the capital could better reflect the true identity of
Taiwan and could also allow the international community to hear more
of Taiwan's voices," he argued.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Kuan-ping of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) , which is an ally of the DPP, urged the public to give
favorable consideration to Tsai's proposal, saying that relocating
the capital will help balance Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>The great majority of lawmakers who endorsed Tsai's proposal are
from the DPP or TSU, with only two legislators from the opposition
Kuomintang -- namely Weng Chung-chun and Chang Shuo-wen.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
denied reports Monday that it is installing a missile base on an
outlying island near China to serve as a launch platform for direct
attacks against China.</P>
      <P>The MND was responding to reports carried by the United Daily

building the nation's first ever "strategic forces" and that the
strategic forces will have a small-scale combat readiness capacity by

      <P>The MND said in a press release that no missile base is being

Taiwan in August to express concern about the matter as reported.</P>
      <P>"The media reports are pure speculation, and the MND regrets that
the newspaper did not first check with the ministry before publishing
them," the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The ministry has followed the strategic concept of "effective
deterrence and resolute defense" in building up the nation's armed
forces to ensure security in the Taiwan Strait, it stressed.</P>
      <P>It further said that it hopes the media will carefully verify its

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu expressed hope Monday that nothing will happen in a
soon-to-begin cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural forum that will have a
negative impact on Taiwan's agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Wu said he expects
that the forum, slated to be held in Boao on Hainan Island in
southern China Oct. 17-18, will be helpful to Taiwan farmers and
fishermen rather than having a disastrous impact on Taiwan's
agricultural sector in the long run.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and Jia Qinglin, chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, will attend the forum,
which is being sponsored by the KMT and the Communist Party of China
(CPC).</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan's official and private sectors are watching closely
to see how the forum unfolds and whether consensus will be reached
during the meeting that would benefit Taiwan's agricultural sector
and farmers in the long run.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu urged Beijing a day earlier to
respect Taiwan farmers' intellectual property rights and create a

      <P>Liu said the KMT should take advantage of the forum to demand
that the Chinese authorities impose strict controls on intellectual
property rights infringements on Taiwan products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTC PROMISES TO LOOK INTO CHINESE TOURISM MARKET MANIPULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to lawmakers' inquiries about
the high costs but low travel quality Chinese tourists usually
encounter in Taiwan, Vice Minister of Transportation and
Communications Oliver F. L. Yu said Monday that he has asked the
Tourism Bureau to look into the matter.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while answering questions at the legislative
transportation committee from opposition People First Party lawmakers
Liu Wen-hsiung and Lee Hung-chun, who expressed concern over the high
prices that Chinese tourists have to pay for low quality sight-seeing
travel in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Yu argued that the situation might be a result of a
price war among local tourist agents, Yu also said that he couldn't
understand why lawmakers said the market is dominated by "a few
people" because more than 120 travel agencies have deposited NT$1
million as guaranty to qualify for receiving Chinese tour groups.</P>
      <P>Yu promised to investigate the matter and take countermeasures to
upgrade travel quality for Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>According to Liu and Lee, travel arrangements for Chinese tour
groups in Taiwan are manipulated by a only a handful of people,
evident in that the board of directors of the recently established
Taiwan Strait Tourism Association (TSTA) comprises only four
government representatives and four private sector representatives.</P>
      <P>The TSTA is a semi-official organization representing the
government in dealing with cross-strait tourism issues with the
Beijing-based Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association (CSTEA).</P>
      <P>Over the past 16 years, a total of 160,000 Chinese tourists from
a third country or area have traveled to Taiwan, but most of them
receive poor treatment and cheap accommodation -- costing as little
as US$25 dollar per day -- even if they pay NT$100,000 for a trip to
Taiwan, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu ascribed the phenomenon to market manipulation by insiders
who control exclusive access to Chinese tourists but then transfer
the business to contractors, who in turn farm it out to
subcontractors.</P>
      <P>In view of an anticipated full opening to Chinese tourists, who
will soon be able to travel to Taiwan directly instead of passing
through a third country or area after the TSTA and CSTEA conclude
bilateral negotiations and reach agreement on the issue, the
government must act on this market manipulation to help protect
travel quality for Chinese tourists in Taiwan, Liu said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not condone the killing
of migratory gray-faced buzzards, a Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
official reaffirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Wu-hsiung, director of the MOI's Construction and Planning
Agency, was responding to media reports that quoted
unidentified bird-lovers as saying on the Web that a mountainous area
in Manzhou, Pingtung County, has reverberated to gunshots by hunters
shooting the birds.
The number of birds killed has hit 5,000 so far, turning the area
into a "killing field," according to the reports.</P>
      <P>The gray-faced buzzard breeds in China, eastern Russia and Japan.
They usually arrive in southern Taiwan to overwinter around Oct. 10,
the Republic of China's National Day, earning the bird the nickname
"National Day" birds.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the birds fly to the Kenting National Park every
year to winter and that the killings hurt the nation's efforts at
conservation.</P>
      <P>But he also claimed that the number of 5,000 being killed is
exaggerated, although any killings at all are "shameful."</P>
      <P>He said the government has been dedicated to educating the public
about protecting wild animals ever since the country's first national
parks were established 20 years ago, and that the efforts have borne
some fruit.</P>
      <P>"For those who refuse to abide by the law, the agency will no
longer just dissuade them from killing, but will begin a strenuous
crackdown," he added.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Kenting National Park has only 30 rangers, he
said he has instructed the rangers to use such methods as ambush and
on-site inspections to intimidate the hunters.</P>
      <P>He also asked local police for assistance and said police rangers
in the Yangmingshan National Park will also provide additional
assistance if necessary.</P>

HIV/AIDS quarantine workers, center head Lin Mei-chu said Monday.</P>

that many people still believe that dining with HIV-carriers or AIDS
patients carries the risk of infection.</P>
      <P>It is necessary for trained people to visit neighborhoods to
educate the ignorant and point out that HIV can only be contracted
through unprotected sexual intercourse, blood transfusions or breast
feeding and that people are not at risk of contracting HIV by simply
having an AIDS patient living next door.</P>
      <P>The previous week, the Taipei District Court ruled that the

(By Tsai Hui-ju)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's latest liver cancer oral drugs
will be provided free to terminal patients of the disease who cannot
afford the drug's high cost, a spokesman for Cheng Ching Hospital in
Taichung City said Monday.</P>
      <P>The new drug, Sorafenib, was donated by two liver cancer patients
from Taichung City and Taichung County who applied for special import
licenses for the drugs but died of cirrhosis before finishing the
treatment, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Human clinical trials of the drug in the United States show that
52 percent of terminal liver cancer patients have a more stable
condition after the treatment, with an average nine-month life
extension, although there might also be slight side effects such as
rashes, fatigue and diarrhea, according to the hospital's Liver Cancer
Treatment Center Director Wang Bo-ming.</P>
      <P>He added that the drug, reputed to be a "magic bullet, " locates
receptors on the surface of liver cancer cells and further inhibits
the cancer cells from proliferating and the blood vessels of cancer
tumors from increasing.</P>
      <P>Liver cancer has a high mortality rate in Taiwan second only to
lung cancer, due to the patients' late awareness of the disease,
unwillingness to have liver surgery and a lack of efficient
treatments, he said.</P>
      <P>Qualified patients for the donated drugs will be eligible
terminal patients of liver cancer who meet the government's low-income
criteria and are aged between 20-75 years old, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Chairman
James Soong will launch a new book Tuesday, PFP spokesman Lee
Hung-chun said Monday.</P>
      <P>The book, titled "Rather to be Liu Ming-chan -- James Soong's
Philosophy of Leadership by Serving, " will spell out the former
Taiwan provincial governor's desire to serve people in the capital
city -- if he gets the opportunity -- as did Liu, the governor of
Taiwan appointed between 1884 and 1891 in the Ching Dynasty, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks suggest that Soong will throw his hat into the ring
in the year-end mayoral election in Taipei as political observers
expect him to do.</P>
      <P>Lee passed over questions on whether Soong would announce his
candidacy the following day, saying only that Soong admires Liu's
contribution to the country's development and aspired to be another
Liu during his own term as Taiwan provincial governor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CONSTITUTION FOR SECOND REPUBLIC 'NOT URGENT TOPIC': KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that a proposed "new constitution for a
second republic" floated by President Chen Shui-bian a day earlier is
not an urgent topic for the Taiwan people and therefore not worth his
comments.</P>
      <P>Chen said at the 80th birthday party of former senior adviser to
the president Koo Kuan-min -- a fervent Taiwan independence advocate
-- that it is time to consider Koo's proposal for a "new constitution
for a second republic."</P>
      <P>Asked about his reaction to Chen's remarks, Ma, who also serves
as Taipei mayor, said the president was not speaking on behalf of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) but was merely expressing
his personal views.</P>
      <P>Pressed on whether he believes the president is moving closer to
the advocates of Taiwan independence, Ma said people can make their
own interpretations.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Chin-lung, a whip of the KMT's legislative
caucus, warned that the president will only hurt the nation's
interests if he keeps talking "irresponsibly" about things that
"cannot be done."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun, a spokesman for the opposition People
First Party, said that by echoing Koo's call for a new constitution
for a second republic, the president was "feeding ecstasy" to the
radical advocates of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Ching-chun, a whip of the DPP's legislative
caucus, pointed out that the relationships between the ruling party
and the major opposition parties are "highly confrontational" at
present and that if the president wants to push for a new
constitution, he must first seek consensus with the opposition.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Cho-shui said bluntly that there is no room
for the realization of a new constitution within Chen's second term,
which has only 19 months left to run.</P>
      <P>Lin said Chen was probably trying to follow the example of former
President Lee Teng-hui by setting "a new constitution for a second
republic" as a long-term goal of his political movement after he
retires in May 2008.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's security head said Monday that
reports about suspected wiretapping of the nation's representative
office in the United States are unfounded rumors.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Shih-ming, director-general of the National Security
Bureau, made the remarks while reporting on the operations of the
bureau as well as intelligence work this year at the Legislative
Yuan's National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Legislators had inquired about media reports that the
representative office in the U.S. is suspected of being bugged and
that secrets could be leaked.</P>
      <P>Hsueh claimed that the secret codes and technology developed by
the NSC make bugging "impossible."</P>
      <P>But he also admitted that one could use gadgets to wiretap
conversations at close distance.</P>
      <P>"But there are regular checks and inspections in every
representative office overseas, " Hsueh said, adding that "if there
are any gadgets or devices, we'll detect them."</P>
      <P>He noted that the main task of the NSC is to collect information,
as well as coordinate, support and integrate intelligence agencies.</P>
      <P>The NSC has an annual budget of more than NT$4.7 billion
(US$143.29 million), which he said is sufficient.</P>
      <P>He also said that the NSC appropriated around NT$150 million to
buy vehicles for guards who accompany the president and vice
president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WRONG TIME TO CALL NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE: KMT CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided Monday not to back a
no-confidence vote proposal planned by the opposition People First
Party (PFP) to topple the Cabinet at the Legislative Yuan, on the
grounds that "the time is not yet right to do so."</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Tsai Chin-lung made the remarks
shortly after a caucus meeting in which some 80 KMT lawmakers
attended and tentatively decided not to support the PFP's planned
move to initiate a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet Friday at
the legislature as a means of pressuring embattled President Chen
Shui-bian to step down.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the attending KMT lawmakers fully discussed
the topic and resolved that "now is not the best time to topple the
Cabinet, despite the fact that it remains one of the options to
demand Chen's resignation."</P>
      <P>The KMT was originally to hold an unrecorded straw vote to gauge
lawmakers' opinions on the PFP's proposal to put forward a
no-confidence motion Friday at the Legislative Yuan, but eventually
dropped the idea and instead held a closed-door meeting to explore
the lawmakers' viewpoints.</P>
      <P>The KMT's policy-making arm -- the Central Standing Committee --
will make a final decision on the party's next move in this regard in
its weekly meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The PFP, which controls only 22 seats in the Legislative Yuan,
won the endorsement of 76 lawmakers last Friday -- exceeding the
legal threshold of one-third approval, or 74 of the lawmakers in the
220-member legislature -- for the proposal to be referred as a motion
to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Although one KMT lawmaker and one Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
lawmaker withdrew their endorsements for the proposal earlier in the
day, PFP is still poised to submit the proposal for lawmakers to vote
on it.</P>
      <P>Despite the sudden change in the situation, the PFP was still
seeking to persuade the KMT to join its efforts to call a
no-confidence vote at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Cheng Chin-ling told a news
conference later in the day that the PFP insists on launching a
no-confidence vote and urged the KMT to stop vacillating because "the
KMT will also need the PFP's collaboration to push bills through the
legislature some day in the future."</P>
      <P>"Now that the KMT sees eye to eye with the PFP that a corrupt
Chen should step down, why does the KMT not support its no-confidence
proposal? " she asked, suggesting that it is because the KMT "has an
axe to grind."</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun said that the KMT's cooperation on
the issue is indispensable and that the PFP is still counting on the
KMT to raise the no-confidence vote proposal Friday after a second
presidential recall motion failed at the legislature last Friday.</P>

Questions Grow Over U.N. Curbs on North Korea
Questions over the effectiveness of the
Security Council's punitive sanctions on North
Korea for its claimed nuclear test grew Sunday,
as both South Korea and China -- the North's
two most important trading partners -- indicated
that business and economic relations would be
largely unaffected.
A day after the Council unanimously passed the
resolution, following nearly a week of intensive
diplomatic negotiations, the South Korean
government said it would still pursue economic
projects with North Korea, including an industrial
zone and tourist resort in the North. Those
projects are not explicitly covered by the
Security Council resolution, but they are an
important source of hard currency for the North.

Wall Street Journal:Heart Medication
Approved for Blacks Faces Uphill Battle
In June 2005, the Food and Drug Administration
made history by approving the first drug authorized
for use in a single racial group.
The drug, BiDil, was cleared to treat congestive
heart failure exclusively in African-Americans. A
clinical trial sponsored by NitroMed Inc., the
drug's maker, showed that within a year of usage,
BiDil reduced deaths by 43% among black patients
who had tried other medicines. It worked so well
that an independent advisory board deemed it
unethical to deny the drug to trial participants
who, for comparison purposes, had been taking a
placebo.
Yet after more than a year on the market, BiDil
is reaching only about 1% of the 750,000 African-
Americans who suffer from heart failure.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Yang Ming-chu and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent annual meeting of the Commission
for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has decided to
slash SBT catch quotas for Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and Indonesia
for next year, Japanese sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to a report in the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, the
CCSBT, which held its annual meeting Oct. 10-13 in Miyazaki on the
southern Japanese island of Kyushu, agreed to cut global southern
bluefin tuna (SBT) catches for CCSBT members and cooperating
non-members by 3,395 metric tons for next year, with the total SBT
global catches totalling 11,530 metric tons for the year.</P>
      <P>As Japanese vessels have exceeded SBT catches in recent years,
the CCSBT decided to cut Japan's catches from this year's 6,065
metric tons to 3,000 metric tons next year.</P>
      <P>The reduced catches for Japan account for nearly 90 percent of
the global reduction for 2006, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In addition, the SBT catch quotas for Taiwan and South Korea will
be each cut by 140 metric tons next year, with the permitted quota
reaching 1,000 metric tons each, while the SBT catch quota for
Indonesia will be reduced by 50 metric tons to 750 metric tons for
2006.</P>
      <P>As SBT catches have accounted for nearly half of Japan's first
class tuna, the quota reduction will make high-class tunas more
expensive, the newspaper said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CAUTIOUS ABOUT ALLOWING BANKS TO INVEST IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) stressed Monday that the government should not allow
China-bound investment by local banks before the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on financial
supervision.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan while
responding to queries by Legislator Lee Jih-chu of the opposition
Kuomintang, who has proposed amending Article 36 of the statutes on
relations between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
remove restrictions on the banking sector's investment in China.</P>
      <P>The proposal asks the government to permit local banks to set up
subsidiaries in China, and suggests the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) serve as top governmental supervisor of the banking
industry's plans for China investment instead of the Ministry of
Finance.</P>
      <P>The proposal has won the endorsement of three lawmakers from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MAC does not oppose commissioning the FSC as top
supervisor for the banking sector's China investment plans.
Currently, however, outbound investment by local enterprises cannot
be made without the approval of the Investment Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, meaning the commission is the
government's "only window" for dealing with local investment projects
in China.</P>
      <P>If the proposal passes, the existing system for managing overseas
investment would be torn apart, Wu warned.</P>
      <P>Wu said that there are 22 countries around the world that have
signed MOUs on financial supervision with China. In this regard, it
would not be in Taiwan's interest if the door is hastily opened
allowing financial enterprises to make investments in China without
the protection of an MOU, he noted.</P>
      <P>Echoing Wu's remarks, FSC Deputy Chairwoman Chang Hsiu-lien said
national safety is a key concern in the issue.</P>

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA)
launched an international architectural competition Monday to design
the largest performing arts complex in Taiwan -- a NT$6.5 billion
(US$200 million) project to create the National Kaohsiung Performing
Arts Center (NKPAC).</P>
      <P>"We hope the arts complex will be the catalyst to begin
bridging the cultural gap between northern and southern Taiwan," CCA
vice chairperson Hong Ching-feng said of the center, which will be
located in the southern metropolis of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second
largest city.</P>
      <P>The NKPAC will occupy the 67-hectare Wei-Wu-Ying Metropolitan
Park (a former military base), and include three theaters and
one concert hall -- providing a total seating capacity of 5,800.</P>
      <P>In addition to the NKPAC's main building, the project
includes the design and planning for the surrounding area,
Wei-Wu-Ying Metropolitan Park and nearby Zongzheng Park.</P>
      <P>Architects from around the world are eligible to enter the
two-stage open competition to secure a NT$702 million contract

office.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully the project will be mentioned in the same breath as

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tensions have mounted in the international
community as a result of North Korea's nuclear test, especially in
Japan and South Korea, reminding the people of Taiwan of
the importance of national defense, scholars said in a forum Monday.</P>
      <P>"The North Korean nuclear issue has allowed Taiwan's people to
understand why Japan and South Korea have made national defense a
top priority," said Academia Sinica research fellow Lin Cheng-yi at
the Taiwan Forum, an event organized by the Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>The nuclear issue has psychological implications for both
Taiwan's government and its people, added Lin, who also lamented
lack of discussion on the issue via public platforms such as the
media, due to anti-corruption protests and political turmoil in
recent months.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has been more 'inward looking' over the past few months,"
Lin said, referring to neglect of the nuclear issue on the part of
Taiwan's media and public, which have paid more attention to domestic
political problems.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the issue on a broader scale, Tamkang University
professor Shih Cheng-feng said the issue was probably good news for
Taiwan, "as long as the People's Republic of China fails to constrain
North Korea on its nuclear program."</P>
      <P>Some political observers believe the United States was in
the past ready to "trade the issue of Taiwan with China in exchange
for China's constraint on North Korea," said David Huang, former
deputy chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>By now the U.S. understands that China "was only pretending it
has influence in North Korea," Huang noted, adding that China has few
resources in the region to constrain North Korea at this moment.</P>
      <P>Focusing on recent developments in Taiwan's domestic poltics and
cross-strait relations, the one-day forum gathered four commentators

by the party's legislative caucus not to endorse a no-confidence vote
planned by the People First Party (PFP) as an attempt to topple the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while fielding reporters' questions on the
issue after the KMT's legislative caucus made the decision earlier
that day. Ma's comments come after the PFP was planning to put
forward a no-confidence vote proposal in the Legislative Yuan Friday
to topple the Cabinet, as a way to continue pressuring President Chen
Shui-bian to resign over a series of corruption allegations.</P>
      <P>Ma said he respected the decision made earlier that day by
nearly 80 KMT lawmakers in a closed-door meeting, but added that the
party's decision-making unit -- the Central Standing Committee --
will make a final decision on the lawmakers' move during its

      <P>"This is the KMT's due process when making a decision regarding a

same procedure when it had to decide whether to collaborate with the
PFP in raising a second motion to recall Chen in the Legislative Yuan
last week."</P>
      <P>Citing the viewpoint of some of the party's legislative caucus
members, Ma said that "most KMT legislators believe there's no
hurry to put forward a no-confidence vote proposal, although it
remains one of the KMT's options to oust Chen."</P>
      <P>"It would be useless to just ask Chen to quit the presidency if
official and government corruption still have to be eradicated," Ma
said, "because it is much more important to set up a sound system and
implement effective measures to serve that end."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) approved
domestic sales of a cervical cancer vaccine known as "Gardasil"
Monday, making it the first cervical cancer-prevention drug to be
marketed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the vaccine mainly targets females aged
between 9 and 26. Those who receive three shots of the vaccine over
six months will be immune to four types of cervical cancer virus or
HPV for at least five years, the officials said.</P>
      <P>A 2005 study project conducted by the Bureau of Health Promotion
found Taiwan's HPV prevalence rate at about 15 percent, with most
cases harmless and a 90 percent recovery rate. However, a long-term
HPV infection may be a sign of cancer, while 90 percent of cervical
cancer patients were infected with high-risk HPV types, warned Wang
Kong-liang, director of the Mackay Memorial Hospital's Department of
Women's Cancer.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs Director General Liao Chi-chou
said the "Gardasil" vaccine has shown to be effective in preventing
cervical cancer that is caused by HPV type 16 and type 18, as well as
genital warts caused by type 6 and type 11.</P>
      <P>National Health Research Institute Director Jacqueline Whang-Peng
said the vaccine is nearly 100 percent effective for those with no
sexual experience, while it only has a 30 percent protection rate for
others with experience.</P>
      <P>She suggested that Taiwanese girls with no sexual experience get
the vaccination at 13 years of age, while scheduling periodical
cervical pap smears after having sex to prevent the onset of the
disease.</P>
      <P>Gardasil is the first cervical vaccine approved in Taiwan
and Asia, and follows on the heels of the vaccine's approval in the
U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union. Another
vaccine, "Cervarix, " is scheduled to enter the Taiwan market by
year's end, with both vaccines requiring an out-of-pocket expense of
NT$3,000 per dose and NT$10,000 for the 3-dose vaccination.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NORTH COAST SCENIC AREA REGISTERS 90% TOURIST GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Tsai Hui-ju)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government efforts to upgrade scenic spots
along the North Coast and Kuanyingshan National Scenic Area have
significantly boosted the area's tourism, which saw a 90 percent
growth in the number of visitors in 2005 over 2003, a spokesman for
the Council on Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The main vision of the government's NT$3.7 billion North Coast
tourism project from 2003 to 2007 is to build an international
seashore scenic area near Taipei, and to integrate the tourism
resources of Taipei, Tamsui, the North Coast, Keelung and the
Northeastern Coast, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>So far, NT$2.4 billion has been invested, helping to spur a
90-percent increase in visitors to the North Coast and Guanyingshan
area -- from 1.16 million in 2003 to 2.2 million in 2005. Also, there
has been a 50-percent growth rate in the Northeast Coast -- from 1.99
million to 3.1 million, according to statistics compiled by the
Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>Several public works have been completed, including the
improvement of service facilities, construction of tourist
fishing ports, renovation of coastal areas, organization
of leisure activity competitions and coordination by government and
civil institutions to push the project, a tourism bureau spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that among the 3.38 million foreign tourists
in 2005, over 30 percent (1 million) had visited the Northeast Coast,
with each person spending over NT$1,000 per day there, bringing
great job opportunities to the scenic areas.</P>
      <P>The government is confident the area will draw more
international tourists after a consistent promotion of leisure

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGED TO PROPOSE KNOCK-YOUR-SOCKS-OFF CONTROL YUAN LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
challenged President Chen Shui-bian Monday to come up with a
knock-your-socks-off list of nominees for Control Yuan seats for
legislative approval.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, who concurrently serves as executive
director of the KMT's central policy coordination committee, made the
call after a KMT legislative caucus meeting in which all caucus
members reached a consensus that the "proposal to topple the Cabinet
remains an option to pressure Chen to resign over corruption
allegations, but Friday is not the most opportune time yet to take
such a drastic action."</P>
      <P>Tseng's call came as a surprise about-face amid a protracted
standoff between rival political camps. Since the term of the
previous Control Yuan expired early last year, the KMT and its
"pan-blue" ally, the People First Party, have repeatedly stonewalled
the inclusion of the Chen-proposed Control Yuan nomination list into
the legislative agenda. As a result, the country's supreme watchdog
body has been standing empty for almost two years.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Chen's previous nominations included some
controversial or unqualified figures, Tseng said he is hopeful that
the president can refer an amazing new list to the Legislature Yuan
for review and approval.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to a brand new list that can knock our socks
off, " Tseng said. "If Chen can propose a list of nominations that
meet public expectations, the KMT caucus would be willing to begin
screening it."</P>
      <P>Although the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" just suffered a fresh
setback last Friday when its second motion to recall Chen failed in
the legislature, Tseng said the KMT still has many things to do.</P>
      <P>"Other than mulling whether to mount another recall motion
against Chen or whether to go ahead with the plan to topple the
Cabinet, we still have many more constructive things to do, such as
scrutinizing the government's general budget plan for the coming
year, pushing for legislation or amendments of a raft of "sunshine
laws" aimed at creating clean politics," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>As to the long-stalled arms procurement plan, Tseng said, the KMT
would also be willing to consider it so long as the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) withdraws an outdated bill.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, the MND has referred two bills related to the
long-talked-about plan to purchase three big-ticket weapons from the
United States -- eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft. Tseng said the executive branch should withdraw the older
one and then the legislature would start to review the later
one.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The combined popularity ratings of Chen Chu
and Loh Chih-ming, candidates of the "pan-green" alliance of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU), exceed those of Huang Chun-ying from the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), according to results of a survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>In the survey -- conducted Oct. 12-13 by Chen's campaign
headquarters -- Chen garnered a support rate of 33.9 percent, while
Huang had 36.6 percent, with Loh registering a much lower 3.5
percent.</P>
      <P>However, if they were the only two candidates in the race, Chen
would get 38.7 percent support while Huang would have 39.2 percent,
the survey indicated.</P>
      <P>In other words, 35 percent of respondents believe Chen is most
likely to become the next Kaohsiung mayor, compared to 31.2 percent
who believe Huang will be elected.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, Chen Chu's campaign manager, said he will not
abandon any efforts to integrate the cooperation of both pan-green
candidates in December's mayoral election, as Chen Chu's popularity
has been steadily increasing recently due to her effective voter
outreach strategies.</P>
      <P>After May, Chen Chu's popularity rate lagged 15 percentage
points behind that of Huang's for some time, when President Chen
Shui-bian's son-in-law was implicated in an alleged corruption
scandal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST CERVICAL CANCER VACCINE ENTERS TAIWAN MARKET(repeat)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) approved
domestic sales of a cervical cancer vaccine known as "Gardasil"
Monday, making it the first cervical cancer-prevention drug to be
marketed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the vaccine mainly targets females aged
between 9 and 26. Those who receive three shots of the vaccine over
six months will be immune to four types of cervical cancer virus or
HPV for at least five years, the officials said.</P>
      <P>A 2005 study project conducted by the Bureau of Health Promotion
found Taiwan's HPV prevalence rate at about 15 percent, with most
cases harmless and a 90 percent recovery rate. However, a long-term
HPV infection may be a sign of cancer, while 90 percent of cervical
cancer patients were infected with high-risk HPV types, warned Wang
Kong-liang, director of the Mackay Memorial Hospital's Department of
Women's Cancer.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs Director General Liao Chi-chou
said the "Gardasil" vaccine has shown to be effective in preventing
cervical cancer that is caused by HPV type 16 and type 18, as well as
genital warts caused by type 6 and type 11.</P>
      <P>National Health Research Institute Director Jacqueline Whang-Peng
said the vaccine is nearly 100 percent effective for those with no
sexual experience, while it only has a 30 percent protection rate for
others with experience.</P>
      <P>She suggested that Taiwanese girls with no sexual experience get
the vaccination at 13 years of age, while scheduling periodical
cervical pap smears after having sex to prevent the onset of the
disease.</P>
      <P>Gardasil is the first cervical vaccine approved in Taiwan
and Asia, and follows on the heels of the vaccine's approval in the
U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union. Another
vaccine, "Cervarix, " is scheduled to enter the Taiwan market by
year's end, with both vaccines requiring an out-of-pocket expense of
NT$3,000 per dose and NT$10,000 for the 3-dose vaccination.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee
passed a resolution Monday demanding that the Ministry of Finance
prevent a proposed merger between Taishin Financial Holding Co. and

    <HEADLINE>CHINA URGED TO HOLD GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT FARM TALKS WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) urged China Tuesday to hold
government-to-government talks with Taiwan on cross-strait
agricultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>They said that China should engage in talks with Taiwan's
government on an equal footing, instead of talking with Taiwan's
opposition party on agricultural exchanges which they believe is an
attempt to cause divisions in Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers made the call as a two-day cross-strait
agricultural forum opened in Boao on Hainan Island in southern China,
with Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and Jia Qinglin, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, attending.</P>
      <P>The legislators pointed out that although the forum is being
sponsored by both the KMT and the Communist Party of China, the
agenda has been set by China.</P>
      <P>They said that cross-strait agricultural exchanges have resulted
in the continued flight of Taiwan capital, technology and talent to
China, while at the same time, Taiwan's agricultural sector has taken
a beating due to low-cost agricultural imports from China.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with Chinese infringement on Taiwan's trademarks,
has seriously impacted Taiwan's agricultural sector, they added.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators said China is attempting to undermine
Taiwan's agricultural sector in a bid to achieve its political goal
of "promoting cross-strait unification through agricultural
exchanges."</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen Hsien-chuang said that China should first
deal with the problem China's infringement on Taiwan's trademarks,
noting that many famous Taiwan brands, such as Hsiluo rice and Kukeng
coffee, that are specialties of certain places in Taiwan have been
registered by Chinese businesspeople in China.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Wei-cher said that if the cross-strait
agricultural cooperation forum cannot solve the infringement problem,
then such cooperation is nothing but "cheating."</P>
      <P>His colleague Cheng Kuo-chung also pointed out that China pays
scant attention to food safety, adding that substandard food products
from China are often found on the market in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example that the Bureau of Standards, Metrology
and Inspection under the Ministry of Economic Affairs discovered in
testing last year that six out of 29 cases of hairy crabs imported
from Shanghai contained carcinogens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAME CHANGE OF STATE FIRMS SHOULD PROCEED IN ORDERLY MANNER: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that
the rectification of the names of state-owned enterprises that
contain the words "China" or "Chinese" should proceed one step
at a time and should not be changed on the spot.</P>
      <P>The premier was responding to reports by the China Times, a local 
newspaper, which said that the Executive Yuan is continuing its
"rectification" campaign in a low profile.</P>
      <P>Su pointed out that it is a fact that many state-owned or
state-controlled enterprises bear identical names with the ones in
China.</P>
      <P>"However, it is also a fact that the names of the state-owned or
state-controlled enterprises have existed for a long time, so the
name-change should not be carried out in one or two days and should
proceed in an orderly manner," he said.</P>
      <P>The news reports said that in the wake of the name change of
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway to the
world, to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport on Sept. 6, the
Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications as well as the Ministry of Economic Affairs in late
September to review the state-owned or state-controlled enterprises
regarding the name-change issue.</P>
      <P>The list of companies to be reviewed include Chinese Petroleum
Corp., China Shipbuilding Corp., China Steel Corp. Chunghwa
Telecom, and China Airlines (CAL), according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CAL said that it has no plan to change its name for
the time being.</P>
      <P>CAL officials said that they are not aware of the "rectification"
campaign being promoted by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>"From the perspective of business as well as based on other
factors, the company has no plan to change its name for the time
being, " the officials said. The 47-year-old CAL was first listed
on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1991. The government-controlled China
Aviation Development Foundation is currently its largest shareholder.</P>
      <P>The officials said that a name-change will have a major effect on
many business agreements as well as the interests of the
shareholders.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) chief
and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that he would do his
utmost to avoid a "pan-blue" split in December's election for Taipei
mayor.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while answering lawmakers' queries on the
issue, which has drawn increased public attention as People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong was reported to announce his bid for
Taipei mayor later the same day. Meanwhile, independent lawmaker Lee
Ao, who closely cooperates with the pan-blue camp, has already done
so, as well as KMT nominee Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>Expressing his "concern" that the three could split the support
of the pan-blue alliance which consits of the KMT and the PFP over
the current development of three pan-blue candidates vying for the
post, Ma said that he would do his best and try every possible means,
such as cross-party negotiations, to make sure the pan-blue alliance
fields only one candidate.</P>
      <P>The pan-blue camp cannot afford to have another split as it had
in the March 2000 presidential election and the 1994 Taipei mayoral
race, Ma stressed.</P>
      <P>As for the question of whether Ma would in person ask Soong or
Lee to withdraw from the race, Ma claimed that he would not rule out
any possibility to achieve that aim.</P>
      <P>Ma also urged all KMT candidates taking part in year-end
elections, including those for Taipei and Kaohsiung city councilors,
never to buy votes and stay away from corruption after being elected.
The KMT is committed to clean politics at both the central and local
government levels, he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPECTED TO ATTRACT US$10 B. OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government expects that Taiwan will
attract US$10 billion worth in foreign investment this year, Minister
of Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to the release of the 2006
World Investment Report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development a day earlier, which showed that Taiwan's ranking in
terms of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows among 140 economies
surveyed around the world dropped to 126th last year.</P>
      <P>The minister said that he doubts the ranking truly reflects the
actual FDI inflows into Taiwan, which he described as a country
enjoying "smooth and sound economic development."</P>
      <P>He added that the government has never ceased in its efforts to
attract foreign investors with its "big investment, big warmth"
policy.</P>
      <P>The UNCTAD report indicated Taiwan received US$1.62 billion worth
of FDI in 2005, or a decrease of US$270 million over the figure for
the previous year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taiwan's "potential index" in terms of FDI inflows
ranked 19th among the 140 economies surveyed, far above the 126th
ranking it posted in terms of actual FDI inflows last year, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>The large gap shows that despite conditions in Taiwan being
favorable for foreign investors, somehow the country has failed to
turn them into concrete results, the report said.</P>
      <P>Explaining the gap, Chen said that since Taiwan is not a U.N.
member, it is possible that the international organization was not
able to obtain enough data about Taiwan's FDI inflows in compiling
the report. He added that his ministry will look into how the
statistics for the report were compiled.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's</P>
      <P>(DPP's) hopes were dashed again Tuesday when the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan once again blocked review of
the long-stalled arms procurement package as well as confirmation of
Control Yuan nominees.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the People
First Party (PFP) , which together form a slim majority in the
220-seat legislature, voted against sending the two issues to the
Procedure Committee for review.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng said the ruling party harbored hope
following recent remarks by KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou that his party
would consider reviewing the arms procurement package and the
confirmation of the Control Yuan nominees.</P>
      <P>Cheng lamented that the party's hopes were once again dashed and
questioned whether opposition legislators had not toed the line set
by Ma.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Policy
Committee, noted that President Chen Shui-bian had said openly
several times that he would consider drawing up a new list of Control
Yuan nominees, adding that if President Chen draws up a new list, the
KMT caucus will agree to the review immediately.</P>

      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh officially
registered as the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) candidate in
the year-end Taipei mayoral election Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the fact that many heavyweight politicians are vying
for the post this year indicates they attach great importance to the
future of the capital city.</P>
      <P>Hsieh promised that if elected mayor, he would accommodate the
different political preferences of residents to make life in the city
more colorful.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, his proposal for Taipei's bid to host the
2020 Olympic Games could accelerate the city's development and help
residents restore their love and trust for each other.</P>
      <P>Also, the bid would offer Taipei residents a collective goal to
work toward and create positive memories and experiences for them to
share in the future, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the International Olympic Committee will vote in 2013
to decide on the host country for the 2020 Olympic Games, Hsieh said
people should not feel pessimistic or lack confidence about the bid,
because Beijing, which lags behind Taipei in terms of its world
ranking, won the bid to host the 2008 Olympics.</P>
      <P>He said Taipei needs a confident mayor who makes something
impossible possible, adding that a pessimistic person is unqualified
for the position.</P>
      <P>Also registering as a candidate in the race Tuesday was Taiwan
Solidarity Union's (TSU) nominee Chou Yu-kou.</P>
      <P>Chou said the year-end election is a "rational race" that
transcends ideological differences.</P>
      <P>Rejecting the possibility of the TSU negotiating with its
"pan-green camp" ally the DPP to field a joint candidate for the
election, Chou said she would participate in the race until the last
minute and not let her supporters down.</P>
      <P>In addition to Hsieh and Chou, Kuomintang nominee Hau Lung-bin

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) got
a new spokesman Tuesday, with Wang Chien-yeh taking the baton from
Michel Lu in a changeover ceremony presided over by Vice Foreign
Minister Chang Siao-yue.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chang, who once served as a MOFA
spokeswoman, said government agencies tend to have mixed feelings
about the media. While government officials hope to publicize major
policy initiatives and achievements through the media, they often
complain that media reports do not accurately present what they want
to convey.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chang said, the job of spokesman for a government
agency is often not an easy one. In this era of democracy that
upholds freedom of the press as a core value, Chang went on, getting
along with journalists has become a crucial part of a government
spokesman's daily routine.</P>
      <P>Chang said Lu has done an outstanding job as MOFA spokesman. "Lu
devoted his full energy to his work and enjoyed doing so. He leaves
big shoes for his successor to fill," she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Wang has all the traits required of a government
spokesman -- eloquence, wit, logical thinking and a passion for his
work, Chang said she believes Wang will be able to take the pressure
of his work in his stride.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lu said that being the voice of a government agency
is a "dangerous job, " as a slip of tongue can have serious
consequences. Given Taiwan's difficult diplomatic situation, he went
on, a MOFA spokesman must make intense efforts to enhance Taiwan's
international profile and visibility.</P>
      <P>Taking over the official seal from Lu, Wang said he feels the
weight of the position. From now on, Wang continued, he will refrain
from expressing his personal views or opinions in public while
conveying messages based on solid facts.</P>
      <P>Wang, a career diplomat who has worked his way up from a
secretarial post, will concurrently serve as director of the MOFA's
Department of Information and Cultural Affairs. He has a master's
degree from George Washington University and graduated from the John

cosmopolitan city by publicly announcing a blueprint for 470
projects, Hau said that he is confident of turning Taipei into "a
brand new city" if elected mayor.</P>
      <P>Hau vowed to live up to his election promises and said that he
strongly believes Taipei residents would not allow smear campaign
tactics to spoil the election.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he thought the candidacies of People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong and Independent lawmaker Lee Ao in the
Taipei mayor election would adversely impact his chances, Hau said
that this would be "unavoidable, " but added that he is determined to
do his utmost to win the race through high ideals and good policies.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hau said that it is Soong's right to participate in
the Taipei mayor election and gave Soong his best wishes.</P>
      <P>The PFP is the KMT's partner in the "pan-blue alliance, " which
also includes the New Party.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a proposal by a group of DPP lawmakers that
Taiwan's capital should be relocated from Taipei to southern Taiwan
as a way to balance regional development, Hau contended that it is
not a pragmatic idea and said he favors Taipei retaining its status
as capital.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Frank Hsieh, the DPP's candidate for Taipei mayor and
a former premier, and Clara Chou, a TV talk show hostess and
candidate for the Taiwan Solidarity Union, have also completed

    <HEADLINE>INDEPENDENT LAWMAKER LAMBASTES KMT FOR 'BETRAYING OPPOSITION CAMP'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent Legislator Li Ao severely
criticized the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Tuesday for
withdrawing its support for a motion seeking to topple the Cabinet
through a no-confidence vote in the legislature.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in the Legislative Yuan, Li said that by
not supporting the motion to be introduced by the opposition People
First Party (PFP) -- the KMT's ally in the "pan-blue alliance" -- the
KMT "has betrayed the opposition camp."</P>
      <P>Terming KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou an "irresolute man," Li pointed
out that instead of taking a straw vote on the matter as it claimed
it would, the KMT asked its legislative caucus to hold a secretive
meeting behind closed doors under the supervision of KMT
Secretary-General Chan Chun-po to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>Li claimed that the KMT leadership had already made a
"pre-determined decision" not to support the PFP motion.</P>
      <P>"The Kuomintang has sold the opposition camp down the river,"
according to Li.</P>
      <P>"Ma has betrayed not only the opposition parties, but also
himself. The trouble for the opposition camp is not that it has a
rival -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party -- but that it has a
friend -- the KMT," he said.</P>
      <P>Li, a noted writer and historian who has been playing the role of
a "political gadfly," said the opposition camp, which currently holds
more than half of the seats in the legislature, "should be making
trouble, raising hell and leaving the ruling party to shoulder the
responsibility."</P>
      <P>He said the KMT should support the motion to topple Premier Su
Tseng-chang and his Cabinet, and that if allegedly scandal-ridden
President Chen Shui-bian appoints a new premier instead of dismissing
the legislature, the opposition camp should introduce another motion
to topple the new premier, and should keep doing this until the
president dissolves the legislature.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP hold a slight majority in the 220-seat
legislature -- short of the two-thirds majority needed to pass a
motion to allow a national referendum to determine whether the
president should be recalled to answer for a series of corruption and
embezzlement scandals.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe that if the president dissolves the legislature
after the Cabinet is toppled through a no-confidence vote, the
opposition camp is likely to control two-thirds of the legislative
seats through a re-election.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus meeting Monday reached the conclusion
that although toppling the Cabinet is still an option for the KMT,
Oct. 20 -- the target date for the PFP to introduce the motion -- is
"not the best opportunity."</P>
      <P>As a result, the KMT legislative caucus immediately ordered KMT
legislators who co-sponsored the PFP motion to withdraw their
sponsorship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE TAKE MORE MEDICINE BUT SPEND LESS: BNHI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan people spend less on
medicine than "people in other countries, " the amount of medicine
that they take is more, an official at the Bureau of National Health
Insurance (BNHI) claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Chao-ming, deputy director of the BNHI's
pharmaceuticals section, the annual per-capita spending on medicine
was NT$6,200 (US$189) in Taiwan in 2004, accounting for 6.2 percent
of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>The figure means that people in Taiwan take medicine worth a
total of NT$143.4 billion per year, including NT$100 billion that is
covered by the National Health Insurance, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He said the annual per-capita spending on medicine is lower than
the US$752 spent in the United States, US$537 in Canada, US$509 in
Japan and US$216 in South Korea.</P>
      <P>However, he said spending less on medicine does not mean Taiwan
people are taking less medicine, pointing out that each prescription
in Taiwan contains three to four kinds of drugs on average, compared
with only one to two kinds for each prescription in the United
States.</P>
      <P>He noted that doctors in Taiwan often prescribed unnecessary
drugs for their patients, which is a waste of medical resources.</P>
      <P>With one-fifth of Taiwan people's medical bills spent on
medicine, Huang predicted that spending on medicine will continue to
increase as the number of people with chronic diseases rises with the
aging of the population.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Chinese official called on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait Tuesday to step up cooperation on
protecting intellectual property rights in the agricultural sector in
order to ensure farmers' interests.</P>
      <P>Jia Qinglin, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, made the call in response to Kuomintang
(KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan's statement that many agricultural
products are being sold in China under Taiwanese brand names,
although they have not originated from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a forum on cross-strait agricultural cooperation,
Lien said that a lot of non-Taiwan produce is being sold in China
using Taiwan trademarks such as "Lishan" and "Alishan, " which have
been registered for pears and tea and wasabi (spice).</P>
      <P>Lien noted that such infringements have affected the interests of
not just producers but also consumers.</P>
      <P>Jia said he will ask Chinese government authorities to strengthen
supervision and management of the market by setting stricter
regulations protecting Taiwan brands of farm products, as well as
maintain the reputation and image of the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>He called on "responsible authorities" on both sides of the
Strait to set up mechanisms to negotiate the authentification and
customs clearance of farm products, the quarantine of animals and
plants and facilitate the transportation of agricultural products.</P>
      <P>He went on to suggest both sides work together to fully cooperate
on the production, supply and marketing of agricultural, forestry,
dairy and fishing products.</P>
      <P>Cooperation in the processing of agricultural and aquacultural
products will increase the added value as well as the competitiveness
of the processing industry, he said.</P>
      <P>Jia stressed that China will definitely make good on its
commitments to the people of Taiwan, a determination that will not be
shaken by the "temporary political turmoil" and "obstruction from a
few people" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The forum, jointly sponsored by KMT think tanks and a research
center of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, seeks ways to "strengthen
cross-strait agricultural cooperation and achieve a win-win situation
for both sides."</P>
      <P>More than 400 delegates participated in the forum, including KMT

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's remarks last
weekend that it is time to consider drafting a "new constitution for
a second republic" has apparently offended the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP) pro-independence ally in the "pan-green camp."</P>
      <P>Legislator Liao Pen-yen, convener of the TSU legislative caucus,
told a press conference Tuesday that every time an election draws
near, the president "teases" the TSU with lip service such as
promoting "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" and
initiating "a Taiwanese constitution."</P>
      <P>As the mayoral and city council elections for Taipei and
Kaohsiung -- the country's two special municipalities -- will take
place in two months, the president has again trotted out a proposal
to draft a new constitution for a second republic.</P>
      <P>"If President Chen really means business about his proposal for a
new constitution for a second republic, I would ask Premier Su
Tseng-chang to clarify whether the central government budget for 2007
is a budget of the first republic or the second republic," Liao said.</P>
      <P>Liao said the TSU will not rule out the possibility of rejecting
the central government budget proposal submitted by the premier to
the legislature.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tseng Tsahn-deng, deputy convener of the TSU
legislative caucus, said the novel terms used by the president before
each election in the past six years have now been replaced by "a
second republic, " and that judging by the president's past
performance, his words have never been matched with deeds.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Chung-yung, general secretary of the TSU
legislative caucus, said that if the president really wants to push
for a new constitution, he should immediately begin negotiations
between the ruling and the opposition parties to reach consensus on
the issue.</P>

Muslim fury over Pope Benedict XVI's public

as calling Islam "evil and inhuman" -- has
subsided elsewhere, but repercussions continue
to reverberate in Iraq, bringing a new level of

Several extremist groups threatened to kill
all Christians unless the pope apologized. Sunni

      <P>Participants in a cross-Taiwan Strait
agricultural cooperation forum adopted a seven-point recommendation
package Tuesday, pledging to continue helping Taiwan farmers sell
their products in China and to crack down on infringement of
trademarks that belong to Taiwan producers.</P>
      <P>The forum was jointly sponsored by Taiwan's main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) , which has
ruled China since 1949.</P>
      <P>They discussed "the opportunities and challenges for agricultural
cooperation after Taiwan's and China's entry into the World Trade

      <P> The seven-point recommendation package is as follows:</P>

      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)

      <P>Wu Ming-min, who boasts a doctorate in agro-economics, was
commenting on a seven-point "joint recommendation" package adopted at
the forum pledging to help Taiwan farmers sell their products in

      <P>Wu said Taiwan's agricultural sector has seen its financial,
technological and human resources "absorbed" by China and yet China
has returned the favor by hitting at Taiwan farm products in the

      <P>The theme of the forum was set by China, with the KMT, Taiwan's

      <P>Setting up direct transport links, which would involve national

    <HEADLINE>ISLET ADMINISTRATOR STRIPPED OF POST FOR FIXING ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tsai Yuan-chen, the elected chief of the
small island township of Wuchiu, which lies 72 nautical miles
northeast of the island of Kinmen, was stripped of his post Tuesday
by a court for election-rigging.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen branch of the Taipei High Court said in its ruling
that Tsai, who ran for re-election Dec. 3, 2005, padded the election
roster of the island with names of his supporters living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Thanks to those fictitious voters -- who registered their place
of residence as the island and traveled there only to cast their
ballots on election day -- Tsai narrowly defeated his rival by only
one vote, 157 to 156, the court determined.</P>
      <P>Because of this, the court ruled Tsai's win as invalid and that
he should be stripped of his post. The ruling is not subject to
appeal. </P>
      <P>Wuchiu, consisting of two islets with a combined area of 2.6
square kilometers, has a population of nearly 500, but only 50 people
of them live there permanently. The islets only link with the rest of
the world is a naval supply ship that sails between Wuchiu and
Taichung City in central Taiwan every ten days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, CENTRAL AMERICAN MINISTERS MEETING ON ENVIRONMENT OPENS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ministerial conference on environmental
protection among Taiwan and its Central American diplomatic allies
opened at the Grand Hyatt Taipei Wednesday with the participation of
eight ministers and other officials from eight countries.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the conference among the environment ministers
of Taiwan, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras and Dominica will serve as a platform for Taiwan to gain
access to business opportunities in these countries regarding
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental
protection efforts, said officials from the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA), sponsor of the conference.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the conference, Deputy Premier Tsai
Ing-wen told the conference delegates that securing balanced
environmental, economic and social development is the only way to
secure sustainable development for nations around the world.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who concurrently serves as convener of the Executive Yuan's
energy technology and policy supervisory committee, said global
weather conditions have been changing drastically in recent years as
a result of overdevelopment, energy waste and excessive carbon
dioxide emissions, with the number of natural disasters increasing
continuously.</P>
      <P>She said the efforts must be made to reduce CO2 emissions today,
or we'll all pay the price later.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is only one Taiwan in the world and only one
Earth, Tsai said a CO2 emissions reduction law was recently passed in
Taiwan as part of the country's efforts to contribute to global
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol or the
U.N. treaty on climate change due to political factors, Taiwan is
more than willing to take part in global activities to better protect
the global environment, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said that Taiwan has been jointly convening with its
Central American allies the conference on integral planning on
sustainable development since 2000. The conference can serve as a
valuable framework for international cooperation, under which Taiwan
can engage in dialogue with its Central American allies on issues
concerning climate change, development of renewable energy, and
recycling technologies, she noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, EPA officials said at the conference that the EPA will
welcome public or private-own Taiwan companies to cash in on
environment-related projects in these seven Central American
countries. Business opportunities will include CO2 reduction
technology and services, the development of renewable energies,
hydraulic power generation, the development of bioenergy, forestation
and forest conservation, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The eight ministers attending the conference are expected to sign
a joint communique on cooperation upon the conclusion of the
conference Thursday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wong Chi-huey, incoming president of
Academia Sinica, pledged Wednesday that he will enrich the talent
pool of the institution to upgrade the quality of its research after
assuming the position.</P>
      <P>Wong, currently director of Academia Sinica's Genomics Research
Center, is scheduled to take over the position Thursday, replacing
Lee Yuan-tseh.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Central News Agency, Wong noted that the
Academia Sinica has made great progress under the leadership of Lee
over the past 12 years and that continuing to improve its research
quality and recruit talent will be the two major challenges in the
future.</P>
      <P>Wong said that in the face of international competition, Taiwan
must integrate any overlapping fields of research and explore fields
with good development prospects.</P>
      <P>While the country has made significant achievements in the field
of information technology, it should not neglect the development of
biotechnology -- the other major field in the high-tech industry,
Wong said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the annual production value of Taiwan's
biotechnology industry accounts for only 0.5 percent of the world's
total of US$800 billion, Wong said this figure indicates that Taiwan
lacks a sound biotechnology industry despite the availability of a
rich bio-tech talent pool in the country.</P>
      <P>According to Wong, Taiwan's biotechnology industry should not
limit itself to producing products such as Chinese medicine,
biogenerics and health food but should continue to innovate and
invent new products.</P>
      <P>The government should also promote the concept of intellectual
property rights protection as a support for invention and creativity,
he said.</P>
      <P>On the recruitment of fresh blood, Wong said Academia Sinica will
strengthen its cooperation with research-oriented universities,
especially the training of doctorate students and post-doctorate
studies.</P>
      <P>He admitted that Academia Sinica faces much difficulty in
recruiting talent mainly because the pay it offers is lower than that
offered by foreign research institutions.</P>
      <P>For example, the pay offered by Academia Sinica is only
one-quarter of that offered by research institutions in Hong Kong and
Singapore and half that of South Korea, he said.</P>
      <P>Wong suggested that the government seek to increase the budget
for Academia Sinica to improve the pay for its research fellows in
order to attract more talent to join the institution.</P>
      <P>He noted that the country's annual spending on technological
development accounts for 2.4 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP) , with the budget for Academia Sinica accounting for only 10
percent of the spending.</P>
      <P>He said the government's plan to increase the spending on
technological development as a percentage of GDP to 3 percent by 2008
is a positive step forward in the country's technological
development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. URGES PRESIDENT CHEN TO LIVE UP TO PROMISES IN INAUGURAL ADDRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Chiehyu Lin and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. State Department urged
President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday to live up to the promises he made
in his inaugural address.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Tom Casey made the remarks when
responding to questions regarding President Chen's recent proposal
that the existing ROC Constitution be frozen to enact a "second
republic constitution" that fits the status quo in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Casey said that the U.S. policy on Taiwan is a "long-standing"
one and that the United States certainly "doesn't want to see any
actions taken by anyone that would unilaterally change the status quo
and certainly expects that any issues that are involved in terms of
cross-strait relations would be addressed through dialogue rather
than unilateral action."</P>
      <P>President Chen pledged in his inauguration speech in 2000 and
again in 2004 that he would not declare independence, not change the
nation's name, not include the "special state-to-state relations"
concept regarding cross-strait ties in the Constitution, and not
promote a referendum on the issue of unification versus independence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department also said Tuesday that it
would not support the Executive Yuan's promotion of a campaign to
rectify the names of Taiwan's state-controlled businesses.</P>
      <P>Such steps would appear to unilaterally change Taiwan's status
and to move Taiwan toward independence, State Department officials
said.</P>
      <P>"In maintaining stability in the Taiwan Straits, the United
States opposes any unilateral steps that would change the status quo.
The United States does not support Taiwan independence and would not
support steps including changes of terminology for
government-controlled enterprises or Taiwan's Economic and Cultural
Offices abroad that would appear to unilaterally change Taiwan's
status," the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan promoted the name change campaign as early as
2004, and then U.S. State Department spokesman Adam Ereli reaffirmed
the United States' position of not supporting it.</P>
      <P>"The United States has an interest in maintaining stability in
the Taiwan Strait. That's what we want to see, and we are therefore
opposed to any unilateral steps that would change the status quo, "
Ereli said at the time.</P>
      <P>"These changes of terminology for government-controlled
enterprises or economic and cultural offices abroad, in our view,
would appear to unilaterally change Taiwan's status, and for that
reason we're not supportive of them," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASTE BATTERY RECYCLING RATE ONLY 12% IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Statistics show that most Taiwan people
lack the habit of recycling waste batteries, with the recycling rate
of used batteries in Taiwan reaching only 12 percent in recent years.</P>
      <P>Claire Chen, manager of the battery manufacturer Duracell, said
Wednesday that Taiwan people use an average of 400 million batteries
a year, with only about 48 million of those batteries being recycled.</P>
      <P>In addition, about 54 percent of the batteries Taiwan people use
are the less durable carbon-zinc batteries, while only 46 percent are
the long-lasting alkaline batteries, which is much lower than the
figure of 90 percent seen in European countries and the United
States, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen added that batteries are often used by children in their
daily life and that therefore, the Taiwan people should be taught
from childhood about the importance of recycling waste batteries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Duracell held an activity at Taipei's Children
Recreation Center Wednesday to promote the concept of battery
recycling. In the activity, children were invited to bring the
batteries they use in their toys to have the "health index" of the
batteries tested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRAVELERS NOT ALLOWED TO BRING IN HAIRY CRABS: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Travelers arriving in Taiwan will not be
allowed to bring hairy crabs into the country from Wednesday, after
traces of carcinogens were detected earlier in the week in crabs
imported from China, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Also from Wednesday, DOH officials said, hairy crabs imported
from China -- also known as Dazha crabs -- will require a food safety
inspection certificate.</P>
      <P>After a consignment of Dazha crabs was discovered Monday by the
Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs to contain carcinogens, six new batches of the crabs
were also discovered to contain cancer-causing substances Wednesday,
the DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials estimated that over 3,000 kilograms of the hairy
crabs imported from China containing carcinogens have been consumed
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's inspection data, the nitrofurans content
in the six new batches of hairy crabs from the Shanghai area averages
between 1.1 ppb and 1.25 ppb, and the batch that was inspected Monday
was identified to have a high nitrofurans content of 4.7 ppb.</P>
      <P>Responding to accusations of negligence leveled against the DOH
for not discovering the presence of nitrofurans in China-originating
hairy crabs earlier, Hsia Tung-ming, director of the DOH's Bureau of
Food Safety, said live hairy crabs had been allowed to be delivered
to Taiwan before inspections were conducted because the crabs have to
be kept alive until they reach local restaurants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president of the company that imports the Dazha
crabs from China said at a news conference Wednesday that all the
crabs listed as "problematic" were distributed by the Taipei Farm
Produce Marketing Company and that officials from the Taipei City
Department of Health had inspected the shipment and determined that
the amount of carcinogens in them was negligible.</P>
      <P>The trader said that about 2,000 of the Dazha crabs had been sold
around Taipei as of Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DENIES WORKING WITH EX-PRESIDENT TO 'EXTINGUISH KMT HEAD'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government Spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan denied
Thursday that Premier Su Tseng-chang is working with former President
Lee Teng-hui to "annihilate" opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Cheng was responding to a magazine claim that Lee has been
pushing a plan to "distance himself from President Chen Shui-bian and
strike at Ma Ying-jeou" and that an Oct. 14 meeting he had with Su
was a step toward realizing that plan.</P>
      <P>Cheng claimed that Su and Lee during that meeting did not even
mention Chen or Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, nor did they
broach the topic of "driving Ma out of the political scene, " as Next
magazine, a popular tabloid, had claimed.</P>
      <P>During the two-hour talk, Cheng claimed, Su and Lee exchanged
views on a wide range of topics, including life philosophy and
current affairs both at home and abroad, and Lee said some good words
about the premier.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the magazine had failed to confirm its claims with the
Executive Yuan and that he was making the clarification for fear that
the magazine's claims would be misleading.</P>
      <P>According to the magazine, Lee and Su are "colluding" to stop the
KMT from winning the Taipei and Kaohsiung municipality elections in
December, thereby blocking Ma's attempts to win the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Part of their joint strategy is for Lee to meet with opposition
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, whom Lee has hated for
a long time and who is now running for Taipei mayor, according to the
magazine.</P>
      <P>Liao Pen-yen, convener of the legislative caucus of the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , which considers Lee its
"spiritual leader," said the TSU certainly would like to drive Ma out
of the political scene because he is "a weak and indecisive leader, "
but he added that he has never heard of a so-called scheme to
"annihilate Ma."</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun, DPP legislative caucus secretary-general, said
it was natural for Su to seek Lee's advice and that Su would likely
be trying to use the meeting to "consolidate" the DPP's ties with the
TSU and "deep-green" electorate -- those who are staunchly pro-Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>In the face of a strong "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and PFP,
he added, the "pan-green camp" should unite together and not be
divided by people trying to make an issue out of Lee's not meeting
with President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun pointed out that relations between
Lee and Soong are like ice and fire and there would be little
likelihood of the two men meeting.</P>
      <P>Lee said the magazine claims could be an attempt by the KMT to
"extinguish Soong under the pretext of an 'extinguish Ma' scheme."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CALM OVER DROP IN SUPPORT RATING FOR TAIPEI MAYORAL CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Wednesday that "business remains as usual, " despite reports that the
support rating for the party's candidate for Taipei mayor was
dropping.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Chan Chung-po made the comment after the
United Daily News reported that day that the support rating for Hau
Lung-bin, the KMT's nominee for Taipei mayor in the December
election, has dwindled to 34 percent from about 50 percent in early
September.</P>
      <P>The newspaper's poll result can be a very good reference for the
KMT, but the ultimate success lies in each candidate's efforts and
what policies he or she puts forward to attract swing voters, Chan
said, ascribing the drop in part to the naming of other candidates in
the race.</P>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party (PFP),
which is the KMT's partner in the "pan-blue alliance, " and
independent lawmaker Lee Ao, who maintains good relations with the
"pan-blues, " both registered their participation in the year-end
Taipei mayor election a day earlier with the municipal election
commission.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou repeatedly said that day he will do his
best until the last minute to make sure that the "pan-blue alliance"
fields a single common candidate because Taipei City is of extreme
importance to the alliance.</P>
      <P>Ma also promised to probe what caused Hau's public support rate
to fall and pledged to provide more assistance for Huang Chun-ying,
the KMT nominee for the Kaohsiung mayoral post in the December
election.</P>
      <P>Despite a decrease in public backing for Hau, he still commands a
comfortable lead over his rivals.</P>
      <P>Soong and Frank Hsieh, a former premier and the Taipei mayoral
candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, enjoyed a
public support rating of 9 percent and 14 percent, respectively,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Lee and Clara Chou, the candidate of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union -- a DPP partner in the "pan-green camp" -- had only
5 percent and 1 percent support, with more than 36 percent of Taipei
City's eligible voters undecided, up from the previous level of 24
percent.</P>
      <P>In response to the KMT chief's fear that a "pan-blue" split might
help the "pan-green camp" grab the Taipei mayoral post, PFP spokesman
Lee Hung-chun made it clear that the PFP is willing to discuss the
issue with the KMT, but he added that it will be pointless for the
KMT to approach the PFP if it only intends to push Soong to withdraw
from the election.</P>
      <P>Public support for Soong "should be much higher" than opinion
polls have detected, and voters in Taipei City are "surely wise
enough" to choose the most capable and experienced aspirant to serve
as their mayor, he claimed.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) urged the government Wednesday to take speedy
action to save Taiwan forests from brown root disease.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chiu Chuan-chin noted that brown root disease
usually develops in arid soil below 800 meters and that currently
there is no way to prevent the disease.</P>
      <P>He expressed worry that the disease could become the "AIDS of
Taiwan forests, " resulting in big losses in the economy and the
landscape.</P>
      <P>He said that at present, only forests in Yilan and north of
Keelung have yet to report the disease and he urged the Forestry
Bureau under the Council of Agriculture to come up with some measures
quickly to save the forests before there is a major disaster.</P>
      <P>He also said that some araucaria heterophylla trees die after
being infected with brown root disease, but they are hard to detect
and that people could be hurt when they topple.</P>
      <P>The disease is caused by fungi that live as parasites on living
host tissue or as saprophytes on dead woody material. The fungus most
often identified as causing the disease is armillaria mellea kummer.
Recent research, however, indicates that several different but
closely related species are involved. Therefore, the generic term
armillaria is used to refer to this group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE FOR CANCER-CAUSING CRAB CASE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relevant government agencies must be held
accountable for a recent controversy involving the import and
consumption of hairy crabs from China that are alleged to contain
carcinogens, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su questioned why travelers arriving in Taiwan were ever allowed
to bring up to six kilograms of hairy crabs into the country in the
first place. He questioned how the customs authorities conduct their
inspections and why they failed to reveal it immediately after some
hairy crabs imported from China were confirmed by lawmakers to
contain the cancer-causing veterinary drug nitrofurans.</P>
      <P>Describing China as the most hostile country to Taiwan in the
world, a country that has imposed the least efficient controls on
food safety in the world and a country from where most of the sham
products in the world originate, Su said Taiwan cannot be too careful
when it comes to the protection of the people's health and interests.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said
Wednesday that after a consignment of the crabs was discovered Monday
by the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs to contain carcinogens, six new batches
of the crabs were also discovered to contain cancer-causing
substances.</P>
      <P>DOH officials also announced Wednesday that with immediate
effect, travelers arriving in Taiwan will not be allowed to bring
hairy crabs into the country.</P>
      <P>The officials also announced that same day that future imports of
live hairy crabs will require a food safety inspection certificate.</P>
      <P>The crabs have been getting shipped into Taiwan for the past
month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Consumer's Foundation accused the administration
Wednesday of negligence for not reporting, or even discovering, the
presence of nitrofurans in China-originating hairy crabs earlier.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Lee Feng-ao said the administration is to
blame over this incident for two reasons: First, the DOH made the
crab ban announcement only after some legislators disclosed the
scandal; and second, when nitrofurans residue was discovered in
imported crabs, the health authorities claimed that the amount was
negligible.</P>
      <P>Actually, Lee argued, the European Union announced a ban in 1997
on the use of nitrofurans in food products and live seafoods due to
the drug's genotoxic and carcinogenic properties.</P>
      <P>Lee called for seafood importers to build a resume system for all
imported seafood indicating point of origin and related information,
and to build their own safety inspection mechanism.</P>
      <P>He also urged the public to refrain from jumping faddishly on the
bandwagon to buy goods, particularly unknown goods, and to
nurture a habit of reading product instructions before using them.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, the blog site run by Webs-tv has seen its visitor
arrivals expand seven-fold over the past year, and the visitor
arrivals at Xuite Blog and Yam Blog have also more than doubled over
the past year.</P>
      <P>Jason Chiang, chairman of the market research company, said the
demographic structure of blog users is changing in Taiwan as blogs
become increasingly popular.</P>
      <P>A similar survey conducted in August 2005 shows that more than 50
percent of blog users were under 29, with 44.7 percent to 59.2
percent being students, compared with 11.3 percent to 20 percent
being office workers, Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>These figures compare with 32 percent to 46 percent of students
as well as 19 percent to 25.3 percent of office workers in August
2006.</P>
      <P>The latest survey indicated that blog users under 29 remain the
majority but that the number of older blog users is increasing,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>For example, more than 40 percent of users of Yam Blog and Sina
Blog are over 30, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian suggested
Wednesday that Taiwan and El Salvador put aside their differences
over certain trade issues to facilitate the signing of a free trade
agreement (FTA) between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Receiving El Salvadoran President Elias Antonio Saca, Chen noted
that Saca's visit had originally been intended for inking an FTA with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, the plan had to be postponed because the two sides had
failed to reach a consensus on sugar export quotas from El Salvador
to Taiwan despite three rounds of talks, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was deeply moved that Saca had come to Taiwan as
planned to show his support for the country and expressed hope that
Taiwan and El Salvador will complete their FTA talks soon.</P>
      <P>Noting that the FTA talks between Taiwan and Honduras have also
been stalled because of a similar problem, Chen said Honduras
President Jose Manuel Zelaya has ordered the relevant authorities in
his country to put aside their differences with Taiwan to speed up
the signing of a Taiwan-Honduras FTA.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the signing of a Taiwan-El Salvador FTA is
urgently needed to attract more Taiwan businesses to invest in El
Salvador.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES CONSUMPTION OF MORE BANANAS TO HELP PROP UP PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged all government
agencies Wednesday to help consume more bananas to prop up the price
of the fruit.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a regular Executive Yuan
meeting to which Council of Agriculture Chairman Su Jia-chyuan
brought several cartons of bananas for Cabinet members.</P>
      <P>Su tapped the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of National
Defense and the Ministry of Education, as well as the Veterans
Affairs Commission, as possible buyers of the bananas.</P>
      <P>The premier said everyone should be thankful that Taiwan has
plenty of quality fruit and agricultural produce at cheap prices and
added that the government should study how to ensure that farmers can
make reasonable profits.</P>
      <P>Su Jia-chyuan expressed hope that all government agencies will
assist in consuming bananas, saying that if the prices can rebound to
NT$8 per kilo, it will help cover the production cost, while if the
prices can be raised to NT$10 per kilo, the farmers will actually
make a profit.</P>
      <P>He noted that the COA has a "stabilize farm produce prices"
project, saying that if the prices of the fruit are low, the COA will
notify all government agencies, while farmers' associations will
deliver the orders directly.</P>
      <P>The COA will also contact the top 100 enterprises in Taiwan to
take the fruit, he added.</P>
      <P>Su said he was disappointed about a cross-Taiwan Strait
agricultural forum that opened a two-day meeting in southern China a
day earlier sponsored by Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang and the
Communist Party of China. The government is not represented in the
forum.</P>
      <P>He said he had hoped China would buy Taiwan bananas, but was
disappointed to find out that "we have to rely on Taiwan consumers."</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said the ministry has a large
"consumer contingency" to consume bananas, with 63,000 prison inmates
under its jurisdiction, adding that the ministry bought large
quantities of pomelos earlier, earning the appreciation of many
farmers' associations.</P>
      <P>Sources noted that the supply and demand of bananas was disrupted
in the wake of a series of typhoons last year. Farmers then focused
on planting bananas and the prices soared to NT$60 per kilo in March
and April this year.</P>
      <P>But oversupply began to show its effect when the wholesale prices
dipped to NT$11 per kilo at the end of June, banana production hit
its peak season in central Taiwan in October, and prices dropped to
below NT$6 per kilo.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
urged the public Wednesday to be on guard against Nigerian
fraudsters.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh made the remarks after the ministry
received several inquiries about the credibility of business and
investment activities conducted by Nigerians.</P>
      <P>Although there have been no reports of people being cheated so
far, the ministry urged the public to be on guard, describing
Nigerian swindlers as notorious around the world and saying that they
should exercise caution when engaging in business with Nigerians.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the ministry has learned that some Nigerians have
collaborated with fraud rings in Taiwan to apply to marry local
people, study or do business in Taiwan. Once they arrive, they often
overstay illegally and use fake documents to engage in fraud.</P>
      <P>Some Nigerians also try to lure Taiwan people into investing in
Nigeria, he added.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that several businessmen recently received inquiries
from Nigerians about their intention to buy scrap railway tracks in
Nigeria, but the ministry said Nigeria is currently building up its
railways, which means that Nigeria's need for railway track should be
increasing rather than decreasing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS OPPOSE TAIWAN FARM EXPORTS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmakers voiced opposition Wednesday to Taiwan
agricultural exports to China, calling it a "blind alley" in
opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) attempts to help promote farmers'
interests.</P>
      <P>DPP legislators Yeh Yi-jin, Charles C. Chiang, Lin Yu-sheng and
Cheng Tsao-min voiced their disagreement over the issue at a news
conference at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, China has only offered "lip service" so far in
this regard and has done nothing concrete to solve the problem of its
infringements upon Taiwan farm produce trademarks and technology,
adding that the Council of Agriculture (COA) has the responsibility
to provide Taiwan farmers with adequate international market
information.</P>
      <P>Since KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan met Beijing officials last
year in China to boost two-way agricultural exchanges, Taiwan farm
exports to China have not increased, although Beijing has put many
incentives in place, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the government should assume responsibility for
failing to promote Taiwan farm produce in the world market, pointing
to the recent glut of locally produced bananas whose wholesale prices
have been falling drastically.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-teh, director-general of the COA's Department of
International Affairs, reported that although the value of Taiwan
farm produce to China accounts for only a tiny portion of the
country's overall agricultural outbound shipments, the government
remains determined to protect farmers' maximum benefits.</P>
      <P>Taiwan insists on holding government-to-government negotiations
on China-bound farm produce exports, supposedly to best secure Taiwan
farmers' interests.</P>
      <P>An agricultural cooperation forum between the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) wrapped up a day earlier on China's
Hainan Island, with the CPC announcing 20 new incentives to help
Taiwan farmers.</P>
      <P>The KMT delegation, led by Lien, was to proceed to Xiamen in
China's Fujian province, where it was scheduled to take part in
across-Taiwan Strait exhibition featuring fruitful results of farm
cooperation projects between Taiwan and China, KMT sources said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan has approved a package
of projects aimed at elevating the quality of Taiwan's manpower,
Minister without Portfolio Lin Ferng-ching said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The three-year package, which accompanies a government plan to
increase Taiwan's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) to
US$30,000 by 2015, is expected to cost NT$25.4 billion (US$765
million) for the 2007-2009 period.</P>
      <P>Under the package, the government aims to decrease the
unemployment rate among people with educational level higher than
university, have 9.1 percent of the fund injected into higher
education coming from donations from enterprises, and increase the
number of research and development personnel to 8.7 per 1,000
employed people in 2009, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>The package will include subsidizing some 1,050 university and
postgraduate students to study abroad during the period and
dispatching students abroad to work as interns at foreign
corporations.</P>
      <P>To further strengthen educational globalization, the government
will try to attract more foreign students to study in Taiwan, from
the current 2,853 students in 2006 to some 8,000 in 2009.</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs chief Lee Ying-yuan said the government
will earmark an additional NT$10 billion to allow each worker to
enjoy a NT$30,000 subsidy per three years to learn second skills.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said that nurturing talent with global
vision is a priority task for the government and that the talent will
not be limited to only nationals, adding that he hopes more talent

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's highest economic planning
agency said Wednesday it will pump NT$540 million (US$16.46 million)
into nine major hot spring areas around the island in an attempt to
attract more tourists.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said the
money will be used to beautify hot spring areas and plan water supply
systems so that the number of visitors to hot springs can reach the
goal of 25 million by 2008.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials noted that tourists made 9.39 million visits to
hot spring areas in 2001 and that the number had increased to 21.51
million visits, up 129 percent, by 2004.</P>
      <P>The officials said that areas with hot springs can usually
attract tourists, but lamented the problems of lack of management and
over-development.</P>
      <P>They cited the example of Taitung County, saying that there used
to be hot springs 100 meters below the ground, but nowadays the bore
has to be between 150 meters and 200 meters.
Adjacent river pollution caused by waste water, as well as
disorderly streets, are also problems that need to be addressed, they
said.</P>
      <P>They added that the Tourism Bureau is currently thrashing out a
hot spring overall development project, targeting the nine major hot
spring areas -- Peitou and Wulai in Taipei, Chiaohsi in Yilan,
Chinchuan in Hsinchu, Chunglun in Chiayi, Tungpu in Puli, Lushan in
Nantou, Guangtzeling in Tainan and Chipeng in Taitung -- as the top
priorities among the hundreds of hot springs around the island.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved a legal
amendment Wednesday under which a woman would have to wait at least
three days after a medical consultation before having an abortion.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said the amendment will better ensure a
fetus' right to life as well as a woman's autonomy, and is expected
to improve personal and family health, as well as social well-being.</P>
      <P>His Cabinet proposed that in addition to seeking medical advice
before signing an agreement to abort the fetus, a woman must also
inform her spouse of the decision. Currently, her husband's consent
is required for the procedure.</P>
      <P>If the spouse cannot be informed, for reasons of being
unconscious or mentally disturbed, or if giving him such information
would endanger the safety of the pregnant woman, then she can make
the decision by herself, noted the amendment.</P>
      <P>As for unmarried, pregnant women under the age of 18, the consent
of her legal guardian must be obtained before she can undergo the
abortion procedure. At present, the law reads "under age" -- loosely
interpreted as between 18 and 20. The revised amendment, if passed,
would clearly set that age at 18.</P>
      <P>If the legal guardian of an unmarried, pregnant woman under 18 is
unable to exercise parental or guardian duties, local social welfare
authorities will make a decision for her based on her best interest,
according to the proposed amendment.</P>
      <P>A medical institution or doctor in violation of the rules will be
fined between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health will try to win the support of political
parties and civic groups for the amendment after sending the proposal
to the legislature for approval.</P>

      <P>Green Island off southeastern Taiwan coast
is likely to become Taiwan's eighth national park next year,
officials of the Construction and Planning Agency under the Ministry
of the Interior said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the Executive Yuan's instructions, the agency has been
working on charting a development plan to transform the island -- one
of the areas in Taiwan most rich in coral reefs -- into an
international eco-marine resort in a bid to preserve the island's
ecology.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's plans to make Green Island into Taiwan's
eighth national park came after Premier Su Tseng-chang inspected the
island in mid-July, and the decision was made during an a cross-agency
meeting presided over by Minister-with-portfolio Wu Feng-shan in late
July.</P>
      <P>In addition, the officials said, the agency also called for two
seminars to be held, in both Taipei and on Green Island, to gauge
public opinion on the proposal.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Green Island may become Taiwan's eighth
national part as early as next year, the officials said, noting that
outlying Tungsha Island is anticipated to become the seventh
national park by year's end.</P>
      <P>Tungsha Island's ecology has noticeably deteriorated in recent
years after the tiny island became a popular tourist destination
for local travelers.</P>

tourism agencies have been engaging in a price war hoping to gain
more tourist dollars, causing a rapid deterioration in the local
environment and adversely effecting the everyday life of local

from 10 p.m. on Oct. 26 so that emergency workers can carry out
drills on evacuation and disaster prevention.</P>
      <P>A bureau spokesman said the original plan to hold the exercises
from 8 p.m. to midnight on Oct. 26 was changed after the Yilan County
government expressed concern that road users might be inconvenienced,
and suggested that the drills be rescheduled to start at 10 p.m. that
day.</P>
      <P>The two main tunnels for eastbound and westbound traffic will
both be closed during the quarterly exercises.</P>
      <P>The 12.9-km tunnel, which opened June 16, has cut travel time
between Taipei and Yilan County from two hours to just 30 minutes. It
is the longest road tunnel in East Asia and the fifth longest tunnel
in the world.</P>

      <P>Four members of a family in flower
business in Kaohsiung City are suspected of having come down with
dengue fever but have refused to cooperate with the government's
disease control measures, a spokesman for the dengue fever disease
control command center said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The family runs a business in the city's "flower street, " the

and flower shop, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also told flower dealers and the public that the
prevention of dengue fever cannot only rely on pesticide spraying but
also needs a through clean-up of the environment that can support
mosquitoes, especially containers in which water can accumulate, to
prevent infestations of mosquitoes.</P>

prevention measures can be fined NT$3,000 to NT$15,000.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Shihlin District Court in Taipei
sentenced a mother and her daughter to five years and two-and-a-half
years in prison respectively on charges of extortion and intimidation
against the late Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo
Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>The court ruling noted that Teng Hsiang-mei, 65, and her
37-year-old daughter Chang Yi-hua had extorted more than NT$200
million from Koo and his family between 1994 and 2004 by claiming
that Chang was Koo's illegitimate daughter, and demanded that if he
and his family did not meet their demands, the "scandal" would be
exposed.</P>
      <P>Koo was a wealthy businessman who led the Koos Group of companies
from 1940 until his death in January 2005. He also enjoyed high
prestige because of his leadership at the SEF -- the Republic of
China's semi-official organization set up to handle technical and
business matters with China.</P>
      <P>Because Koo did have an affair with Teng and was uncertain
whether Teng's claim was true, he paid her NT$39 million in 1994.
Both sides agreed then the matter would not be made public and that
Teng would make no further requests.</P>
      <P>In December 1996, Teng again wrote Koo, threatening that if Koo
did not pay her another NT$18 million, she would hang herself in
front of his wife.</P>
      <P>Fearing that his father's reputation would be damaged, Koo's
eldest son transferred ownership of two of the Koo family's houses to
Teng. But she was not satisfied and demanded that the Koo family pay
her and her daughter an additional NT$15 million, plus a monthly
payment of NT$140,000 to Teng for nine years and NT$65,000 a month to
her daughter for 20 years.</P>
      <P>In 2004, Teng again extorted NT$60 million from the Koo family by
threatening to publicize the affair and cause harm to Koo's
reputation.</P>
      <P>During one of the negotiations, the Koo family managed to take a
sample of Chang's saliva secretly for a DNA test and established
that Chang was not Koo's daughter. The results were further certified
during a formal DNA test conducted by a research institute under the
Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>The lawyer representing Teng and her daughter said his clients
would appeal the ruling.</P>

      <P>Customs officials on the outlying island of
Kinmen began confiscating hairy crabs -- better known locally as
Dazha crabs -- over health concerns Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Customs officials at Kinmen's Shuitou and Liaolo wharves took

province via the "mini three links" route, to bring in up to 6
kilograms of Dazha crabs, but the DOH decided to cancel the provision
earlier in the day after traces of carcinogens, or cancer-causing
agents, were detected in crabs imported from China.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday evening, five cases of Dazha crabs were
intercepted at Kinmen's customs office, officials said. The abrupt
ban drew complaints from passengers, who said the government should
have offered a grace period before the ban's implementation.</P>
      <P>Kinmen customs officials have requested that their counterparts

      <P>Taiwan ranks 35th in terms of globalization
according to the 2006 Globalization Index released by the U.S.-based
magazine Foreign Policy, up one notch over the previous year, a
Cabinet official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The index was based on data from 2004, with a total of 62
countries surveyed.</P>
      <P>Of the four major indicators used to determine the rankings,
Taiwan ranked 12th in terms of economic integration, 33rd in terms of
personal contact, 18th in terms of technological connectivity and
62nd in terms of political engagement, Cabinet spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's performance in political engagement was
unsatisfactory mainly because of China's continued diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan, which has affected the overall globalization
ranking of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that globalization is a world trend, Cheng said the
government has committed itself to creating an internationalized

parties in terms of the ratio of seats each of the parties holds in
the legislature. The Council of Grand Justices ruled in July that the
provision is "unconstitutional" because it infringes upon the
executive branch's power with regard to personnel appointment.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
(RDEC) has come up with a revision to the provision that authorizes
the premier to nominate NCC commissioners for the president to
appoint.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed the draft revision at its weekly
meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The approved draft package also includes new provisions that
allow the Executive Yuan to dismiss unsuitable, unqualified or
incompetent NCC chairmen, vice chairmen and individual commissioners.</P>
      <P>Also included in the package is a "sunset clause" that stipulates
that NCC chairmen, vice chairmen or commissioners who were appointed
before the passage of the proposed law revisions shall lose their
positions on the day when new commissioners are appointed.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Executive Yuan meeting Wednesday, Premier Su
Tseng-chang said the draft revisions are in perfect congruence with
the principles of political accountability and division of power
enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The draft revisions will be referred to the Legislative Yuan for
deliberation and approval. Su said he understands that it won't be
easy for the package to clear the opposition-controlled legislature.</P>
      <P>The premier directed the RDEC and the legislative caucus of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party to step up communications with
opposition parties to seek their support and to enhance the public's
awareness of the Executive Yuan's efforts to uphold the spirit and
provisions of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>In its July 21 ruling, the Council of Grand Justices also ruled
that the NCC will lose its validity by Dec. 31, 2008 at the latest.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's Cabinet meeting, an RDEC-initiated package of
revisions to Article 21 of the Standard Organic Law of Central
Government Agencies that authorize the premier to name the head of a
second-tier administrative agency for the president to appoint
were passed. </P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, the head of a second-tier
government agency should be appointed by the head of the superior
agency with the consent of the legislature.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang and its ally -- the People First Party
-- have voiced strong opposition to the Executive Yuan-proposed law
revisions, pledging to stonewall them on the legislative floor. The
two "pan-blue alliance" parties hold a slim majority in the
legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER HOPEFUL OF TAIWAN-U.S. FTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long
said Thursday he thinks there is hope that Taiwan and the United
States will sign a free trade agreement (FTA), although he added that
he cannot predict when it might occur.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan Foreign Affairs
Committee, Chen said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has
endeavored to initiate FTA talks with major economies around the
world, including the United States, Japan and the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) , as well as with countries
maintaining formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan completed bilateral talks with Nicaragua and
signed in June a free trade agreement, which is expected to take
effect in 2007. Nicaragua is the third country to forge an FTA with
Taiwan after Panama and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>FTA talks have also been underway with El Salvador and Honduras,
and the bilateral talks are expected to conclude by the end of this
year, paving the way for Taiwan to sign FTAs with these Central
American countries, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lee Jih-chu said the MOEA should
spend more of its time and energy pursuing FTAs with countries and
groupings with greater economic clout, such as the new ASEAN Plus
Three group, rather than on small countries like Nicaragua, whose
two-way trade with Taiwan she claimed "translates into nearly zero
economic benefit for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>On relations with the ASEAN Plus Three group, Chen said his
ministry has spared no efforts to bolster exchanges with ASEAN member
countries. For example, he said, Taiwan signed an agreement with the
Philippines last year on the development of an "economic corridor" --
extending from Subic Bay to the Clark Air Base -- from where Taiwan
manufacturing companies will be able to export their products to
other ASEAN countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investors have maintained a very good status in Thailand,
Vietnam and Malaysia, where Taiwan ranks as the third largest source
of foreign capital, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Lee said if Taiwan cannot effectively explore its bilateral
relations with important trade blocks like the ASEAN and the United
States -- which absorb 62 percent and 18 percent, respectively, of
Taiwan's total exports -- Taiwan risks being marginalized on the
global economic stage.</P>
      <P>On the prospects of Taiwan signing an FTA with the United States,
Lee said she is not as optimistic as Chen since the window is closing
fast for substantive consideration of an FTA with Taiwan under the
Bush administration's Trade Promotion Authority, which will expire
July 1, 2007.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
lawmakers accused the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
Thursday of failing to respond quickly to a recent banana glut in
central and southern Taiwan that has caused the fruit to sharply drop
in price.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Cheng Chin-ling and other party
lawmakers, Hsu Yao-chang and Shung Shao-ho, made the comments at a
Legislative Yuan seminar with COA officials, including Agriculture
and Food Agency Director General Tsai Ching-chiang.</P>
      <P>Although there has been a 20 percent increase in banana
production this year as a result of farmers' keen interest to grow it
due to last year's good prices, PFP lawmakers said that the COA must
be held accountable for the dilemma because its forecasting and
monitoring systems have failed.</P>
      <P>Not only were local farmers eager to cash in on the fruit, many
Japanese businessmen also purchased farmland from Taiwan Sugar
Corporation and grew bananas in Taiwan for export to Japan --
something that would certainly hurt local banana shipments bound for
that country, the lawmakers pointed out.</P>
      <P>It is obvious the COA monitoring mechanisms have fallen short of
their functions, damaging Taiwan farmers' interests, they said,
insisting that the COA should assume responsibility for this failure.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the COA has demanded that the state-run Taiwan
Sugar Corporation release no more land for banana farming while
working on a series of promotional incentives to encourage the
government and private sector to consume more.</P>
      <P>COA assessments showed that domestic market demand for bananas
remains stable and that the key to resolving an oversupply is to
explore export outlets, including Japan and countries in Southeast
Asia, Tsai said. He added that the COA is slated soon to launch a
two-week sales promotion in the Japanese market in cooperation with a
Japanese company.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City government has begun
soliciting bids for construction of a cross-harbor tourism cableway
system under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model.</P>
      <P>Prospective bidders are welcome to file applications with the
city government's Urban Development Planning Bureau before Nov. 29,
municipal officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the project will include construction
of a 2.6-km aerial cross-harbor cableway system that starts from the
Shingkuang Pier, crosses the Kaohsiung Harbor and reaches the Chijin
Waterfront Park, plus a cross-harbor Blue Highway, as well as boating
services on the Ai River (Love River in Chinese) -- the spine of the
city and the most famous scenery of Kaohsiung that flows into
Kaohsiung Harbor through downtown.</P>
      <P>The whole project will require an estimated outlay of NT$1.4
billion (US$42.42 million), the officials said.</P>
      <P>After the bid solicitation period expires, the city government
will first review the qualifications of the bidders. In the second
stage of screening, the team that offers the best terms will be
chosen from among all qualified bidders.</P>
      <P>Under the BOT formula, private investors will build and operate
the cross-harbor tourism cableway system as well as relevant boating
services during a specified period of time before transferring
ownership of the facilities to the government.</P>
      <P>The project has long been in the planning, but solicitation of
bids has been delayed because of problems with some technical
details, municipal officials said.</P>
      <P>Once the cross-harbor cableway system is completed, the officials
said, it will integrate the city's mass rapid transit system and
light rail system to enhance tourist transit capacity and operational
efficiency.</P>
      <P>The cableway system is also expected to help develop Kaohsiung
into an international tourism harbor city as the ultimate goal, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>If bid and tender process for the project proceeds smoothly, the
officials said, the new cableway system will be completed in two

      <P>In a press release, the hospital said participants in the three
meetings "unanimously agreed" that Chao's behavior was in severe
violation of medical ethics and damaging to the hospital's
reputation, therefore rendering him "unfit to be an NTU Hospital
doctor." Honesty and integrity are part of the hospital's core
values.</P>
      <P>The decision was sent to NTU President Lee Sze-tsen, who
expressed support and admiration for hospital faculty and staff for
making such a decision.</P>
      <P>Lin Ho-hsiung, the hospital's spokesman, said once an official
notice from the university has been received, the decision will be
implemented.</P>
      <P>Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mao, who once served as director of
Chao's Department of Orthopedics Surgery, said he respected NTU's
decision.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have demanded an eight-year sentence for Chao. His
father Chao Yu-chu, also charged in the same Taiwan Development Corp.
stock-trading scandal, deserves a 10-year jail term, according to
their indictment.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should deregulate the
service sector to enhance its competitiveness, a local economist said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Yang Chia-yen, director of the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research's Research Division VI, the value-added ratio of
Taiwan's service sector stands at 69.37 percent, with earnings
contributing only 46 percent to the added value.</P>
      <P>The figure is lower than most countries which see the percentage
of earnings account for more than 50 percent of the added value of
their service sectors, including the United Kingdom, which registers
a percentage of more than 60 percent, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang said the situation indicates the market scale of Taiwan's
service sector is too small, with the domestic market remaining the
sector's main battleground.</P>
      <P>The limited market scale has made it difficult for Taiwan to
attract foreign businesses to set up operations in the country, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA EYEING NORTHEAST ASIA TO PROMOTE TAIWAN FRUIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) aims to
promote Taiwan produced fruit in Japan and South Korea, where prices
are from four times to 10 times higher than in China, COA Deputy
Minister Lee Jen-Chyuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a legislative committee meeting while
answering questions from ruling Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker
Chuan Suo-hang over Taiwan farm exports to China -- a focal point of
public attention at a time when a delegation of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), led by Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, ended a forum
on agricultural cooperation with Chinese Communist Party officials
Tuesday on China's Hainan Island.</P>
      <P>Chuan demanded the COA take measures to increase local fruit
exports to Japan and South Korea, where he said fruit from Taiwan
enjoys great popularity.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, in July the COA opened a trade promotion center
in Tokyo to give Japanese consumers a taste of the fine quality of
Taiwan's fruit. As the Tokyo center has been warmly received by
Japanese customers, the COA plans to open a new hub in Osaka, he
added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the feasibility of exporting local fruit to South
Korea, Lee said that the quarantine process remains a major problem
to resolve.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan fruit prices in Japan and South Korea are much
better than in China, the COA has been encouraging local farmers to
set their sight on Japanese and South Korean markets, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the value of Taiwan's fruit exports to China
accounts for only a very small portion of the country's outbound
shipments. Although Beijing provides duty-free treatment for 15
Taiwan fruit exports to China, the problem of China's infringement on
Taiwan farm products' trademarks remains serious, significantly
damaging Taiwan farmers' interests, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fruit exports in 2004 and 2005 totaled US$33.82 million
and US$28.22 million in value, US$340,000 and US$1.64 million of
which were shipped to China, respectively, Lee elaborated.</P>
      <P>Although the 2005 export level to China seems to be markedly
higher than the previous year, Lee pointed out that the export value
to Hong Kong dwindled last year, offsetting the growth in exports to
China.</P>

      <P>El Salvador has been an important Central American ally for

      <P>Saca, accompanied by his wife and senior El Salvador officials,

      <P>Taiwan is launching a project to build a Taiwan science park in
El Salvador, so the visit is helpful for El Salvador to better

      <P>Tai said the STSP is part of Taiwan's campaign to build a "green

NT$500 billion for 2006.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts to transplant the science park experience can

    <HEADLINE>ALMOST 20% OF THOSE OVER 55 HAVE OSTEOPOROSIS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost 20 percent of people in Taiwan said
they have been diagnosed with osteoporosis and half of them are
eating an insufficient amount of dairy products, according to a
survey by the Department of Health Thursday.</P>
      <P>The DOH released the survey on the eve of "World Osteoporosis
Day, " which falls on Friday. It found that eight percent of people
aged between 45 and 54 have been diagnosed with osteoporosis, with
that percentage increasing to 16 percent for those between 55 and 64
years of age and 21 percent for those 65 years or older.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that post-menopausal women are much more
likely to suffer from a negative calcium balance than men in the same
age category.</P>
      <P>It showed that half of people 55 years of age and older do not
drink milk or consume enough dairy products, and 40-50 percent seldom
eat soybean products -- another key source of calcium needed to
strengthen bones.</P>
      <P>By contrast, 70 percent of Taiwan's youth under 20 years of age
take three to five servings of eggs, milk or goat milk per week.</P>
      <P>Yang Shu-hua, secretary-general of the Republic of China
Osteoporosis Society, said those with insufficient calcium intake are
more likely to suffer bone fractures, especially the more senior
patients whose eyesight may be poor and those who are partially
paralyzed.</P>
      <P>The best way to prevent osteoporosis is to "keep as much bone
density as possible" while one is still young -- between 25 and 35
years of age -- by exercising and sunbathing, she said.</P>
      <P>Exposing oneself to mild sunshine for 15-20 minutes daily helps
generate vitamin D inside the body, which in turn increases calcium
absorption. Heavy weight training also helps the bones to absorb
nutrients.</P>
      <P>She advised young women not to go too far in their dieting
regimes.</P>
      <P>"Reducing fat at the expense of bone density isn't worth it," she
said, referring to those who follow an excessive diet, making them
more likely to join the high-risk group for developing osteoporosis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP LAMBASTES KMT FOR NOT SUPPORTING MOTION TO TOPPLE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) lashed out at
its ally in the opposition "pan-blue alliance," the Kuomintang (KMT),
Thursday for not supporting a PFP-sponsored motion in the legislature
that would topple Premier Su Tseng-chang and his Cabinet through a
no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>The PFP was to introduce the motion Friday, but after six KMT
legislators withdrew their sponsorship Thursday at the request of the
KMT leadership, the motion's fate became sealed as it had only 68
sponsors left -- short of the one-third threshold of at least 74
sponsors.</P>
      <P>Calling KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou a "spineless jellyfish,"
Legislator Cheng Chin-ling, convener of the PFP's legislative caucus,
said that while the PFP echoed the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign by pushing for a motion to recall scandal-ridden
President Chen Shui-bian and another motion to topple the premier,
the KMT -- the nation's largest opposition party -- did nothing
except try to protect its chairman.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, is the "pan-blue alliance's"
hope to win back power from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
in the 2008 presidential election. Senior KMT officials around him
seem reluctant to make any moves that might harm his chances of
getting elected.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, the KMT decided that its lawmakers will not
support the PFP motion to topple the premier, but will prepare its
own version of the motion ready for use when the party decides the
time is ripe.</P>
      <P>Cheng claimed that as a result of Ma's "do-nothingism," the
anti-graft campaign has almost become a spent force and that his
vacillation and indecisiveness has also caused KMT Taipei mayoral
candidate Hau Lung-bin's approval rating to plunge from 50 percent to
34 percent, according to a recent opinion poll.</P>
      <P>She further claimed that Ma cannot be expected to win the 2008
presidential election.</P>

      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT)
Taipei office hopes a new online scheduling system can provide better
consular service for U.S. citizens, AIT consular officials
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Beginning Nov. 6, applications for all services will be accepted
by appointment only using the free online scheduling system,
which will begin accepting appointments on Oct. 23, said Charles
Bennett, AIT's Consular Section chief during a press conference.</P>
      <P>The full-scale online system will cover appointments
regarding passports, notarial and social security and consular
reports of births abroad, he said.</P>
      <P>More than 70,000 U.S. citizens are currently living in Taiwan,
Bennett said, adding that extensive bilateral exchanges between
Taiwan and the U.S. are making the AIT in Taipei the busiest office
in Asia in terms of consular services.</P>
      <P>The office deals with as many as 200 applications per day during
the busiest season, said Grace Liu, who works in AIT's American
Citizen Services.</P>
      <P>The new system does not necessarily help the AIT handle more
daily applications, Bennett said, but it helps cut down applicants'
waiting time and visits to the office.</P>
      <P>Consular assistance is always available without appointment in
case of emergencies such as life-and-death situations, arrest and
indigence, Bennett noted.</P>

travel market if business on their current routes is seriously
hindered by the north-south high speed train system that is slated to
start operations later this year, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the CAA will judge whether carriers
are permitted to stop operating their domestic routes pending the
extent to which their business is affected by the new railway. The
CAA will agree to the withdrawal if carriers' assessments prove an
actual and noticeable deterioration in passenger loads, he explained.</P>
      <P>Taipei-Taichung air travel is forecast to undergo the biggest
impact when the new service begins, according to Mandarin Airlines,
which is the sole operator on the route.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines said that it expects air passengers between
Taipei and Taichung to be lured away by the high speed train.</P>
      <P>Since the airport in Taichung was relocated from Shuinan near the
city center to Chingchuankang, the carrier has been forced to reduce
its daily flights from more than 10 to the present level of four, a
Mandarin Airlines spokesman said.</P>
      <P>UNI Airways Corp., the only aviation company operating the
Taipei-Chiayi route, said that it is prepared to slash its present
nine daily fights in anticipation of the inauguration of the rail
system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, aviation companies that ply the "golden route" between
Taipei and Kaohsiung said that they do not expect their business to
be much affected in the initial stages because the number of
passengers flying between the two largest cities is relatively high.</P>
      <P>Far East Air Transport Corp. and Trans Asia Airways said that the
impact on their Taipei-Tainan air travel business should also be
limited, as the high speed train station in Tainan City is some way
from the city center, while the airport is close to downtown.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A series of 13 forums will be staged for
Taipei citizens to voice their views about what their city should be
like in the years ahead, as five candidates have registered to run
for mayor and a new city council will be elected in December.</P>
      <P>The Public TV System (PTS) and Taipei Community College are
inviting non-profit organizations to recommend members of the public
for the first such forum scheduled for Oct. 21-22, which will be held
in the format of a "study circle."</P>
      <P>"Study circle" participants are advised to tell their personal
and community experiences and listen to those of others in a bid to
formulate a consensus on major issues related to their daily lives
and city development.</P>
      <P>The forum will first try to define issues to be discussed, such
as how city government policy affects residents, discuss a vision for
their city, gather all different views and then come to a conclusion
-- in the form of a concrete proposal.</P>
      <P>Participants will have to read some reference books or documents
so they will not just give empty talks during the forums. Most of the
reference materials will be provided by civic groups that have
dedicated themselves to studying and working on important issues.</P>
      <P>Four major areas will be discussed in the "city government
deliberative forums" -- the use of city spaces, social welfare,
education and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The results of the 13 forums will be posted on the Internet and
feedback solicited from Taipei citizens. When the candidates debate
is held in late November, they will be questioned about their policy
proposals for each of the citizens' main concerns.</P>
      <P>PTS said a great city is created by great citizens and expressed
hope that the 13 forums will give a historical impetus for a new wave
of "citizen reform" campaigns.</P>

      <P>A total of 385 kg of hairy crabs from China
had been confiscated at airports and harbors around the country as of
Thursday, according to Department of Health (DOH) statistics
released that day.</P>
      <P>The DOH hastily canceled permission Wednesday for each incoming
passenger to bring in up to six kilograms of hairy crabs, known
locally as Dazha crabs, after traces of nitrofurans -- a group of
cancer-causing chemicals that have been banned for use in
food-producing animals in most countries around the world -- were
detected earlier in the week in several batches of the crabs imported
from China.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday evening, 385 kg of the crabs had been confiscated
at major airports and harbors on Taiwan proper and at wharves on the
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, from where direct "mini three
links" shipping services with China's southeastern Fujian Province
are operated, DOH officials said.</P>
      <P>All the confiscated crabs have been disinfected and will be
incinerated, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As the ban was imposed without any grace period or prior public
awareness campaign, many passengers were disgruntled about what they
saw as the health authorities' sloppy handling of the issue and said
the government should review its food safety control mechanisms and

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday
Taiwan and El Salvador will be able to sign a free trade agreement
(FTA) in the near future as they have thrashed out precise details of
the pact.</P>
      <P>Chen revealed progress in Taiwan-El Salvador FTA talks in a
speech delivered at a state dinner hosted by him in a rural township
in southern Chiayi County in honor of visiting Salvadoran President
Elias Antonio Saca and his entourage.</P>
      <P>After three rounds of talks, Chen said, the two countries have
come to terms on most FTA issues. Although they were divided over the
sugar export quota issue, a breakthrough has been achieved through
intense consultations between their economics ministers in the past
two days.</P>
      <P>"The two sides have finally settled their differences over the
sugar export quotas from El Salvador," Chen said without elaboration.</P>
      <P>Now that the two countries have thrashed out details of a
bilateral free trade pact, Chen said, the agreement will be signed
soon and takes effect at the beginning of next year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen also praised Vice President Annette Lu for
her efforts in recent years on pushing for the establishment of a
Taiwanese industrial park in El Salvador to facilitate local
businessmen's investments in the Central American country.</P>
      <P>"The project would not just contribute to our diplomatic ally's
economic development but would help cement bilateral relations as
well," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Saca, accompanied by his wife and an entourage of senior
officials and personal aides, arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a state
visit.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that a state banquet has ever been held
in Chiayi County which is known for its abundant agricultural
production, including the now famous Alishan high-altitude tea.</P>
      <P>For his part, Saca said Taiwan-El Salvador relations are built on
their common convictions and shared values in freedom and democracy.
Saca said he is grateful for Taiwan's long-term development aid and
other assistance for his country. He reaffirmed his country's firm
support for Taiwan's cause in the international diplomatic stage.</P>
      <P>Saca will sing a joint communique with Chen Friday at the
conclusion of his official visit to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA SEEKING INT'L SUPPORT FOR RESUMPTION OF PREVIOUS TUNA CATCH QUOTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will pull
out all the stops to push the International Commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to return the tuna catch quota
for Taiwan to the previous level, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan made the remarks as the ICCAT
is scheduled to meet in November to review whether Taiwan has
improved its supervision of tuna fishing operations over the past
year to prevent overfishing on the high seas.</P>
      <P>The ICCAT decided last year to slash the 2006 tuna catch quota
for Taiwan to 4,600 tons from the original 14,900 tons as a
punishment for Taiwan's alleged overfishing on the high seas in 2004.
It also demanded that Taiwan step up management and surveillance of
its tuna fishing operations, pending a review in November this year.</P>
      <P>Lee said the COA has been lobbying the United States, Japan,
Canada and the European Union to support resumption of the original
tuna catch quota for Taiwan for the coming year.</P>
      <P>"We have embarked on an all-out lobbying campaign to convince
ICCAT member countries to back our appeal for return our catch quota
to the previous level," Lee said.</P>
      <P>During a conference of the Commission for the Conservation of
Southern Bluefin Tuna last week, Lee said the Taiwan delegation had
asked Japan to speak for Taiwan when the ICCAT meets next month.</P>
      <P>Lee said the COA has furnished all ICCAT member states with
detailed statistical reports on Taiwanese fishing vessels' tuna catch
on the high seas. "The breadth and completeness of our reports have
won much recognition," he added.</P>
      <P>Sha Chih-i, deputy director of the COA's Fisheries
Administration, traveled to Canada earlier this month to brief
Canadian officials on Taiwan's efforts in improving tuna fishing
management and supervision, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan can succeed in its bid to have its tuna
catch quota returned to the previous level, Lee said he is cautiously
optimistic.</P>
      <P>"Developments so far are favorable for us. But the international
situation tends to be changing all the time, so we must remain
vigilant," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Before the ICCAT conference, Lee said, the Taiwan delegation will
hold a pre-departure meeting to coordinate opinions and stances of
the government, fishing sector and academic community on all relevant
issues.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has implemented a three-phase program to meet the ICCAT
requirement for tuna fishing in international waters. Professional
observers have been posted onboard the 15 Taiwanese big-eye tuna
fishing boats that are allowed to operate in international waters.</P>
      <P>In addition, 60 longfin tuna boats from Taiwan, in collaboration
with the United States, have periodically reported their catch to the
ICCAT, and the 42 Taiwanese fishing vessels ordered to be mothballed
in Taiwan have been subject to satellite surveillance.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan banned 59 fishing vessels from catching tuna in
international waters last year and has further restricted 101 ships
from doing so this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DEMANDS STRICTER SCREENING OF LIVE ANIMAL, PLANT IMPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed the
administration Friday to adopt stricter screening measures on imports
of live animals and plants as part of efforts to protect people's
health as well as Taiwan's wildlife and environment.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Su said it is the
administration's responsibility to guard against the entry of plants
and animals that could pose a danger to the people's health and the
natural environment, adding that the relevant government agencies
must be held accountable for the recent controversy involving the
import and consumption of hairy crabs from China alleged to contain
carcinogens.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at a state affairs forum held at the Legislative Yuan,
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chen Chao-jung accused the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) of negligence for not
discovering or reporting the presence of nitrofurans in the
China-originating hairy crabs earlier.</P>
      <P>Noting that this was not the first time that the DOH has been
negligent in not warning the public of problematic imported food in
time, Chen called for Su to fire DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mao for
negligence.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liao Pen-yen of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union blasted the administration for "never having done its duty of
guarding against the inflow of sham Chinese products and produce into
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Liao suggested that the administration buy up all the crabs that
have already been imported from China and destroy them for the sake
of the public's safety.</P>
      <P>After live Chinese-originating crabs had been imported into
Taiwan for more than one month, the DOH disclosed Wednesday that the
Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs had discovered earlier in the week that several
batches of the crabs contained cancer-causing nitrofurans.</P>
      <P>DOH officials also announced Wednesday that effective
immediately, travelers arriving in Taiwan will not be allowed to
bring hairy crabs into the country, while future imports of live
hairy crabs will require a food safety inspection certificate.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has adopted a positive and
open attitude and the principle of reciprocity in dealing with issues
such as opening cross-Taiwan Strait tourism and direct transport
links as well as allowing Taiwan's financial sector to set up
operations in China, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Su said the two sides must negotiate on matters involving the
exercise of government authority before the ban on direct
cross-strait transport links can be lifted.</P>
      <P>"However, China has refused to recognize Taiwan as a government
and rejected contact with it," Su noted.</P>
      <P>Su expressed the hope that breakthroughs will be achieved soon on
deadlocked issues, including allowing more Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the government does not object to allowing the financial
sector to invest in China but believes a cross-strait supervisory
system should be established before doing so.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during an interpellation session in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu clarified
that his previous comment that direct cross-strait transport links
"will be very difficult to achieve before the 2008 presidential
election" does not mean "there is no hope."</P>
      <P>Wu said promoting direct cross-strait transport links has been
one of the government's policies since the Executive Yuan published
an assessment report on direct cross-strait transport links in August
2003.</P>
      <P>Also, during a conference on Taiwan's sustainable economic
development held earlier this year, participants reached a consensus
that the government should seek shipping and aviation talks with
Beijing on an equal footing, Wu noted.</P>

      <P>Cooperating with Japan and the United States

Taiwan will be willing to cooperate with Tokyo and Washington on the
issue of sanctions against North Korea, a Taiwan strategist was
quoted as saying Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, a Tamkang University professor and a former deputy
defense minister, said during an interview with the Yomiuri Shimbun
newspaper that although Taiwan's diplomatic clout is insignificant in
terms of global security strategy, the U.S. and Japan can count on
the country to beef up their efforts to enforce sanctions against
Pyongyang in the light of North Korea's recent nuclear tests.</P>
      <P>Responding to the question of whether Pyongyang's nuclear tests
might cause a "domino effect" among some countries, including Taiwan,
to develop nuclear weapons as well -- which the paper described as a
concern of the international community -- Lin said this will not
happen.</P>
      <P>He said the number of Taiwan's military personnel who are
supporters of the pro-China unification opposition parties is higher
than that of those who are supporters of the ruling pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, while Taiwan has become increasingly
reliant on China in terms of the economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's military, therefore, will not opt for owning or

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to post an economic
growth rate of 4.11 percent for 2006, up 0.02 percentage points from
4.09 percent in 2005, the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research
(CIER) forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>The inflation rate is projected to register 1.02 percent for
2006, down significantly from the 2.31 percent of last year,
according to the economic think tank.</P>
      <P>CIER Vice President Chen Wen-lang said that although Taiwan's
economy posted a growth rate of 4.74 percent in the first half of
this year, the performance is not expected to be as good as that in
the third and fourth quarters, owing to sluggish domestic demand.</P>
      <P>The economic growth for the third and fourth quarters are
expected to register 4.03 percent and 3.01 percent, respectively, he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, private consumption expenditure will reverse its
downward trend in the second half of this year, with expenditure
expected to rise 1.94 percent in the third quarter and 2.64 percent
in the fourth quarter, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the rise to a number of developments favorable to
consumers, such as a decline in consumer prices in the third quarter
and drops in gold and oil prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports are expected to amount to US$55.96 billion in

asked him to help push for negotiations between the KMT and its
"pan-blue" partner, the People First Party (PFP) , over fielding a
single joint candidate in the election.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the "pan-blue alliance" cannot afford to have
another split and cannot sustain the serious consequences of such a
split, adding that the KMT will not give up its efforts to discuss
the issue with the PFP.</P>
      <P>"There is no breakup in KMT-PFP relations, and the KMT will

      <P>The "Million Voices Against Corruption"
campaign has still over NT$48 million (US$1.45 million) in its
account book after spending more than half of the public donations in
organizing street protests over the past weeks, campaign leaders said
Friday.</P>
      <P>In responding to some "pan-green" politicians' accusations that
campaign organizers have misused the public funds on personal affairs
such as paying for medical treatment for a wilting Shih Ming-teh --
the former Democratic Progressive Party chairman who initiated the
campaign to press embattled President Chen Shui-bian to step down
over a long string of corruption allegations, the campaign
coordinator claimed at a news conference that Shih had spent none of
the public money.</P>
      <P>Lu Tai-nian, who is also in charge of keeping tabs on campaign
finances, said Shih's family had paid for all the cancer sufferer's
treatment, noting that because of his illness, Shih has hardly eaten
any of the food provided by campaign organizers, while a van that was
used to accommodate Shih during anti-Chen sit-ins last month was
offered by a supporter.</P>
      <P>Supporters of the anti-corruption campaign have donated more than
NT$111 million to the campaign since Shih urged them to donate NT$100
each in support of his call for Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>Displaying a huge pile of account data including original
receipts and invoices, the campaign organizers released a detailed
report at the news conference on their spending of the public
donations during the period from Aug. 12 to Oct. 11.</P>
      <P>A substantive part of the campaign fund -- NT$30 million -- was
spent on advertisements, while other big-item spending included a
payment of over NT$13 million for erecting stages and setting up
stage lighting at rally sites, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Lu said that while the anti-corruption campaign will enter its
"second phrase" in the near future, he will take strict measures to
control and monitor spending and will also continue to publicize
every detail of the spending.</P>
      <P>Another coordinator of the campaign, Chang Fu-chung, announced
that the anti-Chen movement will be restarted Monday, when Shih is
scheduled to call a press conference to reveal the next steps of the
campaign.</P>
      <P>The anti-Chen campaign, starting with a large-scale sit-in Sept.
9 in front of the Presidential Office, came to a "provisional end"
the organizers claimed in a rally on Double Ten National Day after
Taipei city authorities dispersed the anti-Chen activists.</P>

      <P>Wu, a member of the IOC 2008 Beijing Olympic Games Coordination
Commission, was also quoted as saying that Taiwan authorities from
relevant sports agencies have basically reached a positive consensus
on the torch relay issue.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether Taiwanese athletes will join their
Chinese counterparts under a single IOC banner to enter the stadium
on the opening day of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Wu reportedly said
it is still too early to speculate, as the political climate in
Taiwan might change, which might in turn impact the issue between now
and 2008.</P>
      <P>Although Wu did not say so directly, he is known to admire South
Korea and North Korea for the two divided countries' willingness to
allow their athletes to march together under a single flag
representing the whole Korean peninsula in the 2000 Sydney Olympics
and the 2004 Athens Olympics.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council said in July that Taiwan is not
opposed to allowing the torch relay to pass through Taiwan as long as
Taiwan can participate in the activity in its capacity as an IOC
member.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chen-wei, chairman of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee,
said earlier this year that the Olympic torch might come through
Taiwan in 2008 if Beijing does not insist on designating Taiwan as
part of China's "domestic route."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that a
draft law approved by the Cabinet in September on the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions was a concrete step to exhibit Taiwan's
resolve to fulfill its responsibility as a member of the
international community.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has done so even though it is not a signatory to the Kyoto
Protocol, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving a group of
environmental ministers from Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central
America, who are here for a conference on environmental protection
that was held Oct. 18-19.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the themes of the meeting included the
establishment of an intergovernmental dialogue to cope with climate
change and of the clean development mechanism (CDM) as stipulated in
the Kyoto Protocol, as well as various technological exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the CDM encourages major countries around the
world to engage in activities such as forestation, forest
conservation and the development of renewable energy, including
hydraulic power, biomass diesel and bioethanol, in Central America.</P>
      <P>This will help developed countries reduce their greenhouse gas
emissions and facilitate the sustainable economic development of
developing countries, which is a goal that Taiwan is working to
achieve through international cooperation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Participants in this year's conference included Roberto Dobles
Mora, minister of energy and the environment of Costa Rica;
Maximiliano Puig Miller, secretary of state for the environment and
natural resources of Dominican Republic; Juan Mario Dary, minister of
the environment of Guatemala; Cristobal Sequeira, minister of the
environment and natural resources of Nicaragua; and Servulo Baeza,
minister of natural resources and the environment of Belize.</P>
      <P>Robert Dixon, head of the International Energy Agency's Energy
Technology Policy Division, and Mohan Munasinghe, vice chair of the
International Panel on Climate Change, were invited to participate in
the conference as keynote speakers.</P>

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
lawmakers lashed out at main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou Friday, saying that the PFP would not mind risking a
breakup with the KMT to have PFP Chairman James Soong participate in
December's Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Cheng Chin-ling, party spokesman Lee
Hung-chun and lawmakers Liu Wen-hsiung and Daniel Y.C. Huang, among
others, made the remarks at a news conference at a time when KMT-PFP
relations have turned sour after both Soong and KMT nominee Hau
Long-bin registered their candidacies a day earlier in the year-end
Taipei mayor race.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed discontent with Ma's revelation about a so-called
"condition" put forward by Soong during a meeting he had with Ma last
Saturday, claiming that Ma has damaged KMT-PFP relations and that
mutual trust between the two parties has been eroded.</P>
      <P>Ma told foreign media in an interview the previous day that
during the meeting, Soong asked Ma to demand that KMT nominee Hau
Long-bin unconditionally pull out of the race, in return for which,
Soong promised that he will not participate in the 2008 presidential
election so as to fully support Ma in the contest.</P>
      <P>Liu blasted Ma for making such "improper comments" and argued
that Ma must be held accountable if the "pan-blue alliance" splits.</P>
      <P>Huang criticized the KMT for pressuring Soong to quit the mayoral
election under the pretense of unity in the "pan-blue alliance" and
he claimed that Taipei voters will not mind Soong's serving as the
city's mayor if his election is beneficial to them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hau said that he has gained an understanding of
Soong's so-called "condition" from Ma, but added that he is "not
worried at all about the matter."</P>
      <P>Hau said that he strongly believes that both Ma and the KMT will
respect the system and that Ma has repeatedly said that he will
conduct two-way negotiations in line with institutionalized channels.</P>
      <P>Hau cited Ma as saying that the two parties have been seeking to
negotiate through all possible channels over fielding a joint
candidate acceptable to both sides in the Taipei mayor election but

    <HEADLINE>FOOD SAFETY BUREAU CHIEF REPLACED OVER HAIRY CRAB CONTROVERSY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The food safety bureau head has been 
transferred from his post pending an investigation into whether he
withheld information about imported hairy crabs containing
carcinogenic drugs, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Hou Sheng-mao
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hou said that Hsiao Tung-chao, director-general of the DOH's
Bureau of Food Safety, will await further investigation on whether he
should take administrative responsibility. Chen Shu-kung,
director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Food and Drug Analysis, will
concurrently serve in Hsiao's post, Hou added.</P>
      <P>Hou made the announcement during a question-and-answer
session at the Legislative Yuan when Legislator Chang Hsien-yao of
the opposition People First Party inquired about the carcinogens
found in imported hairy crabs over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Hou noted that recent controversy over the hairy crabs, known
locally as Dazha crabs, has violated the principle of open and
transparent information.</P>
      <P>"The Bureau of Food Safety has to review how the matter was
handled," Hou said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao, who was deputy director-general of the Bureau of Food
Safety last year, "cannot extricate himself from the matter, " he
continued.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Hsiao's predecesor should also shoulder
responsibility, Hou said that " the matter needs to be further
studied."</P>
      <P>To ensure food safety, the DOH said that imported food is
destroyed if it fails inspection and that the importers will also be
subject to fines between NT$40,000 and NT$200,000
(NT$1,220-US$6,100).</P>
      <P>To avoid the controversy over contaminated hairy crabs from
taking place again, the DOH also said that it will publish the names
of sham imported food and the importers.</P>
      <P>DOH officials argued that they did not make public the data about
the nitrofurans content in the crabs over the past two years mainly
because the content ratio was extremely low and did not pose a health
hazard.</P>
      <P>Leading retailers in Taiwan have removed the hairy crabs from
their shelves after reports that nitrofurans, one of the carcinogens,
had been detected in several batches of the crabs.</P>
      <P>DOH officials also announced Wednesday that effective
immediately, travelers arriving in Taiwan will not be allowed to
bring hairy crabs into the country, while future imports of live
hairy crabs will require a food safety inspection certificate.</P>

      <P>The leader of an anti-graft campaign left
hospital Friday saying that the next wave of his campaign will be
"even more overwhelming."</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, the former Democratic Progressive Party chairman
who began a sit-in campaign Sept. 9 to pressure President Chen
Shui-bian to step down over a spate of corruption scandals, said the
embattled president should not think that because the protests have
scaled down, he is getting a reprieve.</P>
      <P>Chen should know that the campaigners' outcry against corruption
will not die down easily, Shih said.</P>
      <P>After the "red tide" fades, the next to come might be a tsunami,
Shih added, referring to the fact that the protesters have taken to
wearing red.</P>
      <P>Shih then went straight to the sit-in protest area in front of
the Taipei Main Station.</P>
      <P>Before leaving the hospital, Shih said that although the protest
has been scaled down since Oct. 10 National Day, when tens of
thousands of red-clad protesters encircled the Presidential Office,
the protesters' anger about Chen's alleged corruption has not
subsided.</P>
      <P>Shih, who looked more robust after five days of rest, although
still coughing from time to time, said his life would be used to
accomplish his mission, rather than seek its extension. </P>
      <P>He declined to give more details about his physical condition,
saying that he is not a public servant or a party official, but just
a social worker.</P>
      <P>Shih had liver tumor surgery three months ago and checked into
the hospital Oct. 16 after feeling ill and experiencing unsteady
blood pressure.</P>
      <P>Although the doctors strongly recommended that he stay in
hospital for another week, they reluctantly agreed to his discharge
early upon Shih's insistence.</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-chung, deputy leader of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign, said earlier in the day that the anti-graft
activities will begin again Oct. 23, although he declined to give

Buddha Jayanthi and the 50th anniversary of believers taking refuge

      <P>Politics should be excluded from
Taiwan-China agricultural exchanges to ensure long-term and mutually

Johnnason Liu said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly news briefing, Liu said that cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges have proven limited over the past year,
although over a year ago Beijing implemented various incentives to
serve that end.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, political elements and maneuvering should be
taken out of cross-Taiwan Strait farming exchanges in order to make
it purely a business activity and to secure a balanced form of
development over the long term.</P>

while Chinese shipments to Taiwan amounted to US$9.29 million, Liu

      <P>Part of the international conference will be held in Kinmen,
previously a warzone in the 1950s, on Oct. 23.</P>
      <P>Allen Houng, the commissioner of the movement and chairman of the
Constitution Reform Alliance in Taiwan, said the concept of peace is
easy to understand but difficult to apply.</P>
      <P>The realization of peace cannot rely on politics or forceful
coercion, he said. The only solution is to promote peace through the
grassroots movement, Houng said.</P>
      <P>Five international peace movement promotors, including scholars
and grassroots leaders from the United States, Japan, South Korea,
the Philippines and Mongolia will also attend the conference to
facilitate a regional alliance on peace promotion.</P>
      <P>"The timing of this movement could not be better as domestic
political controversies, chaos and the North Korea nuclear issue
have unfolded before us," said chief organizer Tang Kwang-hua.</P>
      <P>Tang also described the movement as the "third stage" of a civic
peace movement in Taiwan, following the Taiwan Strait crisis in
1995-96 and the arms procurement debate in 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INDUSTRIALISTS TO VISIT INDIA TO STUDY INVESTMENT CLIMATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation organized by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) and comprised of businessmen from 11
manufacturing companies in Taiwan will visit India Oct. 29-Nov.5 to
familiarize themselves with the investment climate there.</P>
      <P>The delegation will be led by Berton Chiu, head of the MOEA's
Department of Investment Services. Its members represent companies in
the petrochemical, shoemaking, information technology,
telecommunications and machinery industries.</P>
      <P>They will visit New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad to study
the investment climate there and compare incentives offered by local
governments. They will also meet with Indian business leaders and try
to find partners for future cooperation.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the MOEA is drafting a plan to establish an
industrial park in India exclusively for Taiwanese investors, with
the location of the special zone still under evaluation.</P>
      <P>He said the industrial park for Taiwan investors is likely to be
located in either Mumbai, the most populous city of India; Chennai, a
major industrial center and India's fourth largest metropolitan city;
or Hyderabad, India's emerging IT and biotech hub.</P>
      <P>Chiu added that a final decision will be made after the
delegation has collected information about the three cities'
geographical convenience, transportation systems and other

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S CROSS-STRAIT ROLE SIMILAR TO NORTH-SOUTH KOREA RELATIONS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea's relationship with North Korea
is similar to that of Taiwan's with China, with all parties facing
similar concerns although the issues are different, a South Korean
scholar said Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Always facing the constant threat of the Chinese military, people
in Taiwan have divided opinions on the issue of reunification
and independence. South Koreans are in a similar situation, said
Shim Young-hee, a sociology professor at Hanyang University.</P>
      <P>The majority of South Koreans still think North and South Korea
should one day become an integrated country, but they are also very
concerned about North Korea's nuclear program, Shim said on
the sidelines of an international peace conference being
held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"It's a problem of when and how," Shim said of the North/South
Korea reunification issue.</P>
      <P>The economic situation after a reunification is also of
great concern for South Koreans, Shim said, adding that South Korea
understands very well the case of Germany, which is why South
Koreans don't want to see a "quick reunification."</P>
      <P>Regarding international relations, Shim said that isolating and
pressuring North Korea is unhelpful and that South Korea's
sunshine policy on government transparency should be kept.</P>
      <P>"North Korea has no other option [but to keep developing its
nuclear program] because the regime is threatened. We should provide
North Korea with an exit," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSENG HSU-PAI JOURNALISM AWARDS GO TO 12 OUTSTANDING REPORTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior journalist Antonio Chiang and 11
other media workers were honored with Tseng Hsu-pai Journalism Awards
in six categories Friday for outstanding professional work over the past year.</P>
      <P>Chiang won the "Newspaper Commentary Award" for his series of
current affairs commentaries appearing in the Apple Daily, which the
judges said was "an in-depth and comprehensive observation of the
core values of a democratic society."</P>
      <P>Lin Li-yun was presented with the "Journalistic Research Award"
for her book entitled "A History of Taiwan's Mass Communications
Industry -- The Production of Mass Communications Knowledge in the
Academic World," which according to the judges gave a precise
account of the process of creation, research and development in this
domain.</P>
      <P>The "Newspaper Report Award" went to Liu Li-jen and five other
Liberty Times reporters whose series of reports on the
"concretization" of Taiwan's offshore islands rendered "good public
service" according to the judges, and provided a balanced and
constructive account of the excessive use of concrete. The other
five winners are Wang Meng-lun, Tseng Hung-ju, Kuo Yi-chun, Wen
Chun-hua and Wu Cheng-ting.</P>
      <P>"Cities That Have Lost Their Memories," a documentary on the loss
of cultural relics in Kaohsiung and Keelung, won the "Public Service
Award for TV Reporters" for Cheng Ching-ching and Hsieh Meng-fu of
Formosa TV, who claimed that Taiwan has neglected its duty to
preserve its cultural relics "to the point of absurdity, " and their
account, said the judges, "compels us to face this fact."</P>
      <P>The "Public Service Award for Radio Reporters" was given to
Chengsheng Broadcasting Corp.'s Wu Chun-man, whose series of reports
on "Your Dangerous Yet Intimate Love -- Microwave Radiation
Unveiled," was characterized by judges as popularizing a
seldom-noted topic by using common sense and facts to
illustrate the role played by electromagnetic
waves in our daily lives.</P>
      <P>Tu Feng-chun of the Apple Daily won the "Newspaper Photography
Award" for his series of photos on "Seven Burning Heroes Coming to
the Rescue of a Sudden Gas Explosion," scenes so unforgettable to the
photojournalist that he has since visited the wounded
firefighters, and now, he said, he would like to donate his cash prize
(NT$100,000) to the seven brave men.</P>
      <P>Professor Hsu Chia-shih, speaking for the judges panel, said more
works were nominated for this year's competition than ever before,
with the majority of themes addressing media workers' concern about
important issues in society -- a spirit the "life-time journalist"
Tseng Hsu-pai would have wanted today's journalists to preserve and
glorify.</P>
      <P>Liu Chih-tsung, chairman of the Tseng Hsu-pai Journalism Award
Foundation, said a total of 149 works were entered for this year's
competition, an indication that despite popular criticism of the
media's role and function in Taiwan, a majority of media workers are
still doing their best to honor the principles of professional
journalism.</P>
      <P>Tseng, a career journalist who was president of the Central News
Agency for 14 years, died in 1994 at the age of 100, leaving in
Taiwan a rich spiritual legacy. Friday's award ceremony was the 32nd
since the Award Foundation was created in 1974 with the purpose of
helping change society in a positive way.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng put
forth three proposals Friday, including setting up a free-trade zone,
claiming the measures would likely turn the off-shore island into
another Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The other two proposals are forming a Kinmen Airlines and
managing Kinmen Airport, ideas that would entail expanding Kinmen's
current role in the "mini-three links" agreement between Taiwan and
China on air transport, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee made the proposals while meeting with visiting executives of
Taiwan's Uni Air, part of the Evergreen Group.</P>
      <P>He said Kinmen's geographical proximity to China would be an
advantage for it to become a trans-shipment center between Taiwan and
China if local and central governments can pool together
their resources.</P>
      <P>Uni Air Chairman Su Yi-hung said that building Kinmen into a
free-trade zone seems more important -- and more realistic -- than
managing an air terminal and running an airline.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Su suggested that Lee and his staff work harder on
pooling resources for realizing the free-trade zone proposal.</P>
      <P>Lee said he welcomes Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa to
visit his county to see if his air trans-shipment ideas are feasible.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An average 185 people die in bicycle
accidents in Taiwan every year, with the main cause of death due to
the fact they were not wearing helmets, according to the results of
study released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The study, conducted by Taipei Medical University in cooperation
with the Bureau of Health Promotion, is based on an analysis of 9,371
bicycle accidents that took place between 1999 and 2002.</P>
      <P>The study shows approximately 3,700 people are injured every year
while riding a bicycle, with the 10-19 age group accounting for 36
percent and those 60 or above accounting for 34 percent.</P>
      <P>Among those injured who were not wearing helmets at the time of
the accidents, 4.2 percent sustained severe injuries, while no severe
injuries occurred among those with helmets, the study indicates.</P>
      <P>Chiou Hung-yi, director of the university's Department of Public
Health, said contrary to expectations that slippery or bumpy
conditions are a major cause of accidents, the study found that more
than 90 percent of bicycle accidents occurred at a time when weather
and road conditions were good.</P>
      <P>According to Chiou, crossroads are where most fatal bicycle
accidents occur, with the periods from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. to
7 p.m. being when most bicycle-related injuries occur.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the lack of bicycle lanes in Taiwan often forces
cyclists to use fast lanes, which increases the risk of accidents.</P>
      <P>He urged authorities to make wearing a helmet compulsory for
cyclists to reduce the probability of severe head injury in the event
of an accident.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) must capture a majority in the Legislative Yuan in next year's
elections in order to ensure "normal governance" by the party, DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yu argued that "normal governance" will be essential for Taiwan
to undergo a "normal transition" to a "normal country."</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while addressing a seminar on the country's
bid to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu said Taiwan is an independent, sovereign state where there are
no ethnic problems, as people in Taiwan no longer distinguish
themselves by their ethnic background as "native Taiwanese" or
"mainlanders."</P>
      <P>Claiming Taiwan's only problem is that of national identity, Yu
said people who identify with China are considered Chinese, while
those who identify with Taiwan are considered Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Yu said the split in national identity is a serious issue the</P>
      <P>country needs to deal with in future, because it is one that
prevents Taiwan from becoming a "normal country."</P>
      <P>To become a "normal country," Yu said, Taiwan needs to change its
official name, enact a new constitution, enhance its competitiveness,
take part in the United Nations and beef up its defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>Yu said the other reason Taiwan is not a "normal country" is
there is no "normal governance, " noting the DPP controls the
presidency and Cabinet but not the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CRAB IMPORTERS HOPE FOR CLEAR POLICY ON CONTROL OF LIVE ANIMALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major hairy crab importers and distributors
including two chain supermarket operators, Carrefour and RT-Mart,
said Saturday that the government should adopt a "clear and definite"
policy on live fauna and flora imports.</P>
      <P>Business representatives made the remarks at a news conference
held after Premier Su Tseng-chang instructed the administration a day
earlier to adopt stricter screening measures on such imports as part
of efforts to safeguard public health.</P>
      <P>The instruction came after traces of nitrofurans -- a group of
cancer-causing chemicals that have been banned for use in
food-producing animals in most countries around the world -- were
detected earlier this week in several batches of crabs imported from
China.</P>
      <P>Chou Hsien-liang, president of Kunshan Yangcheng Lake Hairy Crab
Co. Ltd., and his deputy Yu Tzih-chiang as well as representatives of
Carrefour and RT-Mart said that if the government decides to suspend
imports of Dazha crabs, they will follow the policy without complaint
as an effort to safeguard their business reputation and consumer
rights.</P>
      <P>However, they suggest such a policy be "clear and definite"
because if it isn't, their companies would sustain a great deal of
loss and that would be "unbearable, " the business representatives
said.</P>
      <P>Explaining their importation procedures, Chou said they had never
attempted to ignore official regulations on live crab imports, which
demand safety tests before doing so, as well as safety insurance.</P>
      <P>All their imports of Chinese hairy crabs, known locally as Dazha
crabs from Yancheng Lake in Jiangsu Province, have been sent to SGS,
an international inspection, verification, testing and certification
company, for food safety checks before being shipped to Taiwan, Yu
explained.</P>
      <P>The reason they didn't know the presence of nitrofurans in their
crabs is because the government has never asked for laboratory
analyses of the chemicals, Yu said. He noted the company had again
sent samples of the problematic imports to SGS, with the test results
expected to be released by next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Noting the company's legality in import operations, Chou said if
the government imposes the same ban against importing hairy crabs
from China as it had done on imports of U.S. beef, Kunshan might have
to close because the company only runs one business -- importing
Dazha crabs from China to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kunshan's crab imports have reached around 10 tons a year,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 18th Taipei International Show on
Medical Equipment, Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology will be held
Nov. 9-12 at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>The event, organized by the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) and the Formosan Medical Association, will for the
first time present a pavilion on "information technology" (IT)
medical products to showcase electronic medical research and
developments by both domestic hospitals and research organizations,
as well as world electronic and electrical giants, including IBM, GE,
HP and Fujitsu.</P>
      <P>This year's "Mediphar Taipei" has attracted the participation of
enterprises from numerous countries, including the United States, the
United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, Poland and
Hungary.</P>
      <P>Among foreign participants, Cerrus International from the United
Kingdom will present its medical care and reporting system for home
care, "Saturn," which has proven quite popular on the market.</P>
      <P>In response to a trend where profits from electronic products are
trimming down, many international medical equipment enterprises are
relocating their production lines to Asia, especially to Taiwan and
India, a TAITRA official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, with its forte in the IT sector, has great potential for
developing electronic medical devices, the official added.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA statistics, the sales volume of global
medical equipment has currently reached US$174 billion, a figure
expected to reach US$179 billion in 2009.</P>
      <P>Of that figure, semiconductor application products are expected
to account for 34 percent of the total market, which means there is
great potential for promoting the sale of electronic medical devices,
the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the semiconductor giant Intel is planning to launch
its digital health products, for which Taiwan electronic and medical
firms should not miss the trade opportunities, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The organizers of Mediphar Taipei will also hold a series of
presentations during the show to introduce newly developed products
aimed at helping global buyers quickly get what they want and
assisting domestic firms in exploring foreign markets in a timely
manner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THINK TANK CALLS FOR DESIGNATION OF OCT. 24 AS 'TAIWAN U.N. DAY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A private think tank announced Saturday the
launch of a campaign to designate Oct. 24 as "Taiwan U.N. Day" to
promote the country's bid to join the United Nations under the name
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Lung-chu, chairman of the Taiwan New Century Foundation,
claimed that of all 194 countries around the world, only Taiwan is
not a member of the United Nations, which was founded on Oct. 24,
1945.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the government has been rather passive in
promoting the country's bid for U.N. membership over the past 13
years, relying mainly on the assistance of its diplomatic allies and
failing to liberate itself from the shadow of the "Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>He urged the government to act positively on the matter by
submitting an application to join the United Nations as a new member,
stressing that Taiwan is a peace-loving, independent, sovereign
state which has the ability and desire to fulfil obligations
as stipulated in the U.N. Charter.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during the foundation's seminar on the U.N.
bid, held in cooperation with the Taiwan United Nations Alliance.</P>
      <P>Also at the seminar, Chen Chung, director-general of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs' Department of International Organizations, noted
that more and more people in Taiwan are in favor of the country
joining the United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He promised the ministry would continue its work with the
private sector to work toward that goal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ketagalan Foundation Chairman Lee Hong-hsi pointed out
that Taiwan possesses its own territory, people and government with
administrative, legislative and judicial powers, and is entitled to
due rights within the international community, since these criteria
make it an independent, sovereign state.</P>
      <P>However, China's suppression of Taiwan has resulted in the
country being excluded from the United Nations, Lee said, adding that
applying for U.N. membership under the name of Taiwan is the
best way to declare to the world that Taiwan is an independent,
sovereign state.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT STEPS UP MONITORING OF LIVE AQUATIC IMPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Fisheries Agency (FA) will invite
scholars and experts to join the monitoring of the long-term
environmental influence of importing live aquatic products like
Chinese hairy crabs -- a delicacy in Chinese cuisine -- as part of
efforts to protect Taiwan's public health and environment, said FA
officials Saturday.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, the discovery of carcinogens present in hairy
crabs imported from China -- known locally as Dazha crabs -- has
triggered increasing public concern.</P>
      <P>Most countries around the world tend to be very cautious toward
importation of live aquatic products, the officials said, adding that
the government will step up monitoring of entry of live aquatic
products, including prevention of smuggling and release of the
animals to the wild because of religious belief.</P>
      <P>With the recent incident involving imported Dazha crabs, in which
cancer-causing nitrofurans were traced, the fishery authorities were
forced to launch a drive to reinforce its surveilance system on crab
imports.</P>
      <P>FA officials explained that intensified customs inspection on
such products has been conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs'
Bureau of Standards under the commission of the Department of Health
in order to meet increasing consumer demand for quality and health
safety.</P>
      <P>The ratio of aquatic products randomly selected for inspection in
every batch of imports has also increased from 2 percent to 5
percent, the officials said, noting the ratio may be raised again if
and when necessary.</P>
      <P>Stressing the importance of food safety inspection, the FA said
more efforts will be undertaken -- such as inviting independent
inspectors and government testing units to assist in the work -- to
ensure the safety of the products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City Department of Economic
Development announced the city's most popular beef noodle restaurants
in Taipei Saturday, representing a mix of old and new shops as well
as tradition and creativity, a department spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks while the department presented a
flag to each of the top five traditional and top five creative beef
noodle restaurants, all of which will vie for honors in the final
cooking championship at the Taipei World Trade Center Nov. 4-5.</P>
      <P>Since some questioned last year's election as being unfair by
only collecting ballots via the Internet, this year chefs and
gourmets were invited to select the top 20 from 30 restaurants voted
as the best in the Internet, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Among the winners, some are shops with a long history -- such as
Old Chang's and the Yongkang Beef Restaurant -- while some are
particularly recommended on the Internet, such as Old Dong's thin
beef noodles and Hsu's golden beef noodle, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Besides taste, a customer service evaluation is a new part of
this year's scoring process, the spokesman said, adding that some
restaurants were highly praised on the Internet last year but failed
in this year's election due to keeping evaluators waiting for a long
time, such as Chuanwang Restaurant and Master Hong's.</P>
      <P>Several promotional events will also be held as part of the
competition, including that the first 100 people who patronize these
selected restaurants get a bottle of Coke for only NT$5, and a free
beef-noodle testing will be organized for aficionados during the
upcoming cooking competition, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>Having a diverse mix of cultures has helped
the state of Washington understand "the Taiwanese way" better than
any other state in the United States, Washington State Governor
Christine Gregoire said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"We are fortunate to be a diverse state. And we have a large
community of Taiwanese. All of that has helped us as a state because
we understand the culture of Taiwanese. We understand how business is
done here in Taiwan," Gregoire said on the last day of her visit
here.</P>
      <P>"Not all states can do that," she added.</P>
      <P>Gregoire led a delegation of more than 70 executives to Taipei
from Oct. 19- 21 to further trade, tourism, investment, education and
cultural relations between Washington and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the northwestern U.S. state have been enjoying a wide
range of exchanges for more than 35 years, as Taiwan is the state's
third-largest agricultural export market while Washington's exports
to Taiwan totaled US$3.1 billion in 2005.</P>
      <P>But Gregoire wants to further cultivate bilateral ties, for
example by stepping up student exchanges and fostering business partnerships.</P>
      <P>"That can make people understand each other more," she said.</P>

state. It's a state with a very diverse culture and a high quality of
products, from airplanes and apples to coffee," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CREATE INCENTIVES TO RECYCLE WASTE BATTERIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several local governments are using
incentives to urge people to recycle waste batteries, with the Taipei
County government providing lucky draws for several gift coupons
worth NT$5,000 each.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) , more than 300 million batteries are used in
Taiwan per year, with less than 20 percent being recycled.</P>
      <P>Cheng Tzu-shou, chief of the EPA's recycling management
committee, noted that if not properly disposed of, some toxic
elements in batteries -- including mercury, cadmium, and lead --
pollute the soil and water supply, and may have a damaging affect on
the human blood, nervous, urological and fertility systems.</P>
      <P>To protect the environment from such harmful waste, the EPA has
launched the battery recycling campaign, and several local
governments have joined the EPA's efforts, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>For example, Cheng added, each Taipei County resident can receive
a lucky draw ticket in exchange for recycling ten waste batteries at
Yingge Ceramics Museum on Oct. 29, and Hsinchu City's Department of
Environmental Protection is also offering lucky draws with notebook
computers, LCD television sets and digital cameras as prizes to those
who recycle waste batteries</P>
      <P>As there are many recycling facilities set aside by convenient
stores, supermarkets, telecommunication stores and garbage trucks,
Cheng urged the public not to throw away batteries as a gesture of
protecting the earth.</P>
      <P>Recently, a manager of a battery manufacturer reminded the public
that batteries are frequently used by children in daily life and
therefore the people of Taiwan should be taught from childhood about
the importance of recycling batteries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY REMAINS KEY TO IMPROVING CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Wu Jih-chun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democracy is Taiwan's most valuable
asset in its political development and from a mid- to long-term
perspective, democracy remains key to improving relations across the
Taiwan Strait, the Republic of China minister of foreign affairs said
here Friday.</P>
      <P>James Huang made the remarks in a speech delivered at a Stanford
University dinner reception, attended by nearly 100 noted U.S.
scholars and experts in Asia-Pacific affairs, including former U.S.
Secretary of Defense William Perry. Liao Wei-ping, director of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, was also present at the
occasion.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's foreign minister, Huang said he is obliged to maitain
Taiwan's national dignity and win international respect for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Given its economic strength and advances in medical services,
Huang said, Taiwan can contribute a great deal to global public
health care and economic development. However, he lamented that China
has relentlessly obstructed Taiwan's participation in international
cooperative programs in those fields.</P>
      <P>Huang said Taiwan is willing to engage in peaceful dialogue with
China. But he stressed that such dialogue should be conducted on the
premise of parity, reaffirming Taiwan's resolve to maintain its
distinct national identity, political liberty and democracy.</P>
      <P>While the recent North Korean nuclear test has caused widespread
global concerns, Huang said the world tends to overlook China's
missile threat against Taiwan. China has targeted 800 ballistic
missiles at Taiwan, Huang said. Despite such threat, Huang said
Taiwan is unlikely to develop nuclear weapons because Taiwan
upholds freedom, democracy and human rights as its core values.</P>
      <P>Against the backdrop of globalization and democratization, Huang
said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should leave aside the
controversy over sovereignty and proceed to democratic dialogues.</P>
      <P>If in the beginning, there is difficulty to initiate
government-to-government dialogues, Huang said Taiwan is willing to
start with talks at the non-governmental level.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ultimate cure to the cross-strait issue is a
democratic China, Huang said Taiwan, with the experience of being the
first successful democracy in predominantly Chinese societies, will
and is willing to be "the best partner to China on her way to
democracy."</P>
      <P>At to the form of relations between Taiwan and China, Huang said
that as long as the democratic process is followed, and the consent
of the majority of the Taiwanese people is obtained, the ROC
government remains "open to any kind of possibilities."</P>
      <P>Huang also called on the international community to engage in
democratic dialogue with China and to assist her to become a member
of the world's democratic community. "The democratization of China
will be the most critical global issue in the 21st century, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's domestic issues, Huang acknowledged that
Taiwan, as one of the third-wave democracies, has indeed encountered
several democratic crises and challenges over the years.</P>
      <P>For the most part, Huang said, all the crises and challenges
have derived from the fact that institutional reforms are unable to
keep up with the changing environment. As an emerging democracy,
he said, many of Taiwan's existing systems and operations remain
weak and insufficient.</P>
      <P>"The challenges we've met on the way are tests and trials to our
fledgling democracy, Huang said, adding that the Taiwanese people
must learn to face up to these problems through reason and with an
open mind and must seek judicial recourse for resolutions. </P>
      <P>It is understandable that not all the people can be 100 percent
satisfied with their own democratic system, Huang went on, but he
added that as long as people remain free to articulate their views
and aspirations, the foundation of a sound democratic system can be
ensured.</P>
      <P>Noting that there has been a very high level of civil
participation in Taiwan's society, Huang said this could not have
occurred without the government's respect for freedom of the press
and the expression of diverse views. </P>
      <P>In conclusion, Huang said he believes that Taiwan can face its
problems with confidence.learn its lesson along the way and move on
the right track to deepen its democratic development.</P>

      <P>The leader of a so-called "anti-corruption"
campaign to pressure President Chen Shui-bian to resign over
allegations of graft said Saturday he is willing to assume all
political and legal responsibility for the disorder that occurred on
Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh made the remarks after being interrogated by a

"besiege" the Presidential Office Oct. 10 in a bid to force Chen to
step down over alleged corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>The police maintained that Shih didn't obtain permission before
calling up tens of thousands of slogan-chanting protesters to take to
the streets of Taipei on National Day.</P>
      <P>Shih stressed he would not evade any responsibility that he
should assume, but argued that the Chen administration should be
blamed in this case, accusing the DPP administration of having backed
off its commitment to establishing clean politics since gripping
power six years ago.</P>

      <P>The leader of a so-called "anti-corruption"

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY REMAINS KEY TO IMPROVING CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MINISTER(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Wu Jih-chun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democracy is Taiwan's most valuable
asset in its political development and from a mid- to long-term
perspective, democracy remains key to improving relations across the
Taiwan Strait, the Republic of China minister of foreign affairs said
here Friday.</P>
      <P>James Huang made the remarks in a speech delivered at a Stanford
University dinner reception, attended by nearly 100 noted U.S.
scholars and experts in Asia-Pacific affairs, including former U.S.
Secretary of Defense William Perry. Liao Wei-ping, director of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, was also present at the
occasion.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's foreign minister, Huang said he is obliged to maitain
Taiwan's national dignity and win international respect for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Given its economic strength and advances in medical services,
Huang said, Taiwan can contribute a great deal to global public
health care and economic development. However, he lamented that China
has relentlessly obstructed Taiwan's participation in international
cooperative programs in those fields.</P>
      <P>Huang said Taiwan is willing to engage in peaceful dialogue with
China. But he stressed that such dialogue should be conducted on the
premise of parity, reaffirming Taiwan's resolve to maintain its
distinct national identity, political liberty and democracy.</P>
      <P>While the recent North Korean nuclear test has caused widespread
global concerns, Huang said the world tends to overlook China's
missile threat against Taiwan. China has targeted 800 ballistic
missiles at Taiwan, Huang said. Despite such threat, Huang said
Taiwan is unlikely to develop nuclear weapons because Taiwan
upholds freedom, democracy and human rights as its core values.</P>
      <P>Against the backdrop of globalization and democratization, Huang
said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should leave aside the
controversy over sovereignty and proceed to democratic dialogues.</P>
      <P>If in the beginning, there is difficulty to initiate
government-to-government dialogues, Huang said Taiwan is willing to
start with talks at the non-governmental level.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ultimate cure to the cross-strait issue is a
democratic China, Huang said Taiwan, with the experience of being the
first successful democracy in predominantly Chinese societies, will
and is willing to be "the best partner to China on her way to
democracy."</P>
      <P>At to the form of relations between Taiwan and China, Huang said
that as long as the democratic process is followed, and the consent
of the majority of the Taiwanese people is obtained, the ROC
government remains "open to any kind of possibilities."</P>
      <P>Huang also called on the international community to engage in
democratic dialogue with China and to assist her to become a member
of the world's democratic community. "The democratization of China
will be the most critical global issue in the 21st century, " he
added.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's domestic issues, Huang acknowledged that
Taiwan, as one of the third-wave democracies, has indeed encountered
several democratic crises and challenges over the years.</P>
      <P>For the most part, Huang said, all the crises and challenges
have derived from the fact that institutional reforms are unable to
keep up with the changing environment. As an emerging democracy,
he said, many of Taiwan's existing systems and operations remain
weak and insufficient.</P>
      <P>"The challenges we've met on the way are tests and trials to our
fledgling democracy, Huang said, adding that the Taiwanese people
must learn to face up to these problems through reason and with an
open mind and must seek judicial recourse for resolutions. </P>
      <P>It is understandable that not all the people can be 100 percent
satisfied with their own democratic system, Huang went on, but he
added that as long as people remain free to articulate their views
and aspirations, the foundation of a sound democratic system can be
ensured.</P>
      <P>Noting that there has been a very high level of civil
participation in Taiwan's society, Huang said this could not have
occurred without the government's respect for freedom of the press
and the expression of diverse views. </P>
      <P>In conclusion, Huang said he believes that Taiwan can face its
problems with confidence.learn its lesson along the way and move on
the right track to deepen its democratic development.</P>

      <P>The secretary-general of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Sunday that the ruling party will help
push for the relocation of the capital to central or southern Taiwan
and that the issue can be determined via a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Nearly 70 legislators, led by DPP Legislator Trong Chai, signed a
proposal last Monday to relocate the capital away from Taipei City in
the north to central or southern Taiwan to help achieve the goal of
balanced development in the country and to "better reflect the true
identity of Taiwan and allow the international community to hear more
of Taiwan's voices."</P>
      <P>Lin said that if necessary, a national referendum can be held to
allow the people to vote directly on the issue.</P>
      <P>Lin, who lost the Taichung mayoral election last year as a DPP
candidate, said that he personally favors the capital being relocated
to Taichung, which he described as having an ideal central location,
a good climate, and convenient transportation and communications
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Ahead of a move of the capital to Taichung, Lin said, the
administration could consider first moving the headquarters of the

    <HEADLINE>EUROPEAN BANK TO OPEN ITS FIRST ASIAN OFFICE IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Jeniffer Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) is scheduled to open an office in Taipei Tuesday
as the regional banking institution's first affiliate in Asia.</P>
      <P>EBRD First Vice President Varel Freeman, who will travel to
Taiwan to officiate at a ceremony marking the office's inauguration,
said the EBRD is opening the Taipei office in the hopes that Taiwan
-- with its rich and successful experience in the development of
small- and medium-size enterprises -- will reach out to help
countries in central and eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>Freeman, a citizen of the United States who became an EBRD first
vice president last August, overseeing all banking operations of the
EBRD, is expected to be accompanied by several senior EBRD officials
and specialists in attending the inauguration ceremony to be held at
the new office located at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>On the sidelines of the opening ceremony will be a seminar on
"EBRD Opportunities and Risks" to be held at the Grand Hyatt Taipei
and another ceremony marking a contract signing on a risk sharing
fund to be co-established by the EBRD and the International
Cooperation and Development Fund operated by Taiwan's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Freeman chairs the EBRD Operations Committee which reviews all
investment and loan proposals before consideration by the Board of
Directors, and oversees the formulation of the bank's strategy to
effectively and efficiently promote the transition of the 27
countries where the EBRD invests. Freemen is also a member of the
EBRD Executive Committee of the bank, which is chaired by the bank's
president, and acts in his absence.</P>
      <P>During his two-day stay in Taiwan, Freeman is scheduled to visit
the ministries of foreign affairs and economic affairs, in addition
to meeting executives of Taiwan's major financial and banking
institutions as well as companies, which are interested in investing
or relocating business operations to Russia or Eastern or Central
Europe</P>
      <P>EBRD Vice President Fabrizio Saccomanni visited Taipei in
November 2005 to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Foreign
Ministry to pave the way for the opening of an EBRD office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Saccomanni said Taiwan banks will be welcome to take part in
EBRD-backed trade promotion projects and syndicated loan projects
aimed at helping EBRD loan recipient countries reinvigorate their
economy and completely transform themselves into prosperous liberal
democracies.</P>
      <P>By so doing, he said, Taiwan banks can spare political and credit
risks while earning reasonable profits and forging financial ties in
the region.</P>
      <P>The EBRD, founded in 1990, uses the tools of investment to help
build market economies and democracies in 27 countries from Central
Europe to Central Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has maintained close interactions with the EBRD since the
bank's inception and has been one of the contributor countries.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2005, the bank had completed 1,301 trade
promotion projects worldwide, giving out loans totaling 30.31 billion
euros (US$38.28 billion) . Loans granted to beneficiary countries via

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURAL TRADE DEFICIT FOR JAN.-SEPT. HITS US$4.53 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan registered an agricultural trade
deficit of US$4.53 billion for the first nine months of this year,
caused mainly by a drastic drop in exports to Japan, which however
remained the largest buyer of Taiwan's farm produce, according to
statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) Sunday.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS quoted Council of Agriculture (COA) data as showing
that from January to September this year, Taiwan exported US$2.51
billion worth of agricultural products, down 4 percent from the level
for the same period last year, while imports grew 0.7 percent to
US$7.03 billion.</P>
      <P>Although the trade deficit of US$4.53 billion was up only US$0.16
billion over that for the same period the previous year, exports to
Japan fell 21.7 percent, to a mere US$0.72 billion, the government
tallies show.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said that during the first three quarters, Taiwan's
main agricultural exports were aquacultural and dairy products,
totalling US$1.82 billion, an amount that accounted for 72.5 percent
of the country's total agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>The main agricultural imports for the period were grains and
tobacco, valued at US$4.17 billion, followed by meat and other farm
animal products, amounting to US$1.45 billion. These major items
accounted for 79.9 percent of Taiwan's total agricultural imports.</P>
      <P>In terms of export markets, Japan remained Taiwan's No. 1 buyer
of agricultural products despite the whopping 21.7 percent decline
over the previous year. China (including Hong Kong) and the United
States were the No. 2 and No. 3 markets for Taiwan's farm produce.</P>
      <P>The United States was also the No. 1 source of Taiwan's
agricultural imports for the first nine months of the year, selling
US$2.11 billion worth of goods to the island, up 2.6 percent over the
figure for the same period a year earlier. Australia and Japan were
the second and third largest exporters of farm produce to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP TO PRESENT 'SUNSHINE FAMILY PLAN' TO HELP THE POOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday she
will put forward a "sunshine family plan" in the near future in the
hopes of having rich families help the impoverished get ahead.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Lu said, Taiwan has become too obsessed with
politics while overlooking significant socioeconomic changes amid
globalization. As a result, she lamented, the wealth gap between rich
and poor has become ever more serious.</P>
      <P>Noting that the wealth gap has been widening, Lu said the average
annual income of the wealthiest 20 percent of households, standing at
NT$1.79 million, is now 6.04 times that of the bottom 20 percent,
which stands at NT$298,000. Worse still, she said, 85,000 households
are leading a hand-to-mouth existence.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lu said she feels compelled to come up
with a "sunshine family plan" to enlist the rich to help with poverty
elimination in domestic society. Precise details of the program will
be announced in the near future, she added.</P>
      <P>Lu further said bitter confrontation between the ruling and
opposition parties in recent years has hindered national development
and affected political stability.</P>
      <P>With a strong opposition in the legislature, a stalemate in the
lawmaking process has emerged, Lu said. As a result, she went on,
many important bills and policy initiatives have been boycotted or
deferred, leading only to meaningless attrition.</P>
      <P>Preoccupation with political strife has left major social and
economic issues neglected, such as the aging of the population, low
birth rate, high unemployment and rising suicide, Lu said. The number
of people who committed suicide jumped from 1,847 in 1996 to 4,282
last year.</P>
      <P>"Given all these grim tallies, we should no longer be preoccupied
with partisan politics and should instead pay more heed to the income
inequality problems in the pursuit of socioeconomic justice and
judicial independence and impartiality," Lu urged.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang warned Sunday that a
continuation of social turmoil, as the leader of an anti-corruption
campaign has threatened to pursue, will blunt Taiwan's international
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Su was commenting on "One Million Voices Against Corruption"
campaign leader Shih Ming-teh's promise to renew the campaign's
thrust in plans that he will announce Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih, a former chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, made
the statement Saturday after some DPP leaders described the "red
tide" created by his depose-President Chen Shui-bian campaign as
ebbing.</P>
      <P>During an inspection tour of Changhua in central Taiwan, Su said
he will respect the "political views" of campaign participants. "But
endless social unrest will cause Taiwan to lose its competitiveness,"
he warned.</P>
      <P>In answer to media questions, the premier also expressed the hope
that the legislature will approve the government's arms-procurement
budget proposal soon.</P>
      <P>"The arms purchase bill has been stalled [at the legislature] for
too long, and screening has not even started," he said.</P>
      <P>The premier was asked to comment on a media report that former
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage has written to quite
a number of political leaders in Taiwan regarding Taiwan's plan to
buy anti-submarine aircraft from the United States.</P>
      <P>Su said he has not seen such a letter, "but the budget should be
approved as quickly as possible since it has been stalled for so
long."</P>
      <P>As to what kinds of weapons to buy and from which companies, "the
Ministry of National Defense will follow strict procurement
procedures" in making the decision, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, CPC REACH DEAL ON EXPORTING TAIWAN BANANAS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus
announced Sunday that the party has reached a deal with the Communist
Party of China (CPC) on exporting bananas to China to help Taiwan
banana growers facing a glut in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Banana prices in Taiwan have taken a nosedive recently as a
result of overproduction, with wholesale prices plummeting to below
NT$5 per kilo.</P>
      <P>KMT Central Policy Committee Executive Director Tseng Yung-chuan
said at a press conference in Taipei that the KMT and CPC had reached
agreement in a meeting held in Xiamen Saturday which extended to 2
a.m. Sunday that China would buy up all the 2,000 metric tons of
Taiwan's excess banana supply at a price of NT$10 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The first batch of 300 tons is expected to be shipped to Shanghai
and Tianjin via Hong Kong Tuesday to help alleviate the anxiety of
the banana farmers, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Fruit Marketing Cooperative and two other private-run
farmers' associations will be authorized to handle the export of the
bananas, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen Wu-hsiung, a former vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA) who took part in the Xiamen meeting as a
representative of the KMT and returned to Taipei at around noon
Sunday, said the Chinese authorities have agreed to make the
procurement to help solve the farmers' problems, adding that payment
for the first shipment of bananas is expected to be made by Chinese
buyers in two weeks.</P>
      <P>The NT$10 per kilo offered by the Chinese importers is
significantly higher than the NT$3 per kilo that has been promised by
COA Chairman Su Jia-chyuan to the farmers under a COA "stabilizing
farm produce prices" project, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that despite the overproduction in Taiwan, the bananas
to be exported to China will have guaranteed quality as the fruit
will be packed and shipped by standards on par with those of such
exports to Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Jung-kung, a deputy executive director of the
KMT Central Policy Committee, said that since the administration has
agreed to open holiday cross-strait charter flights and special
cross-strait cargo charter flight services for high-technology
industries, it should also consider opening "special cross-strait
banana charter flights" as a measure to help Taiwan's growers and to
"demonstrate the government's guts."</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Su said Oct. 18 that he was disappointed with the
results of a cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural forum that opened a
meeting in southern China Oct. 17 sponsored by the KMT and the CPC.
He said that he had hoped China would buy Taiwan bananas but was
disappointed to find out that "we have to rely on Taiwan consumers."</P>
      <P>The supply of bananas in Taiwan was disrupted in the wake of a
series of typhoons last year. This year, after banana growers
increased production to cash in on rising prices, which soared to
NT$60 per kilogram in March and April, oversupply began to have an
effect by the end of June, with prices nosediving to below NT$6 per
kilo.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan has
promised to earmark funds for baseball training programs at schools
to help nurture baseball talent in the southern port city.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the promise during a question-and-answer session at the
Kaohsiung City Council Friday.</P>
      <P>During the session, Councilor Chen Hsin-yu of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party said that scores of elementary and
junior high schools in the city have encountered difficulties in
fielding baseball teams due to a lack of financial resources.</P>
      <P>For example, Chen said, the baseball training program at Fuhsin
Elementary School, where most of the students are aboriginal, has
been having trouble moving forward due to financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that the city government provide NT$1,000 per
month for each of the school's 75 baseball players.</P>
      <P>She further said the baseball craze in Taiwan has been fanned by
the brilliant performance of Taiwan-born New York Yankees pitcher
Wang Chien-ming. Young baseball players in Taiwan are now keen on
winning recognition abroad just like Wang has, Chen said, adding that
the government needs to help them realize their dream.</P>
      <P>In response, Yeh said she is in favor of earmarking funds for
baseball training programs at elementary and junior high schools, as
well as providing subsidies to baseball teams and players in
Kaohsiung City regardless of whether they apply for such subsidies.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) heavyweights
and primary also-rans stood behind the party's nominee for Taipei
mayor, Hau Lung-bin, during a ceremony launching Hau's campaign
headquarters Sunday.</P>
      <P>Throwing their support behind Hau were, among others, KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and KMT Vice
Chairman Wu Po-hsiung, as well as Yeh Chin-chuan, Ting Shou-chung,
John Chiang and Tsai Cheng-yuan -- who lost in the party's primary
for the mayoral election slated for Ddec. 9.</P>
      <P>Hau said that ever since he decided to join the election
campaign, he has hoped that it will be a "model" democratic race
marked by "a lot of policy debate and very little political
spitting."</P>
      <P>However, he added, that hope has been dashed by an "anachronistic
rival" who has been focusing attacks on his father, former Premier
Hau Pei-tsun, leading people to wonder whether this rival is
competing against him or against his father for the mayoral post.</P>
      <P>Hau was referring to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) nominee, former Premier Frank Hsieh, who has challenged Hau
to answer several integrity questions regarding the Hau family's use
of public money.</P>
      <P>Hau said that, if elected, he will use his four years in office
to clean up Danshui River, bring a new skyline to the city, and
renovate such old districts as Wanhua and Datong.</P>
      <P>He noted that his team has mapped out a city administration plan
that focuses on nine major programs to be implemented in 470 projects
covering environment, health, education and transportation under the
theme of "bright prospects for boosting metropolitan Taipei's
competitiveness."</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma, who is also incumbent mayor of Taipei, lauded
Hau for being a "competent and morally courageous" political leader
who, while serving as environment minister, had achieved an excellent
track record before quitting voluntarily to take responsibility for
opposing allowing Pinglin residents to use a referendum to decide
policy issues concerning an interchange system on the Taipei-Yilan
Expressway.</P>
      <P>Also showing up to boost Hau's campaign were former Kaohsiung
Mayor Wu Dun-yi and former Taipei Deputy Mayor Ou Chin-teh, as well
as all 27 of the party's nominees for the city council elections,
which will be held on the same day.</P>
      <P>A catch phrase at the ceremony was "unite the pan-blue alliance,"
as the emcee repeatedly urged the KMT supporters not to split their
votes among James Soong, chairman of the People First Party (PFP) ,
and Lee Ao, an independent legislator who has always voted along with
the "pan-blue" line.</P>
      <P>A fifth candidate in the race is Chou Yu-kou of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), who has won the blessing of former President
Lee Teng-hui.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) declined to comment in detail Sunday on China's
reported willingness to import 2,000 tons tons of Taiwan bananas to
help Taiwan growers facing a glut in the domestic market, labeling it
a"business deal in the private sector."</P>
      <P>The COA officials said the council will remain neutral toward the
business transaction in the private sector as long as the deal is
beneficial to Taiwan growers.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen whether the Chinese procurement of 2,000
tons of Taiwan bananas will have any significant positive effect as
banana prices in the domestic market have begun to pick up in recent
days and as there is an excess supply of bananas of about 3,000 tons
each month, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) announced Sunday that it had
reached a deal with the Communist Party of China (CPC) earlier in the
day on the export of 2,000 tons of Taiwan bananas to China at a price
of NT$10 per kilogram.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate in the Dec. 9 mayoral election
in Taipei City, challenged his opposition Kuomintang (KMT) rival, Hau
Lung-bin, Sunday to prove his innocence in an allegation that he has
used public money to pay his water, electricity and phone bills.</P>
      <P>"If [Hau] can show us receipts proving he has paid the bills with
his own money, I will quit the race," claimed Hsieh, a former premier
who has been hounding Hau over what he calls "the integrity issue."</P>
      <P>Hsieh's DPP comrades, Legislators Kuan Pi-ling and Hsu Kuo-yung,
added ammunition to Hsieh's salvos by holding a press conference at
the legislature to accuse Hau of "sharing" a government package
giving his father, former Premier Hau Pei-tsun, preferential
treatment in household utility charges.</P>
      <P>In response to Hau's argument that the package was actually
approved by Hsieh himself when Hsieh was premier, Hsieh claimed that
Hau Lung-bin is not a retired premier and so is not eligible for such
treatment.</P>
      <P>"It is simply criminal behavior that marks a low standard of
political ethics," Hsieh asserted.</P>
      <P>He ridiculed Hau for making a ridiculous joke by complaining
about why Hsieh had not attacked him earlier over this matter.</P>
      <P>"Hau is just like a thief who has just been caught complaining to
police about why they had not tried to catch him over the past years
when he had been stealing, " Hsieh said, adding that he was not
raising the question until now because he was not given such
information until the mayoral election campaign began.</P>
      <P>Hau referred to the accusations made by Hsieh and his DPP
comrades as "nothing but electioneering gimmicks, " urging his
"respected rival" to come up with more policy ideas rather than
"political spitting."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) has announced ticket prices and people can hardly wait to
take a much touted 90-minute train ride between Kaohsiung and Taipei,
a senior transport official said Sunday the service is unlikely to be
launched until after the end of October.</P>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Vice Minister Ho Nuan-hsuan's
statement came in spite of repeated pledges by THSRC and the
government that the service will be launched on Oct. 31, after a
one-year delay.</P>
      <P>After attending two days of THSRC's mock operations, including
two-way operations on a single line and emergency response to
earthquakes, Ho said he was "rather satisfied" with the results,
though there were still shortcomings.</P>
      <P>As to whether the whole system has developed to the level of
officially launching public service, he said the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) must wait for an independent
verification and validation (IV&amp;V) report from Lloyd's Register of
Shipping of the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The report will not be available until early November, when THSRC
will submit its train schedule to Lloyd's; a review committee will
not call a "concluding" conference until it sees Lloyd's IV&amp;V report;
and MOTC respects both the IV&amp;V report and the committee's final
conclusion, according to Ho.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, it is certain that the official launching of
high-speed train service will be put off until after the Oct. 31
deadline.</P>
      <P>"If there is any safety concern, MOTC will not easily give a
green light [for launching the service]," Ho said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Varel Freeman, first vice president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) , arrived in
Taipei Sunday to preside over the opening of the bank's Taiwan office
the following day.</P>
      <P>This is Freeman's first visit to Taiwan, and the office to be
opened Monday at the Taipei World Trade Center will be the EBRD's
only foothold in Asia.</P>
      <P>The new office is expected to employ Taiwan's successful
experience in small- and medium-size enterprise development to help
boost economic growth in countries in the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), the Baltic Sea, and Central and Eastern Europe, Freeman
said upon his arrival.</P>
      <P>Besides officiating at the EBRD Taipei office inauguration,
Freemen will chair a seminar on "EBRD Opportunities and Risks" and
sign an agreement with Taiwan's government-managed International
Cooperation and Development Fund on the establishment of a
risk-sharing fund.</P>
      <P>During his two-day stay, Freeman, an American citizen who
assumed his current post in August last year, will also meet with
senior executives of major Taiwanese business groups, particularly
those interested in tapping markets in CIS member states and Central
and Eastern European countries.</P>
      <P>The EBRD, founded in 1990, provides project financing for banks,
industries and businesses, both new ventures and investments in
existing companies. It also works with publicly owned companies to
support privatization, restructuring state-owned firms and
improvement of municipal services.</P>
      <P>The EBRD's mandate stipulates that it must only work in countries
that are committed to democratic principles. It is directed by its
founding agreement to promote environmentally sound and sustainable
development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, one of the EBRD's contributor countries, has maintained
close interaction with the bank since its inception.</P>
      <P>Government sources said Taiwan originally sought for the EBRD
president to travel to Taipei to chair the opening of the bank's
Taiwan office. The plan was aborted because of China's deliberate
sabotages, the sources said.</P>

      <P>Ministry officials said Sunday that the upgraded Immigration
Administration will have 2,386 full-time staff, including 310
contract employees.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang denied Sunday
that the new Immigration Administration's staff recruitment was
marred by favoritism.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to a newspaper report that lawmakers from
across the political spectrum have lobbied on behalf of many police
officers intending to transfer to positions in the Immigration
Administration as they believe that they will have better chances for
promotion in the new office.</P>
      <P>Although some lawmakers have recommended candidates, Lee said the
selection of police officers to be qualified for transfer to the
Immigration Office has not been affected by any lobby campaign or
favoritism.</P>
      <P>"The selection was completely based on a comprehensive package of
regulations announced in July, " Lee stressed, adding that the
selection was in terms of individual police officers' scores of
performance and existing promotion order.</P>
      <P>A large portion of the new Immigration Office's positions will be
filled by staff to be mandatorily transferred from relevant
government agencies, and only 369 vacancies are open for police
officers to apply for transfer. A total of 8,000 police officers vied
for those posts.</P>
      <P>"Competition was fierce, and we have strictly followed the
principles of objectivity and impartiality. Connections or favoritism
were never a factor in the selection," Lee stressed.</P>
      <P>The name list of police officers qualified to join the
Immigration Administration has been unveiled on the MOI's Web site,
Lee added.</P>

      <P>The scheduled launch of service on Taiwan's

the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) fails to produce the
required independent safety verification report within the next few

failed to produce the independent verification and validation (IV&amp;V)
report from Lloyd's Register of Shipping of the United Kingdom on
Oct. 20 as required before his ministry gives the green light for
the launch of service.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he has no idea why the official launch of the railway
system has continued to be put off, noting that THSRC Chairwoman Nita
Ing has disappointed the country by delaying the inauguration of the
railway service from October 2005 to November this year.</P>
      <P>The minister told lawmakers that a review committee will not call
a "concluding" conference until it sees the IV&amp;V report on the

    <HEADLINE>U.S. KNOWS TAIWAN'S STANCE ON CONSTITUTIONAL RE-ENGINEERING: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang 
said Monday that Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering will not
touch on sensitive issues and that the United States understands
Taiwan's stance.</P>
      <P>Huang, who returned from a five-day visit to the United States
Sunday, was responding to questions about whether he had communicated
with the United States to address the latter's concerns over
President Chen Shui-bian's recent remarks.</P>
      <P>President Chen said last month that it may be high time to
seriously consider the issue regarding the definition of the nation's
territory enshrined in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The president also proposed early this month that the existing
Constitution be frozen to enact a "second republic constitution" that
fits the status quo in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he had some private time and made a speech at
Stanford University during his U.S. visit. He also met privately with
former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and some retired
officials and scholars.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he did not discuss with U.S. officials the
long-stalled arms procurement project or constitutional
re-engineering during his visit.</P>
      <P>He noted that since President Chen was re-elected in 2004, the
two sides have continued to communicate with each other on issues
regarding constitutional re-engineering.</P>
      <P>"The communications have gone well, and Taiwan's government has
pledged that it will not touch on sensitive issues in promoting 
constitutional re-engineering, " he said, adding that "the United
States has a good understanding of Taiwan's stance."</P>
      <P>Washington reportedly is concerned about whether Chen's remarks
go against his "four noes" pledge made in his inaugural speeches in
2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>In the speeches, Chen promised that if China has no intention of
using force against Taiwan, he will not declare independence, not
change the national title, not include the "two-state theory"
regarding cross-strait relations into the Constitution, and not hold
an "independence vs. unification" referendum on Taiwan's future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE GROUP URGED TO START TALKS ON TOURIST OPENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged the
Beijing-based Cross-Strait Tourism Exchange Association (CSTEA) to
engage in dialogue with its Taiwan counterpart soon to pave the way
for Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The KMT urged the CSTEA to write to its Taiwan counterpart, the
Taiwan Strait Tourism Association (TSTA), immediately so that the two
quasi-official groups could start negotiations on the matter soon to
facilitate the tourist opening, hopefully before the end of November,
said Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that during a visit to Beijing in early September,
members of a KMT delegation, including himself, reached consensus
with Beijing officials, led by China's top official in charge of
Taiwan affairs, Chen Yunlin, that two unofficial groups from the two
sides will be authorized to negotiate the details of the opening of
Taiwan to Chinese tourists under the "Macau formula, " with the issue
of sovereignty being shelved.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed on implementing direct flight services,
including weekend charter flights, without the requirement of stops
in third locations, like Hong Kong or Macau, while leaving the flight
right issue untouched, Tseng noted.</P>
      <P>Now that the two quasi-official groups -- the CSTEA and the TSTA
-- have been established, it's time for them to start talking, Tseng
said, adding that if the CSTEA-TSTA talks can be concluded before the
end of November, the first group of the Chinese tourists can be
expected in Taiwan by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a party whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said
that if the direct cross-strait charter flight services are allowed,
this will translate into total savings of about NT$50 billion
(US$1.52 billion) in travel expenses each year for the some 4 million
Taiwan businesspeople and tourists that make cross-strait trips.</P>
      <P>Tsai also called for the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) to forsake ideology and give the green light to the TSTA to
start negotiations with China's CSTEA on the tourist opening.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-sheng, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications who also serves as
chairman of the TSTA, said last week that both the TSTA and the CSTEA
became operational recently and that the TSTA is awaiting the green
light from the MAC to authorize it to represent Taiwan in bilateral
talks with the CSTEA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STRIVING TO MAINTAIN STATUS QUO: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Wu Jih-chun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government and people of the Republic
of China on Taiwan are concerned about the gradual tilting of the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait in China's favor, Foreign Affairs
Minister James Huang said in a recent interview with Voice of
America.</P>
      <P>Some political pundits have blamed the Democratic Progressive
Party administration for promoting Taiwan independence in a gradual
manner. But Huang said in the interview with the U.S.-based
multimedia broadcasting service during his visit to San Francisco
last Friday that such blame is "unfair and deviates from truth."</P>
      <P>Huang said Taiwan need not pursue "another form of independence"
nor declare independence since it has been an independent sovereign
state officially referred to as the Republic of China. Contrary to
the criticism, he argued, what the ROC government and people are most
concerned about is the gradual tilting toward "unification with
China."</P>
      <P>Following China's rise as an economic power, Huang said, it has
stepped up "united front" tactics against Taiwan by boosting
interaction with Taiwan's opposition parties and the private sector.
The ever-growing cross-strait trade and China-bound investment by
Taiwanese enterprises have made it increasingly difficult to maintain
the current cross-strait status quo, Huang said.</P>
      <P>As China remains hostile toward Taiwan, declines to renounce the
option of the use of force against Taiwan, and has 800 ballistic
missiles deployed along its southeastern coast opposite Taiwan, Huang
said, the ROC government "must defend Taiwan's own national identity
and protect its status quo as a liberal democracy from being
wrecked."</P>
      <P>Huang further said Taiwan's distinct national identity has not
been deliberately nurtured by its government, but has rather evolved
naturally on the island over the past five decades. "The people of
Taiwan have gotten accustomed to the natural environment and
atmosphere of their homeland," he noted.</P>
      <P>Asked what Taiwan should do to mitigate cross-strait tension,
Huang said it has been Taiwan's policy goal to chart a stable
framework for peaceful interaction with China.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has on numerous occasions called for the
creation of such an interaction framework, Huang said, adding that
much to Taiwan's regret, Beijing has consistently turned a deaf ear
to the appeal and has failed to make any response. "Improving
cross-strait ties cannot depend solely on Taiwan's unilateral efforts
as it takes two to tango," he added.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering plan, Huang said the
government's stance is crystal clear, namely that any amendment
proposals should be based on the cardinal premise of no fundamental
change to the present status quo.</P>
      <P>Although some individual politicians and political parties have
expressed differing opinions about the constitutional reform, none of
those proposals should be interpreted as reflecting the government's
stance, Huang said, adding that the ROC government should not be
labeled as a "troublemaker" simply because of ideas put forward by
some radical activists.</P>

Darfur rebels were fighting the

flush with weapons taken from the Sudanese

Wall Street Journal: In Shift From Nursing
Homes, State Has Family Members Care for
Elderly Relatives Helping Gram at $9.25 an Hour

In an effort being watched around the
nation, Vermont is trying to give elderly people
a choice of where they want to be cared for: in 
an institution or at home. To create more home-
care workers, the state has been paying for
family members to care for aging relatives, at
about $10 an hour. If Vermont's program works,
it could influence a wider change in the
multibillion-dollar industry that cares for the
aged. As the number of older Americans -- and
the cost of caring for them -- soars, the
federal government is pushing efforts like the
one in Vermont. Advocates say in-home care could
improve the lives of many seniors, while saving
the government money. But the idea faces huge
hurdles, including opposition from the nursing-
home industry and a culture of dispersed, busy
families that has become accustomed to having
others care for their loved ones.</TEXT>

      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" should
keep its promise by allowing several proposals initiated by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to be screened in the
Legislative Yuan, DPP legislative caucus whip Yeh Yi-jin said Monday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the legislature, Yeh said the
Executive Yuan has withdrawn the special arms purchase plan in the
legislature and replaced it with an annual arms procurement budget
plan in accordance with the petition of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Yeh expressed the hope that the "pan-blue" legislators, which
hold a slight majority in the legislature, will put several
proposals, including the arms purchase plan, the nomination list for
Control Yuan members and the nomination of the country's state public
prosecutor general, on the agenda for screening in Monday's procedure
committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Yeh expressed regret over the remarks made by PFP Chairman James
Soong Sunday that members of a so-called anti-graft campaign with
President Chen Shui-bian as its target have proposed that "pan-blue"
lawmakers postpone placing the three proposals on the agenda until
prosecutors close the probe into the alleged misuse of the
Presidential Office's state affairs budget.</P>
      <P>Yeh said she has doubted the political wisdom of the leader of

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HALTS FLU VACCINE AFTER FOUR ISRAELIS DIE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Center for Disease Control (CDC)
ordered an immediate halt Monday to flu vaccinations using a vaccine
manufactured by a French company after four people in Israel were
reported to have died soon after receiving the vaccine.</P>
      <P>The CDC said no more shots of Sanofi-Aventis-made vaccine would
be given, even though there have been no local reports of any serious
side effects of the flu vaccine since the government began offering
free flu vaccinations to children aged under two and senior citizens
aged above 65 in mid-Septemer.</P>
      <P>Deputy CDC Director-General Chou Chih-hau said the center had
been trying to contact the French pharmaceutical company and the
CDC's overseas offices ever since being informed of the Israeli
deaths.</P>
      <P>Because of the time difference in France and Israel, the CDC was
unable to obtain immediate information on the problematic vaccine or
the cause of the deaths in Israel, Chou said. However, he urged the
public to stay calm, pointing out that "those fatalities do not mean
the French flu vaccine imported into Taiwan is also problematic."</P>
      <P>Since the government kicked off free flu vaccinations for infants
Sept. 25 and free shots for elderly people Oct. 11, some of the
Sanofi-Aventis vaccine has been used, according to the CDC, which
also revealed that it purchased a total of 1.128 million doses of flu
vaccine manufactured by the French company this year.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire reports, the Israeli health authorities
were investigating whether the deaths, all of which occurred in the
town of Kiryat Gat in southern Israel over the past week, are
connected to the French vaccine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION URGED TO BE RATIONAL ON BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition parties were urged Monday to
be rational and to take only the interests of the people and the
country into consideration rather than "blindly axing" government
budgets.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-chin, a whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
legislative caucus, said the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
has caused over NT$115 billion (US$3.5 billion) in government budget
for 2006 to remain frozen, which he described as an unwise move that
has jeopardized the interests of the people and the country.</P>
      <P>Yeh asked legislators of the opposition Kuomintang and the People
First Party sarcastically if they intend to hobble Taiwan's economic
growth, undermine Taiwan's overall development or prevent the Taiwan
people from leading normal lives by boycotting the 2006 government
budget bill.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, some NT$23.3 billion in the government's
general budget, NT$53.3 billion in the state-run enterprise budget,
NT$39 billion in the budget for the expansion of public construction
projects for 2006 were frozen by the opposition.</P>
      <P>Yeh urged the opposition lawmakers to reconsider the government's
2006 budget bill and refrain from boycotting the budget bill via the
Legislative Procedure Committee.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislators are hijacking the rest of the
legislators and preventing them from exercising their rights as
lawmakers if the bill continues to be stuck in the Procedure
Committee, which is formed by only some 20 legislators, Yeh claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NSC OFFICIAL TRUSTS PROSECUTOR'S PROBE OF ALLEGED MISUSE OF FUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior National Security Council (NSC)
official urged the public Monday to trust Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen,
who is investigating alleged misuse of a "state affairs fund" by
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>NSC Secretary-General Chiou I-jen repeated the president's pledge
that if he or his wife are found to have been involved in any
corruption scandal, he will take responsibility by stepping down.</P>
      <P>During a legislative interpellation session, Chiou refused to
comment on the issue as it is still under judicial investigation.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to "believe in the justice system" rather
than comment on a case which is being investigated.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Chi-chu claimed that
since the Presidential Office "has long been breaking the law"
regarding its use of the state affairs fund, the office's budget
should be frozen except for personnel funds.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-hua, another KMT lawmaker, agreed that at least the
NT$50 million state affairs budget should be denied.</P>
      <P>Lin Teh-fu, also of the KMT, questioned why the Presidential
Office has requested an increase in the state affairs budget from
NT$35 million to NT$50 million per year, to which Tan Sun Chen,
secretary-general to the president, replied that the head of state
needs that amount to carry out "government business."</P>
      <P>Also criticized was the Presidential Office's request for NT$148
million to operate a limousine fleet for the president and the vice
president next year.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the request for fiscal 2007 has taken into account the
possibility that several teams of candidates will be running for the
2008 presidential election and claimed that the limousine fleet must
therefore be expanded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>After a three-year hiatus, United Airlines
(UA) of the United States is scheduled to resume its non-stop flight
service between Taipei and San Francisco from April 3, 2007, a
corporate source said Monday.</P>
      <P>UA suspended the flights in April 2003 after an outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan in March of that
year.</P>
      <P>UA is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its entry into the
Taiwan market this year. It launched its Taipei-Tokyo-San Francisco
route in 1986, followed by the opening of Taipei-San Francisco
non-stop flights in 1987, said Andrea Wu, general manager of UA
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Wu said, many customers who make
frequent business trips between San Francisco and Taipei have
inquired as to whether and when UA will resume direct non-stop
flights.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said, the service is being resumed to meet
increasing demand from Taiwan. In 2005, 580,000 Taiwan tourists
visited the United States, of which 190,000 visited California, up
7.9 percent over the 2004 figure, making Taiwan the seventh-largest
source of foreign visitors to California.</P>
      <P>UA will be using the Boeing 747 series to ply the Taipei-San
Francisco route, according to Wu. The flight will depart Taipei at
12: 20 a.m. every day and arrive in San Francisco at 8: 24 a.m. the
next day. The return flight will depart San Francisco at 1: 01 p.m.
and arrive in Taipei at 5:20 p.m. the next day.</P>
      <P>Currently, UA operates one flight each day between Taipei and the
United States via Japan. The company is scheduled to launch a daily
Taipei-Tokyo-Washington flight Oct. 28, according to Wu.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that

      <P>Ma made the remarks during a ceremony to mark the start of the

five hectares occupying one third of the part of the Keelung river

    <HEADLINE>MOEA CONTINUES EFFORTS IN UPGRADING NAPHTHA CRACKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long
said Monday that the ministry has not stopped efforts to upgrade two
naphtha cracking plants in the southern county of Kaohsiung in an
effort to keep the crackers at the same locations despite opposition
by local residents.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while responding to inquiries from
lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan about a planned upgrade to the
third naphtha cracker run by the state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
and a problem of whether or not to relocate the company's fifth
naphtha cracking plant in Houchin by 2015 -- the deadline for its
existence in the village. </P>
      <P>Chen said the government hopes the fifth cracker can stay in
Houchin and will spare no efforts to negotiate with local people to
keep the cracker at its current site.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has been trying to
persuade Houchin residents to allow the plant's upgrade at its
current site in order to save an expensive relocation project.
Residents in the area have long complained about pollution caused by
the plant. </P>
      <P>Claiming that an upgrade will efficiently reduce the cracker's
impact on the environment, Chen said the MOEA will continue efforts
to talk with Houchin residents on the issue.</P>
      <P>In 1990, the government promised Houchin people that the plant
would be relocated by 2015 before kicking off construction of the
cracker, as part of efforts to smooth over strong protests against
the construction.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Chairman Jeffrey Koo Jr. of Chinatrust
Financial Holding Co., a defendant in a prosecution investigation of
the company's investment in state-controlled Mega Financial Holding
Co., will return to Taiwan Nov. 18 as scheduled, a Chinatrust
spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo Jr. is on a two-month Eisenhower Fellowship program
in the United States. Several of his company's senior executives were
detained last week by investigators probing allegations that the
company invested in Mega Financial via structured notes transacted
through its Hong Kong branch.</P>
      <P>According to the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) ,
Chinatrust later transferred those notes to another Hong Kong-based
company called Red Fire Development Ltd., which cashed in the notes,
making a profit of over US$31 million. The money was later returned
to Chinatrust after the FSC intervened.</P>
      <P>Taiwan prosecutors suspect that Red Fire is a front company
controlled by the Koo family and are trying to determine whether any
individuals have made illicit profits from the Mega Financial
dealing.</P>
      <P>As the investigation is having an impact on not just Chinatrust
but also the country's financial market, prosecutors said they want
to conclude it as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>After detaining Chinatrust's former Chief Financial Officer Chang
Ming-tien, Chief Legal Officer Teng Yen-tun and Vice General Manager
of Finance Lin Hsiang-hsi, prosecutors will next question Koo Jr. for
his role in the incident.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the investigation might lead to charges of
breach of trust, illegal trading and violation of the banking law.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has denied media reports that Premier Su
Tseng-chang and Vice Premier Tsai Ying-wen are behind the
investigation.</P>
      <P>"This case is being probed by the judicial investigators, a case

    <HEADLINE>MOTC TO STUDY WHETHER THSRC HAS BREACHED CONTRACT IN LAUNCH DELAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   23   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Tsai Duei said Monday that he will study whether the
delayed inauguration of Taiwan's high speed railway constitutes a
breach of contract.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while answering questions at the
Legislative Yuan's transportation committee.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the scheduled Oct. 31 launch could be "problematic, "
adding that the primary concern will be safety but that the wait
should not extend six months or another year.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung of the opposition People First Party
said that a contract signed June 16, 2000 shows that the original
launch date was June 30, 2003.</P>
      <P>But the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) announced last year
that the inauguration would be postponed yet again for another year
until Oct. 31, 2006, Liu said, asking how the ministry plans to deal
with the second delay.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the build-operate-transfer project grants the builder
-- THSRC -- 35 years of operation, which started in 1998, and that
the delay has curtailed several years of operation, which he said is
a "sort of punishment."</P>
      <P>But Liu said the contract states that serious delay and
compromised quality constitute a breach of contract. In such a case,
the operation can be terminated and the contract can be revoked or
terminated and Liu called for the MOTC to make a decision.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Fu-hsiang, director-general of the MOTC's Bureau of
High Speed Rail, said that 58 deficiencies found in the first-stage
inspection are being addressed and that the improvements should be
completed by the end of November.</P>
      <P>The first inspection conducted Aug. 9 listed more than 130
deficiencies, 58 of which needed to be improved prior to the
inauguration. The second- and final-stage inspection meeting had been
scheduled for Wednesday, but had been postponed.</P>
      <P>He noted that in an earthquake simulation drill for the high
speed railway a day earlier, the trains were able to stop in five
kilometers, which he said is within a reasonable scale.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that if an earthquake takes place, the driver will be
alerted by an automatic message sent from a detection system. In a
serious earthquake, the automatic brake system will be activated, and
the passenger cars will be able to stop in between 3 and 4
kilometers.</P>
      <P>He also said that there will be 19 trains running in each
direction of the 345-km railway linking Taipei in the north and
Kaohsiung in the south in the initial stage, with the number
increased to 88 within a year.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) is
coordinating with farmer's groups in banana-producing regions to buy
bananas at NT$10 (US$0.3) per kilo to help prop up prices.</P>
      <P>Banana growers are in great distress after prices, which reached
a high of NT$60 early this year, dropped to between NT$5 and NT$6 per
kilo in mid-October due to oversupply.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang led his Cabinet members in a drive to eat
bananas in a Cabinet meeting last Wednesday, and the COA also
activated a project to encourage government agencies as well as local

rebounded to between NT$7 and NT$8 recently. To speed up the rebound,
they have asked farmer's groups to buy more bananas.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the COA will buy poor quality fruit at

compared to the north of Taiwan," said Government Information Office
(GIO) minister Cheng Wen-tsang.</P>
      <P>Winners of best documentary, film and animation categories will
be announced at the award ceremony Nov. 26 in Tainan's Chihkanlou,
built during the Dutch occupation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the festival has distinguished itself from its
northern counterpart, Huang said. Several independent films, such as
"Let it be" and "Jump! Boys," came out of the festival, achieving
relative box office success and local accolades.</P>
      <P>"It's encouraging for numerous local filmmakers, especially
young people who are passionate about making films. It was a driving
force that encourages them to keep on producing films," she said.</P>
      <P>This year is no different. The opening film, "The Road in the
Air," directed by Isaac Lee, and the closing film "Exit No.
6" directed by Lin Yu-hsien -- the same director who directed "Jump!
Boys" -- have been the festival's most talked-about independent films
of the year.</P>
      <P>Dozens of foreign films will be screened during the festival, as
well as a feature created by two promising young directors -- Cheng
Yu-chieh and Ho Wi-ding.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FILM FESTIVAL SHOWS 'NEVER SAY DIE' ATTITUDE OF TAIWANESE FILMMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The increasing number and broader themes of
films featured in the 2006 South Taiwan Film and Video Festival show
Taiwanese filmmakers have a "never say die" attitude, an encouraging
sign in Taiwan's film industry, a veteran Taiwanese director said
Monday.</P>
      <P>"The film entries this year are full of vibrance and diversity,
which tells me this is a promising film festival and that these young
men just refuse to say die to the awful environment in Taiwan's film
industry," said Lee You-ning, a former director who serves as a
festival juror.</P>
      <P>The themes of the 10 films nominated for the category of best
documentary range from Taiwanese history, environmental
issues to the story of an Internet writer.</P>
      <P>In addition, stories of sex workers, a college student facing
graduation and a child who lost her father are some of the
eight nominations for best film.</P>
      <P>"The film festival was established to provide independent
filmmakers with an additional outlet to present their work. Judging
from the festival's increasing popularity, I'm glad to say we did
just that," said the event's main organizer Huang Yu-shan, also a
director.</P>
      <P>The success of independent films in recent years has boosted
young filmmakers' confidence, something not seen among Taiwanese
directors before because of a long "down period" in Taiwan's film
industry, which has been suffering since the mid-1980's, Huang added.</P>
      <P>The South Taiwan Film and Video Festival, established in 2001, is
devoted to showcasing new independent films. The 2006 event will be
held from Nov. 3 - Dec. 9 in various central and southern cities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT ENCOURAGES DISABLED TO CHALLENGE THEIR DESTINY</HEADLINE>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lauded Monday a
group of swimmers with Down Syndrome who captured several awards in a
recent swimming championship, and encouraged physically and mentally
challenged people to challenge their destiny.</P>
      <P>Chen received the swimmers at the Presidential Office after they
garnered 13 gold medals, nine silver and six bronze in September at
the 3rd World Down Syndrome Swimming Championships in Limerick,
Ireland, and praised them for breaking the world swimming records
for Down Syndrome swimmers.</P>
      <P>Noting these swimmers have demonstrated "Taiwan spirit,"
Chen said he offered them his utmost respect and congratulations.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of team leader Fan Ching-chia, Chen said Fan's
fingers cannot be held close together, so he had to tie
together his fingers while practicing. But Fan won three gold medals,
three silver and one bronze in the competition, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen cited another example of Chen Yu-wei, whose palm is only
half the normal size, which poses quite a disadvantage in
swimming.</P>
      <P>However, Chen Yu-wei is now the the world record-holder for
the 25m backstroke and both the 50 and 100m free style for Down
Syndrome swimmers, President Chen said.</P>
      <P>While encouraging the physically and mentally disabled to
open their minds when facing a challenge, the president urged both
governmental agencies and the public to work toward an obstacle-free
environment for them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINATRUST PROBE BETRAYS KOO JR.'S AMBITION TO OVERACHIEVEBy S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> "If you eat too quickly, you'll break the bowl" is a Taiwanese
version of "Haste makes waste." And it seems an apt description of
what is happening in Chinatrust Financial Holding Vice Chairman
Jeffrey Koo Jr.'s attempt to merge government-controlled Mega
Financial Holding Co.</P>
      <P>Three of Chinatrust's senior executives have been detained in
connection with a prosecutorial investigation into allegations that
the company's acquisition of Mega Financial stocks through its Hong
Kong branch might have broken the law.</P>
      <P>Koo Jr. himself is now a defendant in the investigation initiated
by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) . Investigators are
waiting to question him when he returns from the United States Nov.
18.</P>
      <P>His eagerness to take over Mega Financial Holding may have been
prompted in part by his younger brother Angelo's success in winning
over China Development Financial Holding Corp., a prowess eulogized
by some journalists as proving Angelo's "leopard-like" sharpness,
agility and ruthlessness.</P>
      <P>If the gentlemanly-looking Koo Jr. could get Mega Financial, a
NT$260 billion company, he would outshine Angelo, whose China
Development Financial is capitalized at just over half of it --
NT$140 billion.</P>
      <P>But more pertinent to Koo Jr.'s "grand strategy" is that a
combined Chinatrust and Mega Financial Holding Company would be far
ahead of any competitor and its leading position would remain almost
unshakable.</P>
      <P>As can be imagined, Chinatrust's obvious ambition incurred
backlash from a wide range of "non-well wishers, " including Wu
Jung-yi and Chien Hung-wen, two board members who quit after
private-sector members surpassed the number of representatives of
government-owned stocks on the board of Mega Financial, thwarting
Koo's plan of merging Mega Financial.</P>
      <P>Koo was stripped of his post as chairman of China Trust
Commercial Bank after the FSC slapped a heavy fine on Chinatrust
Financial for its illegal purchase of Mega Financial stocks through
its Hong Kong branch, leaving him to keep his vice chairmanship at
Chinatrust Financial.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial Holding, through its Hong Kong branch,
bought "structured notes" to invest in Mega Financial. The
"structured notes" reduce the cost it would have to pay at market
prices. It can also profit from selling them. THe FSC views this as
"illegal trading."</P>
      <P>Koo's father, Jeffrey Koo, has kept a low profile over his eldest
son's suspected role in the incident, claiming that Chinatrust is an
honest business and his son will be vindicated.</P>
      <P>Investigation into Chinatrust Financial Holding's suspected
irregularities in the Mega Financial dealing has put brakes on
several ongoing merger plans, not only among Taiwan's financial
institutions but also foreign banks interested in buying Taiwan
banks.</P>
      <P>However, market observers said that over the long term, foreign
banks will likely revive their interest in "marrying" Taiwanese banks
that are seen to be advantageous in their China strategy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung, central  Taiwan, Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung Shan Medical
University Hospital is recruiting volunteers to test the efficacy of
a new herbal treatment for hyperuricemia, or high uric acid levels in
the blood.</P>
      <P>The pioneer project, developed with a subsidy from the
Cabinet-level Department of Health, is seeking adult volunteers with
uric acid levels of 8mg/dl or over.</P>
      <P>Hyperuricemia may cause gout if high levels of uric acid have
been present in the blood over a long period. Uric acid levels can
increase when kidneys are not functioning properly, but raised uric
acid levels over a long period can also damage the kidneys.</P>
      <P>According to the Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, patients
who join the pilot project will receive a one-month supply of the
"scientific traditional Chinese medicine," plus free tests on levels
of serum uric acid, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein,
high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride and blood sugar, as well as
liver and kidney functions.</P>
      <P>Interested volunteers may apply to the hospital before the end of
October by contacting Dr. James Cheng-Chung Wei of the Department of
Rheumatology and Immunology, or calling the hospital's Chinese

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is time to question the real facts
behind Taiwan's "retrocession, " said a pro-independence civic group
on the eve of Taiwan's 61st Retrocession Day, which falls on Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>"The real retrocession did not begin on Oct. 25, 1945, when
Japanese rule of Taiwan officially ended. In fact, the retrocession
never happened, " said Chet Yang, secretary-general of the Taiwan
Society.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was never given back to the people of Taiwan because the
Kuomintang (KMT) took over after Japan pulled and started yet another
period of "colonial rule," Yang claimed.</P>
      <P>True freedom was not restored in Taiwan until the late 1980's,
when the world's longest period of martial law was finally lifted and
people's right to assembly and demonstration was protected, Yang
added.</P>
      <P>"Even today, Taiwan is limited to only partial democratic reform
because of political stalemate and media chaos," he said.</P>
      <P>"What happened during the Double Ten National Day ceremony gave
us a legitimate reason to question the factuality of Taiwan's
retrocession," claimed Taiwan Society President Wu Shuh-min.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to an Oct. 10 incident in which several
opposition legislators protested during the celebration ceremony
while President Chen Shui-bian was making a speech.</P>
      <P>All the chaos of today has resulted from different national
identities among the people of Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"A concensus on national identity will not be reached before a
common cultural identity. It is why we hope to revive the Taiwan
people's awareness and recognition of Taiwanese culture, " Wu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign reiterated Monday that he will continue to use
peaceful and nonviolent means to pressure President Chen Shui-bian
to step down to answer for a series of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who launched the campaign Sept. 9, stressed
at a press conference that under his leadership the anti-graft
movement will not deviate from the principles of peace and
nonviolence, although former DPP legislator Lin Zheng-jie -- an
activist known for championing brinkmanship in street protests -- has
joined the campaign as one of its deputy commanders.</P>
      <P>Allaying fears that Lin's presence may signify the campaign has
changed tactics by switching to the use of violence, Shih
explained that Lin has joined the anti-graft leadership because
others at the campaign headquarters have succeeded in persuading him
to give up violence.</P>
      <P>Asked whether something unpleasant had occurred between him and
Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, with regard to difficulties experienced by campaign
followers in using Taipei roads, Shih acknowledged there had been
some quarrels between him and Ma, mainly because Ma has been playing
two conflicting roles.</P>
      <P>On why he would not allow Ma to pay him a visit while he was
recuperating in hospital and undergoing physical examinations, Shih
said he declined the visit mainly because of fears that Ma and his
high-profile entourage might disturb other patients in the hospital.</P>

notice from Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office. And on Oct. 16, the
Suzhou committee formally notified Taipei that it would not accept
Taiwanese delegates' attendance at the AHC Congress and subsequent
health seminar.</P>
      <P>Chen Mei-ju, a municipal health department division chief in
charge of health promotion, said it is very regrettable that Suzhou,
an ancient city filled with historical and cultural relics, has
brusquely blocked Taiwan's attendance at the AHC Congress, which will
address only non-political health topics.</P>
      <P>Chen said the municipal government will lodge a formal protest

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-GRAFT CAMPAIGN WILL CONTINUE TO USE NONVIOLENT MEANS: SHIH(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of the "Million Voices Against
Corruption" campaign reiterated Monday that he will continue to use
peaceful and nonviolent means to pressure President Chen Shui-bian
to step down to answer for a series of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) who launched the campaign Sept. 9, stressed
at a press conference that under his leadership the anti-graft
movement will not deviate from the principles of peace and
nonviolence, although former DPP legislator Lin Zheng-jie -- an
activist known for championing brinkmanship in street protests -- has
joined the campaign as one of its deputy commanders.</P>
      <P>Allaying fears that Lin's presence may signify the campaign has
changed tactics by switching to the use of violence, Shih
explained that Lin has joined the anti-graft leadership because
others at the campaign headquarters have succeeded in persuading him
to give up violence.</P>
      <P>Asked whether something unpleasant had occurred between him and
Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, with regard to difficulties experienced by campaign
followers in using Taipei roads, Shih acknowledged there had been
some quarrels between him and Ma, mainly because Ma has been playing
two conflicting roles.</P>
      <P>On why he would not allow Ma to pay him a visit while he was
recuperating in hospital and undergoing physical examinations, Shih
said he declined the visit mainly because of fears that Ma and his
high-profile entourage might disturb other patients in the hospital.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES KMT CHIEF TO 'HONOR WORD' ON MAJOR BILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang called on main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to "be a man of his
word" and not block major bills at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Su said Ma should not use the pretext of "KMT consultations with
the People First Party (PFP) " to keep the arms procurement bill and
other major bills from being put on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>Su made the call after the legislative caucuses of the KMT and
its "pan-blue alliance" ally PFP decided to put on hold the Executive
Yuan's arms procurement bill and the president's nominations for
prosecutor general and Control Yuan members.</P>
      <P>"For the sake of national security, Ma should honor his word and
help push the arms purchase bill through the procedure committee as
soon as possible," Su said.</P>
      <P>"If the opposition parties do not even allow the legislature to
debate the bill, as they have done for a few years, it will be their
dereliction of duty," Su added.</P>
      <P>If the nominations for prosecutor general and Control Yuan
members do not pass the legislature, there will be no one to monitor
government officials or to accept people's petitions, and no one to
act as a special prosecutor for investigating corruption scandals, Su
pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said it is strange for the KMT and the PFP to claim they are
against corruption while at the same time refusing even to discuss
the nominations for prosecutor general and Control Yuan members.</P>
      <P>On a government bill on political party assets, the premier said
when the KMT moved from China to Taiwan in 1949, it misappropriated a
lot of public and private assets and now is using its majority status
in the legislature to stop a law from being passed to govern the
assets.</P>
      <P>"Even Shih Ming-teh, who is leading an anti-corruption campaign,
is saying that a Legislative Yuan priority should be enacting a set
of anti-corruption laws including one on political party assets, " Su
said.</P>
      <P>If Ma meant business when he said he was against corruption, he
should lead the opposition lawmakers to pass the party assets law and
return all of the party's "ill-gotten" assets to the people, he
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that if
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou were to renounce Taiwan's
sovereignty in exchange for a peace treaty with China, even if he
were elected Taiwan's president, he would become a "chief executive."</P>
      <P>To this, Ma responded by claiming Taiwan is not a special
administrative area of China and asking how there could thus be a
chief executive. "Su was just showing his ignorance about
cross-Taiwan Strait affairs," he added.</P>
      <P>The exchange of words came afer Su was asked to comment on a
Liberty Times report that, during an interview with Bloomberg News,
Ma expressed an interest in trading Taiwan's "no independence" for
Beijing's "no use of arms" to ensure Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Ma reportedly told Bloomberg that if he becomes Taiwan's
president in 2008, he will seek to sign a peace treaty with Beijing
by 2012.</P>
      <P>Su told reporters at the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan is a
country whose government must not become a local government of China.</P>
      <P>"If China wants to talk peace with Taiwan, it must first renounce
the option of the use of force. We must not give up anything when a
gangster comes to our door with weapons in hand, seeking to talk with
us, " he added.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said China should commit itself to not using
violence. He also called on Beijing to abandon its "one China"
policy.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country. Whoever is
elected its president must not give up its sovereignty in order to
appease China," Su claimed.</P>
      <P>He called on the people of Taiwan "to watch out" before electing
someone as their president who might give up Taiwan's sovereignty and
become "someone like Hong Kong's chief executive."</P>
      <P>Ma said Su's comment is an indication that he is far from being
an expert on cross-strait affairs and that he is capable only of
attacking a political rival with groundless charges.</P>
      <P>A chief executive is a post designed for a special administrative
area (SAA), and it is very clear that Taiwan is not an SAA of China,
so the premier, being a member of the ruling team, "had better do his
homework," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the KMT has never listed Taiwan independence as
one of its policy options, though the people are free to make their
own choices as Taiwan is a free and democratic country.</P>
      <P>"What's wrong with the KMT not listing independence as a policy
option?" Ma asked.</P>
      <P>What his party is seeking, in terms of Taiwan's relations with
China, is Beijing's withdrawal of its missiles aimed at Taiwan and
the signing of a peace treaty between China and Taiwan in order to
ensure improved cross-strait ties that would bring peace and
prosperity to the people on both sides of the strait, Ma said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Tuesday dismissed reports that five African diplomatic allies of
Taiwan are planning to send foreign ministers to Beijing for a
conference.</P>
      <P>Ministry spokesman Wang Chien-yeh was responding to reports by
the United Daily News, a local newspaper, which quoted Chinese
officials as saying that the five nations -- Malawi, Burkina Faso,
Sao Tome and Principe, Gambia and Swaziland -- have expressed their
intention to send foreign ministers or their deputies to attend the
Beijing summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation and the 3rd
Ministerial Conference slated for Nov. 3-5.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that although the newspaper quoted Chinese officials,
the information received by Taiwan's government has contained nothing
to the effect that any of its allies in Africa plan to attend the
forum. </P>
      <P>He said that China indeed is trying every means to undermine
Taiwan's relations with its diplomatic allies, adding that the
ministry will closely watch Beijing's moves.</P>
      <P>The ministry also alerted Taiwan's embassies in the five
African countries and reminded the diplomatic allies that it would
not be appropriate to send representatives to attend the conference
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said that Taiwan will actively take part in the

    <HEADLINE>CAA URGED TO FOOT AVIATION PARK'S NIGHT-OUTDOOR-LIGHTING BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan, Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
should foot the night-outdoor-lighting bill for an "air passenger
park" near the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport (TTIA) , a
spokesman for the Tayuan village administrative office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the 300-plus street lights in the
197-hectare "air passenger park" in Taouan County's Taoyuan Village
have been kept lit through the night as a form of advertising to
attract investors to set up shop in the vast complex, "burning" NT$4
million a year in electricity bills.</P>
      <P>The "air passenger park" is part of the government's ambitious
plan to develop an "airport city" near the TTIA, Taiwan's main
gateway, to enhance Taiwan's competitiveness in the world aviation
market. The "airport city" comprises an air passenger park, an air
cargo park and a free trade port zone.</P>
      <P>The CAA and other relevant government agencies have been working
hard to lure business groups to invest in the "air passenger park."
As Taoyuan County already has several industrial parks, their cluster
effects have made the new "air passenger park" less attractive to
investors.</P>
      <P>At a time of high gas prices, Tayuan Village Chief Chang
Chien-lung said, it's too wasteful to have a large number of street
lights lit through night in an almost untapped zone.</P>
      <P>Chang suggested that the number of street lights to be kept lit
at night be slashed. Moreover, he demanded that the CAA pay for the
park's outdoor-lighting bill, or at least foot 70 percent of the
electricity bill plus providing a maintenance subsidy. He also
requested that the Taoyuan county government pay for 30 percent of
the park's outdoor-lighting bill.</P>
      <P>Officials at the park's administration center claimed that
turning on the park's street lights at night is not done for
advertising, but rather for public safety.</P>
      <P>In response to Chang's suggestions, the officials said the CAA
and the Taoyuan County government will come up with measures to
address the issue.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang and Justice Minister
Shih Mao-lin denied Tuesday that a crucial report on the
investigation into the president's alleged misuse of a special "state
affairs fund" has been completed.</P>
      <P>Su and Shih categorically denied that they know anything about
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lin Yi-shih's claim that the report has
been completed and absolves President Chen Shui-bian of any
wrongdoing in connection with allegations that fake receipts and
invoices had been used to claim "state affairs" expenses.</P>
      <P>In reply to Lin's question at the legislature, Su said the
president has never told him or the justice minister how to proceed
with the prosecution investigation into the "state affairs fund"
case.</P>
      <P>Lin said he suspects that Su must have learned of the
investigation report, otherwise he would not have stated earlier in
the day that if the president or his wife, Wu Shu-jen, are found to
have been involved in any wrongdoing in the case, the president
should resign -- a statement emphasized a day earlier by National
Security Council Secretary General Chiou I-jen.</P>
      <P>"Even if the president had told me how to carry out the
investigation, I would not have, on principle, followed his order, "
Su claimed.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said that all
he knows about the case is that it is still under investigation. As
to its progress, he said he has no idea of the details.</P>
      <P>It's simply not true that the prosecution's investigative report
on this case has been completed, he said.</P>
      <P>"A prosecutor will not send a report on an individual case to me
(for a preview) . I don't want to see it. It's impossible for me to
ask to see it," Shih said.</P>
      <P>In response to a question by legislators about whether the
president has ordered him to "track the progress of the prosecution
probe, " Shih said he can guarantee the president has never issued
such an order.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the Presidential Office's department of
public affairs, said the Presidential Office "does not know more
about the progress of the investigation than the public does."</P>
      <P>Lee called on the people to respect the judicial system which
operates on the principle of "not disclosing the contents of an
investigation."</P>
      <P>The president will not interfere in judicial investigations, and
the media should not speculate on the investigation in order to allow
judicial officials to do their jobs independently and without any

    <TEXT>
      <P>Varel Freeman, the first vice president of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), presided
over the opening ceremony of the bank's Taiwan office in Taipei
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Freeman, ROC Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Yang Tze-pao and
Central Bank of China Deputy Governor Liang Fa-chin cut the ribbon to
announce the office's opening -- EBRD's first foothold in Asia.</P>
      <P>Heading a group of senior EBRD officials, including Julia
Zilberman and Marek Kiezun, Freeman said after the inauguration
ceremony that the office aims to assist Taiwanese enterprises and
banks in developing markets in Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and
other member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS).</P>
      <P>EBRD, founded in 1991, is the largest single investor in the
region, and promotes co-financing and foreign direct investment as
well as provides technical assistance.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a EBRD member, it has participated in
several of its cooperation projects since its founding, and has
offered donations to the bank worth US$21 million, which prompted
EBRD to set up a Taiwan office to help Taiwanese firms develop other
markets, Freeman said.</P>
      <P>Freeman added that through EBRD's assistance, Taiwanese
businesses can enter markets in Central and East Europe, Russia and
Mongolia, where business opportunities are abundant in financial,
scientific and infrastructure industries.</P>
      <P>Serving as a platform and liaison office, EBRD can also help
Taiwanese enterprises, including financial institutions, seek proper
partners in the region and reduce their investment risk there,
Freeman went on.</P>
      <P>Han Chien-hao, the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs'
representative in EBRD, noted that the new Taipei office hopes to
employ Taiwan's successful experience in developing small- and
medium-size enterprises to serve as reference for those countries
that receive EBRD's assistance.</P>
      <P>In addition, the office is expected to help Taiwanese firms
diversify their investments and reduce their heavy dependence on the
Chinese market, Han added.</P>
      <P>Many representatives of Taiwanese financial institutions
participated in the inauguration ceremony and seminar, which were
organized by the new office in hopes of better understanding how they
can obtain EBRD's assistance while developing markets in Central and
Eastern Europe, as well as Central Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT YET TO PREPARE TO ACCEPT AIDS PATIENTS: CIVIC GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government and health organizations
have yet to prepare for accepting AIDS patients, an official of a
civic group said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Shui-mei, executive director of the Garden of Mercy
Foundation, made the remarks during a public hearing at the
Legislative Yuan on sheltering AIDS patients, which was sponsored by
Legislators Wang Jung-chang and Huang Shu-ing of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chiu noted that AIDS patients have been stigmatized, resulting in
their receiving differential treatment.</P>
      <P>Her remarks came in the wake of a controversial court ruling
demanding that a halfway home for AIDS patients relocate away from
its current site in an apartment complex within three months.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang noted that AIDS patients need medical care,
social services, schooling and vocational counseling. However, he 
continued, the lack of public understanding of the disease has often
led to rejection of AIDS patients.</P>
      <P>He said that as of September this year, a cumulative total of
12,474 HIV positive cases had been reported in Taiwan, with 1,515 of
the AIDS patients having died from full-brown AIDS and 43 of the
patients having left Taiwan. Among the surviving 10,916 HIV carriers
in Taiwan, 27 were under the age of 18, and 175 were over the age of
65.</P>
      <P>Chiu also said that AIDS patients have different needs at
different stages of their disease, but they usually can't get enough
support from society. When civic groups solicit support for AIDS
patients, she continued, they often encounter difficulties because
they want to protect the privacy and identity of the patients.</P>
      <P>Hsien Chu-ing, secretary-general of Lourdes Association, a
Catholic charity organization, said that the association requires an
annual budget of NT$10 million (US$304,880) to provide assistance to
AIDS patients, but the government can only provide between 15 percent
and 25 percent of that amount.</P>
      <P>Chen Tsai-chin, vice minister of the Department of Health, said
the law states clearly that the public cannot discriminate against
HIV carriers and AIDS patients and that they have the same schooling
and employment rights as all other Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>The DOH will put more effort into its campaign on educating the
public about HIV/AIDS, Chen added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should be on alert against
Chinese oysters of inferior quality in order to protect public
health and the rights of local oyster farmers, legislators of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged at a news
conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Chung-mo claimed that quite a number of
Chinese oysters contain antiseptics that "keep them from going
rotten for three months," and their price is only one-third
that of local oysters.</P>
      <P>Chinese oysters, whether dumped or smuggled into Taiwan,
will affect public health and undermine local farmers' rights, Lin
added.</P>
      <P>As around 70 oyster farmers from the village of Wangkung in
central Changhua county staged a protest against sham Chinese oysters
in front of the Legislative Yuan in the afternoon, Lin said his heart
was heavy.</P>
      <P>Lin called for the Department of Health, Environmental Protection
Administration, Council of Agriculture's Fishery Administration as well
as the Coast Guard Administration to launch a publicity drive
against sham Chinese oysters and to step up the crackdown on their
influx.</P>
      <P>To promote local production, Lin and his colleague Ho
Shui-sheng also ate raw oysters at the news conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTY ASSETS BILL CLEARS LEGISLATURE'S PROCEDURE COMMITTEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's and ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's proposals on handling the opposition Kuomintang's
(KMT) "ill-gotten" assets passed the legislature's procedure
committee Tuesday, somewhat unexpectedly.</P>
      <P>The two versions of the political party assets bill will be
discussed on the legislative floor Oct. 27, when the speaker is
expected to assign it to a legislative committee or a joint committee
for review.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the bill's chances of becoming law are not high
since the KMT's "pan-blue alliance" ally, the People First Party
(PFP), which stood on the DPP's side on the bill Tuesday, may change
its attitude toward the highly charged political issue implied in the
DPP bill.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung proposed a delay in putting the
bill on the legislative agenda, a proposal that won only 15 votes
from KMT lawmakers, less than half of the number needed, because the
DPP and PFP objected to it.</P>
      <P>"It wasn't an easy decision for the PFP, " said Huang Yi-chiao, a
PFP lawmaker. "We were responding to popular calls over the past six
weeks by supporters of the 'Million Voices Against Corruption'
campaign," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang said he hopes the issue will be rationally debated in the
legislative committee so that radical provisions in the bill will be
changed and the affected party won't feel it is being "purged" a la
"Chinese People's Proletariat Cultural Revolution."</P>
      <P>The DPP aims to force the KMT to return all of its "ill-gotten"
assets to national coffers in an attempt to show it is fighting for
social justice.</P>
      <P>The KMT has its own proposal to handle the issue -- under its
proposed "political party law" that is part of a package of "sunshine
laws" aimed at increasing transparency in Taiwan politics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the procedure committee blocked all other major bills
and proposals of the government, including a military weapons
procurement bill and a special request to add new money to the
government's fiscal 2006 budget.</P>
      <P>Because of opposition from the KMT and PFP, the committee also
refused to let the legislature exercise its right to approve
President Chen Shui-bian's nominations for prosecutor general and
Control Yuan members.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung station of the Taiwan High
Speed Rail (THSR) line was inaugurated Tuesday, becoming the first of
the system's eight stations to open for service.</P>
      <P>THSR Co. Chairwoman Nita Ing presided over the inauguration
ceremony, which was attended by administrative leaders of Taichung
City and County, Changhua County and Nantou County, as well as local
representatives and several lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Construction work on the Taichung station, located in Wujih
Township, began July 27, 2002 and was not completed until Oct. 2,
2005. During that period, more than 10,000 workers were hired to
build the shuttle-shaped station on land covering more than 117,000
square meters.</P>
      <P>The station's "shuttle" shape signifies a train moving forward at
high speed and making fast connections, while also referring to the
central role the station plays in connecting all stations in the
north and south.</P>
      <P>It takes a mere 45 minutes to reach the southern city of
Kaohsiung from the station, and 46 minutes to get to the northern
city of Taipei, saving half the time spent on traveling by bus or
regular train to the two metropolises from Taichung, according to
THSR.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said he expects
the high-speed rail will change the Taiwanese lifestyle, allowing
travel to any corner of the island in one day.</P>
      <P>As a result, Hu suggested a relocation of the central government
from Taipei to Taichung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECOND-HAND SMOKE EXPOSURE INCREASES RISK OF CERVICAL CANCER: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Exposure to second-hand smoke can increase
women's risk of getting cervical cancer, according to the results of
study released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The study was funded by the National Health Research Institutes
and conducted by China Medical University's Department of Public
Health and Institutes of Environmental Health. It was based on a
pathological analysis of 260 women in the Kaohsiung region who had
pre-cancerous lesions or cervical cancer, as well as 507 women whose
pap smear results were normal between 2002 and 2005.</P>
      <P>After controlling the human papillomavirus infection and other
risk factors, the study found that women smokers suffer from moderate
or severe cervical dysplasia 3.5 times more often than non-smokers.</P>
      <P>If women above 20 years of age are exposed to second-hand smoke
tantamount to one pack of cigarettes a day for more than 10 years,
their risk of suffering from minimal, moderate or severe cervical
dysplasia is 3.5 times that of women who are not, with the risk
increasing to 6.1 times if they are exposed to smoke equal to more
than one pack of cigarettes, the study showed.</P>
      <P>If the second-hand exposure lasts for more than 20 years, the
risk of women suffering from minimal, moderate or severe cervical
dysplasia will rise to 7.2 times that of women who are not, the study
indicated.</P>
      <P>While overseas and domestic studies has proven that besides the
human papillomavirus infection, smoking is another major cause of
cervical cancer among women, exposure to second-hand smoke is the
greatest risk facing women in Taiwan in light of the fact that only
three to four percent of Taiwan women are smokers, researchers said.

      <P>The export value of Taiwan's oncidium -- a
strain of orchid -- exceeded US$7 million last year, with agriculture
officials predicting booming exports in the years to come, a Council
of Agriculture (COA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the COA's Agriculture and

with the United States and Japan its primary markets.</P>
      <P>The official said Taiwan's climate is highly suitable for

      <P>Thanks to research and development efforts by both farmers and

    <HEADLINE>TAITRA TO OFFER BANANAS TO FOREIGN BUYERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) will help distressed banana farmers
tide over difficulties by presenting the fruit to foreign buyers
attending shows in Taipei, TAITRA officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The council's move came in the wake of a glut of local bananas
that has sent prices below growing costs of around NT$8 (US$0.24) per
kilo. Banana prices have only recently seen a rebound after
"strenuous promotion efforts" -- Premier Su Tseng-chang led his
Cabinet members in eating bananas in a Cabinet meeting last week,
while the COA also solicited government agencies and businesses to
buy more bananas.</P>
      <P>The officials said that international buyers at the Taipei
International Gift and Stationery Autumn Show, which kicked off
Tuesday, received one-kilo bags of bananas as presents. They
estimated that 1,650 bags will have been distributed by the end of
the show Thursday.</P>
      <P>International buyers at the Taiwan International Motorcycle
Industry Show, to be held Oct. 27-29, will also receive the same
gift.</P>
      <P>In addition, all 200 guests taking part in the opening ceremony
of the Taiwan office of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in Taipei Tuesday, also received two kilos of bananas
each from TAITRA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Secretary-General Yeh Ming-shui described bananas
as very distinctive Taiwan fruit, claiming that they are popular,
high-priced fruit in Japan and Western countries.</P>
      <P>With ideal growing conditions this year, the council knew in
March that it would be a bumper year for bananas and stepped up
marketing of the fruit by inviting large Japanese buyers to come to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TAITRA will also organize a delegation that will travel to the
Philippines next month to learn more about the operations of Dole,
the largest banana brand in the world.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation will include officials of farmer's
associations in such banana-producing regions as Tainan, Nantou and
Pingtung counties, as well as fruit exporters, he said.</P>
      <P>The delegation hopes to learn more about Dole's production,
packaging and marketing strategies, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan used to be called the "banana kingdom, " with
Taiwan bananas accounting for up to 80 percent of the Japanese market
three decades ago, he lamented that they have been replaced by
cheaper bananas from other countries in recent years.</P>
      <P>The council will pattern the promotion of bananas on its strategy
for promoting mangoes over the past few years in the hope that Taiwan
bananas will once again shine in the international market, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has one of the best performances
among Asian countries in terms of press freedom according to the
Worldwide Press Freedom Index 2006 released Tuesday by the
France-based Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ranking advanced to 43rd this year from 51st last year,
performing better than Japan, which got 51st place and the United
States, which got 53rd, said Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the results indicate that Taiwan has established a
strong environment for press and speech freedom, which he said should
be a source of pride for the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan ranks 35th and ties with Japan in
another press freedom rating released by the U.S.-based Freedom House

month by Freedom House also rated Taiwan a free country providing the
highest degree of freedom in terms of both political rights and civil
liberties.</P>
      <P>These results prove that Taiwan's achievements in democracy and
freedom have won the recognition of mainstream human rights
organizations in Europe and the United States, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>In contrast, China's ranking dropped from 159th last year to

      <P>The Shihmen reservoir, which supplies
drinking water to some 3 million people in northern Taiwan, is facing
the threat of pollution from landfill waste, a former reservoir
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chuan-chen, who retired recently from the Shihmen Reservoir
Administration, warned at a press conference that toxic landfill
waste dumped by subcontractors of a construction project in the
reservoir's catchment area could harm the health of residents in the
counties of Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu who rely on the reservoir for
their drinking water.</P>
      <P>Chen, accompanied by three legislators of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, said he
has spotted toxic waste and trash dumped by subcontractors working on
the Nantsaikou creek bank reinforcement project.</P>
      <P>He said the landfill waste appears to be cinders from
incinerators that might contain dioxin, heavy metals and other toxic
chemical waste, and that if these harmful substances are washed into
the reservoir they will pollute the drinking water source and
endanger the health of the 3 million people who get their water from
it.</P>
      <P>A subsequent investigation by the Water Resources Agency under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs found that subcontractors had dumped
200 cubic meters of toxic landfill waste illegally.</P>
      <P>Officials at the agency's Northern Region Water Resources Office
said they will work with public prosecutors to punish those
responsible. They added that a NT$273,000 fine will be imposed on the
construction company responsible for supervising the project.</P>
      <P>The officials have ordered that the site of the landfill be
covered temporarily with tarpaulin to prevent rain from washing the
toxic substances into the reservoir before the waste is removed
completely.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Bureau under the Taoyuan county
government will also release a report Oct. 27 on its investigation
into the incident.</P>

new low point according to an annual survey conducted recently by
Edelman and blogging familiarity and usage is very high, foreign
businesses are encouraged to communicate through various channels.</P>
      <P>The "Regional Stakeholder Study 2006" survey was based on
interviews with 1,050 consumers, employees, investors, media members,
government officials, NGOs and business executives -- the seven
stakeholder groups -- in Taiwan, Japan, China, South Korea, India and
Singapore, among other countries. It polled 70 people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing the survey results, VanderMolen also noted the
difficulties for businesses in hiring qualified employees in Taiwan,
as 19 percent of the survey respondents in Taiwan listed employee
development and benefits as the first thing they noticed that makes
companies stand out.</P>
      <P>"At the end of the day, products and services remain king, " he
said.</P>
      <P>But businesses also should hand "power to the people, " get
employees engaged, apply multi-channel communication and pay
attention to corporate social responsibility to operate smoothly in
the Asia-Pacific region.</P>

announced Tuesday that it would cut gasoline prices by NT$0.7 per
liter and diesel prices by NT$0.8 per liter from midnight.</P>
      <P>With the adjustment, the price of 92 octane unleaded will drop to

while that of regular will be NT$21.8 per liter. The fuel oil price

      <P>The cuts are aimed at reflecting declining world crude oil

      <P>The system operates with crude oil price changes on the benchmark

Posts Loss of $5.8 Billion, Worst Since '92
The Ford Motor Company reported its worst
financial results in more than 14 years Monday
and warned that its business was likely to worsen
further in the months ahead, as it and other
Detroit auto companies struggle to reinvent
themselves.
Indeed, the new chief executive at Ford, Alan
R. Mulally, a former Boeing executive, said the
automaker would require a full transformation in
the way it thought about consumers and approached
the American market.

Wall Street Journal:To Stop Dust Bowl, Mongolia
Builds 'Great Wall' of Trees
The great Gobi Desert has camels with two humps,
a rare breed of desert bear, and some of Asia's
last remaining nomads. One thing it doesn't have is
shade.
Batchuluun Doorov is trying to change that. Each
morning, he travels by motorcycle to a remote
desert outpost, rouses his assistants, and begins
watering thousands of scraggly trees rising up from
the sand. Workers planted the trees months ago, and
now they form a thin green line across the horizon
in one of the most barren places on earth.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The often rowdy Legislative Yuan was
plunged into yet another low spot once again Tuesday when a
grandstanding independent lawmaker who prefers to refer to himself as
a "gadfly" sprayed teargas in the legislature to disrupt a meeting of
the legislature's Procedure Committee.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ao, wearing a gas mask and brandishing a stun
baton -- another illegal weapon -- sprayed the teargas from the
podium of a Legislative Yuan conference room where members of the
Procedure Committee were discussing which bills should be put on the
agenda for deliberation at Friday's plenary session.</P>
      <P>Lee, whose grating style is sometimes described as acerbic, is
not a Procedure Committee member, but he nevertheless attended, to
the surprise of many of his colleagues. With the consent of the
meeting's chair, Legislator Tsai Chi-fang of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), Lee secured a chance to speak.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers present at the session were expecting Lee to speak
for their cause of putting an "ill-gotten party assets disposal" bill
onto Friday's agenda. The bill is aimed at forcing the main
opposition Kuomintang to return the huge amount of assets it amassed
illicitly or inappropriately during its 55-year rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Much to their disappointment and surprise, however, Lee said he
had come to prevent the inclusion of a controversial arms procurement
bill on the agenda. The bill has been stalled for two years because
of opposition from the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance, " which holds a
slim majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Claiming that members of the legislature's Defense Committee, of
which Lee is a member, have not been given a chance to express their
opinion on the multi-billion-dollar arms procurement bill, Lee said he
strongly objected to placing the bill on Friday's agenda.</P>
      <P>"I'm getting old, but I will block this bill for all I'm worth, "
Lee grumbled before launching his bizarre teargas assault on his
colleagues.</P>
      <P>His action caught his colleagues off guard, many of whom fled the
hall in fits of coughing, and forced the meeting's chairman to
announce a suspension of the meeting. After realizing his goal of
dispersing his colleagues, Lee himself fled the hall.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Kuo-ching lambasted Lee as "coercing others in
"broad daylight" while some other DPP lawmakers demanded that Tsai
have Lee arrested as a criminal caught red-handed. Opposition KMT
Legislator Joanna Lei asked Tsai to maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>Neither Tsai nor police officers posted in the legislature took
any action to stop Lee's disgusting act.</P>
      <P>After a 20-minute hiatus, the meeting resumed and Lei took to the
podium, blasting Lee's "mad behavior" and protesting Tsai's failure
to take any action to stop him. She demanded that Lee be referred to
the disciplinary committee for punishment.</P>
      <P>Tsai apologized for the chaos. Acting on Lei's proposal, the
Procedure Committee unanimously agreed to have Friday's plenary
session discuss whether to refer the case to the Discipline Committee
to punish Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ACCUSES KMT LEADER OF NOT KEEPING HIS WORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang blasted opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Tuesday, claiming that he did
not keep his word to help put an arms purchase plan on the
legislature's agenda for screening.</P>
      <P>Su made the accusation after an arms procurement budget was
rejected again earlier that day by legislators of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" for the 57th time from the Legislative Yuan's
agenda for screening.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Ma promised the previous week that KMT
legislators would help put the arms purchase budget plan on the
legislative agenda if the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
withdrew its original special arms procurement plan in the
legislature and replaced it with an annual arms procurement budget
plan.</P>
      <P>Now that the Executive Yuan has done this in accordance with the
petition of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party (PFP), Su said he sees no reason why the "pan-blue
alliance" still blocked it.</P>
      <P>It was reported that PFP legislators changed their attitude after
PFP Chairman James Soong said Sunday that members of a so-called
anti-graft campaign with President Chen Shui-bian as its target have
proposed that "pan-blue" lawmakers postpone placing three major
proposals, including the arms procurement budget plan, on the agenda
until prosecutors close the probe into the alleged misuse of the
Presidential Office's state affairs budget.</P>
      <P>However, Su doubted why the budget plan still was not put on the
agenda since only PFP legislators opposed it, and claimed that Ma had
"broken his promise again and again." Su said Ma should step down to
assume responsibility for what he described as the deadlock in the
country's security.</P>
      <P>Noting that legislative party whips of both ruling and opposition
parties had reached consensus on the arms procurement budget plan
last week, Defense Minister Lee Jye expressed regret over the budget
plan's rejection in the legislature, where the "pan-blue" legislators
hold a slight majority.</P>
      <P>While expressing regret at "politicians breaking mutual trust, "
Lee urged support from the public for the MND's plan to buy the
three big-ticket weaponary systems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has seen 434 confirmed indigenous
dengue fever cases since the beginning of summer, according to
statistics released Tuesday by the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the figure shows that there were 277 reported
cases in Kaohsiung City, 144 cases in Kaohsiung County, nine cases in
Pingtung County, two cases in Tainan County, and one each in Taipei
County and Keelung City.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Chou Chih-hao said the increase in the
incidence of dengue fever infections was slowing down, with 40
confirmed cases last week.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that three of Kaohsiung City's districts --
Chiencheng, Sanmin and Nantzu -- are still "hot zones" and that more
efforts are needed by the residents to clean up their environments
and get rid of the mosquitoes that carry the disease.</P>
      <P>He said it has been certified that the two people in Taipei
County and Keelung City who contracted the disease were infected
during visits to southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chou expressed confidence that the incidence of the disease will
be brought under control as the climate cools in November.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is a flu-like viral disease spread by the bite of
infected mosquitoes that breed in abandoned tires, flower pots and
water storage containers close to human dwellings.</P>
      <P>The disease usually starts suddenly with a high fever, rash,
severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and muscle and joint pain,
accompanied by nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. It may take a
month for a patient to recover from the disease.</P>

      <P>Kung Hui-chun, a 20-year-old hospitality
student who recently won the championship in a world cocktail-making
race, paid a visit Tuesday to Frank Hsieh, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's candidate for the year-end Taipei mayoral
election, to thank him for his support of the bartender's association
in Kaohsiung during his tenure as mayor of the southern port city.</P>
      <P>During her meeting with Hsieh at the latter's office in Taipei,
Kung proudly demonstrated how to make the cocktail "Cool Sweetheart"
which won her the title of the 2006 World Cocktail Competition in
Greece Oct. 7.</P>
      <P>At the end of her demonstration, Kung gave Hsieh an unexpected
kiss to express her gratitude for Hsieh's support for the Kaohsiung
Bartenders Association and wish him a success in the year-end race
for Taipei mayorship.</P>
      <P>Kung is the first Asian to win the competition, organized
annually by the International Bartenders Association (IBA) . To
celebrate her success, Taiwan's hospitality industry has renamed her
award-winning cocktail from "Cool Sweetheart" to "Taiwan Sweetheart."</P>

competition earlier this year and took fourth spot in the
IBA-sponsored 2006 World Flairtending Competition, during her visit
to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, Hsieh began to allow the Kaohsiung Bartenders
Association members to practice their cocktail-making skills in the
city government properties in 1999 and has never hesitated to give
exhortation to young association members during the past years.</P>
      <P>Kuo said many school dropouts and those from poor single-parent
families in southern Taiwan have learned bartending skills at classes
offered by the association. Over the past four years, Taiwanese
contestants have consecutively won the championship in the Asian

      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Kuo-ching lambasted Lee as "coercing others in

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ACCUSES KMT LEADER OF NOT KEEPING HIS WORD(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang blasted opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Tuesday, claiming that he did
not keep his word to help put an arms purchase plan on the
legislature's agenda for screening.</P>
      <P>Su made the accusation after an arms procurement budget was
rejected again earlier that day by legislators of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" for the 57th time from the Legislative Yuan's
agenda for screening.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Ma promised the previous week that KMT
legislators would help put the arms purchase budget plan on the
legislative agenda if the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
withdrew its original special arms procurement plan in the
legislature and replaced it with an annual arms procurement budget
plan.</P>
      <P>Now that the Executive Yuan has done this in accordance with the
petition of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party (PFP), Su said he sees no reason why the "pan-blue
alliance" still blocked it.</P>
      <P>It was reported that PFP legislators changed their attitude after
PFP Chairman James Soong said Sunday that members of a so-called
anti-graft campaign with President Chen Shui-bian as its target have
proposed that "pan-blue" lawmakers postpone placing three major
proposals, including the arms procurement budget plan, on the agenda
until prosecutors close the probe into the alleged misuse of the
Presidential Office's state affairs budget.</P>
      <P>However, Su doubted why the budget plan still was not put on the
agenda since only PFP legislators opposed it, and claimed that Ma had
"broken his promise again and again." Su said Ma should step down to
assume responsibility for what he described as the deadlock in the
country's security.</P>
      <P>Noting that legislative party whips of both ruling and opposition
parties had reached consensus on the arms procurement budget plan
last week, Defense Minister Lee Jye expressed regret over the budget
plan's rejection in the legislature, where the "pan-blue" legislators
hold a slight majority.</P>
      <P>While expressing regret at "politicians breaking mutual trust, "
Lee urged support from the public for the MND's plan to buy the
three big-ticket weaponary systems.</P>

      <P>Taiwan media's credibility is in jeopardy,
dropping to a "trust rating" of only 1 percent among major business
stakeholder groups, according to the results of an annual survey on
Asia Pacific business stakeholders released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Alan VanderMolen, president of consulting and public relations
firm Edelman Asia-Pacific, claimed of the finding in the Regional
Stakeholder Study 2006 that "Taiwan media is in trouble."</P>
      <P>The survey was based on interviews with 1,050 consumers,
employees, investors, media members, government officials,
non-government organization (NGO) workers and business executives --
the seven stakeholder groups -- in various countries including
Taiwan, Japan, China, South Korea, India and Singapore. It polled 70
people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese respondents gave the media only 1 percent in trust
rating with regard to credibility. Government, NGOs and businesses --
the other institutions rated -- all received trust ratings of 11
percent.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the trust rating of local mainstream
media in Taiwan is lower than foreign mainstream media, Web-based
media, and even bloggers, VanderMolen said.</P>
      <P>Only 3 percent of the respondents in Taiwan believe what the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has seen 434 confirmed indigenous
dengue fever cases since the beginning of summer, according to
statistics released Tuesday by the Center for Disease Control (CDC)
under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the figure shows that there were 277 reported
cases in Kaohsiung City, 144 cases in Kaohsiung County, nine cases in
Pingtung County, two cases in Tainan County, and one each in Taipei
County and Keelung City.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Chou Chih-hao said the increase in the
incidence of dengue fever infections was slowing down, with 40
confirmed cases last week.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that three of Kaohsiung City's districts --
Chiencheng, Sanmin and Nantzu -- are still "hot zones" and that more
efforts are needed by the residents to clean up their environments
and get rid of the mosquitoes that carry the disease.</P>
      <P>He said it has been certified that the two people in Taipei
County and Keelung City who contracted the disease were infected
during visits to southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chou expressed confidence that the incidence of the disease will
be brought under control as the climate cools in November.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is a flu-like viral disease spread by the bite of
infected mosquitoes that breed in abandoned tires, flower pots and
water storage containers close to human dwellings.</P>
      <P>The disease usually starts suddenly with a high fever, rash,
severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and muscle and joint pain,
accompanied by nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. It may take a
month for a patient to recover from the disease.</P>

      <P>Kung Hui-chun, a 20-year-old hospitality
student who recently won the championship in a world cocktail-making
race, paid a visit Tuesday to Frank Hsieh, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's candidate for the year-end Taipei mayoral
election, to thank him for his support of the bartender's association
in Kaohsiung during his tenure as mayor of the southern port city.</P>
      <P>During her meeting with Hsieh at the latter's office in Taipei,
Kung proudly demonstrated how to make the cocktail "Cool Sweetheart"
which won her the title of the 2006 World Cocktail Competition in
Greece Oct. 7.</P>
      <P>At the end of her demonstration, Kung gave Hsieh an unexpected
kiss to express her gratitude for Hsieh's support for the Kaohsiung
Bartenders Association and wish him a success in the year-end race
for Taipei mayorship.</P>
      <P>Kung is the first Asian to win the competition, organized
annually by the International Bartenders Association (IBA) . To
celebrate her success, Taiwan's hospitality industry has renamed her
award-winning cocktail from "Cool Sweetheart" to "Taiwan Sweetheart."</P>

      <P>According to Kuo, Hsieh began to allow the Kaohsiung Bartenders
Association members to practice their cocktail-making skills in the
city government properties in 1999 and has never hesitated to give
exhortation to young association members during the past years.</P>
      <P>Kuo said many school dropouts and those from poor single-parent
families in southern Taiwan have learned bartending skills at classes
offered by the association. Over the past four years, Taiwanese
contestants have consecutively won the championship in the Asian

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RESEARCHERS DISCOVER SUBSURFACE BIOME IN INORGANIC ENVIRONMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(by Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan-led reaserch team has discovered a
self-sustaining community of bacteria 2.825 km below the surface of
the Earth in South Africa, proving that life forms can exist in
inorganic environments, academic sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The research team, led by two assistant professors at National
Taiwan University and composed of several other research fellows of
various nationalities, has published its findings in the latest issue
of the prestigious U.S.-based Nature magazine.</P>
      <P>According to the team's research results, the biome, found in a
gold mine outside Johannesburg, has possibly been there for 3 million
to 25 million years, supporting itself by consuming sulfate and
hydrogen, which does not come from photosynthetic process but from
fracture water radiated by uranium.</P>
      <P>A species from the division of firmicutes, the largest group in
the bacteria community, was found to be able to digest minerals and
produce chemical waste, which the other kinds of bacteria depend on
to live. Researchers said that the firmicutes take the place of
photosynthetic organisms and sustain life underground.</P>
      <P>The importance of this finding is that it is the first time
scientists have proved that life can exist without photosynthesis and
be sustained purely on minerals. The results also spell hope that
there might be some life forms in the depths of Mars or the moons of
other planets.</P>
      <P>The project, which has been underway for four years, is a
collaboration among Lin Li-hung at NTU's Department of Geosciences,
Wang Pei-ling at NTU's Institute of Oceanography, Tullis Onstott at
Princeton University, Lisa Pratt at Indiana University Bloomington,
and eight other researchers from the United States, Canada, South
Africa and Germany.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Science Council, the U.S. National Astronautics
and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, and
several other institutions have financially supported the project.</P>
      <P>Lin, the lead author of the paper, explained that they chose the
mine in South Africa as the excavation site because the seams there
have existed for more than 3 billion years and have experienced very
little tectonic activity, which would destroy any subsurface
communities.</P>
      <P>Lin entered the depths of the mine on 30 occasions during a four-
month period, collecting samples from fracture water. The samples
were later thoroughly examined for signs of life.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, the scientists found various kinds of
bacteria in the water, however, the population is dominated by a new
species, which is related to hydrothermal vent bacteria from the
division of firmicutes. Closer DNA comparisons revealed that the
species has been removed from contact with its surface cousins for at
least 3 million years and has adopted a new way to survive in the
process.</P>
      <P>To name a few differences, the new species can consume sulfate
and hydrogen to produce sustaining materials for the other bacteria,
and they can resist the radioactive environment. The new strain also
reproduces at a much slower rate, over 45 years to 300 years, while
normal bacteria reproduce every 30 minutes to one hour.</P>
      <P>There have been many cases of subsurface bacterium communities
being discovered before. However, in the previous cases, there was no
way to determine whether the communities existed in isolation in an
inorganic environment or whether they were carried there by "
outsiders," such as humans or animals.</P>
      <P>In this project, the scientists have verified that the
environment is completely isolated from the outside world.</P>

      <P>A group of opposition and independent
legislators questioned Wednesday the appropriateness of the new
Academica Sinica president, Wong Chi-huey, holding dual citizenship.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chiang Lien-fu said that
Wong, a U.S.-trained scientist, holds both Republic of China and U.S.
citizenship, which he claimed could place Wong, now the head of
Taiwan's top research institute, in a "divided loyalties" dilemma if
Taiwan's national interests conflict with those of the United States.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chiang's remarks in a meeting of the Legislative
Yuan Sci-Tech and Information Committee, Wong said that as the head
of Academia Sinica, he will be completely devoted to Taiwan, adding
that he had already given up his career in the United States prior to
returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that the recently passed Nationality Act
allows personnel at academic research organizations to hold dual
citizenship.</P>
      <P>When asked by Independent Legislator Lin Chin-hsing why he
attaches so much importance to holding dual citizenship, Wong
responded that it is because of personal considerations. He noted
that he had lived in the United States for 35 years and plans on
returning there after his term as the president of Academia Sinica
ends.</P>
      <P>Wong further said that he personally feels that allowing academic
researchers to hold dual citizenship can only benefit the progress

    <HEADLINE>TAMSUI, HUALIEN SELECTED FOR 'SOLAR CITY' PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The scenic coastal town of Tamsui in
northern Taipei County and the eastern county of Hualien have been
selected as venues for a "Solar City" project aimed at promoting
clean energy, tourism and high-tech development, economics officials
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "Solar City" project is part of the government's "Challenge
2008" national development plan, under which cities or townships with
sufficient sunlight will be selected for installation of photovoltaic
(PV) power generation systems, the officials explained.</P>
      <P>Such facilities are capable of generating electricity from
sunlight -- an unlimited, clean source of energy, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Apart from establishing PV power generation facilities that
collect energy from sunlight and convert it into electricity, the
officials said the "Solar City" project will also create a new look
for the selected cities or townships with urban aesthetic visions and
advanced optical technologies.</P>
      <P>Noting that several advanced countries, such as Austria, Germany
and Japan, have successfully turned their renewable energy producing
installations into tourist attractions or objects of public art, the
officials said the "Solar City" project will integrate PV power
generation facilities with unique local scenery, historical sites and
cultural heritage to create new images for the selected cities or
townships.</P>
      <P>After a careful field survey, the Bureau of Energy under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs has selected Tamsui and Hualien for the
first phase of the "Solar City" development plan.</P>
      <P>The bureau is scheduled to sign a contract with the Taipei and
Hualien county governments respectively later this year for the
"Solar City" project.</P>
      <P>According to energy bureau officials, each of the two county
governments will receive a grant of NT$120 million for developing
Tamsui and yet-to-be-selected Hualien townships into "solar cities"
that will boast beautiful urban landscapes and meet the requirements
of energy conservation and eco-friendliness.</P>
      <P>All the construction projects under the "Solar City" program have
to be completed by the end of 2008, the officials said. By then,
people will be able to appreciate magnificent solar power generation
structures that collect sunlight in the daytime and illuminate the
Tamsui Riverbanks at night.</P>
      <P>"Integrating sophisticated solar power generation and optical
technology and urban aesthetic visions will help inspire advancement
in energy and environmental protection industries while ordinary
citizens will be able to enjoy aesthetic beauty and poetic
possibilities brought about by the cutting-edge technologies, " an
energy bureau official said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that
he believes President Chen Shui-bian agrees with him that a political
leader should step down if found to have been involved in a
corruption scandal.</P>
      <P>During an interpellation session at the legislature a day
earlier, Su further remarked that as the nation's leader, the
president should set an example for the people by examining himself
"with higher moral standards, " remarks that drew attention from
pundits of all stripes.</P>
      <P>Some opposition lawmakers said Su made such "daring remarks"
because he knew of a prosecution report on an investigation into
"state affairs fund" spending that exonerates Chen from any possible
charges of corruption.</P>
      <P>In reply to media questions, Su said that what he said at the
legislature simply reveals "a principle and a standard that I have
always held, and I believe the president holds the same principle and
standard."</P>
      <P>But as a well-trained lawyer, Su said, he must also stress the
importance of the principle of the rule of law -- under which, he
claimed, "allegations cannot serve as material for media reports" and
judgments cannot precede trials.</P>
      <P>Su said: "I am a premier who has been appointed by the president.
I have my own principles about what to say and what to do. But I also
have to follow some rules on how and what to say in my capacity as
premier, rules that I will make myself."</P>
      <P>He continued: "I believe that everyone has seen clearly what the
president has done over the years and has been using the most
stringent criteria to examine him. And he has on many occasions
clearly stated his views about ethics, which it would be
inappropriate for me to repeat."</P>
      <P>Asked to define his so-called "high moral standards, " Su refused
to answer directly, saying only, "Please keep checking us."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 90 percent of respondents to a
recent survey are worried about imported fake Chinese food products,
according to the survey results released Wednesday by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The DPP conducted the survey Oct. 3-5 prior to a meeting in
southern China in mid-October sponsored by Taiwan's opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC). A total of
1,018 effective samples were collected with a margin of error of 3.13
percent.</P>
      <P>The results show that up to 89 percent of the people polled are
worried about the inferior quality of Chinese products, while 76
percent are worried that competition from cheap Chinese agricultural
produce will affect the livelihoods of local farmers and 61 percent
are worried that closer cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural exchanges
will lead to the flight of Taiwan's expertise and the loss of
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>On the KMT-CPC agricultural forum, 62 percent said it would
not help solve the issue of fake Chinese food products,
counterfeiting of Taiwan agricultural produce or the outflow of
Taiwan's premium expertise.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 86 percent of the respondents believe
cross-strait agricultural exchanges should be conducted in a
government-to-government way so as to protect the rights of local
farmers.</P>
      <P>The survey results were released amid recent reports of imported
Chinese hairy crabs containing carcinogens and oysters containing

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved Wednesday a public
construction package under which the government will funnel a total
of NT$728.9 billion (US$21.95 billion) over the next three years into
resolving problems such as flooding, water shortages, an
unsatisfactory environment and the lack of leisure facilities.</P>
      <P>According to Minister without Portfolio Wu Tse-cheng, the package
is expected to contribute 0.99 percent per year to Taiwan's economic
growth and provide 340,000 jobs, which will have a positive effect on
boosting the country's economy and attracting private sector
investment.</P>
      <P>On water-related problems, the Cabinet will invest NT$210 billion
over the next three years to resolve flooding problems and improve
the quality of drinking water, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Plans to achieve the goals include overhauling rivers around the
country and regional water drainage systems, increasing water storage
and reserve facilities, upgrading the apportioning of water resources
and sewage treatment facilities, relieving the risk of water
shortages in the Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung
areas, building an inter-connecting pipeline between Taipei's Feitsui
reservoir and Taoyuan's Shihmen reservoir, and purifying water, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government will also refurbish the environment around
the coast and along river banks, with the goal of seeing each county
and city having at least one section of river that is accessible for
public use and enjoyment by 2009, increasing to at least two by
2015.</P>
      <P>Noting that transportation development is another focus of the
public construction package, Wu said the government will make it a
priority to establish close-knit regional networks connecting
railways and highways to prepare for the launch of the high-speed
railway system.</P>
      <P>Over the next three years, the government will pour in NT$336.8
billion to construct a logistic network that meets international
standards, strengthen rail transport development and air freight
services in eastern Taiwan and the outlying islands, reconstruct
dilapidated bridges and reinforce express transport services, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>It is the government's goal to shorten the travel time between
major cities to within three hours, cut down the commuting time in
urban areas and that between townships and local capitals to within
75 minutes, and reduce the travel time between international airports
or seaports and major science-based industrial parks to within 10
minutes, he said.</P>
      <P>On the plan to improve the living environment, the government
will invest NT$192 billion over the next three years to build parks,
leisure and sports facilities, bicycle lanes and walkways to provide
an environment friendly to pedestrians, and upgrade the handicapped
friendly facilities on public transport, he said.</P>
      <P>On the plan to bridge the digital gap between rural and urban
areas, the government aims to shorten the travel time between
residences and community art and cultural centers or sports
facilities to within 10 minutes, cut down the travel time between
residences and multipurpose sports parks to within 70 minutes, and
increase broadband coverage to 40 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>The package is one of five covered by the Cabinet's NT$1.17
trillion "mega investment" and "mega warmth" projects, which are to
be implemented over a three-year period from 2007 to 2009 to increase
Taiwan-bound investment, create jobs, narrow the rural-urban
development gap and reduce wealth disparity.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has previously unveiled the other four packages on
industrial development, the financial market, human resources and
social welfare.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Wednesday the official launch of
the five packages following the finalization of the public
construction package -- the final one in the series.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NSC TO HIRE 1,800 OVERSEAS RESEARCHERS EACH YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) has set
a goal of hiring 1,800 researchers from overseas each year to help
beef up Taiwan's scientific research clout, NSC Chairman Chen
Chien-jen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a joint session of the Legislative Yuan
Sci-Tech and Information Committee and the Budget and Final Accounts
Committee, Chen said the NSC has decided to increase the number of
researchers that the council plans to invite from overseas from the
current 1,100 each year to 1,800.</P>
      <P>They will be paid salaries on a par with those paid to
researchers at the same levels in the United States, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The council will also help more local doctoral candidates to
pursue advanced research abroad and facilitate the participation of
local young academics in international research projects, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to questions raised by ruling
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Kuo Chun-ming, who asked the
NSC and Academia Sinica -- two major research organizations -- what
they have been doing to acquire researchers from abroad as one of the
options to bolster Taiwan's research strength.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, newly sworn in Academia Sinica President Wong Chi-huey
appealed to the administration to free researchers from regulations
that are designed to regulate public functionaries.</P>
      <P>Wong said liberalism is heralded in the academic research field,
but the administration regulates researchers with civil servant law.
"It is irrational that the government treat the country's researchers
as civil servants, who have to obey the instructions of the
government," Wong added.</P>
      <P>Wong added that it is also unrealistic that researchers be
prohibited from taking up additional research projects or posts.
"Such restrictions are obviously limiting the possibility of
acquisition or further expansion of research information," he
said.</P>
      <P>The legislative joint session was screening budget plans for the
NSC and Academia Sinica for 2007. The Executive Yuan-drafted NSC
budget plan includes projected NSC revenues for 2007 totaling NT$89
million, down NT$1 million from the year-earlier level, NSC spending
for 2007 at NT$43.84 billion, up NT$3.356 billion over 2006, and
spending for NSC affiliated organizations for 2007 totaling NT$38.29
billion, up 12.57 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>For Academia Sinica, the budget plan for 2007 includes annual
revenues totaling NT$173.83 million, up NT$23.49 million over 2006,
and annual spendings totaling NT$10.43 billion, up NT$1.043 billion
over 2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO STEP UP ORANGE PROMOTION IN VIEW OF POSSIBLE GLUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Wednesday that it will step up its promotion of oranges to deal with
a possible glut.</P>
      <P>COA officials estimated that local orange production could
increase to 223,971 tons this year, up 16 percent from the previous
year, or 10 percent more than the average production of the past
three years.</P>
      <P>Foreseeing a possible oversupply, the COA adopted measures to cut
production in August. They said that orange prices in production
areas averaged NT$15 (US$0.45) per kilo in early October and NT$13.2
in mid-October.</P>
      <P>To stabilize supply and demand, the officials said that when
harvest season arrives, they will promote direct marketing, encourage
the military and prisons to consume more oranges, and help growers
produce orange juice.</P>
      <P>If necessary, the government will activate a mechanism to solicit
government agencies and leading private businesses to buy oranges,
they said.</P>
      <P>They said that the peak season for oranges is between November
and January. With the increased production this year, they fear that
oranges could face the same fate as bananas, prices of which plunged
below production cost as a result of glut, leaving growers in dire
straits. The government is presently doing everything possible to
prop up banana prices.</P>

the dual citizenship of the head of the nation's highest research

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office categorically
denied Wednesday that a prosecution report on an investigation into
the "state affairs fund" case has been presented to the office for
a preview before it is made public.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang, director of the office's department of public
affairs, was responding to former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who claimed that Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen's
investigative report on the president's suspected involvement in the
alleged misuse of the "state affairs fund" might have been submitted
to the president for a preview.</P>
      <P>Lee said Shih's claim was "totally groundless, " adding that the
Presidential Office will not interfere in the prosecution
investigation or try to predict the results of the probe.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office does not hold any specific stance on the
"state affairs fund" issue, he said, emphasizing that the office will
"absolutely respect" the judicial authorities' decision.</P>
      <P>Shih said his concern was based on National Security Council
Secretary General Chiou I-jen's open statement that if the president
or his wife were to be found to have been involved in any corruption
scandal, the president will step down to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Shih, who is leading a "Million Voices Against Corruption"
campaign calling on the president to resign, speculated that Chiou
was using precise words on the conditions of Chen's stepping down
because Chiou had been "reassured" his statement will not backfire.</P>
      <P>Shih urged Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen to take into account "people's
expectations" rather than his own career prospects when deciding
whether or not to indict the president and his wife.</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-chung, the anti-corruption campaign's media coordinator,
said the campaign's legal advisers had concluded that "some people at
the Presidential Office" must be indicted for several reasons.</P>
      <P>First, Chang claimed, the president has broken the law by
conducting "secret diplomacy." The president has said the allegedly
misused "state affairs fund" has actually been used on such secret
diplomacy work as the "southern line" project.</P>
      <P>Second, according to Chang, the "state affairs fund" must not be
used for purposes that are not legally stipulated. And third, he
said, the Presidential Office had refused to cooperate with National
Audit Office officials trying to audit its accounting books.</P>
      <P>He reiterated Shih's claim that people are expecting Prosecutor
Chen to act as a "last defense" of justice in the country, and that if
this final defense collapses, a "tidal wave" will ensue.</P>
      <P>But Chang would not comment on the question of how campaign
leaders will react if Prosecutor Chen decides not to indict the
president or his wife, beyond saying that it is "a question that will
be discussed by the campaign's decision-making group."</P>
      <P>The campaign leadership's allusion to a "tidal wave" in the event
that the prosecution exonerates the scandal-ridden president did not
please Premier Su Tseng-chang, who advised Shih and the other
campaign leaders not to use "menacing language" in pursuit of their
cause.</P>
      <P>"Don't create turmoil in society because of your personal likes
and dislikes," said the premier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENSATIONALIZED FILICIDE-SUICIDE REPORTAGE MAY CREATE COPYCAT EFFECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.   25  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Media sensationalism in reporting
filicide-suicide cases in Taiwan during the past several months may
have created a "copycat effect" and unknowingly taught more disturbed
parents how to kill their children and themselves, according to an
analysis released by the Broadcasting Development Fund (BDF)
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The BDF will invite experts and academics to join a panel
discussion Thursday on the copycat effect caused by media
sensationalism and other related topics, including efforts to prevent
filicide-suicide, help survivors of such suicide attempts and ways to
correct social values imbedded in the minds of the public.</P>
      <P>Lu Wan-ping, a department head at the BDF, pointed out that
between June and August, there were 43 reports in Taiwan's newspapers
on parents killing their children and themselves.</P>
      <P>She said that of all the newspapers, the Chinese-language Apple
Daily was apparently the most sensationalistic, as it devoted the No.
1 spot on its front page to such reports many times, with each report
averaging about a half-page.</P>
      <P>During the same period, there were 142 television news reports on
suicides, of which 44 were about filicide-suicides. Era-TV alone -- a
cable TV news station -- devoted 12 reports to such family tragedies.</P>
      <P>Lu acknowledged it is still a moot point whether sensationalized
news reportage on filicide-suicides could create a copycat effect.</P>
      <P>Chang Chia-ming, a psychiatrist at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,
noted an unprecedented phenomenon of "filicide-suicide clusters" in
the past few months, with one cluster following another within a
short time.</P>

The top American military commander in Iraq
said Tuesday that it was possible he might need

in Baghdad to reinvigorate a plan to recapture
the capital's streets from insurgents and death
squads.
In a news conference held after a week of
largely bad news from Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey
Jr. and Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad sought to
reassure an increasingly restive American public
that the war was still winnable.

William Swanberg had a thing for Legos, but
it was hardly child's play.
After he was arrested last November near
Portland, Ore., police investigators determined
he had stolen more than $600,000 of the Danish
building toys over three years from dozens of
stores in at least five Western states.
He pilfered the toys by creating counterfeit
bar codes that allowed $100 Lego sets, for example,
to be rung up for just $19. Then he resold them on

    <HEADLINE>LANDFILL WASTE TO BE REMOVED FROM SHIHMEN DAM'S CATCHMENT AREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs indicated Wednesday that in three days
it will work out a plan to remove landfill waste and trash that was
dumped in the Shihmen reservoir's catchment area by construction
subcontractors.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, head of the WRA, acknowledged that 500 cubic
meters of landfill waste -- about 40 truckloads -- was discovered to
have been dumped by subcontractors working on the Nantsaikou creek
bank reinforcement project -- more than double the estimated total of
200 cubic meters declared a day earlier.</P>
      <P>He said officials from the Environmental Protection
Administration had already collected samples of the waste and are
expected to release a test report Nov. 20 on whether the waste
contains toxic substances, such as dioxin and heavy metals.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Shihmen reservoir's water source has not been
polluted, and that more efforts will be made to prevent toxic
chemicals from being washed into the reservoir by rain.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he added, the WRA will work with public
prosecutors to find those responsible for dumping the waste in the
catchment area.</P>
      <P>Media reports on the illegal dumping of landfill waste have
triggered public concern about the potential dangers to public
health, because the Shihmen reservoir supplies drinking water to some
3 million people in the counties of Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO PROPOSE OWN VERSION OF PARTY ASSETS BILL: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Wednesday that his party opposes the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) party assets bill, and now that it has been
put on the legislative agenda the KMT will propose its own version of
the bill.</P>
      <P>The DPP proposal passed the legislature's procedure committee
Tuesday with the backing of the KMT's "pan-blue alliance" ally the
People First Party (PFP), creating a rift between the two "allies."</P>
      <P>Ma said he is not against allowing the legislature to debate a
bill that would regulate political party assets, but that the DPP
version proposes handling all of the KMT's assets, dating back a long
time.</P>
      <P>"It looks like an attempt to 'purge' the KMT along the lines of
China's Cultural Revolution -- a proposal that's unreasonable,
unconstitutional and against the spirit of the law," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the KMT will propose a political party bill
which includes a chapter dealing exclusively with party assets.</P>
      <P>The KMT suggests that a political party be permitted to own
assets and banned from running a business, and that the assets be
certified yearly by professional accountants as part of an initiative
to make party finances transparent, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Talking about the KMT-PFP rift, Ma said the two parties are
cooperating in the city council elections of Taipei and Kaoshiung and
in the national legislature.</P>
      <P>Without cooperation, he said, the two opposition parties will not
be able to retain their majority status in the legislature.</P>
      <P>"So, whenever possible, cooperation should be pursued, and in
areas of difference -- such as a PFP-initiated no-confidence motion
against the premier -- there should be room for differing views,
based on which a common ground can be explored," he added.</P>

against his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rival, Frank

demanded Hsieh apologize within 24 hours or face a lawsuit.</P>

defaming Hau and attempting to make him lose the election -- the
latter being a punishable crime under election law.</P>

      <P>The last two of the four Kidd-class
destroyers procured from the United States returned to Taiwan
Wednesday after a 52-day voyage across the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>The newly acquired destroyers, christened the "Makung" and the
"Tsoyin, " arrived in the evening at Suao naval base in northeastern
Yilan County to the warm welcome of more than 1,000 family members of
the 400-plus naval officers and enlisted men aboard the two warships.</P>
      <P>Addressing a welcome ceremony, Navy General Commander Adm. Lin
Chen-yi said all personnel aboard the two destroyers have taken part
in the vessels' demothballing and received rigorous training in
equipment maintenance and weaponry systems operations during their
nearly two-year stay at a shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina.</P>
      <P>Lin praised all military personnel aboard the two warships for
their perseverance and fortitude in withstanding tough demothballing
work, training and a comprehensive series of stringent shell and
missile test-firing before heading for home in early September.</P>
      <P>The two destroyers departed from the United States Sept. 3 and
made logistics stops at U.S. naval bases in Hawaii and Guam.</P>
      <P>The two warships are scheduled to be commissioned into service at
a grand ceremony scheduled for Nov. 2, Lin said, adding that the two

      <P>Taiwan struck a deal with the United States in 2003 on procuring
the four Kidd-class destroyers at a cost of NT$24 billion. The ships
were built in the late 1970s for Iran, but later mothballed after the

equipment maintenance and weaponry systems operations during their
nearly two-year stay at a shipyard in Charleston, South Carolina.</P>
      <P>Lin praised all military personnel aboard the two warships for
their perseverance and fortitude in withstanding tough demothballing
work, training and a comprehensive series of stringent shell and
missile test-firing before heading for home in early September.</P>
      <P>The two destroyers departed from the United States Sept. 3 and
made logistics stops at U.S. naval bases in Hawaii and Guam.</P>
      <P>The two warships are scheduled to be commissioned into service at
a grand ceremony scheduled for Nov. 2, Lin said, adding that the two
destroyers' commissioning will contribute toward the enhancement of
Taiwan's defense capability.</P>
      <P>Taiwan struck a deal with the United States in 2003 on procuring
the four Kidd-class destroyers at a cost of NT$24 billion. The ships
were built in the late 1970s for Iran, but later mothballed after the
deal was canceled aimd souring U.S.-Iran ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan accepted delivery of two of the four vessels -- the
Keelung and the Suao -- last December.</P>
      <P>Naval officials said the Kidd-class destroyers, armed with
advanced missiles and three-dimensional radar, possess superb
air-defense, anti-submarine and battlefield management capabilities.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Chiehyu Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government's policy on Taiwan
is comprised of an inseparable "package" including its commitment to
help Taiwan defend itself, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We've been very clear that U.S. policy on Taiwan is governed by
our commitment to a 'one China' policy and to the three communiques.
We've also been very clear that it is governed by our obligations
under the Taiwan Relations Act, and that is to help Taiwan defend
itself," Rice said.</P>
      <P>"And I say to the Chinese all the time that it is a package and
can't be separated out," she added.</P>
      <P>Rice said Washington expects neither Taiwan nor China to engage
in activities that are aimed at disturbing or changing the status quo
unilaterally.</P>
      <P>She suggested that both sides engage in dialogue to reduce
cross-strait tensions and keep any "unforeseen or unwanted incidents"
from happening.</P>
      <P>Rice made the remarks during a question-and-answer session after
delivering the Heritage Foundation's Annual B.C. Lee Lecture on
security issues in Northeast Asia. She was asked how the U.S.
position or relationship with Taiwan affects U.S. talks with North
Korea, particularly how Washington negotiates with Beijing and
strategizes to pressure North Korea to terminate its nuclear weapons
program.</P>
      <P>Rice said the cross-strait issue is separate from the North
Korean issue.</P>
      <P>On the North Korean issue, the United States deals with China as
a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, which has certain
powers and responsibilities to act on behalf of U.S. Security

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's deputy representative to the
United States expressed welcome Wednesday to U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice's remarks earlier the same day that the U.S. policy
on Taiwan is comprised of an inseparable "package" including its
commitment to helping Taiwan defend itself.</P>
      <P>John C.C. Deng said Rice's openly describing of the United
States' "one China" policy and its obligation by law to help Taiwan
defend itself in the event of attack as a "package" that cannot be
separated out has profound meaning.</P>
      <P>Rice made the remarks during a question-and-answer session after
delivering the Heritage Foundation's Annual B.C. Lee Lecture on
security issues in Northeast Asia. She was asked how the U.S.
position or relationship with Taiwan affects U.S. talks with North
Korea, particularly how Washington negotiates with Beijing and
strategizes to pressure Pyongyang to terminate its nuclear weapons
program.</P>
      <P>Rice spelled out very clearly the United States' "one China"
policy and its commitment to the three communiques and the Taiwan
Relations Act under which the United States is obliged by law to help
Taiwan defend itself. "I say to the Chinese all the time those are a
package and they can't be separated out," she said.</P>
      <P>"It means that we expect neither side, Taiwan or China, to engage
in activities that would try to destabilize the status quo
unilaterally, " Rice said, adding that Northeast Asian security would
be improved if China and Taiwan "could engage in discussions about
cross-strait issues to lower tensions and to keep any unforeseen or
unwanted incidents from happening."</P>
      <P>Deng said Taiwan is appreciative of Rice's remarks and hopes that
the Beijing leadership "faces the goodwill of the United States and
begins to engage in dialogue with Taiwan's popularly-elected
leaders."</P>
      <P>Deng further pointed out that Rice's remarks contained three
important points -- that the United States attaches great importance
to cross-Taiwan stability and adheres to its obligation to help
Taiwan defend itself, that it encourages Beijing to engage in
dialogue with Taiwan's leadership so as to reduce elements of
uncertainty, and that a more stable cross-strait situation is
conducive to securing regional stability.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the government has set an ultimate goal of creating a barrier-free
environment for the elderly in preparation for the country's expected
shift to an "aged society."</P>
      <P>In the latest edition of his online newsletter, Chen noted that
people 65 years of age or above already account for 9.9 percent of
Taiwan's total population, which exceeds the benchmark of 7 percent
set by the World Health Organization to define a greying society.</P>
      <P>Of these senior citizens, 113,000 require long-term care, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>It is projected that Taiwan will become an "aged society" by
2019, when people 65 years of age or above are expected to account
for 15 percent of the total population, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen said owing to longer life expectancy, changes in the social
structure, declining fertility rates, and emigration of local
residents, the counties of Yunlin, Chiayi and Penghu have already
become "aged societies," which he said has prompted the government to
pay closer attention to this urgent problem.</P>
      <P>To provide senior citizens with a secure livelihood, the
government has launched the labor insurance program and an insurance
program for civil servants, military personnel and public school
teachers, and it is offering monthly allowances to elderly people
from low-to-medium income households, he said.</P>
      <P>The president said that in line with the consensus reached during
a conference on Taiwan's sustainable economic development held
earlier this year, the Cabinet has finalized a draft law for the
launch of a national pension program to provide better security in
old age for all of Taiwan's 23 million people</P>
      <P>He said the government hopes to integrate the resources available
in the private sector to provide long-term community-based care
services for the elderly, adding that it will also offer various
subsidies and forms of assistance according to the needs of different
families, with the goal of creating "a barrier-free environment for
senior citizens."</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER SEEKS CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST LEE AO FOR TEAR GAS INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Joanna Lei
headed to the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office Thursday to seek
criminal charges against independent Legislator Lee Ao for
discharging a canister of tear gas during a meeting of the
legislature's Procedures Committee two days earlier.</P>
      <P>Lei asked prosecutors to determine whether Lee should be charged
with obstructing public functions and/or interfering with assembly
rights for his actions.</P>
      <P>Lee sprayed the tear gas from the podium of a Legislative Yuan
conference room where members of the Procedure Committee were
discussing which bills should be put on the agenda for deliberation
at a plenary session slated for Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is not a member of the Procedure Committee but who was
nevertheless allowed to attend the meeting, said he had come to
prevent the inclusion of a controversial arms procurement bill on the
agenda. The bill has been blocked for two years by lawmakers of the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" which holds a slim majority in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Claiming that members of the legislature's Defense Committee, of
which Lee is a member, had not been given a chance to express their
opinions on the multi-billion-dollar arms procurement bill, Lee said
he strongly objected to placing the bill on Friday's agenda.</P>
      <P>"I'm getting old, but I will block this bill with all my
strength, " Lee grumbled before launching into his bizarre tear gas
protest.</P>
      <P>Lee's actions caught his colleagues off guard, many of whom fled
to the hallway in fits of coughing, and forced the meeting's chairman
to announce a suspension of the meeting. After achieving his goal of
dispersing his colleagues, Lee himself left the scene.</P>
      <P>After a 20-minute hiatus, the meeting resumed and Lei took the
podium, blasting Lee's "mad behavior" and protesting the meeting
convener's failure to take any action to stop him. She demanded that
Lee be referred to the disciplinary committee for punishment.</P>
      <P>After heading to the prosecutor's office Thursday to seek
criminal charges against Lee, Lei told reporters that she reserves
the right to file a slander suit against the independent lawmaker for
calling her an "ugly woman" during a heated exchange Tuesday at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>

      <P>The business climate index in the service
industry fell to 114.54 points, the lowest in 16 months, with a
monthly drop of 3.92 points -- also the largest since June 2004, and
an indication that consumer confidence has remained low, according to
the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) Thursday.</P>
      <P>It noted that retail, wholesale and restaurant businesses gave
the most conservative responses, as business was sharply affected by
superstitions surrounding "ghost month," a traditionally inauspicious
month to get married, travel or do anything but pray, and most
restaurants and hotels experience declining revenues.</P>
      <P>Department store revenues dropped 18.1 percent from the previous
month while franchised convenient stores also recorded sales 5.8
percent below August's level, TIER said.</P>
      <P>Tourism industry revenues declined 10 percent from the previous
month. Traditionally, September is an off-season for tourism.</P>
      <P>It said the service industry's business climate index of 114.54
was the lowest since May 2005 and represented the eighth consecutive
monthly decline.</P>
      <P>"This shows the effects not only of ghost month, but also the
private sector's falling confidence, " TIER said, which noted that
mass sit-in protests against scandal-ridden President Chen Shui-bian
served to further dampen consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>It said the government has repeatedly emphasized that the service
industry is the locomotive of Taiwan's economy, yet it hasn't
performed well since the 2004 National Conference on the Development
of the Service Industry.</P>
      <P>TIER suggested that the government tell businesspeople more about
its policy initiatives and listen more to their views so as to narrow
the gap between policy-makers and business operators.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE PIANIST WINS TOP PRIZE IN AUSTRIAN CONTEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-li and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lu Yi-chih, a 24-year-old Taiwanese
pianist, realized his dream of performing in Vienna's famous Golden
Hall Tuesday when he played Mozart's piano concerto No. 27 in B flat
major in collaboration with Austrian National Radio Orchestra.</P>
      <P>Lu, a student at the Vienna University of Music and Performing
Arts, obtained the coveted opportunity of collaborating with the
renowned Austrian symphony orchestra after he won the top prize in
the Gradua ad Parnassum music contest in Austria earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The Gradus ad Parnasum is one of the most important music
contests in Austria, designed to discover and encourage young music
talent. Austrian citizens as well as foreigners who have resided in
Austria for more than three years are eligible to take part in the
competition. The contest has been held annually in various parts of
Austria featuring different musical instruments. This year's contest
featured the violin, piano, clarinet and string quart.</P>
      <P>Lu emerged as the top winner by presenting luminous, meticulous
renditions of Liszt's "Don Juan Fantasia" and Debussy's evocative
"Estampes."</P>
      <P>He also captured the best rendition award for giving a wonderful
presentation of Richard Duenser's "Sunrise," a piano work composed at
the commission of the Austrian radio orchestra.</P>
      <P>Lu, one of the most promising new-generation Taiwanese pianists,
has won prizes in eight regional and international piano contests in
his fledgling music career.</P>
      <P>"It's a dream come true for me to perform a concerto inside the
magnificent Vienna Golden Hall, " Lu said after the Tuesday concert
with the Austrian Radio Orchestra.</P>

    <HEADLINE>50% OF TODDLERS WITH ALLERGIES HAVE EARLY ASTHMA SYMPTOMS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Approximately 50 percent of infants and
preschoolers receiving medical treatment for allergies display
preliminary symptoms of asthma, making them at high risk of
developing the respiratory condition later in life, according to the
results of a survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Chang-Gung Memorial Children's
Hospital on children up to five years of age who made recent
outpatient visits to the hospital for allergies or asthma.</P>
      <P>The survey found 30 percent of these patients had persistent
asthma, while another 50 percent had preliminary symptoms of the
respiratory condition -- such as frequent coughing and wheezing.</P>
      <P>With the increased risk of respiratory illnesses in urbanized
areas, as many as 95 percent of the parents surveyed were worried
their children might develop asthma in future, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Huang Ching-lung, a pediatrist at the hospital, noted that
between 50 percent and 80 percent of asthmatic children usually
experience the first symptoms before the age of five, often more
slight cases of intermittent asthma or respiratory tract allergies.</P>
      <P>Children with these early symptoms may cough whenever they eat
iced products, smell smoke and other smells, or after play or
exercise. They may also have a night cough, making it difficult for
them to get to sleep, Huang said.</P>
      <P>As 85 percent of child cases of intermittent asthma are caused by
a viral infection, many parents may ignore and mistake it for a flu,
he said.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, a cough caused by the flu will not usually
continue for more than 10 days, and parents should be extra careful
if their children is coughing for more than 10 days, or if the
child's respiratory tract becomes overly sensitive.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that approximately 60 percent of children with
preliminary symptoms of asthma will develop asthma in the future, he
urged parents to have their children medically diagnosed if they have
a persistent cough or display wheezing symptoms more than three times
a year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) candidate
in the Taipei mayoral election challenged ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Frank Hsieh to join her in taking a
lie detector test to prove Hsieh's campaign had asked her to drop out
of the race.</P>
      <P>Chou Yu-Kou, who represents the pro-Taiwan independence TSU as
one of five candidates in the year-end Taipei mayoral race, said at a
news conference at the Legislative Yuan Thursday that via a
go-between, DPP candidate Frank Hsieh had offered her three
conditions in exchange for quitting the race.</P>
      <P>Chou said Hsieh could choose either to file a suit against her
for slander or join her in undergoing the lie detector test.</P>
      <P>Chou claimed that to get her to quit the race, Hsieh made three
offers through an intermediary. One, if elected, Hsieh would see to
it that a Taipei city government post would be reserved for her;
second, he would assist her in the next legislative election; and
third, he would assist her in the next election for Taipei city
council.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's campaign headquarters had no response to Chou's
allegations, saying only that the charges were all "sheer
fabrication" and not worthy of response.

    <HEADLINE>NEW COMPOUND DEVELOPED TO HELP THOSE WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at National Chung-hsing
University (NCHU) have completed the development of a new trivalent
chromium (Cr3) complex compound, which has proved effective in
helping patients with metabolic syndrome, university officials
announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The team, led by NCHU Department of Veterinary Medicine Chairman
Mao Chia-hung, uses lactoferrin -- or iron-binding protein -- as a
vehicle and detaches two Cr3 ions onto it. The lactoferrin can then
send the Cr3 ions and other vitamins inside the human body to enhance
the metabolic process, Mao said.</P>
      <P>Mao explained that they had run tests on laboratory mice with
diabetes for seven weeks, finding that the compound can help moderate
the levels of blood sugar, triacylglycerol, low density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol, leptin and inflammatory mediators.</P>
      <P>Chromium is a vital element for human metabolism, Mao noted,
adding that using Cr3 compounds can help restore patients to normal
status, within acceptable levels of blood sugar, blood lipid,
insulin, LDL cholesterol, leptin, and triacylglycerol, and contain
inflammatory mediators.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNA ORGANIZES 'ENCHANTING TAIWAN' PHOTO EXHIBITION IN NEW DELHI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New Delhi,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Kuo Chuan-hsin and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A photo exhibition featuring Taiwan's
scenery and glimpses into the everyday lives of its people opened in
India Thursday as part of a series designed to promote bilateral
cultural exchanges and relationship.</P>
      <P>The "Enchanting Taiwan" exhibition at the India Habitat in New
Delhi is sponsored by the Central News Agency and the Republic of
China representative office in India to complement Taiwan's "Go
South" and India's "Look East" policies.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to India Andrew Kao, CNA President Liu
Chih-tsung and Chandan Mitra, an Indian senator who concurrently
heads the independent newspaper Pioneer, officiated at the
ribbon-cutting ceremony of the exhibition's opening.</P>
      <P>Scores of Indian politicians, business leaders and media
executives attended the event.</P>
      <P>On display are images of Taiwan's natural scenery presented by
the Government Information Office, as well as a collection of CNA
news photos reflecting Taiwan's "vitality, diversity, democracy and
openness."</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Kao said the ROC government, while
vigorously promoting trade, cultural, tourism and technological
cooperation with India in recent years, has also spared no efforts to
increase understanding and friendship at the grassroots level.</P>
      <P>"The 'Enchanting Taiwan' exhibition epitomizes our commitment to
boosting exchanges and cooperation with India," Kao added.</P>
      <P>Mitra, who has twice visited Taiwan, said in his speech that he
was impressed by Taiwan's scenery, flourishing economy, vibrant
democracy and strong commitment to development.</P>
      <P>He said he was also impressed by Taiwan's dynamic media and press
freedom during his visits.</P>
      <P>Noting that socio-economic and educational exchanges between
Taiwan and India have increased in recent years, Mitra said the
recent opening of a CNA branch office in New Delhi marked yet another
step forward in Taiwan-India ties.</P>
      <P>For his part, Liu said the exhibition marks the first time the
CNA has ever displayed its wealth of news photos abroad.</P>
      <P>"The reasons for selecting India as the place for our first-ever
overseas photo exhibition are quite simple: India is the cradle of
civilization and the world's largest democracy, boasting a diversity
of culture and an abundance of human resources, " Liu said, adding
that India, with its exceptional achievements in software design and
industrial outsourcing, is now the most celebrated economic
powerhouse among the four BRIC countries, comprising Brazil, Russia,
India and China.</P>
      <P>To help expand the Taiwanese international perspective and
knowledge of India, Liu said CNA sent a team of reporters to India in
2004 to cover stories about the country's rise as "the jewel of South
Asia," inspiring what he described as an "Indian fever" in Taiwan's
media.</P>
      <P>In 2005, CNA sponsored an "India in Transition" photo exhibition
in Taipei, showcasing the country's path of democratic,
socio-economic, cultural and urban development, which received an
enthusiastic response, Liu said.</P>
      <P>And New Delhi's "Enchanting Taiwan" photo exhibition is an
extension of a CNA-organized series of activities to enhance cultural
and information exchanges between the two sides, he added.</P>
      <P>"We believe that a new 'IT' or 'India plus Taiwan' strategy that
integrates India's brilliant capability in software design and
Taiwan's cutting-edge hardware R&amp;D capacity will be conducive to
upgrading the two countries' global competitiveness and bringing
about a wealth of win-win business opportunities," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, which runs until Oct. 31, also aims to kindle
Indian interest in "discovering and experiencing Taiwan" and getting
a taste of Taiwan's transformation from a labor-intensive
manufacturing hub of low-cost gadgets to a high-tech powerhouse.</P>
      <P>Since his arrival in India Tuesday, Liu has been busy calling on
major Indian media groups to promote media exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>He has visited three major news agencies -- The Press Trust of
India, United News of India and Indo-Asian News Service -- as well as
the independent newspaper Pioneer and India's No. 1 newspaper, the
Times of India.</P>
      <P>Liu said his call to step up media exchanges has received an
enthusiastic response from Indian media executives, all of whom have
shown keen interest in developing cooperative ties with CNA and other
Taiwan media outlets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and India exchanged representative offices in 1995. Over
the past decade, the two countries have signed an agreement on
investment promotion and protection, and have established direct air
links.</P>
      <P>Bilateral exchanges in various fields have also gradually warmed
as a result of the government's efforts to hold in check a business
craze for China investment and reduce the risk of over-dependence on
the Chinese market by encouraging businessmen to instead expand
investment in India, which has contributed significantly toward
growth in Taiwan-India trade in recent years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT HEAD CALLS FOR PASSAGE OF ROBUST DEFENSE BUDGET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei
Office Director Stephen Young called Thursday for Taiwan's
legislature to pass the defense budget and various arms procurement
packages this autumn, in one of the strongest and clearest messages
AIT has publicly expressed in years.</P>
      <P>"Act now to pass the robust defense budget this fall. Don't do it
for the United States. Do it for Taiwan, " Young said in his second
public press conference since he took office in March.</P>
      <P>Young returned from Washington in early October after meeting
senior officials in the White House, State Department, Defense
Department and Congress.</P>
      <P>"As an indispensable partner of Taiwan, the U.S. needs to speak
its mind, " Young said, claiming that the U.S. is the only country
willing to help Taiwan with arms sales according to Taiwan's
defensive needs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to pass the robust defense budget, which will
increase from 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this
year to 3 percent in 2008, in the legislative session this autumn, he
said.</P>
      <P>The next concrete step is that the long-stalled arms procurement
package "should pass through the Procedure Committee in the
Legislative Yuan so an open debate can begin, " he said.</P>
      <P>It has been five years since U.S. President George W. Bush
approved the sale of the arms package to Taiwan in April 2001, Young
said, adding that China has never stopped its military buildup during
that period.</P>
      <P>"The gap between Taiwan and China in terms of military capability
has been growing, " he went on.</P>
      <P>Young said that now is the best time to pass the arms bill and
defense budget because the U.S. will be reviewing its commitments and
policies after the presidential election in 2008 and a new
administration takes office.</P>
      <P>The U.S. wants to help Taiwan with its defense not to "alienate
Taiwan and China" but in the belief that a stronger Taiwan will
"allow Taiwan to discuss political issues with China without fear of
threat or coercion, " he said.</P>
      <P>The de facto U.S. ambassador said he has met with major political
figures since returning from Washington. Prior to meeting opposition
People First Party Chairman James Soong the previous day, he met with
President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Su Tseng-chang, opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, former President Lee Teng-hui,
Defense Minister Lee Jye, Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang and
Legislative Speaker Wang jyng-ping.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should speed up normalizing economic
relations with China to ensure its economic survival and future
prosperity, the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) said
Thursday in its annual Position Paper.</P>
      <P>"With US$14.6 billion in investment, European business is the
largest foreign investor in Taiwan and we have a keen interest in
ensuring that Taiwan faces reality and secures its prosperity, " ECCT
Chairman Ralf Scheller said in a press conference.</P>
      <P>The position paper, titled "Facing Reality: Normalize Regional
Economic Relations to Secure Taiwan's Prosperity, " claims that
Taiwan's economy has not gained in competitiveness over the past year
by making the necessary reforms that should have led to an economic
transformation.</P>
      <P>The ECCT, which represents over 600 members from 400 companies
and organizations, is concerned that other economic areas in the
region, including South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and China's
Guangdong Province, have become more competitive through measures
such as market liberalization and tax incentives.</P>
      <P>Speeding up cross-strait business normalization is listed among
the ECCT's 2006-2007 priority issues, which also include eliminating
over-regulation, complying with World Trade Organization commitments,
accelerating the development of the service industry and creating a
favorable tax climate.</P>
      <P>The paper expresses regret that recent domestic political turmoil
and impasse has stifled economic reforms and cross-strait business
normalization, while the most urgent and critical suggestions were
side-stepped at the Conference for Sustainable Economic Development.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan does not start normalizing its cross-strait economic
relations soon, headquarters of European companies have indicated
that they are not interested in further substantial investment in
Taiwan, Scheller warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYORAL ASPIRANT OPPOSES U.S. PRESSURE ON TAIWAN TO BUY ARMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong, who has quit as party leader to run for Taipei
mayor, said Thursday he opposes a purchase of major weapons from the
United States but supports a budget to study the feasibility of
buying submarines.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks after American Institute in Taiwan
Director Stephen Young urged Taiwan's legislature to pass a
government bill on the procurement of major weapons systems during
its current session.</P>
      <P>Taiwan might miss its chance of procuring those weapons at all if
the bill cannot be approved this autumn, according to Young.</P>
      <P>Soong said he met with Young a day earlier and told him that as
PFP chairman he supports "reasonable" military procurements and has
never objected to the idea of having a strong defense capability.</P>
      <P>Soong said the PFP and its "pan-blue alliance" ally the
Kuomintang (KMT) won a majority of legislative seats during the last
election because the two parties opposed the military purchases.</P>
      <P>Claiming that "reasonable budget for military purchase" remains
Taiwan's mainstream view, Soong said the PFP and the KMT must not
"breach people's trust in us."</P>
      <P>He criticized Young for demanding that Taiwan's legislature pass
the bill within a certain time limit, adding that if the U.S. really
cares about Taiwan's democracy, not only will the Republican Party's
administration care about Taiwan, the Democratic Party will also care
about Taiwan should it become the ruling party.</P>
      <P>He noted that the U.S. is in the midst of a mid-term election.
Although Taiwan should not get involved in American politics, it
should not just hear the advice of "some Republican candidates but
should also take Democrats as friends," he said.</P>
      <P>To ensure Taiwan's security, Soong said Taiwan should not provoke
China or rely on the U.S. for its defense. "We should try to build a
framework of peace across the Taiwan Strait in accordance with the
international situation," he said.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Shoring up national defense will benefit
Taiwan literally and figuratively, American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Taipei Office Director Stephen Young said in a press conference
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Urging Taiwan's legislature to pass a robust defense budget in
the autumn session, Young said that by shoring up its defense, Taiwan
can boost its self-confidence in a wide-range of cross-Taiwan Strait
discussions and send a message to China at the same time.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan cannot win its arms race with China, but it doesn't need
to, " said Young, who took office in March to serve as the top U.S.
representative in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can just send the message that if China wants to attack
Taiwan, Taiwan is able to defend itself... and China knows that the
U.S. will respond if it attacks Taiwan, " he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, defense is more efficient than offense, which is why
Taiwan has to be smart in the weapons it buys, according to Young.</P>
      <P>Responding to a media question about a cross-strait peace
agreement, Young said he believes most political leaders in Taiwan
intend to sign such an agreement with China but that "terms" will be
the ultimate problem.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan urged
the public Thursday not to "overinterpret" American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Director Stephen Young's appeal for Taiwan's legislature
to pass a defense budget bill during its current session.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the call after some pundits described Young's appeal
as an "ultimatum" to Taipei issued by the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>"While we concern ourselves with Young's remarks, we should also
take note of U.S. Secretary of State Condolleeza Rice's recent
statement that the U.S. commitment to helping Taiwan defend itself
remains unchanged, " Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Asked if the government was feeling any pressure after Young
urged the Legislative Yuan to pass the defense budget this autumn,
Cheng said the U.S. has always hoped Taiwan will pass the budget bill
as soon as possible and both ruling and opposition party leaders in
Taiwan have also voiced their support for buying new weapons.</P>
      <P>"National security is priceless. Defense investment must not be
used as a point of contention between the ruling and opposition
parties, " he said, adding that the Executive Yuan has made some
adjustments in its proposal for a major arms procurement package.</P>
      <P>"Passing the arms package will protect Taiwan, not the U.S., "
Cheng said.</P>
      <P>As to whether the U.S. will take retaliatory measures against
Taiwan if the arms procurement bill fails to clear the legislative
floor this autumn, Cheng refused to speculate.</P>
      <P>"The point is that the ruling and opposition parties should begin
real discussion about the arms procurement package as soon as

      <P>An octogenarian couple in
Taitung County told reporters Thursday that they will not consider
euthanasia for their 54-year-old daughter, who has been bedridden in
a vegetative state since her first birthday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting-chih, 81, and her 82-year-old husband Chiang Chin-shui
have spent 53 years caring for their daughter Chiang Yu-chao, who
became paralyzed after suffering from brain edema barely after her
first birthday.</P>
      <P>Their daughter's condition kept worsening with multiple
disabilities -- she could not turn her head or body and lost her
vision at six. Her bones have become so brittle that the couple must
handle her with extra care when they turn her and clean her to
prevent bedsores.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that for 53 years, her daughter has never been
exposed to sunlight, Lin said Yu-chao can only "lie in bed like a
pile of meat."</P>
      <P>When told that families with similar problems were calling on the
government to pass legislation to allow the use of euthanasia, Lin
said firmly: "No way. I will not let that happen to my daughter."</P>
      <P>She added that no matter how hard and tiresome the job is, she

      <P>"We will not let someone else look after her. We will care for

    <HEADLINE>OCTOGENARIAN COUPLE SPEND 53 YEARS CARING FOR COMATOSE DAUGHTER(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung, eastern Taiwan, Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An octogenarian couple in
Taitung County told reporters Thursday that they will not consider
euthanasia for their 54-year-old daughter, who has been bedridden in
a vegetative state since her first birthday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting-chih, 81, and her 82-year-old husband Chiang Chin-shui
have spent 53 years caring for their daughter Chiang Yu-chao, who
became paralyzed after suffering from brain edema barely after her
first birthday.</P>
      <P>Their daughter's condition kept worsening with multiple
disabilities -- she could not turn her head or body and lost her
vision at six. Her bones have become so brittle that the couple must
handle her with extra care when they turn her and clean her to
prevent bedsores.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that for 53 years, her daughter has never been
exposed to sunlight, Lin said Yu-chao can only "lie in bed like a
pile of meat."</P>
      <P>When told that families with similar problems were calling on the
government to pass legislation to allow the use of euthanasia, Lin
said firmly: "No way. I will not let that happen to my daughter."</P>
      <P>She added that no matter how hard and tiresome the job is, she
and her husband will continue taking care of their daughter.</P>
      <P>"We will not let someone else look after her. We will care for
her ourselves and eventually see who is going to fall first," she
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Yang Ming-chu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A grand opening ceremony for Taiwan's first
high-speed railway will be held Dec. 7 at the system's Taichung
station in central Taiwan, a Japanese news agency reported Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Kyodo News, Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) has
sent invitations to former Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi
and many other Japanese politicians and railway industry celebrities
to attend the inauguration of the 345-kilometer railway which uses
the Japan-built Shinkansen "bullet train" system.</P>
      <P>The Japanese news agency said THSRC management has informed
Tadashi Ikeda, the Japanese representative in Taiwan, of its decision
with regard to the high-speed rail's opening as well as its
invitations to Koizumi and other Japanese dignitaries.</P>
      <P>The "bullet train, " which began initial test running in August,
has reached a maximum speed of 300 kilometers per hour during
testing, Kyodo News said.</P>
      <P>It quoted THSRC sources as saying that except for the 7-kilometer
Taipei-Panchiao section, the railway will begin a new stage of test
running between Panchiao and Kaohsiung in mid-November.</P>
      <P>After the Dec. 7 opening ceremony, Kyodo News said, Taiwan's
first high-speed railway is scheduled to formally begin operations in
mid-December.</P>
      <P>The railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung will reduce travel time
between Taiwan's two largest cities to 90 minutes. It had been set to
begin operations Oct. 31 after a one-year delay, but senior
transportation officials said earlier this week that "there would be
difficulties if the system were to begin operations this month."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT HEAD'S ARMS SALES REMARKS A REITERATION OF U.S. POSITION: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Chiehyu Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The latest call by an American
Institute in Taiwan official urging Taiwan to pass the budget for its
arms procurement from the United States is only a reiteration of
Washington's long-standing position, a U.S. State Department official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Sean McCormack made the comment during
a daily press briefing when asked if the call by Stephen Young,
director of the AIT's Taipei office, indicates any new policy on the
U.S. side.</P>
      <P>"I can't tell you the particular reason for the timing of Mr.
Young's remarks, only that it is, as you noted, a reiteration of what
we have urged those authorities to do over a period of time, "
McCormack said.</P>
      <P>In Taipei Thursday, Young called for Taiwan's Legislative Yuan to
pass during its current session the long-stalled budget for an arms
procurement package covering diesel-powered submarines,
submarine-hunting aircraft and Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
batteries.</P>
      <P>Earlier in September, a Pentagon official in charge of arms sales
to Taiwan told the Central News Agency that the Taiwan legislature's
attitude toward the arms procurement budget this autumn would be
decisive to the future development of U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>The official said that based on its understanding of the
political situation in Taiwan, the United States has waited patiently
over the past three years for Taiwan to sort out the differences
between the ruling and opposition parties over the arms procurement
package.</P>
      <P>However, the United States cannot wait forever, the official
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER APPEALS TO LAWMAKERS FOR EARLY PASSAGE OF ARMS BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang appealed to the
legislature again on Friday for an early passage of a bill on the
procurement of a major arms package from the United States, saying
that five years has already passed since Taiwan placed the order with
America.</P>
      <P>Su once again expressed his disapproval with the persistent
obstruction of the bill by the opposition legislators, who hold a
slight majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>He repeated his appeal to the legislators for the passage of the
arms procurement bill during the current legislative session, saying
that while China has been rapidly building up its military, Taiwan's
military capabilities have remained unchanged over the past five
years.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks after American Institute in Taiwan Director
Stephen Young urged Taiwan's legislature Thursday to pass the bill on
the procurement of major U.S. weapons systems during its current
session. Young said that Taiwan might lose the opportunity to procure
the weapons at all if the bill cannot be approved this autumn.</P>
      <P>After Young made the remarks, Taipei mayoral candidate James
Soong, who quit the chairmanship of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) to run in the mayoral election, criticized Young for demanding
that Taiwan's legislature pass the bill within a certain time limit.</P>
      <P>Soong said the PFP and its "pan-blue alliance" ally, the
Kuomintang (KMT), won a majority of legislative seats during the last
election because the two parties were opposed to the military
purchase. Claiming that "a reasonable budget for military purchases"
remains the mainstream view in Taiwan, Soong said the PFP and the KMT
must not "breach the people's trust in us."</P>
      <P>As to whether Young's remarks will make passage of the bill even
more difficult due to his angering opposition lawmakers, Su said that
the remarks can only provide another excuse for the opposition not to
pass the bill.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen noted that Young was just
reiterating the U.S. government's stance concerning the arms
procurement plan. Taiwan should make its own judgment on the issue,
and all the people concerned in this country should ponder it in a
rational manner, she added.</P>
      <P>For his part, Defense Minister Lee Jye said that Young made the
remarks in a serious manner, which Lee said should make the Taiwan
public seriously think about the meaning of his words.</P>
      <P>Disclosing that the Ministry of National Defense has felt
pressure from the United States over the issue since half a year ago
and has in turn pressed the legislature on the matter, Lee urged the
pubic not to overreact to Young's remarks.</P>
      <P>Lee said that China has disclosed a timetable for actions to take
Taiwan militarily and that according to the timetable, China will
have acquired three aircraft carriers by 2020.</P>
      <P>He added that the last thing Taiwan would like to do is to engage
in an arms race with China, but Taiwan should at least maintain an
ability to defend itself.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight Chinese tourists who sustained severe
injuries in a car crash while traveling in Taiwan earlier this month
were taken home Thursday under the escort of a Taiwan emergency
medical team, a medical source said Friday.</P>
      <P>Escorted by members of the Life Star emergency medical team, the
eight patients were accommodated in eight separate wardrooms
remodeled from the business-class section of a passenger aircraft for
their trip home to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalien, said Kuo
Chien-chung, the doctor who is the leader of the team.</P>
      <P>The Life Star mission helped save about half of the costs that
would otherwise be charged in such emergency transport aboard a
specially ordered charter flight, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the Life Star mission will initiate cross-Taiwan
Strait cooperation in emergency transport, Kuo said, adding that the
Taiwan emergency medical service system could also offer services to
Beijing to help prepare the Chinese capital for the 2008 Olympic
Games in terms of emergency service planning and personnel training.
</P>
      <P>Life Star teams -- manned by emergency doctors and specialists
aided with special equipment, including inflatable negative pressure
isolation chambers and portable altitude chambers -- began their
operations in January this year.</P>
      <P>The teams have replaced the services offered by Hong Kong's SOS
Inc. -- which is very expensive -- since last year, when they helped
carry patients suspected of having contracted bird flu from the
outlying island of Kinmen to Taiwan proper, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Five of a 40-member tour group from Dalien were killed in the car

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office demanded Friday
that a major newspaper correct what it claimed is a "fabricated"
report regarding Chinatrust Financial Holding Co.'s attempts to take
over Mega Financial Holding Co.</P>
      <P>In a press release, the Presidential Office accused the China
Times of trying to damage President Chen Shui-bian's reputation by
claiming that Chen had tacitly encouraged Chinatrust to "manage to
merge" government-controlled Mega Financial Holding.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust is presently under investigation for suspected
irregularities in the use of "structured notes" through an overseas
branch to acquire Mega shares, and the daily claimed that Premier Su
Tseng-chang was using the probe to distance himself from the
scandal-ridden president.</P>
      <P>According to the Presidential Office, the report was "completely
groundless and wildly speculative, and therefore totally
irresponsible" and should be "denounced in the most vehement terms."</P>
      <P>It claimed that the report "severely twisted and smeared" the
government's intention in pushing ahead with a second phase of
financial reforms, in addition to dividing the relations between the
Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>It said that in order to "restore the president's reputation," it
will send a message to the newspaper demanding that it "immediately
correct" the report.</P>
      <P>Several senior executives of Chinatrust have been detained for
their suspected roles in connection with the investigation.</P>
      <P>Late Thursday, prosecutors of the Taipei District Court issued a
summons demanding that Chinatrust Vice Chairman Jeffrey Koo Jr. show
up for questioning.</P>
      <P>Koo, who is currently in the United States on a short-term study
program, has told close friends that "if this was not a politically
motivated investigation, " he would be willing to cooperate with the
investigators.</P>
      <P>In response to Koo, the premier said that if a conglomerate has
done something wrong, it should be handled by the judicial
authorities according to the law and that there is "absolutely no
political motivation" behind the investigation.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said he can understand why
the boss of a big enterprise would react angrily to a judicial probe
into his business practices.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng said, the justice system must be respected and all
those who have been served summonses should "face the justice
authorities honestly and candidly."</P>
      <P>He claimed that neither the Presidential Office nor the Cabinet
have intervened in the investigation of Chinatrust Financial Holding,
and neither have they issued any "instructions" to the judicial
officials probing the case.</P>
      <P>Cheng called on the people not to "politicize" a judicial
investigation whose progress or results will be determined by the
officials of the justice system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIVIC GROUP PROTESTS AGAINST REMARKS BY AIT HEAD ON ARMS DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of a civic group opposed to an arms
deal with the United States scuffled with police in front of the
American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT's) Taipei Office Friday.</P>
      <P>Members of the Anti-Arms Procurement Alliance were protesting
against what they claimed were "inappropriate" remarks a day earlier
by Stephen Young, director of AIT's Taipei Office, that the U.S.
thinks Taiwan should pass the budgets for a long-stalled arms
procurement package by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The AIT is a quasi-official organization authorized to handle
relations with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>The protesters described Young's remarks as U.S.
interference in Taiwan's internal affairs and staged a skit to
convey the sense that a debt-ridden Taiwan will break the back of
the Taiwan people while a heartless U.S. tries to promote its
arms.</P>
      <P>The protestors wanted to deliver a letter of protest to the AIT
but no AIT officials showed up to accept it, scuffled with the police
instead.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chung-yi, convener of the alliance, said the group will stage
a protest every day until Young apologizes.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet submitted the plan to the Legislative Yuan to buy the
arms procurement package related to eight diesel-fueled submarines, a
squadron of 12 anti-submarine P-3C aircraft, and six Patriot PAC-3
anti-missile batteries in 2004, but the opposition parties, which
hold a slim majority in the legislature, have blocked its review
persistently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CONTINUOUSLY SUPPORTS ARMS PROCUREMENT: LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
continuously support the notion of arms procurement to beef up
Taiwan's self-defense and the party will not be swayed by remarks
made by American Institute in Taiwan Director Stephen Young,
Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, quoted KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou as saying Friday that he fully understood Young's point of
view when he urged Taiwan's legislature Thursday at a rare news
conference to pass the bill on the procurement of major U.S. weapons
systems during its current session.</P>
      <P>Young said Taiwan might lose the opportunity to procure the
weapons at all if the bill cannot be approved this autumn. He also
hinted that arms procurement plans should not be "kidnapped" by
Taiwan's domestic politics and that the U.S. will watch closely who
is taking advantage of the arms procurement bill to harvest personal
political gains.</P>
      <P>Wang said he exchanged views with Ma that morning over the KMT's
reaction to Young's remarks and added that Ma told him it would be
more conducive to the passage of the bill if Young had adopted a
milder attitude or more polite wording during the news conference
over the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA, ITRI TRANSFORM RICE STRAW INTO GREEN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) has made a breakthrough in making plywood out of
rice straw, which is practically useless and mostly goes to waste or
is used as organic fertilizer, ITRI officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The ITRI, under the commission of the Council of Agriculture's
Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA), utilizes straw and glue made from
rice to produce the new type of plywood that can be used to make
desks, chairs, partition board, loudspeaker cabinets, ceilings or
even coffins, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produces some 1.46 million tons of rice straw per year, an
AFA official said, adding that if left unused, it is a waste of
"green" materials, hence the motive to invent a new way to recycle
and add value to the rice straw.</P>
      <P>He explained that since the rice straw plywood is made of organic
materials, once recycled, it decomposes easily in the natural
environment, causing no environmental concern.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN URGED TO COOPERATE WITH TAIWAN ON CHINA'S DEMOCRATIZATION</HEADLINE>

(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) urged Japan Friday to collaborate with Taiwan
in efforts to accelerate China's democratization.</P>
      <P>Visiting DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said in a speech delivered at
the headquarters of the Tokyo Foundation that only by pushing to
build countries in East Asia into solid democratic communities can
the international community be allowed to witness true peace and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Yu, a former premier, said Japan should join hands with Taiwan in
efforts to usher China onto the path of democracy, claiming that only
when China turns into a true democracy can the whole East Asia be
assured of long-lasting peace and stability.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Japan -- a role model in Asia in terms of
democratic transition and political modernization -- is obliged to
play a leading role in regional efforts to accelerate China's
democratization.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is attaching great expectations to new Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, believing that Japan's first government
leader born after World War II can lead regional efforts to expand
Asia into a bigger democratic community with his new perspective.</P>
      <P>Some 200 people, including leaders from Japan's political,
academic and economic sectors, attended the speech sponsored by the
Tokyo Foundation.</P>
      <P>Yu flew to Japan Oct. 24 for a six-day visit in the company of 10

      <P>During the visit, he will also deliver a speech at Waseda

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECTED NOROVIRUS MASS INFECTION STRIKES YILAN HOSPITAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mass hospital infection suspected to have
been triggered by norovirus has been reported in northeastern Yilan
County, with more than 70 patients and health care workers having
fallen ill over the past two weeks, a Center for Disease Control
(CDC) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao said the CDC will help
the Suao Veterans Hospital step up its disinfection procedures to
control the outbreak and will re-examine samples from the patients to
determine if the infections were caused by norovirus.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, a few patients and health care workers in the
hospital first displayed symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting Oct. 15,
with the number of people with similar symptoms increasing to more
than 70 as of Oct. 24.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that norovirus is usually prevalent in autumn and
winter, with the major symptoms of norovirus illness including
diarrhea and vomiting.</P>
      <P>While most patients recover in one week with proper treatment,
people with weakened immune systems, such as children, the elderly
and those with chronic diseases, can develop severe complications
including dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He said washing the hands frequently is one of the most effective
ways to prevent norovirus infection.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Yu Hsi-cheng, deputy superintendent of the hospital,
said most of the infected people had recovered, with the exception of
16 who are still in quarantine.</P>
      <P>Yu said the hospital has forbidden the families of the patients
from visiting them at the hospital to prevent the spread of the
disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY OPENING AWAITING AUSPICIOUS  DAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of Taiwan's first high-speed
has been pushed back yet again to Dec. 7, mainly because of
considerations of the itineraries of invited dignitaries as well as
an auspicious day according to the Chinese almanac, a spokesman for
the Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chin-shan made the remarks after Kyodo News, a Japanese
news agency, reported that the THSRC has sent invitations to former
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and many other Japanese
politicians to attend the Dec. 7 inauguration of the railway, which
uses the Japan-built Shinkansen bullet train system.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the THSRC has separated the operation and
inauguration ceremonies because the operation requires approval from
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>He noted that trains are currently test running between Panchiao,
Taipei County and Zouying, Kaohsiung City according to schedule,
while the system's Panchiao and Taipei stations will be inaugurated
Nov. 16.</P>
      <P>He said that by the whole of the 345-km railway
linking Taipei and Kaohsiung will be able to reach the level of
inauguration "technically" by mid-November, so that an inauguration
ceremony can be held.</P>
      <P>Early December is considered the ideal time because invited
foreign dignitaries will be preoccupied with private or official
business between mid-December and January next year. An opening
ceremony at 10: 30 a.m. Dec. 7 is believed to be propitious timing
according to the Chinese almanac.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony, which will take place at the system's
Taichung station in central Taiwan will also be symbolic of the train
linking the two largest cities in southern and northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about the grand opening of the railway two days before the
year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections, Chiang said the
public should not think about everything in the context of politics,
and that there should not be "undue" speculation.</P>
      <P>The high-speed railway, originally set to begin operation
after a one-year delay, will reduce travel time between Taiwan's 
two largest cities to 90 minutes from the current four hours.</P>

      <P>The Kinmen Defense Command chief said
Friday that 70 percent of the command's idle barracks have been
cleaned up and could help tourism development of the outlying island.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Defense Commander Yang Tien-hsiao made the remarks in a

of phased out ammunition and equipment in them. Also attending
were Kinmen County Speaker Hsieh Yi-chang and Kinmen National Park

      <P>Yang said that Kinmen began streamlining its 100,000 troops in
the 1990s. After the decrease in the number of men stationed there,
some of the idle barracks have been used by residents to house
poultry and other livestock, and have become hangouts for
delinquents, which is why the decision to reclaim and renovate them
was made.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the Kinmen local government can negotiate with the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Police in Taiwan are working with their
U.S. counterparts to crack the case of a California-based fraud ring
that has swindled millions of dollars' worth of merchandise from
Taiwanese suppliers through import scams since 1998.</P>
      <P>According to the International Criminal Affairs Division (ICAD)
of Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau, the fraud ring would use
different names to place orders with Taiwan's exporters and after
receiving the goods, it would use various excuses to refuse payment.</P>
      <P>The names used by the fraudsters include "Michael Lian," "Paul
Cheng," "MP," "JP International," "Ever-Union Trading &amp; Investment
Inc.," "Ever-Unique Trading," and "LLUVIA Trading Inc." There is no
evidence these import companies actually exist.</P>
      <P>In September, police in Taiwan's central Changhua county sought
ICAD's help when investigating a new scam case involving what looked
like the same fraud ring. The ICAD contacted Los Angeles police
authorities and provided them with related information.</P>
      <P>Acting on the tip-offs, on Sept. 21 Los Angeles County police
searched container warehouses in two towns -- Pomona and Hawthorne --
and seized 19 containers full of liquid crystal display (LCD)
monitors, acoustic equipment and office furniture -- all imported
from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 25, Los Angeles County police officers Eddie Leung and

      <P>Since September there have been five cases

    <HEADLINE>KMT CLAIMS ITS ASSETS CAN WITHSTAND 'RATIONAL EXAMINATION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(BY S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Admitting that the legitimacy of some of
the party's assets was "questionable, " opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that overall, they could withstand
"rational examination."</P>
      <P>Ma briefed the media on his party's proposal to draft a law
regulating political party assets after the Legislative Yuan resolved
to form a joint committee to screen two controversial bills proposed
by the government and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to tackle the thorny issue of the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets.</P>
      <P>Ma said the Cabinet's proposal contains "incriminating"
provisions and, worse, demands the KMT prove its assets have not been
obtained illegally.</P>
      <P>Such proposals are not in keeping with the spirit of the rule of
law, he said, adding that a modern, democratic country should respect
the rule of law rather than "doing what it likes."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the KMT's assets -- whether they were taken over
from the Japanese colonial government at the time, transferred or
assigned by the Republic of China's government -- have all been
obtained legally, although the legitimacy of the acquisition process
may be open to doubt.</P>
      <P>"As long as anyone can prove any piece of KMT property was
acquired improperly, we will return it to the central or local
government," he pledged.</P>
      <P>However, he added, if somebody demands the KMT "compensate" his
or her so-called lost property, "the party does not have enough cash
now."</P>
      <P>Noting that such demands violate the spirit of the law, Ma said
the KMT must sell part of its remaining assets to pay for the pension
fund for retired party workers -- a task he said his party was
"morally and legally obligated" to perform.</P>
      <P>In sum, Ma said the KMT's assets can withstand "rational
examination" by anyone from any point of view, and that he would
oppose any Chinese Cultural Revolution-style attempt to "purge" his
party.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, he would like to propose legislation for a
political party law, under which a special chapter would set rules
for managing the assets of political parties.</P>
      <P>He said his proposal aims to "build a comprehensive system"
governing political party assets, and that this measure is better
than government and DPP proposals targeting the KMT only.</P>

      <P>A Chinese tourist seeking political asylum
in Taiwan was deported Thursday after authorities determined he
failed to meet the necessary requirements, Taiwan's senior official
in charge of China affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , said Jia Jia -- who is secretary-general of the Shanxi
Province Technology Experts Association -- left his tourist group
shortly upon arriving at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Oct. 22
and reported to the Tourism Bureau two days later.</P>
      <P>During a police investigation, Jia requested political asylum, a
request later turned down because he did not meet the requirements to
become an asylum seeker, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Jia was deported to Hong Kong, where he claimed he traveled to
Taiwan to "break away from the Communist Party of China (CPC) ." He
urged all CPC members to quit the party so that democracy could be
realized earlier in China.</P>
      <P>Jia, who is allowed to stay in Hong Kong for seven days, appealed
for international help so he would not "face severe persecution" in
China.</P>
      <P>Jia, 55, may be the first Chinese to enter Taiwan as a tourist
and then seek political asylum.</P>
      <P>"Jia is different from other Chinese democracy activists, who
simply cannot go abroad legally," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said the authorities had refused to grant Jia asylum because
he vacillated about his reasons for seeking asylum, confounding
investigators who wanted to reach a conclusion on the case as quickly
as possible so that Jia himself could return to his normal life.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said although Taiwan cares about China's
democratic progress, Taiwan has its own stance on the issue; that is,
inside China there should be more voices and better mechanisms to
deal with its own problems.</P>
      <P>"Only when more Chinese democrats remain in China to improve its
system will China benefit directly from their efforts," Liu said.</P>

      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
finally resolved Friday to have four of its standing committees
screen two controversial bills aimed at reclaiming the main
opposiiton Kuomintang's (KMT's) so-called ill-gotten party assets.</P>
      <P>The two bills were drafted by the Executive Yuan and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , respectively, which had been
stalled for quite some time.</P>
      <P>With unexpected support from some lawmakers of the KMT's
"pan-blue" ally, the People First Party (PFP) , the legislature's
Procedure Committee finally agreed Tuesday to have the two bills
placed onto the agenda for Friday's plenary session to decide whether
to deliberate them.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers originally hoped that the plenary session could
start debating the two bills whose contents are roughly same.</P>
      <P>Much to their disappointment, the PFP associated with the KMT
again and jointly defeated the DPP-led "pan-green camp's" attempt in
two rounds of showdown vote.</P>
      <P>As a result, the two bills had to be assigned to the
legislature's judiciary and organic laws committees for initial
deliberation. Nevertheless, "pan-blue" lawmakers camp up with another
proposal. They proposed that two additional committees -- finance and
home affairs committees -- join the deliberation. The DPP reluctantly

      <P>The leader of an ongoing anti-corruption

Taiwan's legislature to approve a defense budget for arms procurement
from the United States.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, a former chairman of the ruling Democratic

Taiwan should act now to pass defense budget legislation and seize

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese tourist seeking political asylum
in Taiwan was deported Thursday after authorities determined he
failed to meet the necessary requirements, Taiwan's senior official
in charge of China affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , said Jia Jia -- who is secretary-general of the Shanxi
Province Technology Experts Association -- left his tourist group
shortly upon arriving at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Oct. 22
and reported to the Tourism Bureau two days later.</P>
      <P>During a police investigation, Jia requested political asylum, a
request later turned down because he did not meet the requirements to
become an asylum seeker, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Jia was deported to Hong Kong, where he claimed he traveled to
Taiwan to "break away from the Communist Party of China (CPC) ." He
urged all CPC members to quit the party so that democracy could be
realized earlier in China.</P>
      <P>Jia, who is allowed to stay in Hong Kong for seven days, appealed
for international help so he would not "face severe persecution" in
China.</P>
      <P>Jia, 55, may be the first Chinese to enter Taiwan as a tourist
and then seek political asylum.</P>
      <P>"Jia is different from other Chinese democracy activists, who
simply cannot go abroad legally," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said the authorities had refused to grant Jia asylum because
he vacillated about his reasons for seeking asylum, confounding
investigators who wanted to reach a conclusion on the case as quickly
as possible so that Jia himself could return to his normal life.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said although Taiwan cares about China's
democratic progress, Taiwan has its own stance on the issue; that is,
inside China there should be more voices and better mechanisms to
deal with its own problems.</P>
      <P>"Only when more Chinese democrats remain in China to improve its
system will China benefit directly from their efforts," Liu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CLAIMS ITS ASSETS CAN WITHSTAND 'RATIONAL EXAMINATION'(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(BY S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Admitting that the legitimacy of some of
the party's assets was "questionable, " opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that overall, they could withstand
"rational examination."</P>
      <P>Ma briefed the media on his party's proposal to draft a law
regulating political party assets after the Legislative Yuan resolved
to form a joint committee to screen two controversial bills proposed
by the government and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to tackle the thorny issue of the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets.</P>
      <P>Ma said the Cabinet's proposal contains "incriminating"
provisions and, worse, demands the KMT prove its assets have not been
obtained illegally.</P>
      <P>Such proposals are not in keeping with the spirit of the rule of
law, he said, adding that a modern, democratic country should respect
the rule of law rather than "doing what it likes."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the KMT's assets -- whether they were taken over
from the Japanese colonial government at the time, transferred or
assigned by the Republic of China's government -- have all been
obtained legally, although the legitimacy of the acquisition process
may be open to doubt.</P>
      <P>"As long as anyone can prove any piece of KMT property was
acquired improperly, we will return it to the central or local
government," he pledged.</P>
      <P>However, he added, if somebody demands the KMT "compensate" his
or her so-called lost property, "the party does not have enough cash
now."</P>
      <P>Noting that such demands violate the spirit of the law, Ma said
the KMT must sell part of its remaining assets to pay for the pension
fund for retired party workers -- a task he said his party was
"morally and legally obligated" to perform.</P>
      <P>In sum, Ma said the KMT's assets can withstand "rational
examination" by anyone from any point of view, and that he would
oppose any Chinese Cultural Revolution-style attempt to "purge" his
party.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, he would like to propose legislation for a
political party law, under which a special chapter would set rules
for managing the assets of political parties.</P>
      <P>He said his proposal aims to "build a comprehensive system"
governing political party assets, and that this measure is better
than government and DPP proposals targeting the KMT only.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES TO SCREEN BILLS ON ILL-GOTTEN PARTY ASSETS(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
finally resolved Friday to have four of its standing committees
screen two controversial bills aimed at reclaiming the main
opposiiton Kuomintang's (KMT's) so-called ill-gotten party assets.</P>
      <P>The two bills were drafted by the Executive Yuan and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , respectively, which had been
stalled for quite some time.</P>
      <P>With unexpected support from some lawmakers of the KMT's
"pan-blue" ally, the People First Party (PFP) , the legislature's
Procedure Committee finally agreed Tuesday to have the two bills
placed onto the agenda for Friday's plenary session to decide whether
to deliberate them.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers originally hoped that the plenary session could
start debating the two bills whose contents are roughly same.</P>
      <P>Much to their disappointment, the PFP associated with the KMT
again and jointly defeated the DPP-led "pan-green camp's" attempt in
two rounds of showdown vote.</P>
      <P>As a result, the two bills had to be assigned to the
legislature's judiciary and organic laws committees for initial
deliberation. Nevertheless, "pan-blue" lawmakers camp up with another
proposal. They proposed that two additional committees -- finance and
home affairs committees -- join the deliberation. The DPP reluctantly
agreed to that arrangement.</P>
      <P>Differences between the government- and the DPP-proposed bills
centered on the date to reclaim state properties from the KMT, which
ruled Taiwan for more than 50 years before the DPP came to power in
2000.</P>

local participants to an Asian leadership forum, led by University of
Maryland President C.D. Mote Jr.</P>

protection and disease prevention and control. The participants

    <HEADLINE>U.S. OFFICIAL WARNS OF CONSEQUENCES OF TAIWAN ARMS PROCUREMENT DELAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu, Chiehyu Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will lose the support of the
United States if it continues to delay its arms procurement plan, a
senior U.S. official warned Friday.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is reluctant to invest in its own defense, the new
administration to be formed in 2008 in Taiwan should be prepared to
"inherit a mess of government with U.S.-Taiwan relations on a
downward spiral" and "inherit a government with minimum support from
the new U.S. administration, " the official told the Central News
Agency during a background briefing.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a recent
call by Stephen Young, director of the American Institute in Taiwan's
(AIT) Taipei office, for Taiwan to pass its long-stalled arms
procurement budget this fall was "friendly advice to the heart" and
that he hopes "Taiwan recognizes the seriousness of his message."</P>
      <P>According to the official, the U.S. government has sent similar
messages to Taiwan on many occasions and Young's remarks was only a
reiteration of Washington's long-standing position.</P>
      <P>"I'm pretty certain that if Taiwan does not demonstrate her
determination to defend herself by investing in her self-defense, you
will see a re-evaluation of U.S. security assistance to Taiwan, " the
official said.</P>
      <P>He said that although the U.S. government will still fulfill its
commitment to defend Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act,
Washington will review the extent of its security support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He expressed disappointment at what he described as a situation
in which "some politicians are using Taiwan's long-term survival as
if it is a chip to be used for political gambling."</P>
      <P>Urging Taiwan to take immediate action to deal with the arms
procurement budget, he said this fall is a critical "turning point."</P>
      <P>"The U.S.-Taiwan relationship will not remain as it is. It will
either go up or it will go down. It will definitely not stay
constant," he warned.</P>
      <P>"U.S. support for Taiwan is not something to fool around with.
Once it is gone, it will be difficult to regain," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the official, if this happens, Taiwan's long-term
security will be jeopardized and China will force Taiwan to accept
terms that are against the interests of its 23 million people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, when asked to comment on the strong reaction from
Taiwan's opposition toward Young's remarks, U.S. State Department
Spokesman Sean McCormack said Friday: "I'm not aware that Mr. Young
presented the U.S. position any differently than it's been presented
in the past."</P>
      <P>Asked if Washington has any plans to recall him over the
controversy, McCormack said: "Young is doing a good job."</P>
      <P>The opposition in Taiwan, which has blocked the arms procurement
budget over the past two years, was unhappy with Young's remarks and
described Young's remarks as interference in Taiwan's internal
affairs.</P>
      <P>Some opposition legislators urged the public Friday to bombard
the AIT with phone calls to voice their protest and to "paralyze the
AIT's operation."</P>
      <P>Also Friday, former Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Shih
Ming-teh accused Young of having spoken as if he was the "U.S.
governor of Taiwan" and he urged President Chen Shui-bian to request
that the U.S. government replace Young to "defend Taiwan's
sovereignty."</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESOLVE DIFFERENCES WITH DEMOCRACY, PEACE: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu renewed Saturday
her concept of "soft power" that emphasizes the use of democracy and
peace to resolve differences.</P>
      <P>Lu said the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) inaugurated in August
last year was founded on this concept and groups 28 countries
aspiring to peace, democracy and freedom working toward world
prosperity and progress.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, there will be no peace if there is no democracy,
and prosperity will be impossible without democracy and peace.</P>
      <P>It will only create uncertainties and worsen conflicts if a
country relies on military or economic power to deal with other
countries, Lu said.</P>
      <P>She said the DPU is promoting a series of activities and
programs, including establishing an alliance of universities in the
Pacific region, to enhance scholarly exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while addressing a celebration held in Taipei
for the 150th founding anniversary of University of Maryland of the
United States and the Asia Leadership Forum co-hosted by the
university and its Taiwan alumni club.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday, Lu urged opposition legislators to drop their
objections to the government's arms procurement package from the
United States and pass the budget for the procurement as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan must equip itself with sufficient defense
capabilities in order to protect itself and to maintain peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>While the situation in Northeast Asia is drawing close attention
from the world, Taiwan needs to fulfill its responsibilities in
maintaining regional peace, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF CALLS FOR CALM BEFORE DISCUSSING ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou urged the ruling and opposition parties Saturday to calm
down and think before talking about the country's controversial arms
purchase plan from the United States.</P>
      <P>The last thing the parties should do is "hook the arms
procurement bill together with domestic political conflicts, " Ma
Ying-jeou said while answering media inquiries.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is still trapped in political turmoil
triggered by malicious confrontations between the ruling and
opposition parties, Ma said "it might be better for the two sides to
calm down first" before they discuss the arms procurement bill.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that the KMT and its political ally, the People
First Party (PFP) agree that there must be a "reasonable budget" for
the arms package. The opposition claims that the package is grossly
overpriced and have blocked it from even being assigned to the
legislature's defense committtee for deliberation for more then 50
times.</P>
      <P>Ma said it is important for Taiwan to maintain a strong national
defense. "Do not think the country doesn't need any arms purchases
only because the U.S. representative to Taiwan has said something, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should "do whatever it thinks is necessary for the country
no matter what the American said" Ma said, urging the public to
support a "reasonable" arms procurement package in a rational manner
"for only such support can really help Taiwan's national defense."</P>
      <P>"That is what a sovereign country should do," according to Ma. </P>
      <P>In Taipei two days earlier, Stephen Young, director of the
American Institute in Taiwan's Taipei Office, called for the
Legislative Yuan to pass during its current session the long-stalled
budget for buying arms from the U.S.</P>
      <P>Earlier in September, a Pentagon official in charge of arms sales
to Taiwan told the Central News Agency that the Taiwan legislature's
attitude toward the arms procurement budget this autumn will be
decisive to the future development of U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP CONCERNED ABOUT TAIWANESE VISITING CHINA FOR ORGAN TRANSPLANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu has called for
government agencies and the legal and academic sectors to show
concern over Taiwanese visiting China for organ transplants, the
Presidential Office said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal during a meeting Friday with representatives
from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , the Department of Health
(DOH) , and a Presidential Office consulting committee on human
rights.</P>
      <P>Lu said President Chen Shui-bian is also concerned about the
matter, and she expressed her utmost condemnation of what she claimed
are China's illegal organ transplants that she said seriously violate
human rights.</P>
      <P>Lu suggested that a special committee be established to show
concern for local people who have received organ transplants in
China.</P>
      <P>According to Chinese statistics, some 18,500 organ transplants
were conducted in China between 1994 and 1999, a number that jumped
to 60,000 during the 2000-2005 period.</P>
      <P>In addition, there were only 22 liver transplant centers in China
in 1999, with the number rising to 500 in 2005, with liver transplant
operations increasing from 135 in 1999 to 4,000 in 2005.</P>
      <P>In terms of kidney transplants, there were only 3,596 such
operations in China in 1999, but the number of these surgeries jumped
to 10,000 in 2005. Lu said she doubts whether there has been such a
huge increase of executed prisoners in China during the period.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong practitioners have claimed that arrested Falun Gong
followers have been victims of forced live organ removal for
transplants in China.</P>
      <P>Lu suggested that related government agencies promote education
about the possible source of the Chinese organs for transplant and
that officials of the DOH, MAC and Ministry of Justice investigate
whether there are local medical personnel or institutions involved in
illegal organ transplants in China.</P>
      <P>Describing it as a serious issue, Lu also urged the private
sector to contribute its part in protecting human rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER URGES KMT TO SPEED UP PASSAGE OF ARMS DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang again urged the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Saturday to speed up the passage of a
long-stalled major arms procurement package from the United States in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks on the sidelines of an inspection tour of
Taichung City to hear a briefing on the planning of an opera house
in the central Taiwan city.</P>
      <P>Su noted that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has said the party is
willing to review the arms procurement bill in the legislature,
although the KMT legislative caucus had again blocked it from being
put on the agenda for review earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Su criticized the KMT for blocking the deal for five years since
U.S. President George W. Bush approved the robust arms package --
including eight diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC-III
anti-missile batteries and a squadron of 12 P-3C aircraft -- in
2001. The Cabinet submitted the arms procurement bill and
appropriation bill to the legislature in 2004.</P>
      <P>"The people know well who's blocking the arms deal, " Su said,
adding that more delay will seriously undermine national security.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said the party will support arms purchases at a
"reasonable" price.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's national security is crucial and that people
should not allow candid remarks by a top U.S. representative in
Taiwan to cloud their judgment.</P>
      <P>He was referring to Stephen Young, director of the American
Institute in Taiwan's Taipei Office, who said Thursday that Taiwan
should pass a long-stalled appropriation bill for the arms by the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma said the latest proposal sent by the Ministry of
National Defense to the legislature is not for the original NT$610.8
billion (US$18.49 billion) special budget proposal for the
arms purchase drawn up in 2004, but a NT$6.3 billion supplementary
budget, covering NT$200 million for a submarine feasibility
assessment, NT$1.7 billion for the P-3Cs in the first year, NT$3.7
billion for the upgrading of the Patriot II missiles, and NT$700
million for building an airstrip on Taiping Island in the Spratly
archipelago.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taipei City mayoral candidate James Soong, who
is on leave from the chairmanship of the opposition People First
Party to take part in the election as an independent, claimed that as
the United States is now in its mid-term elections, the government
has no need to "benefit the arms dealers of the Republican Party."</P>
      <P>Soong, while launching his mobile campaign headquarters -- a bus
-- in suburban Beitou, said the PFP will oppose "unreasonable prices"
for arms procurements, or unnecessary items, or those that are not in
conformity with budgetary procedures and cannot be monitored.</P>
      <P>The PFP will adamantly oppose any recurrence of the kickback
scandals involved in the purchase of Lafayette frigates from France
in the 1990s, saying that arms purchases should be transparent and
should not be allowed to "line the pockets of the arms dealers."</P>

(By Wu Jih-chun and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must carry out constitutional
reforms as soon as possible to adjust its system of government in
order to enhance government efficiency, a Taiwan academic said in the
United States Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tong, a professor at National Taiwan University's
Graduate Institute of National Development, made the remarks while
delivering a speech to the Silicon Valley chapter of the Global
Alliance for Democracy and Peace.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the confusing system of government adopted by
Taiwan is the biggest predicament faced by the country, and unless
the system is changed through constitutional reform -- preferably by
the end of next year, the new administration to be formed in 2008
will have difficulty functioning.</P>
      <P>If the system of government is adjusted to become a purely
parliamentary system or a presidential system, it will help resolve
the current problem in which the implementation of government
policies are constantly blocked by the opposition, with the delay of
the arms procurement package from the United States being the most
obvious example, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that judging from the performances of modern
democratic countries in terms of their efficiency in governance and
political cleanliness, those practising the parliamentary system are
better than those that have adopted the presidential system.</P>
      <P>Indicating a personal preference for the parliamentary system,
Chen said that if the Constitution is amended to change Taiwan's
system of government to that of a parliamentary system, the majority
party in the legislature will form the Cabinet to ensure smooth
implementation of the Cabinet's policies.</P>

efforts to revitalize the Taipei Story House, once called Yuanshan

      <P>Ma expressed his admiration for the work to transfer the 92-year

      <P>Mentioning that some 400,000 people have visited the Taipei Story

has not been easy to revitalize the "mini" historic villa.</P>
      <P>Because of the efforts of Chen, who has succeeded in transforming

factories in Houli, a village which produces jazz drums and

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T TO CRACK DOWN ON OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN TRAFFICKING RING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang
reaffirmed Saturday his determination to get to the bottom of alleged
corruption involving collaboration between ministry officials with a
human trafficking ring to bring Chinese prostitutes into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that a judicial probe into the case has begun and
noted that the ministry will not condone any illegal practices.</P>
      <P>Lee said he had contacted National Police Agency Director-General
Hou Yu-ih and that he would not let anyone involved off the hook.</P>
      <P>"Chinese women coming to Taiwan have to follow due procedure, "
Lee said, adding that the ministry will review this procedure.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will also pursue the ministry officials involved,
no matter how high their rank may be," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, investigators turned over Lee Jo-ling, a senior clerk
at the Bureau of Immigration, and human smuggling ring leader Chung
Jui-chih, as well as eight others, to the Taipei Prosecutor's Office
for further questioning.</P>
      <P>Investigators a day earlier searched Lee's office and residence as
well as a brothel run by Chung. They also questioned a dozen
immigration officials, including Lee, as well as Chung, Chinese women
and local men who had agreed to enter marriages of convenience with
the women.</P>
      <P>The agents said Lee is familiar with the procedure for Chinese
women coming to Taiwan and knows that immigration officials are
usually more lax when handling cases that legislators have requested
should have speedy treatment.</P>
      <P>Lee therefore attached the entry applications from the Chinese
women to the "speedy cases" to make it easier for them to enter
Taiwan, the agents added.</P>
      <P>The women were also told to fake pregnancy so as to get an early
interview by immigration officials upon arrival.</P>
      <P>The agents found that the trafficking ring has been able to bring
over around 80 women through marriages of convenience. For each case,
Lee received between NT$30,000 and NT$80,000, and she is estimated to
have received around NT$2 million in bribes.</P>
      <P>The agents said the Chinese women paid back the expenses of
between NT$200,000 and NT$300,000 for coming to Taiwan to the
smuggling ring by engaging in prostitution, and also have to pay the
"local husbands" hired by the ring around NT$30,000 per month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE WOMEN HAVE TO BE FIVE MONTHS PREGNANT TO GET EARLY INTERVIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's top immigration official said
Saturday that Chinese brides of Taiwanese husbands will have to be
five months pregnant in order to be eligible for an early Taiwan
entry interview.</P>
      <P>Wu Cheng-chi, commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration under the
National Police Agency, made the remarks in a press conference to
explain the bureau's new policy in the wake of alleged corruption
involving collaboration between immigration officials and a human
trafficking ring.</P>
      <P>Wu said that out of humanitarian considerations, the bureau has
allowed pregnant women an early entry interview without realizing
that it has become a loophole for smuggling rings seeking to bring in
Chinese prostitutes.</P>
      <P>He said his bureau has detected several cases of Chinese women
faking pregnancy during the immigration process since the beginning
of this year.</P>
      <P>The bureau's new regulations will require women to provide
hospital proof that they are at least five months into pregnancy when
they apply for an early interview, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, for those cases in which legislators request "speedy
treatment, " the bureau will also step up internal auditing to plug
any possible loopholes in that regard.</P>
      <P>Touching on the alleged involvement of Lee Juo-ling, a member of
a liaison task force with the Legislative Yuan, in the smuggling
operation, Wu said that as soon as the court rules on her detention,
the bureau will convene a meeting to mete out disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>Noting that eight other immigration officials were released after
being questioned by the investigative agents a day earlier, Wu said
the case is probably the "individual behavior" of Lee and has nothing
to do with "massive corruption, " or "other ranking officials" as
reports had speculated.</P>
      <P>According to bureau statistics, since the interview system was
implemented in September 2003, 132,633 people have been interviewed.
Of these, 16,704 failed the interview and 4,485 were deported.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Magnificent and exquisite flower
arrangements featuring Chinese aesthetics that aspire to the
unification of nature and humankind have been drawing the attention
of visitors to the Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.</P>
      <P>Twenty artists of the Taipei-based Chinese Floral Art Foundation
(CFAF) have been invited to demonstrate the art of Chinese flower
arranging and to organize an exotic floral art exhibition at a
chrysanthemum festival that kicked off Thursday as part of the
garden's centenary celebrations.</P>
      <P>The CFAF was established in 1986 to continue and develop Chinese
floral art, which has existed for around 1,500 years, according to
the organization. It also said the art was originally created to
decorate religious ceremonies, but later became part of the life of
imperial courts and royal families.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the ancient art was not popular until two decades ago
when a local historian discovered the beauty of Chinese floral
arrangements and how to create them in ancient books. Since then, the
art has not only been revived, but has also developed in a systemic
and scientific manner under the cooperation of the CFAF and the
government.</P>
      <P>The group of floral artists will travel to Washington and New
York to present their work after the exhibition closes Sunday.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun will go to a screening commission under the

retrieving the ill-gotten assets of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Kao Yung-kuang, chairman of the screening commission, said the
commission will hold a closed-door meeting next Thursday but will
also hold a press conference after the meeting.</P>
      <P>The commission held the first official meeting Wednesday to
review a proposal initiated by the "pan-green camp" led by the DPP
and another anti-graft proposal initiated by the "pan-blue alliance"
led by the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The commission decided to handle both cases and is expected to
complete the review in 30 days.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, the commission while convening a
meeting can invite the leader of the proposal to attend to provide
explanations. If necessary, related government agencies, pundits and
experts can also attend.</P>
      <P>The two proposals are led by Yu and Wang Chien-shien, a former
minister of finance and legislator, but neither attended Wednesday's
meeting because of other engagements.</P>
      <P>When he submitted the proposal Sept. 4 to the Executive Yuan, Yu
said that the public claim for retrieving the "ill-gotten" KMT assets
will be an implementation of transitional justice and that a
referendum will uphold the ideal of "sovereignty lies with the

promote conservation awareness in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The presence of Jane Goodall, a well-known British

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
he insists on protecting Taiwan's identity and urged the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" to approve the arms purchase budget plan proposed
by the Ministry of National Defense as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal during a visit to Taitung County in
eastern Taiwan, where he visited several recreational farms and met
some 50 entrepreneurs in the Taitung area. Chen was accompanied by
Council of Agriculture Minister Su Jia-chyuan and Legislator Chen
Ying.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after the controversial arms purchase plan
was rejected from legislative screening again earlier this week for
the 57th time by the opposition-dominated legislative Procedure
Committee.</P>
      <P>The president told the entrepreneurs at the meeting that his
insistence on Taiwan's identity has never changed and that they
should have faith in him.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and China are separate countries on each side
of the Taiwan Strait, Chen urged the "pan-blue alliance" to pass the
defense budget bill with "a rational attitude, " as Taiwan will walk
his own way, different from that of China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he stressed that he has been working on reducing the
gap in terms of the development among different counties and cities
around the country, telling Taitung residents that the expansion
project of the railway linking the southern parts of Taiwan will
begin "at any time" once environmental evaluation reports pass
related committees.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chui-chang, the winner of the country's first rice quality
competition, who was also present at the meeting, presented Chen with
a sack of his rice, noting that sales of his prizewinning rice grew
by 200 percent last year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang agreed Saturday to
offer an additional NT$500 million in construction grant for the
Taichung municipal government to build a world-class opera house in
the central city.</P>
      <P>The planned Taichung opera house originally called for an outlay
of NT$2.4 billion and the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs
had agreed to contribute half of the needed budget.</P>
      <P>As the winning design for the new opera house, created by a
Japanese architect, requires special technology and materials, city
officials said the construction cost will spike by more than NT$1.1
billion. The city government has expressed its hope that the
Executive Yuan offers more grant for the project.</P>
      <P>During a community outreach of Taichung Saturday, Su acceded to
an increase of NT$500 million in the central government's grant for
the ambitious construction project after Taichung Mayor Jason Hu made
three assurances -- the city government will be able to complete the
project smoothly, the city council fully supports the project and
there will be no more cost overruns.</P>
      <P>Su, who once served as magistrate of southernmost Pingtung County
and later magistrate of northern Taipei County, said local
governments tend to need the assistance of the central government in
carrying out mega infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>Based on his trust in Hu's administrative competence, Su said he
is more than willing to lend support for the project so that it can
be completed by 2009.</P>
      <P>With its unique architectural style, Su said he believes that the
Taichung Opera House, when completed, will become a new landmark in
Taichung and entire central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu once proposed to build a Guggenheim branch museum in Taichung,
but he was forced to drop the plan after failing to secure an
approval from the city council. Hu said the opera house project is
different from the Guggenheim museum plan and that he is confident of
obtaining the city council's consent to the new plan.</P>

he regards them as dogs and horses, they regard him as a common
citizen; when he regards them as dirt and grass, they regard him as a
robber and enemy."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER AGREES TO OFFER MORE GRANT FOR TAICHUNG OPERA HOUSE PLAN(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang agreed Saturday to
offer an additional NT$500 million in construction grant for the
Taichung municipal government to build a world-class opera house in
the central city.</P>
      <P>The planned Taichung opera house originally called for an outlay
of NT$2.4 billion and the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs
had agreed to contribute half of the needed budget.</P>
      <P>As the winning design for the new opera house, created by a
Japanese architect, requires special technology and materials, city
officials said the construction cost will spike by more than NT$1.1
billion. The city government has expressed its hope that the
Executive Yuan offers more grant for the project.</P>
      <P>During a community outreach of Taichung Saturday, Su acceded to
an increase of NT$500 million in the central government's grant for
the ambitious construction project after Taichung Mayor Jason Hu made
three assurances -- the city government will be able to complete the
project smoothly, the city council fully supports the project and
there will be no more cost overruns.</P>
      <P>Su, who once served as magistrate of southernmost Pingtung County
and later magistrate of northern Taipei County, said local
governments tend to need the assistance of the central government in
carrying out mega infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>Based on his trust in Hu's administrative competence, Su said he
is more than willing to lend support for the project so that it can
be completed by 2009.</P>
      <P>With its unique architectural style, Su said he believes that the
Taichung Opera House, when completed, will become a new landmark in
Taichung and entire central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu once proposed to build a Guggenheim branch museum in Taichung,
but he was forced to drop the plan after failing to secure an
approval from the city council. Hu said the opera house project is
different from the Guggenheim museum plan and that he is confident of
obtaining the city council's consent to the new plan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Immigration (BOI) fired a
senior clerk Saturday after she was held incommunicado for further
investigation into her alleged role in facilitating the smuggling of
prostitutes from China.</P>
      <P>The BOI decided to fire Lee Jo-ling plus giving her two major
demerits after the Taipei District Court agreed to her detention on
suspicion that she had offered tips to a human trafficking ring to
facilitate the smuggling of Chinese prostitutes into Taiwan in
exchange for cash rewards.</P>
      <P>Lee was suspected of having told the human trafficking ring led
by Chung Ju-chih to have Chinese women fake pregnancy to get early
entry interview.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, investigators said, more than 80 women from
China had entered Taiwan posing as brides for Taiwanese men before
turning to prostitution. For each case, Lee allegedly received
between NT$30,000 and NT$80,000, and she is believed to have raked in
around NT$2 million in bribes.</P>
      <P>Investigators searched Lee's office and residence Friday and a
prosecutor in charge of the case applied for keeping her incustody
after an overnight questioning. The district court approved Lee's
detention in the evening. Chung and two other accomplices have also

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BECOME WORLD HUB FOR HAKKA STUDIES: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that
Taiwan is being built into an international research hub for studying
Hakka culture and history under the concerted efforts of the
government and academic sector.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the First International Conference on
Hakka Studies in Taiwan, Chen said he would see to it that the budget
for the Council for Hakka Affairs is augmented to provide more
government research grants for Hakka culture studies.</P>
      <P>President Chen said the council -- established during his first
term in office -- is the world's first Cabinet-level governmental
office dedicated exclusively to Hakka affairs.</P>
      <P>Since its inception, Chen said, the council has actively helped
rejuvenate Hakka activities in Taiwan, promoting and preserving the
Hakka dialect while bolstering Hakka studies -- which has begun to
bear fruit.</P>
      <P>He said that around the world, there are about 100 million
Hakka-speaking people scattered throughout 100 countries, but only
Taiwan has a Cabinet-level agency to preserve and promote Hakka
culture and language.</P>
      <P>Under the assistance of the Council for Hakka Affairs, the
world's first college of Hakka studies was established at National
Central University in 2003, followed by a second at National Chiao
Tung University in 2004. This year the third has been approved to be
founded within the University System of Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, three other Taiwan universities have
established graduate schools in Hakka studies, while 12
additional colleges and unversities have founded Hakka research
centers.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a country with many ethnic groups, blessing
Taiwan with their diversity, colorful traditions and flourishing
vitality, Chen said all of Taiwan's people -- regardless of whether
Hakka, indigenous, Taiwanese or "Waishengren" -- people from Chinese
mainland -- or immigrants who have recently arrived -- are the
masters of the country.</P>
      <P>The Hakka culture is also one of Taiwan's collective assets to be
shared and protected by all of Taiwan's people, Chen said, adding the
country should not only help Hakka people conserve their legacy, but
also allow others at home and abroad better understand Hakka people
and culture.</P>
      <P>The International Conference on Hakka Studies opened at the
Taipei International Convention Center Sunday with the participation
of academics and scholars from the United States, the United Kingdom,
Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference -- aimed at examining Hakka studies from a
global perspective -- is being sponsored by the College of Hakka
Studies, National Central University under the guidance of the
Council for Hakka Affairs.</P>

for residential area construction in the Pingtung Agricultural
Biotechnology Park, agency officials announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>The officials indicated that with the first stage of construction
nearly 88 percent complete on the plant for companies and research
organizations, the 233-hectare park in Pingtung County, southern
Taiwan, is now entering a development period.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that at the Council of Agriculture's request,
the CPA will invite qualified construction companies to submit
tenders for building 12 housing units in a residential area. The
estimated cost for the residential area is NT$220.61 million (US$6.63
million).</P>
      <P>Additional tenders will also be invited to provide various
service facilities in the residential area, such as electricity,
telecommunications, banking, shopping and dining, estimated at a cost

      <P>The Pingtung Agricultural Biotechnology Park is the first of its
kind in Taiwan, with the aim of helping research arms of large

    <TEXT>
      <P>Acid precipitation has worsened most in
northern Keelung City and on the outlying island of Matsu over the
past decade, according to a study by the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
.</P>
      <P>Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are
emitted into the atmosphere, undergo chemical transformations and are
absorbed by clouds. The CWB defines acid rain as rainfall with a pH
value lower than five.</P>
      <P>In the decade-long study -- using 17 weather surveillance
stations deployed around Taiwan and on the remote islets -- the CWB
found rainfall in northern and northeastern Taiwan is generally more
acidic than other regions.</P>
      <P>Precipitation is most acidic in Keelung, with the percentage of
acidic rain in annual rainfall at 71.6, they said, adding that Taipei
City comes second with 39.98 percent.</P>
      <P>As for the outlying islets, the bureau said Matsu has an annual
percentage of 47.8 and that peaks in spring at 65.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed percentages in central and southern Taiwan
are both lower than 5 percent, while eastern county of Taitung touts
the lowest percentage nationwide at 2 percent.</P>
      <P>The CWB suggested that the high acid levels in Taipei and Keelung
may be caused by the concentration of industries and automobiles
there, plus pollutants from China and northeastern Asia coming with
the winter monsoon season also worsen the situation.</P>
      <P>Matsu is influenced mostly by pollutants from China, they said.</P>

      <P>Chang Guo-bao, Director General of the MOE's Department of

      <P>More than half of Taiwan's university
students cannot correctly identify the name of Germany's chancellor
and over 60 percent have no idea which country was recently in a
conflict with Israel, according to a survey released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted on 1,200 college and university students
across Taiwan, showed only 49.6 percent could correctly identify
Germany's chancellor; 26.1 percent erroneously believed it was
Thaksin Shinawatra -- the former Thai prime minister -- and 14
percent responded Tony Blair instead of Angela Merkel.</P>
      <P>On the question of which country recently went to war with
Israel, 36 percent said Palestine, 21 percent responded Iraq, and
only 38 percent came up with the right answer of Lebanon, according
to the survey, conducted by the World Leadership Education
Foundation.</P>
      <P>What most Taiwanese students did know was that Wang Chien-ming is
a Taiwanese pitcher for the New York Yankees; 97.5 percent provided
the correct answer identifying the Taiwan-born pitcher of the famous
U.S. Major League Baseball team. Still, 1.9 percent selected "Kuo

      <P>Lin Tsai-chen, deputy director of the foundation's political and

students have a poor knowledge of contemporary world affairs.</P>
      <P>This can be attributed to two factors: Taiwan's media devote
little attention to international news reporting, and Taiwanese
students do not read the newspapers, watch news programs or even read

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of medical professionals from
Show Chwan Memorial Hospital have won the hearts and minds of the
Nauruan people after providing two rounds of free medical services in
the South Pacific island country.</P>
      <P>During the last round in Nauru from Oct. 9-22, the 11 medical
professionals, led by Show Chwan Memorial Hospital's president Ku
Ming-chow, treated scores of patients, including the wife of Nauru
President Ludwig Scotty, Ku said at a news conference held in Taipei
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ku said the Nauruan first lady had complained of experiencing
dizzy spells and light-headedness for many years, but had never had
the problem addressed.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chuang Pi-kun examined the Nauruan first lady and diagnosed
that she had chronic tympanitis, which could be traced back to a
common cold she had in childhood.</P>
      <P>Chuang determined surgery to be the only solution for Mrs.
Scotty's suffering and suggested the first lady travel to
Taiwan for the procedure.</P>
      <P>One of the group's pediatricians became an overnight sensation in
Nauru after performing life-saving surgery on a two-month-old
infant whose hernia had reached a critical point, rescuing the
child from the verge of death, said Ku.</P>
      <P>According to Ku, Nauru is the world's third smallest country in
terms of territory and population. There is only one hospital on the
island, and only three doctors.</P>
      <P>The Nauru Hospital referred a total of 40 patients to Australia
and Fiji for treatment last year, at a loss of NT$10 million
(US$300,000) to the Nauruan government, Ku said.</P>
      <P>Ku said the Changhua-based Show Chwan Memorial Hospital first
became committed to dispatching medical professionals to Nauru
and helping Nauruan patients seek treatment in Taiwan after the
hospital formed sister ties with Nauru Hospital.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Show Chwan will help raise public health
standards in Nauru and train Nauru's own medical professionals,
allowing them to become medically independent, Ku added.</P>
      <P>The Show Chwan medical team -- which includes gynecologists,
obstetricians, surgeons and orthopedists -- first visited Nauru in
September this year to provide free medical attention through the
International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) -- a spin-off
organization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Under a medical aid project initiated by the ministry in

    <HEADLINE>ENTREPRENEURS BETTER LEADERS THAN POLITICIANS IN STUDENTS' MINDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When asked "Who is the best leader? " most
university students in Taiwan think of wealthy entrepreneurs such as
Wang Yung-ching and Kuo Tai-ming rather than any politicians, both
past and present.</P>
      <P>According to a survey of 1,200 college and university students
across Taiwan, Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching is the
No. 1 hero in their minds, followed by Honhai Group's Kuo Tai-ming
and Bill Gates, who founded Microsoft Corp.</P>
      <P>Fourth on their list of best leaders was opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou. By contrast, President Chen Shui-bian
was much further down the list.</P>
      <P>The World Leadership Education Foundation asked the students to
write down one name only for "best leader." Wang received 273 votes,
Kuo had 252 and Bill Gates was nominated by 185 students.</P>
      <P>Ma ranked after three job- and wealth-creating entrepreneurs to
become the No. 4 "best leader" in the eyes of Taiwan's university
students -- and the "No. 1" politician.</P>
      <P>The fifth place went to Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., with 144 votes. Sixth place went
to another politician who is no longer alive -- Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the
founding father of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Dr. Sun was one vote ahead of Master Sheng Yen, founder of the
Dharma Drum (Buddhist) Foundation, who won 108 votes and ranked
seventh.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,200 "voters, " only 32 cast a ballot for President Chen
Shui-bian for the title of "best leader, " and three for Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>As for the most important characteristic of a good leader, 25
percent cited "far-sightedness, " 21 percent responded "competency, "
17 percent most esteemed "trustworthiness, " and 13 percent said an
"ability to implement policies" is the most important trait.</P>
      <P>Professor Sheng Chih-jen of Soochow University said that in a
normal democracy, government leaders are always very high on the list
of "best leader."</P>
      <P>The results of the survey apparently indicate that Taiwan's
political leaders, especially those in the ruling party, do not
possess characteristics that students think "the best leader" must
have.</P>
      <P>Hung Hsiu-chu, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislator, said
the results show Taiwan's students are very pragmatic -- they prefer
wealth-creating enterpreneurs to politicians, and politicians of the
past are not on their minds unless they performed outstandingly.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that over 60 percent of Taiwan's university
students, who are 18 years and older, do not agree with the idea of
lowering the voting age to 18 from 20.</P>
      <P>A 19-year-old participant in Sunday's press conference announcing
the poll results said people under 20 may not be mature enough to
make a sound choice in elections and he supports maintaining the
existing system of granting voting rights to people 20 years and
older.</P>
      <P>Professor Sheng said this shows a majority of college and
university students realize a voter should be responsible for his or
her choices for candidate, an attitude that shows they're actually
mature enough to vote and one that should be adopted by "adults."</P>

areas to offer assistance every year. This year, he added, the club
chose to donate books to schoolchildren in the border area of
Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that giving books is one of the most meaningful acts,
hoping the donation will meet the goal of making books accessible to
the schoolchildren and further encouraging them to read.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the project was initiated by the Field Relief
Agency, a Taiwan charity group which for years has been working to
help homeless children in Cambodia.</P>
      <P>A total of 6,000 textbooks were donated to the 68 Cambodian
schools, and the books will be reused by other schoolchildren in
future.</P>
      <P>"The Cambodian kids were delighted by the donation. They looked
at the books and stationery as if they had received this year's
Christmas presents early," Tsai said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo hosted a series of
activities Sunday in celebration of its 20th anniversary of
relocating from Yuanshan in downtown Taipei to suburban Muzha.</P>
      <P>The events included a birthday party, an open-air concert and
many other conservation-related activities.</P>
      <P>While cutting a cake and distributing slices to hundreds of
tourists at the birthday party, Taipei Zoo director Chen Pao-chung
said the zoo not only provides an excellent venue for educating the
public on environmental awareness and wildlife conservation, but
serves as a popular recreational spot.</P>
      <P>The zoo will move forward with its goals of "respecting life,
caring for nature" in future, he said, expressing hope the public
would also strive to protect animals and the environment.</P>
      <P>A 70-year-old volunteer who has served at the zoo for more than
16 years said that since the zoo's 1986 relocation to Muzha, the
method of tending for the animals has made great progress -- from
fences in the early stages to larger and more beneficial habitats.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that people who have taken photos at the zoo are
invited to send their photos as part of the anniversary celebrations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 52nd conference of the Asian Pacific
League for Freedom and Democracy (APLFD) issued a communique at its
closing session Sunday calling for Taiwan's full inclusion in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>In the communique, the APLFD said continued international
attention should be devoted to peace in the Taiwan Strait in view of
Taiwan's key role in the democratization of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Arguing that "Taiwan should be admitted into the United
Nations," it called on the international community to help Taiwan
obtain full membership in the World Health Organization and other
international organizations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a proven and viable democracy deserving of such
support," it read.</P>
      <P>The league condemned the action of North Korea in conducting
nuclear testing, urged a peaceful resolution to the disturbing
situation in Iraq, and expressed grave concern with situations in
Thailand, Laos, Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Myanmar.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS PROCUREMENT HINGES ON TAIWAN'S NEEDS, REASONABLE COST: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether a proposed defense procurement bill
passes in the legislature should depend on whether the items fulfil
Taiwan's urgent needs and whether the pricetag is reasonable, James
Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party (PFP) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Soong, who is currently on leave from the PFP chairmanship to run
in the year-end Taipei mayoral election as an independent, reiterated
his party's position that the PFP does not object to military
procurement, but only opposes buying weapons at extravagant prices.</P>
      <P>He criticized the United States for not selling Taiwan the
sophisticated weapons that it really needs. Citing one example, he
said instead of selling Taiwan Aegis-class battleships, the U.S.
government was only willing to sell four Kidd-class destroyers that
had been mothballed for 20 years.</P>
      <P>Soong was also critical of the PFP's "pan-blue" ally -- the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- for vacillating on the issue.</P>
      <P>He said if the KMT wanted to let the military procurement budget
bill pass in the legislature it should not expect the PFP's
cooperation, although there is nothing the PFP could do to stop it
from doing so. He acknowledged the KMT could easily pass the
bill by working with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, because
at present the KMT holds the majority in the legislature with 89
seats.</P>
      <P>Soong stressed the PFP's position on weapons procurement will
not change despite a public statement by Stephen Young, the
Taipei Office director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), at
a press conference three days ago, warning that if Taiwan does not
pass the legislation by November, it may miss the last opportunity
for a weapons deal with the United States.</P>
      <P>The AIT is a semi-official organization that handles relations
with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Noting the Bush administration backed Young's statement and
warned that Taiwan could "inherit a mess of a government with the
U.S.-Taiwan relationship in a downward spiral" if it continues to
ignore its national security, Soong said such remarks are "simply
nonsense."</P>
      <P> "The relationship between Taiwan and the United States
has been a mess ever since the United States abandoned Taiwan and
severed diplomatic relations with it in 1979," Soong said.</P>
      <P>Soong said that during a visit to the United States, American
officials had agreed with him that China is unlikely to use force
against Taiwan as long as Taiwan does not seek de jure independence.</P>
      <P>He added that it is important for Taiwan to refrain from seeking
de jure independence if it wants to ensure its national security.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP BIGWIGS THROW FULL WEIGHT BEHIND DPP KAOHSIUNG MAYOR NOMINEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) heavyweights such as Vice President Annette Lu and
Premier Su Tseng-chang threw their full weight behind the party's
nominee for Kaohsiung mayor, Chen Chu, as polls indicated rising
support for Chen Sunday.</P>
      <P>All of the party's so-called "four bigwigs" -- Lu, Su, Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- and the party's seven
county magistrates and city mayors in southern Taiwan stood beside
Chen in a ceremony marking the launch of her campaign headquarters.</P>
      <P>Lu said Chen's win will not only mean women have finally "come
ahead" in Taiwan society, but will also provide a critical impetus
for the DPP to continue ruling Taiwan in 2008.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former labor minister who is running on the theme of
"Taiwan's values lie in Kaohsiung, " agreed that the southern port
city's government must remain in the DPP hands so the party will have
a fighting chance for the 2008 presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Having incumbent Acting Mayor Yeh Chu-lan working as her campaign
manager, Chen said if elected, she will build an efficient
transportation network, protect workers' rights and interests,
cooperate with neighboring counties and increase benefits for senior
citizens.</P>
      <P>"We certainly will stage a most successful 2009 World Games to
benefit Kaohisung economically and to raise the city's international
profile, " she said, promising to "extend the DPP's administrative
glory" in the city.</P>
      <P>Su said he will give Chen "two big red envelopes" in the form of
an underground railway project and an international trade and
conference center project, both of which require a capital of more
than NT$50 billion.</P>
      <P>"I urge the voters to continue to support a party which really
cares about Kaohsiung's development so that the DPP's excellent
administrative performance will be continued here," Su said.</P>
      <P>Yu, who is leading a party whose morale has been hit by a string
of corruption scandals, admitted some party members have been
involved in "illegal" incidents but he promised to launch a "major
reform" of the party.</P>
      <P>He then turn to the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou, lambasting Ma for presiding over a "super corrupt
structure" that has over the past two years sold the party's assets
for NT$25 billion.</P>
      <P>Yu also criticized the KMT's candidate, Huang Chun-ying, for
being a "nearly 70 years old" man with no vitality and no creativity
-- "old wine in the KMT's new bottle" who, Yu claimed, must be
stopped from regaining power for the opposition party.</P>
      <P>Besides comparing Huang's senile image to Chen's being much
younger (50-plus) and much more energetic, Yu also described Huang as
an "incompetent and untalented" man packaged by the KMT as "one among
its political elite."</P>
      <P>Yu said a DPP poll shows that Chen's support rate has risen to a
level near that for Huang and is rising, while the trend indicates
support for Huang is falling.</P>
      <P>KMT's Ma, who was chairing a party meeting in Kaohisung,
acknowledged it has become a close race between Huang and Chen, as
media reported that his party's poll indicated Chen is less than five
percent away from Huang.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a former mayor of Kaohsiung now running for Taipei mayor,
moved his campaign to his old turf by contrasting his "grand
achievements in cleaning Love River" in Kaohsing and Ma's "poor
record in cleaning Danshui River" in Taipei -- a contrast that Hsieh
claimed shows the KMT is a party with "no ability to rule and no
courage to govern."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO RE-INTRODUCE ARMS PROCUREMENT BILL TUESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) vowed Sunday that despite a setback last week, it would try
once again to get an arms procurement bill on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ker Chien-ming, convener of the DPP's legislative
caucus, said he hoped Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), would be held accountable for promising his
party's support for a "reasonable" arms procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Ker said the DPP would mobilize all its members on the Procedure
Committee to get the bill on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>Proposed legislation to buy diesel-powered submarines,
submarine-hunting aircraft and Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries
from the United States has been blocked 61 times from getting on the
agenda in the past five years by opposition parties, which hold a
slight majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung said that failure to pass the
long-stalled bill was detrimental to the Taiwan-U.S. relationship,
and that opposition parties should not use spurious excuses to 
prevent the bill's passage, but instead consider the
legislation based purely on Taiwan's military and strategic needs.</P>
      <P>Lee also said he disagreed with the KMT chairman's remarks that
negotiation on the arms procurement bill should be shelved until all
sides calm down after a controversial public statement last week
by Stephen Young, the Taipei Office director of the American
Institute in Taiwan, demanding that Taiwan's legislature pass the
budget bill by November's end.</P>
      <P>The reason Ma gave was "only a new excuse" for stalling the arms
procurement bill, Lee said, adding that he was bored with such
excuses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>22 SENIOR CHINESE CIVIL AVIATION OFFICIALS TO VISIT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-level delegation of civil aviation
officials from China is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Nov. 8 for a
week-long visit, the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) announced
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 22-member delegation will be led by Gao Hongfeng, a deputy
director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation will include CAAC division chiefs in
charge of air transportation, airport management, North China and
East China aviation management, as well as senior executives of the
six Chinese carriers that have joined non-stop cross-Taiwan Strait
charter flight services during the Lunar New Year and Mid-Autumn
festivals.</P>
      <P>Their visit is primarily a goodwill exchange, a TAA spokesman
said, adding that the six Taiwan airline companies will take turns
hosting the Chinese aviation officials during their stay.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, Chinese civil aviation officials and
airline executives have been inviting their Taiwanese counterparts to
visit Beijing every year for Lunar New Year holiday social functions.</P>
      <P>Besides attending a half-day seminar on commercial airline
management, the Chinese delegation will visit major tourist
attractions in central and northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to TAA sources, the association's invitation also
included Pu Zhaozhou, director of the CAAC's Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macau Affairs Office, but the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which
charts Taiwan's policy toward China, didn't approve Pu's visa
application.</P>
      <P>Pu has been a key figure in cross-strait talks on opening regular
cross-strait charter flight services. As no progress has been made in
this regard, the sources said, the MAC would not like to see Pu visit
Taiwan at this moment, which MAC officials said could spark unwanted
speculation about charter flight negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT VOWS TO 'OUST CORRUPT DPP' IN KAOHSIUNG RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate
for Kaohsiung mayor Huang Chun-ying pledged Sunday that if elected,
he would lead a "clean, diligent and efficient" team to "create
happiness and prosperity for Kaohsiung citizens."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony to launch his new campaign headquarters,
Huang said he will be running not on the main rival's reputation of
corruption but on the KMT's ability to govern.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou elaborated on Huang's veiled accusation
against Chen Chu, a former labor minister now running on the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ticket, by claiming that Chen's
policy of not importing foreign workers was abolished after
intervention by "the powers that be."</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to the corruption scandal surrounding the
Kaohsiung rapid transit system, in which several senior Kaohsiung
city government officials were indicted, along with a former senior
aide to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>He said the Dec. 9 municipal elections, for which the DPP has
nominated two senior officials suspected of involvement in the
Kaohsiung rapid transit scandal, are a race between "integrity" and
"greed," an election that must see the ruling DPP candidates defeated
so they will "examine themselves frankly."</P>
      <P>"Let's pray to God: Give us a mayor who will not be involved
in a corruption scandal," Ma said, also referring to the DPP's Taipei
mayor candidate, former Kaohsiung mayor and former premier Frank
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Huang's campaign manager, former economics minister and KMT Vice
Chairman P.K. Chiang, called on Kaohsiung voters to examine the DPP's
track record over the past six years of "economic decline" and
"turning an economic miracle into economic crisis."</P>
      <P>What have been rising are suicide rates and unemployment rates,
Chiang claimed.</P>
      <P>"Even more intolerable is that the ruling elite have fattened
their pockets at the general public's expense," he added.</P>
      <P>Also on hand to show support for Huang were Legislative Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng, former Kaohsiung mayor Wu Dun-yi, KMT Legislator Chiu
Yi and People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chang Hsien-yao.</P>
      <P>Huang's primary school teacher Cheng Yu-hui came from Yunlin
to Kaohsiung to give his blessings to his beloved "model student"
Huang.</P>
      <P>Cheng said it was "the greatest moment" in his life to have the
honor of placing a ribbon on Huang's shoulder. This is Huang's second
bid for the mayoral post; he lost to Frank Hsieh during the last
Kaohsiung mayor election.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The deputy head of the Bureau of
Immigration (BOI) was given a reprimand Sunday after a senior clerk
was detained a day earlier on suspicion of collaborating with a
snakehead ring that smuggled Chinese prostitutes into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>BOI Deputy Director Wu Hsueh-yen was disciplined over the
suspected misconduct of Lee Jo-ling, a BOI clerk who was fired
shortly after she was taken into custody Saturday over alleged
collaboration with human trafficking gangsters.</P>
      <P>Lee was accused of taking bribes from the snakehead ring led by
Chung Chih-ju to let about 80 Chinese women into Taiwan by having
them pretend to be local men's pregnant wives. The women were
apparently smuggled for prostitution, investigators said. Chung and
two other ring members have also been held incommunicado.</P>
      <P>According to a BOI news release issued late evening, Lee's direct
superior Chao Kuang-chung -- a public relations section chief -- was
given two demerits and her another superior, Ho Sen-kuei, director of
the BOI administration affairs, was demoted to a secretarial post
plus a demerit.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office ordered a search of Lee's office,
her home and 17 brothels run by the snakehead ring Friday.
Investigators said more than 80 women from China had entered Taiwan
posing as brides for Taiwanese men before turning to prostitution.
For each case, Lee allegedly received between NT$30,000 and
NT$80,000. She faces a minimum five-year prison term if convicted of
corruption charges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>22 SENIOR CHINESE CIVIL AVIATION OFFICIALS TO VISIT TAIWAN(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-level delegation of civil aviation
officials from China is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Nov. 8 for a
week-long visit, the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) announced
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The 22-member delegation will be led by Gao Hongfeng, a deputy
director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation will include CAAC division chiefs in
charge of air transportation, airport management, North China and
East China aviation management, as well as senior executives of the
six Chinese carriers that have joined non-stop cross-Taiwan Strait
charter flight services during the Lunar New Year and Mid-Autumn
festivals.</P>
      <P>Their visit is primarily a goodwill exchange, a TAA spokesman
said, adding that the six Taiwan airline companies will take turns
hosting the Chinese aviation officials during their stay.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, Chinese civil aviation officials and
airline executives have been inviting their Taiwanese counterparts to
visit Beijing every year for Lunar New Year holiday social functions.</P>
      <P>Besides attending a half-day seminar on commercial airline
management, the Chinese delegation will visit major tourist
attractions in central and northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to TAA sources, the association's invitation also
included Pu Zhaozhou, director of the CAAC's Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macau Affairs Office, but the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which
charts Taiwan's policy toward China, didn't approve Pu's visa
application.</P>
      <P>Pu has been a key figure in cross-strait talks on opening regular
cross-strait charter flight services. As no progress has been made in
this regard, the sources said, the MAC would not like to see Pu visit
Taiwan at this moment, which MAC officials said could spark unwanted
speculation about charter flight negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT VOWS TO 'OUST CORRUPT DPP' IN KAOHSIUNG RACE(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate
for Kaohsiung mayor Huang Chun-ying pledged Sunday that if elected,
he would lead a "clean, diligent and efficient" team to "create
happiness and prosperity for Kaohsiung citizens."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony to launch his new campaign headquarters,
Huang said he will be running not on the main rival's reputation of
corruption but on the KMT's ability to govern.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou elaborated on Huang's veiled accusation
against Chen Chu, a former labor minister now running on the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ticket, by claiming that Chen's
policy of not importing foreign workers was abolished after
intervention by "the powers that be."</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to the corruption scandal surrounding the
Kaohsiung rapid transit system, in which several senior Kaohsiung
city government officials were indicted, along with a former senior
aide to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>He said the Dec. 9 municipal elections, for which the DPP has
nominated two senior officials suspected of involvement in the
Kaohsiung rapid transit scandal, are a race between "integrity" and
"greed," an election that must see the ruling DPP candidates defeated
so they will "examine themselves frankly."</P>
      <P>"Let's pray to God: Give us a mayor who will not be involved
in a corruption scandal," Ma said, also referring to the DPP's Taipei
mayor candidate, former Kaohsiung mayor and former premier Frank
Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Huang's campaign manager, former economics minister and KMT Vice
Chairman P.K. Chiang, called on Kaohsiung voters to examine the DPP's
track record over the past six years of "economic decline" and
"turning an economic miracle into economic crisis."</P>
      <P>What have been rising are suicide rates and unemployment rates,
Chiang claimed.</P>
      <P>"Even more intolerable is that the ruling elite have fattened
their pockets at the general public's expense," he added.</P>
      <P>Also on hand to show support for Huang were Legislative Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng, former Kaohsiung mayor Wu Dun-yi, KMT Legislator Chiu
Yi and People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chang Hsien-yao.</P>
      <P>Huang's primary school teacher Cheng Yu-hui came from Yunlin
to Kaohsiung to give his blessings to his beloved "model student"
Huang.</P>
      <P>Cheng said it was "the greatest moment" in his life to have the
honor of placing a ribbon on Huang's shoulder. This is Huang's second
bid for the mayoral post; he lost to Frank Hsieh during the last
Kaohsiung mayor election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOI DEPUTY HEAD DISCIPLINED FOR FIRED CLERK'S ALLEGED BRIBE-TAKING(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The deputy head of the Bureau of
Immigration (BOI) was given a reprimand Sunday after a senior clerk
was detained a day earlier on suspicion of collaborating with a
snakehead ring that smuggled Chinese prostitutes into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>BOI Deputy Director Wu Hsueh-yen was disciplined over the
suspected misconduct of Lee Jo-ling, a BOI clerk who was fired
shortly after she was taken into custody Saturday over alleged
collaboration with human trafficking gangsters.</P>
      <P>Lee was accused of taking bribes from the snakehead ring led by
Chung Chih-ju to let about 80 Chinese women into Taiwan by having
them pretend to be local men's pregnant wives. The women were
apparently smuggled for prostitution, investigators said. Chung and
two other ring members have also been held incommunicado.</P>
      <P>According to a BOI news release issued late evening, Lee's direct
superior Chao Kuang-chung -- a public relations section chief -- was
given two demerits and her another superior, Ho Sen-kuei, director of
the BOI administration affairs, was demoted to a secretarial post
plus a demerit.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's Office ordered a search of Lee's office,
her home and 17 brothels run by the snakehead ring Friday.
Investigators said more than 80 women from China had entered Taiwan
posing as brides for Taiwanese men before turning to prostitution.
For each case, Lee allegedly received between NT$30,000 and
NT$80,000. She faces a minimum five-year prison term if convicted of
corruption charges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PEACE IS NOT FREE': PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Quoting an inscription on the Korean War
Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., President Chen Shui-bian said
Monday in a video conference with prominent Japanese political and
academic figures that "freedom is not free, " adding his own words
that "peace in not free either."</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States expects Taiwan's legislature to
approve the long-stalled arms procurement bill this autumn at a time
when the military balance in the Taiwan Strait has tilted in China's
favor according to a 2005 Pentagon report on China's military
build-up, Chen said maintaining peace with China "cannot be done for
free."</P>
      <P>A peace accord "is only a sheet of empty words that can easily be
torn up" if either of the signatory countries does not have a solid
defense capability to back it up, Chen asserted.</P>
      <P>The president's words were seen as a response to a proposal put
forward by opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou in a recent
interview with foreign media that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
could sign a peace accord in which Taiwan promises not to declare
independence and China renounces the option of the use of force
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting another report released recently by the U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission, President Chen said China is
expected to complete the deployment of several major advanced weapon
systems by 2008, adding that there will be a dangerous military
imbalance for seven years before U.S. counterbalance forces against
China can be established in the region by 2015.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that these warnings do not only apply to Taiwan but
also to other countries neighboring China, including Japan.</P>
      <P>Quoting the inscription on the Korean War Veterans Memorial in
the U.S. capital, Chen said that "freedom requires blood and tears to
defend," adding that the same principle applies to maintaining peace.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that Taiwan has been living under a constant
military threat from China for over half a century and that
therefore, nobody in the world has a stronger desire for peace than
do the Taiwan people, noting</P>
      <P>The greatest obstacle to cross-strait peace currently is China's
totalitarian regime, Chen said, adding that overcoming this obstacle
is a task for all the peace-loving countries of the world to face and
tackle.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that Taiwan will keep its promise to maintain
adequate defense capabilities and to strive to maintain the status
quo across the Taiwan Strait. He also appealed to the international
community to face the reality of the cross-Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>Prominent Japanese figures who attended Monday's video conference
included Japanese lawmakers Takeo Hiranuma, Shouichi Nakagawa and
Motohisa Ikeda, as well as Jun Nishikawa, a professor with Waseda
University in Tokyo and Mineo Nakajima, president of Akita

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR MULTILATERAL MECHANISM FOR TAIWAN STRAIT SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called on the
international community Monday to pay more attention to potential
military threats to the Taiwan Strait and proposed a "multilateral
dialogue mechanism" similar to the six-way talks on North Korea.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a teleconference between Taipei and Tokyo, Chen
suggested that Japan legislate its version of the Taiwan Relations
Act -- based on which the United States has since 1979 helped Taiwan
defend itself against China's military threats -- before establishing
a triangular security mechanism involving Taiwan, Japan and the U.S.</P>
      <P>He cited Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent visits to
China and South Korea as an example of shedding minor differences for
the sake of the greater common good.</P>
      <P>Chen said a good lesson to be drawn from Abe's visits to the two
neighboring countries is that differences can be put aside out of
"sincerity, goodwill and mutual respect."</P>
      <P>If Japan and China can set aside minor differences to seek common
ground, "then I believe the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can also
keep their differences in abeyance and resume dialogue without any
preconditions," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Claiming that improved Sino-Japanese ties will not affect
Taiwan's interests, the president noted that while Taiwan is watching
the power struggle inside China, it is more concerned about whether
China is experiencing a "democratic and peaceful rise" or a
"hegemonistic and militaristic rise."</P>
      <P>Lauding Japan's contribution to fighting terrorism after the
Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S., Chen said the world
community has increased its respect for Japan, who has beyond doubt
become a leader of the international community.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has paid close attention to Japan's proposals for
integrating East Asian economies and conducting joint studies on
Asian economies, in the hope that it can do its share in helping
promote economic prosperity in the region.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan and Japan not only form "the best
alliance in democratic values and regional security, " but also "the
best alliance in economics and trade."</P>
      <P>While hoping to sign a free trade agreement (FTA) with Japan, the
president said he knows it will not be an easy task for the short
term and suggested signing an investment guarantee pact and promoting
an "economic partnership agreement" before reaching an FTA.</P>
      <P>Nearly 100 Japanese academics and politicians and Taiwan
officials based in Japan attended the teleconference in Tokyo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SUSPENDS MILITARY EXCHANGES WITH TAIWAN: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has suspended military
exchange programs with Taiwan as a retaliatory move against Taiwan
legislature's boycott of the passage of a long-stalled arms
procurement bill, Defense Minister Lee Jye said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon has not only shelved Taiwan's new order for a batch
of F16 jet fighters, it has also notified military agencies,
including the Bureau of Armament and Acquisition, in written notices
recently that all personnel exchanges and meetings between the two
sides are suspended, Lee said at a Legislative Yuan Defense Committee
meeting.</P>
      <P>The U.S. defense authorities said in the notices that the
suspension will be reviewed only after they learn of development
concerning Taiwan legislature's passage of the long-stalled defense
budget and various arms procurement packages, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee said the criticism lodged by some opposition legislators
against American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office Director Stephen
Young over Young's remarks made last week concerning the passage of
an arms procurement bill has made the life of the Ministry of
National Defense harder.</P>
      <P>In a recent news conference in Taipei, Young claimed that the
U.S. is the "only country" willing to help Taiwan with arms sales
according to Taiwan's defensive needs. "Taiwan needs to pass the
robust defense budget, which will increase from 2.5 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP) this year to 3 percent in 2008, in the
legislative session this autumn," Young said.</P>
      <P>Young expressed disappointment at what he described as a
situation in which "some politicians are using Taiwan's long-term
survival as if it is a chip to be used for political gambling."</P>
      <P>Urging Taiwan to take immediate action to deal with the arms
procurement budget, Young described this autumn as a "critical
turning point."</P>
      <P>"The U.S.-Taiwan relationship will not remain as it is. It will
either go up or it will go down. It will definitely not stay
constant," Young warned.</P>
      <P>Quoting another senior U.S. official as saying recently that
Taiwan could "inherit a mess of a government with the U.S.-Taiwan
relationship in a downward spiral if Taiwan continues to ignore its
national security" in a gesture of support to Young for his recent
remarks, Lee said a "downward spiral" in U.S.-Taiwan relations will
certainly not serve Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>Lee denied that the arms procurement bill -- initiated by the
former ruling Kuomintang and covering diesel-powered submarines,
submarine-hunting aircraft and Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries
-- was a "cash-for-friendship" policy, claiming that the weapons are
essential in terms of beefing up Taiwan's defense capacity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TALKS ON CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS HAVE NOT STOPPED: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiations on cross-Taiwan Strait cargo
and passenger charter flight services are slow, but they have not
stopped, the nation's top China policy charter said Monday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made the
remarks in a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan when
asked if negotiations on the cross-strait charter flight services
have stopped and full opening to tourists from China has been delayed.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the "negotiations are somewhat stalled, but they
have not stopped."</P>
      <P>Wu noted that since Taipei and Beijing announced simultaneously
in mid-June measures with regard to four kinds of cross-strait
charter flight services, including the launch of special charter
cargo flights and making cross-strait charter passenger flights for
holidays such as Chinese New Year, Tomb Sweeping Day, Dragon Boat
Festival and Mid-autumn Festival a regular occurrence, no new
proposals or stances have been announced.</P>
      <P>He said the negotiations have not stopped and that "although
there are no formal negotiations, " both sides have continued to
exchange views.</P>
      <P>Wu said there is no change from his earlier statement that he
"hopes to realize the full opening to Chinese tourists by the end of
this year, " but pointed out that if it is China that is stalling,
then "the responsibility is not on our side."</P>
      <P>He noted that a visit by Zhang Xiqin, a deputy director of
China's National Tourism Administration, was arranged through
bilateral communications. Zhang will lead a large delegation to
Taiwan to take part in the 2006 Taipei International Travel Fair
scheduled for Nov. 3-6, and might contact related agencies while in
Taiwan, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wu also said measures to strengthen regulations on Chinese
tourists have borne fruit, noting that only 29 Chinese tourists have
overstayed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan opens up fully to Chinese tourists, the number of
visa overstayers can be kept to a minimum if Beijing is rigorous in
its screening process, he added.</P>
      <P>Opposition Legislator David Huang of the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union claimed that a call for regular cross-strait charter
flight services on weekends would become "de facto direct
cross-strait links" and said the government should not give in on
this point.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the duration of the holiday charter services
will be 14 days before and after Chinese New Year's Day and seven
days before and after Tomb Sweeping Festival, Dragon Boat Festival
and Mid-Autumn Festival, and if there are weekend charter flight
services, more than 200 days of the year will have direct
cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that regular cross-strait charter flights were one of
the hotly debated issues in a recent national economic development
conference, adding that the issue will need more discussion before
the government makes its stance known.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2007 TIME FOR RE-ENGINEERING CONSTITUTION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Ming-chu Yang and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Claiming that "nothing is impossible under
the sky, " President Chen Shui-bian told a teleconference from Taipei
Monday that constitutional re-engineering will become "a vogue" in
Taiwan next year and that "it's absolutely not a dream to help
deliver a new Constitution for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in reply to a Japanese reporter who said
the president has said he will bring a new Constitution to Taiwan by
2008, and yet little progress has been made.</P>
      <P>Chen said that several drafts or versions of a new Constitution
have been prepared. After the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung and Taipei municipal
elections, 2007 should be a great opportunity for reforming the
Constitution, when discussing the matter will become "fashionable, "
he claimed.</P>
      <P>He noted that any amendment to the Constitution must be approved
by a national referendum -- a resolution adopted by an ad hoc
National Assembly June 6, 2005.</P>
      <P>The law raises a high hurdle to amending the Constitution: it
must first be proposed by a quarter of the legislators and then pass
a three-quarters vote in a legislative meeting attended by more than
three-quarters of the legislators.</P>
      <P>Following that, the amendment proposal must be approved by a
referendum in which more than half of all eligible voters -- not just
those who cast their ballots in the referendum -- agree with the
proposal.</P>
      <P>In spite of the difficulty in amending the Constitution, Chen
said last year saw the National Assembly abolished, people's right to
referendum enshrined in the Constitution, and the number of
legislative seats almost halved, with a "single-member constituency,
two-vote system" adopted for legislative elections.</P>
      <P>As to whether Taiwan should adopt a Japanese-style Cabinet system
or an American-style presidential system of government, Chen said
this is an "important and urgent issue for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He said all politicians must bow in front of "people power " and
that inducing the birth of a new Constitution for Taiwan "absolutely
is not a dream."</P>

    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  China,  Oct.  30 (CNA)
(By Kuo Mei-lan &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan bananas are expected to
enter the market in Shanghai next week at an estimated price of four
yuan (US$0.50) per kilogram, an executive of a Shanghai fruit trading
company said Monday.</P>
      <P>A shipment of 72 tons of bananas from Taiwan arrived in Shanghai
Sunday and after passing through customs examinations and quarantine,
the fruit will be likely available in one week after, the executive
said.</P>
      <P>He said the bananas will be sold at more than two yuan per catty
-- a weight measure used in China that is approximately equal to half
a kilogram -- double the price of bananas grown in Nanhai, southern
China, and equivalent to the price for bananas from the Philippines
and Ecuador.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan banana export was part of an agreement reached Oct. 22
between Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and Beijing's Communist
Party of China (CPC) to help Taiwanese farmers facing a glut in the
local market.</P>
      <P>Banana prices in Taiwan took a nosedive over the past weeks as a
result of rampant overproduction, with wholesale prices plummeting to
below NT$5 (US$0.15) per kilo.</P>
      <P>In the latest KMT-CPC meeting in the Chinese city of Xiamen, the
CPC agreed to buy up to 2,000 tons of Taiwan's excess banana supply
at NT$10 per kilogram.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou reiterated Monday that the KMT's stance on supporting the
passage of a NT$6.3 billion supplementary budget to beef up the
country's defense capacity remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Ma said the KMT legislative caucus will review the NT$6.3 billion
supplementary budget -- covering NT$200 million for a submarine
feasibility assessment, NT$1.7 billion for P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft in the first year, NT$3.7 billion for the upgrading of
Patriot II missiles, and NT$700 million for building an airstrip on
Taiping Island in the Spratly archipelago -- which is expected to be
put on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan Procedure Committee for
debate Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma's remarks scotched rumors that the KMT and its ally, the
opposition People First Party, will move to have the NT$6.3 billion
budget plan shelved in Tuesday's procedure.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Chin-lung, a party whip of the KMT legislative
caucus, said the KMT has resolutely opposed the original NT$610.8
billion special budget proposal for the arms purchases from the
United States drawn up in 2004, but that its determination to support
"rational and pragmatic" arms procurements remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>In related news, Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, denied that he
had instigated the awarding of a utilization license to a Taipei
Water Department (TWD) building that has been under construction for
three years so that he can use it as the location for a "Ma Ying-jeou
Institute" that he plans to found.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chiu Chuang-Chin
and Taipei City Councilor Chou Wei-you charged in a news conference
Monday that Ma has taken steps to enable the shabbily built TWD
building to be inaugurated despite construction flaws and defects so
that he can have a place to help realize his ambition to establish
his own institute like one founded by former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has posted
its position paper on the party's assets on the Web for public
examination, an official of the main opposition party said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Che-shen, deputy KMT secretary-general, also said that in
addition to listing the legal basis of its assets, the party has
published the progress of its handling of the controversial assets,
as well as the balance sheet of its Central Investment Holding Co.</P>
      <P>He refuted a local newspaper's report that the KMT was
debt-ridden in the 1970 but has since amassed tens of billions of
dollars in party assets, showing that "the party has funneled money
from the national coffers into the party coffers."</P>
      <P>Chang said the purported balance sheet carried by that
newspaper is actually the party's estimated revenues and expenses for
that year and the shortage between them, adding that the KMT's assets
in that year were not in the red.</P>
      <P>The KMT's move came in the wake of a party assets bill being

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has decided to
send Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), to act as his envoy to this year's
informal leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum, an aide to the president said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liu Shih-fang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said the president expressed to the envoy from Vietnam Hoang
Van Dung that he would like to go himself, but he understood the
difficulties of the host country due to pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The president told Hoang, APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC)
chairman, that as a formal member of APEC, Taiwan should enjoy the
same rights and obligations as other members and that he would like
to attend very much, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the president was positive about Chang's
achievements in the high-tech sector and especially his research and
development in the semiconductor sector.</P>
      <P>Chang's participation in the APEC summit will be accepted by
Taiwan as well as by other Asian countries, she added. </P>
      <P>The APEC summit will be held in Hanoi Nov. 18-19 and reports had
said that Vietnam, under pressure from China, had been unable to send
an envoy to Taiwan to deliver the invitation.</P>
      <P>However, Hoang delivered the invitation to the president on
behalf of the Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet Monday. </P>
      <P>Hoang expressed his appreciation for Taiwan's support for
Vietnam's bid for World Trade Organization and APEC membership.</P>
      <P>Saying that past Taiwan representatives have made contributions
to previous APEC meetings, he expressed the hope that the
representative this year will follow past practice and avoid sparking
protests by the third countries for political reasons.</P>
      <P> APEC is one of the few international organizations that admit
both Taipei and Beijing. Because of Beijing's opposition, the
Republic of China's head of state has been unable to attend previous
APEC annual informal leadership meetings and has instead had to name
a proxy to attend on his behalf. Lin Hsin-i, a senior adviser to the
president and former vice premier, attended the 2005 APEC summit in
Busan, South Korea.

the suspicion he has taken bribes from bankers seeking advice in
their plans to merge other banking institutions.</P>

discussed include the new social relevance of museums, different
types and roles of museums, and the local, regional and national
identity of museums.</P>
      <P>A total of 40 theses by 24 scholars will be presented at the
three-day conference, which Hsiao Tsung-huang, director of the
National Taiwan Museum, described as "a great opportunity to open

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SCHOLARS APPLAUD U.S. OFFICIAL'S MESSAGE ON ARMS SALES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan should support a
message on arms procurement that was delivered by United States
official Stephen Young as it serves Taiwan's national interest, a
pair of scholars said Monday in a press conference.
On Oct. 26, Stephen Young, the director of the American Insitute
in Taiwan (AIT), urged Taiwan's legislature to pass a robust defense
budget in its fall session, a message that should be supported by
Taiwan's people, said Lee Ming-juin and Yu Wei-hsuan, both members
of the pro-independence civil group Taiwan Society North.</P>
      <P>"Compared with our Asian counterparts, Japan and South Korea,
Taiwan's defense budget has been decreasing in recent years. It is
against the global trend and hindering the U.S.' strategic plan in
the Asia-Pacific region," said Lee, a professor at Huafan University.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan does not raise its defense budget for this minimal
requirement, the U.S.' line of defense in the first island chain of
the Pacific Rim will have a large gap, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>The U.S. offered to sell arms to Taiwan according to the Taiwan
Relations Act, instead of "The Republic of China Relations Act,"
noted Yu, a professor at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>"Which brings the uncertainty of Taiwan's status to the table,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has the right to be upset about the stalemate over the
arms package in Taiwan's legislature, Yu said, as the U.S. military
force could face casualties if Taiwan fails to defend itself in
the event of a cross-strait conflict.</P>
      <P>By opposing the robust defense budget and the arms sale, Taiwan
will place its national security in China's hands, which could lead
to a misjudgement by both the U.S. and China, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"China could attack Taiwan relentlessly once it's capable of
doing so. And the U.S. could interpret the case of arms procurement
as Taiwan's willingness to accept unification and change its
Taiwan policy accordingly," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FSC COMMISSIONER'S DETENTION ASKED ON SUSPICIONS OF TAKING BRIBES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors requested to detain Lin
Chung-cheng, commissioner of the Financial Supervisory Commission
(FSC) , and his secretary Su Chun-chi early Tuesday for suspected
illegal lobbying and bribe taking.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors were also seeking to detain Tsui Mei-lan, a legal
advisor to China Development Financial Holding Corp. in a probe
mainly into allegations that some public functionaries have been
suspected of making illicit profits and violating other ethical
codes.</P>
      <P>As of noon, debate was still going on at Taichung District Court
over whether to grant prosecutors a permission to detain the trio.</P>
      <P>Lin, 53, is the third senior official at the FSC to be
investigated on corruption charges, after former Chairman Kong
Jaw-sheng was indicted on charges of breach of trust and conflict of
interest, and former Financial Examination Bureau director Lee
Chin-cheng was sentenced to 10 years in prison for involvement in the
"stock vultures" scandal which shocked the nation.</P>
      <P>Lin has submitted his resignation, which Premier Su Tseng-chang
said will be "handled according to procedures."</P>
      <P>The premier said that since its establishment two years ago, the
FSC's performance has not met "society's expectations" and that he
has instructed FSC Chairman Shih Jun-ji to "give it a good jolt" in
order to gain the public's trust in the financial regulatory body.</P>
      <P>As to the judicial authorities' probe of yet another senior
official in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party government, Su
said that if Lin is found guilty, "then let justice be done," and if
he is found to be innocent, then his name should be cleared.</P>
      <P>Taichung District Prosecutor Chang Hung-mo said prosecutors
wanted to detain Lin, his secretary and Tsui for further
invesgiation, while nine others were released on bail ranging from
NT$10,000 (US$300) to NT$800,000.</P>
      <P>Investigators found that Lin has used his influence in the FSC to
obstruct the commission from referring China Development Financial
Holding Corp. to judicial authorities for an investigation into its
suspected violation of the stock exchange law in its bid to merge a
securities firm.</P>
      <P>Lin is also suspected of lobbying for China Development Financial
in defense of its controversial purchase of a local brokerage --
Taiwan International Securities -- during the FSC's internal
discussions.</P>
      <P>Lin was also found to have lobbied for Chinatrust Financial
Holding Co. and helped the company in its efforts to take over
government-controlled Mega Holdings through overseas "structured
notes" deals, deals that have been investigated in another case.</P>
      <P>In return for his suspected illegal services to the banking
businesses, Lin was allegedly given a timber cabin and other bribes,
the prosecution said.</P>
      <P>With Lin under investigation, the seven-member FSC will continue
to hold regular meetings as the required minimum of two-thirds of
commissioners will be able to attend, FSC Vice Chairman Susan Chang
said.</P>
      <P>If two commissioners are absent, the FSC cannot hold a legal
meeting, she noted.</P>
      <P>Currently, Commissioner Lin Kuo-chuan is visiting Japan. If he
cannot return by Thursday, the FSC's regular meeting will be put off,
she said.</P>

Yu-kou and Lo Chih-ming to withdraw from the mayoral elections in
Taipei and Kaohsiung, claiming that doing so will "benefit Taiwan and
the TSU itself."</P>
      <P>In response, the TSU held a press conference during which the
party's chairman, Su Chin-chiang, urged all "Taiwan-first" civic
groups to be rational, and Lo's spokeswoman Chien Lin Hui-chun
demanded that the Southern Taiwan Society apologize within three days
for issuing the statement or face a legal action.</P>
      <P>Su said pro-independence groups should make their priority
Taiwan, instead of Taiwan's two major political parties -- the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT).</P>
      <P>The DPP and the TSU form the "pan-green camp" while the KMT and
the People First Party (PFP) form the "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>If the "pro-green" groups continue to get embroiled in Taiwan's
"blue-green" stand-off and conflicts and to be obsessed with
"avenging the loss of political power," then they don't deserve to be
called pro-Taiwan groups, Su said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that by calling for Lo and Chou to quit the elections,
the Southern Taiwan Society may have violated the election law, which
stipulates that "actions aimed at preventing the election of an
individual" are illegal.</P>
      <P>Chien Lin said that "pro-Taiwan" does not mean pro-DPP or
pro-corruption, and she raised the question of whether the Southern
Taiwan Society has benefited somehow for its longstanding support of
the DPP.</P>
      <P>She accused the Southern Taiwan Society of trying to scare Taiwan
voters by claiming that electing the "wrong" candidates could lead to
China's annexation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chou Yu-kou, the TSU's candidate for Taipei mayor, said that the
members of the Southern Taiwan Society are all intellectuals and that
she is surprised that they have come out with such an anti-democratic
statement.</P>
      <P>Calling the issuing of such a statement "Taiwan's shame," Chou
said that she will stay in the mayoral race until the end in order to
"fight against their hegemonistic attitude."</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian told visiting
Alaska governor Frank Murkowski Tuesday that he hopes the United
States and Taiwan will be able to sign a free trade agreement (FTA)
soon.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with Murkowski, an
outspoken supporter of Taiwan, at the Presidential Office. Murkowski
was accompanied by Stephen Young, head of the Taipei Office of the
American Institute in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said talks on issues related to a Taiwan-U.S. FTA
have been proceeding smoothly over the past few months, expressing
thanks for U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Karan Bhatia's dedicated
efforts in the negotiations, including those concerning the formation
of a trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA).</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes the TIFA talks will build a sound and solid
foundation for the planned Taiwan-U.S. FTA.</P>
      <P>Murkowski arrived in Taiwan Sunday for a six-day visit, which is
his fourth trip to the island as the governor of Alaska. Prior to
that, he visited 15 times while serving as a U.S. senator.</P>
      <P>During his stay, the governor is scheduled to pay a visit to
former President Lee Teng-hui, call on the heads of the state-run
Taiwan Power Co. and the Chinese Petroleum Co., as well as meet with
local enterprise leaders.</P>
      <P>Murkowski is also slated to attend the third annual meeting of
the Taiwan-Alaska Trade and Investment Cooperation Council in an
effort to continue promoting cooperation and exchanges between the
two sides in the resources, mining, fishery, forestry and tourism
sectors.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen expressed his gratitude to the "friend
of Taiwan" for having written a letter to U.S. President George W.
Bush expressing his grave concerns over China's passage of an
anti-secession law, as well as for having sent a message to the
director general of the World Health Organization each year since
2003 to call for Taiwan's accession to the international body.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan, the eighth largest trade partner of the
United States, has been maintaining close trade and economic
relations with the country.</P>
      <P>Citing official statistics, Chen noted that bilateral trade
between the two countries reached US$56 billion for 2005, with U.S.
exports to Taiwan amounting to US$22 billion for that year.</P>
      <P>Murkowski is scheduled to depart Taiwan Nov. 3.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kinmen County government opened a
narcotics hazard prevention and control center Tuesday to underscore
its determination to wipe out drug-related crimes on the outlying
island.</P>
      <P>Officiating at a ceremony marking the center's inauguration,
Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng said the central government has
designated 2005 through 2008 as years for an intensified campaign
against narcotics.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new center is a response to Premier Su
Tseng-chang's call earlier this year for each city and county to set
up a drug hazard prevention and control center to upgrade the
efficiency of anti-drug operations, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The new center will integrate resources in the administrative,
judicial, police, education, social welfare and public health systems
to prevent drug abuse and crack down on drug trafficking, Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, 200-plus Kinmen residents are convicted drug
abusers subject to special monitoring. "The ratio is alarmingly high
as Kinmen has a population of only about 70,000, " Lee said, adding
that the new center will step up the drug hazard awareness campaign
to prevent drug abuse.</P>
      <P>Liu Chia-fang, chief prosecutor of the Kinmen Prosecutor's Office
who will serve as an adviser of the new center, said that a lot of
inmates have ended up in prison because of crimes they committed in
order to get money to satisfy their drug addiction and that many
people become addicted to drugs after forming the habit of smoking,
with 90 percent of drug addicts saying they started using drugs out
of curiosity and 80 percent mentioning the influence of bad friends.</P>
      <P>In the past, Liu said, the anti-drug campaign tended to focus on
the supply side. The continued rise in the number of drug abusers and
traffickers proves the failure of this strategy, Liu said, adding
that in the future, the campaign should give priority to curbing
demand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PAY HIKE FOR MOST OFFICE WORKERS OVER PAST THREE YEARS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of office workers in Taiwan
have received no pay hike over the past three years, forcing many of
them to seek moonlighting opportunities, according to the results of
a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted online by 104 Job Bank in cooperation
with Smart magazine on 1,651 office workers from Oct. 3-11. It has a
margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The survey found that the pay of 55.5 percent of the respondents
has remained the same over the past three years, while 13.3 percent
of those polled have experienced a pay cut during the period.</P>
      <P>Of the workers who have seen their pay decrease, approximately 40
percent have experienced a cut in salary of more than 5 percent,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Among workers in the 36-55 age group whose family financial
burden are heavier than others, as many as 23 percent have suffered a
pay cut.</P>
      <P>While 24.4 percent of the respondents have found a second job to
boost their income, 80 percent of those who have not done so are
planning to follow suit, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>In addition to financial considerations, 34.4 percent of the
respondents think taking a second job can increase their expertise
and skills, 28.8 percent think the experience can serve as a
springboard to entering a new profession or starting their own
business, and 27.5 percent think it can expand their job experience.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 42.5 percent of the moonlighters make
between NT$5,000 (US$151) and NT$10,000 per month in their second
jobs, and another 5 percent make more than NT$30,000 per month.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that the higher the education background of the
workers, the higher the income they receive from moonlighting.</P>
      <P>As many as 16.7 percent of the workers with a post-graduate
degree earn more than NT$20,000 per month from their moonlighting
jobs, compared with only 8.6 percent among bachelor's degree holders
and 8.4 percent among junior college graduates.</P>
      <P>While 36.1 percent of those with a post-graduate degree moonlight
by taking outsourced projects, 25 percent serve as lecturers at
educational institutions.</P>
      <P>On the pay for outsourced projects, those in the information
technology and Internet category offer an average of NT$187,500 per
project, those in the planning category offer an average of
NT$65,200, those in the design and graphics category offer an average
of NT$48,300, and those in the writing and publishing category offer

    <HEADLINE>UNPERTURBED BY U.S. WARNINGS, KMT, PFP BLOCK ARMS BILL AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unperturbed by America's top envoy and a
Washington senior official's threat of a "downward spiral" in
bilateral relations if the legislature does not approve an arms
procurement bill this fall, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) lawmakers again joined to block the bill from
getting on the legislative agenda Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers' move was also a slap in the face for
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who had made assurances the previous day
that his party supported the passage of a NT$6.3 billion (US$189
million) supplementary budget to bolster Taiwan's defense capability
-- the same budget bill blocked Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao Pen-yen, convener of the Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU)
legislative caucus, said it was "no news" Ma has lost credibility
because his party has been kidnapped by the PFP, which has
"threatened" to help the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
pass a bill on the KMT's "ill-gotten" assets if the KMT supports the
arms bill.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, the DPP's legislative caucus secretary-general, said
KMT whips have signed an agreement on putting the arms procurement
bill on the legislative agenda "so that an open debate can begin" --
as American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) Taiwan Office Director
Stephen Young urged Oct. 26.</P>
      <P>By blocking the bill from passing the Procedure Committee, the
KMT has proven itself to have been "hijacked by the PFP," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP did not just stop the NT$6.3 billion budget for
"major defense investment programs" from getting on the legislative
agenda. They also blocked the withdrawal of the government's initial
proposal for a special budget of NT$610.8 billion to buy new weapons
from the U.S. -- a proposal the Cabinet has asked to rescind, upon
the Legislative Yuan's recommendation.</P>
      <P>Also kept in abeyance in the committee are the president's
requests to approve his nominations for Control Yuan members and
state public prosecutor general, as well as almost 50 legislative
bills or actions the DPP and its "pan-green camp" ally the TSU have
proposed for deliberation in a plenary meeting of the legislature.</P>
      <P>At a rare press conference Oct. 26, Young urged Taiwan's
legislature to "act now to pass the robust defense budget this fall,"
estimating the proportion of defense spending to GDP would increase
from 2.5 percent this year to 3 percent in 2008, and allow debate on
the long-stalled arms procurement package to get under way in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The next day, a senior official in Washington told the CNA that
Taiwan will lose U.S. support if it continues to delay its arms
procurement plan.</P>
      <P>The official warned that if Taiwan is reluctant to invest in its
own defense, the new administration in 2008 would "inherit a mess of
a government with U.S.-Taiwan relations on a downward spiral" -- a
government "with minimum support from the new U.S. administration."</P>
      <P>Young and the D.C. official's warnings, while seen by the
government as "sincere advice coming from a good friend of Taiwan, "
triggered vehement responses from some opposition politicians and
other critics.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin Su-mei, an aboriginal Non-Partisan Solidarity Union
(NPSU) legislator, joined critics in describing Young's comments as
"inappropriate remarks, " advising him to "get out of Taiwan and back
to the U.S."</P>
      <P>She said she opposes the bill because it would cut deeply into
government spending on health and education, at a time when many
schoolchildren cannot afford lunch and the education budget has
fallen to the bottom among Asia's "four dragons, " and even below
Taiwan's 1997 level.</P>
      <P>Adding fuel to the fire, President Chen Shui-bian allegedly
commented that anyone opposing the bill should be seen as supporting
a new round of "cooperation between the KMT and the Communist Party
of China."</P>
      <P>Li Ao, an independent legislator who set off tear gas in a
procedure committee meeting last week to obstruct discussion on the
arms bill, said Chen's comment alone was enough to ensure the bill
would be blocked Tuesday.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Su Chi, a former KMT Cabinet official, said the
bill has been delayed so long because Taiwan has never held rational
debate on the subject.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Defense Minister Lee Jye has never gone on
TV to explain the bill to the public, while other "pan-green"
politicians have only tried to accuse rivals, drive a wedge between
the KMT and PFP and provoke animosity between supporters of Taiwan
independence and ultimate unification with China.</P>
      <P>"None of these [actions] set a good example in a democracy, " Su
said.</P>

      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) recently
raided a human-trafficking ring in northern Taiwan, rescuing a
Vietnamese woman who was sold to a labor brokerage company and forced
to work illegally on the island, the NPA announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The NPA Foreign Affairs Police Corps launched two separate raids
in Taipei county and city Monday, arresting three suspects including
Kuo Chiu-ling, head of the brokerage firm, and her employee Lee
Sheng-huai.</P>
      <P>The other, identified as Tsai Shi-chin, was discovered to have
sold foreign women at a price of some NT$300,000 (US$9,020) each to
the company, which then seized the victims' passports and forced them
to sign a contract selling themselves to the company, according to
the initial police inquiry.</P>
      <P>Police said Kuo and Lee have forced victims to work illegally in
the northern areas, exploiting "cheap laborers" who had to work at

NT$30,000 -- the average salary for foreign laborers in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) confirmed media reports Tuesday that former
President Lee Teng-hui plans to form a new political party,
describing the strategy as providing "a moderate option" amid fierce
political infighting.</P>
      <P>Su Chin-chiang made the remarks at a news conference held at TSU
headquarters after local media reported that Lee -- TSU's spiritual
leader -- intends to start a new political party to counterbalance
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Lee is deeply concerned about escalating confrontation between
the "pan-green" camp led by the DPP and the KMT-led "pan-blue
alliance," and over the past year has weighed the feasibility of
exercising "median power" by forming a political party, Su said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs 'middle-of-the-road power' to overcome the extremes
in political confrontation between the two camps, and it's logical to
assume that establishing a new political party is one way to achieve
that aim, " he said, adding that "the TSU is wide open to forming a
new party that exemplifies 'moderation, ' 'good sense, ' 'integrity'
and 'Taiwan first.'"</P>
      <P>According to Su, Lee expects TSU to play the role of a
fundamental power base in Taiwan's "middle-of-the-road" politics, as
the silent majority is "fed up with extremes."</P>
      <P>Local media reported that the new party is likely to take shape
in March or April next year, and cited sources close to Lee as saying
that Lee deems Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng as the most
appropriate and only candidate to serve as the new party's chairman.</P>
      <P>In response to a report alleging Wang or former Premier Frank
Hsieh might take on the task, Su said that "it is too early to
discuss the matter."</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that the public certainly has high
expectations for Wang in such a role due to his capacity as
legislative speaker, who acts as mediator between ruling and
opposition forces.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The problem of widening wealth inequality
in the country is reflected in the financial status of office workers
in their 30s, with the gap expected to become increasingly wider in
the future, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the 30 Monthly magazine in late
September.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 10 percent of the office workers in their
30s make more than NT$1 million per annum, while 65 percent receive
an annual income of less than NT$600,000.</P>
      <P>After analyzing pay adjustments, results of investment and
financial confidence of the respondents, the survey shows that the
rich are becoming richer while the middle-class is seeing its status
downgraded.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents whose annual income exceeds NT$1 million,
56.7 percent have received a pay hike over the past year, compared
with only 32.5 percent among those who earn less than NT$600,000 a
year, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The salaries of more than 66 percent of the respondents have not
increased over the past year.</P>
      <P>High-income earners have also performed better in terms of the
results of their investments, with more than 50 percent having made
profits from their investments this year, the survey indicates.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents who make less than NT$600,000 per year,
57.3 percent have not engaged in any investment activities, with less
than one-quarter having made profits from investment this year.</P>
      <P>As many as 65.1 percent of the low-to-medium income earners
mentioned helplessness in the face of financial pressure, and 9.6
percent said that although they have plans to improve their financial
condition, they have not carried them out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 88.5 percent of those who earn less than NT$600,000
per year do not think they will be able to save NT$10 million before
they retire, compared with 77.8 percent who expressed confidence
among those who earn more than NT$1 million per year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSERVATIONIST JANE GOODALL: 'LITTLE THINGS CAN CHANGE THE WORLD'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Facing the enormous challenges of global
warming and poverty, keep the faith and believe every little thing
can help change the world, a British conservationist urged Monday in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Always think about your action, how it can affect people around
you, the environment, nature and animals," Jane Goodall told
hundreds of students in a topical speech entitled "Change the World."</P>
      <P>In a two-hour forum moderated by Taichung City mayor Jason Hu,
Goodall discussed a wide range of topics, including poverty, global
warming, Africa and world peace, with another guest speaker, Lee
Chi-tung, a Tsing Hua University professor.</P>
      <P>The current situation regarding global warming and poverty may
make people frustrated sometimes, but it is never too late to take
the first step, Goodall said.</P>
      <P>"Little things like riding a bicycle to work can make a
difference. As we make more money, we can make greater changes
through buying products such as organic food and energy-efficient
cars," she said.</P>
      <P>"We cannot just hope for the government and politicians to make
changes. It's all up to us," she urged.</P>
      <P>"Every single one of us can make a difference every single day,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Goodall, a 72-year-old primatologist best known for decades
of pioneering research on chimpanzees in Africa, has not forgotten her
"babies."</P>
      <P>"We are not the only beings with personalities and feelings. We
share 99 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees," she said, adding that
after years of research she came to realize that humans have to help
themselves first, before saving chimpanzees.</P>
      <P>Goodall is on her tenth visit to Taiwan to promote conservation
awareness and the Roots and Shoots program, an educational program
she established around the world in schools at all levels.</P>
      <P>The forum was organized by Rotary International District 3520.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER: RECENT EVENTS DELAY DEBATE ON ARMS PURCHASE BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided to
"temporarily delay" legislative debate on a controversial arms
procurement bill Tuesday, claiming emotions are running high after
provocative remarks were made by a U.S. envoy and government officials in Taiwan, according to an opposition lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, a former KMT Cabinet member, made the remarks after
members of his caucus and their "pan-blue alliance" ally the People
First Party (PFP) blocked -- for the 62nd time -- a
government-initiated budget proposal to buy U.S. weapons from getting
on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>Su said his party supports a "reasonable, modest and
middle-of-the-road" arms procurement package -- meaning the
government's proposal for buying three major items (anti-missile
batteries, anti-submarine aircraft and submarines) can "neither be
completely accepted nor completely rejected."</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, caucus secretary-general, blamed DPP legislators
for "echoing American threats" by pushing for a Procedure Committee
decision on the bill right after the American Institute in Taiwan's
(AIT) Taipei Office Director Stephen Young set a time limit for
Taiwan's legislature to pass the defense budget and a D.C. official
warned of a "downward spiral" in U.S.-Taiwan relations if the bill is
not passed soon.</P>
      <P>Making things worse were President Chen Shui-bian's alleged
remarks that anyone opposing the arms bill is supporting a new round
of "KMT-Communist Party of China cooperation," Tsai added.</P>
      <P>The DPP government is making an issue out of the bill at this
time in a bid to "blur the focus" of public anger at the
scandal-ridden president, he said, adding the KMT will not be
disturbed by the DPP's strategy and will keep a close watch on how
taxpayer money is spent.</P>
      <P>Liao Pen-yen, convener of the Taiwan Solidarity Union's
legislative caucus, acknowledged Young's strongly worded remarks did a
disservice to the DPP government by giving the KMT-PFP alliance an
excuse to delay open debate on the bill in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Still, Liao said, the KMT legislators' action Tuesday betrayed
the fact their Chairman Ma Ying-jeou had failed to honor his word
about passing the government's NT$6.3 billion supplementary budget to
strengthen Taiwan's defense capability.</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, director of the TSU's Policy Committee, said the
government has adjusted its total budget for procuring advanced
weaponry to upgrade defense capability -- from NT$610.8 billion down
to NT$480 billion and now down to NT$340 billion, and yet the
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and PFP remain adamant in
opposing the package.</P>
      <P>"If political strife continues, military imbalance will worsen
across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's national security will be in
peril," Ho warned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPENING OF DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS SHOULD BE PROGRESSIVE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
the opening of direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport links involves
not only business interests but also national security and should
therefore be carried out in a progressive and pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving a group of foreign
businessmen in Taiwan who have expressed concern over the issue.</P>
      <P>He said the government's policy was to first open the "mini three
links" between Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and
China's Fujian Province before proceeding to a full opening of direct
cross-strait links.</P>
      <P>Also, direct cross-strait charter cargo flights should be
launched before direct cross-strait charter passenger flights, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The president urged the business sector not to overlook Beijing's
united front tactics against Taiwan while focusing on the business
interests and convenience of the opening of direct cross-strait
transport links.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the government is resolved to provide the best
services for the industrial and business sectors, he urged the
businessmen to have confidence in the government and offer their firm
support for the government's policy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted that the production value of Taiwan's service
sector contributed to 73.56 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) last year, making the sector the most important force
in promoting the country's economic development and social stability.</P>
      <P>To further strengthen the development of the service sector, the
Cabinet has mapped out a series of measures targeting the sector in
"mega investment" and "mega warmth" projects finalized recently, he
said.</P>
      <P>These measures include speeding up deregulation of the service
sector and promoting travel, digital content, culture and creativity,
telecommunications and medical services, he said, adding that the
government aims to boost the GDP value of the service sector from
NT$8.2 trillion now to NT$10.3 trillion by 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG PORT MAINTAINS STEADY GROWTH IN CARGO HANDLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung County, central Taiwan, Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Port has
maintained a steady growth in cargo handling since beginning
operations in 1976, Taichung Harbor Bureau officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony celebrating the bureau's 30th founding anniversary,
the officials pointed out that Taichung Port handled 88.43 million
tons of cargo in 2005, representing a 46 percent increase over 1996.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, goods loaded and unloaded
at the port reached 67 million tons, up 3.19 percent from the same
period of last year, according to the bureau, which administers the
port.</P>
      <P>Taichung Port, located in Wuchi, Taichung County, has 46
deep-water wharves and 15 specialized zones. It is the third-largest
of Taiwan's four international commercial ports, behind Kaohsiung
Port in southern Taiwan and Keelung Port in the north.</P>
      <P>The man-made port boasts high-efficiency and fully automated
warehousing operations, which are open to private investment. To
date, 41 companies have invested NT$30 billion in the port.</P>
      <P>Future goals for the port include expanding the number of wharves
to 83, increasing the container-handling capacity and developing the
port as a distribution center.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials acknowledged that the port is facing fierce
competition from ports in neighboring countries, especially China.</P>
      <P>They suggested that to create a mutually beneficial situation for
all the parties involved, Taichung Port should be incorporated into
Taichung County and the central government should allow direct mail,
trade and transport services between Taiwan and China as soon as
possible.</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The confirmation of two dengue fever
deaths in the past three days in the southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung has prompted local health officials to spray insecticide
Tuesday in two districts to eliminate mosquito larvae and pupae
before they become adult mosquitoes.</P>
      <P>According to the Kaohsiung city government's Department of
Health, the Center for Disease Control has confirmed that Dengue
hemorrhagic fever caused the death of a 66-year-old woman in the
Chiencheng district Oct. 28 -- Kaohsiung's first victim this year --
and claimed another victim -- a 76-year-old man -- in the Lingya
district Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by Kaohsiung's Department of Health show that
the city had recorded 365 confirmed indigenous dengue fever cases
since the beginning of summer, including nine dengue hemorrhagic
fever cases, and that the Chiencheng district is one of the
high-incidence areas.</P>
      <P>The two deaths prompted health officials to send sanitation teams
to the two districts to eliminate the mosquitoes that carry the
disease.</P>
      <P>The teams discovered mosquito pupae in pools of water at a
construction site and in flowerpots at florist shops in the Lingya
district. In addition to killing the pupae, they issued written
warnings to the construction company and shop owners that they will
face penalties if they allow their surroundings to become mosquito
breeding grounds again.</P>
      <P>Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a severe, potentially fatal infection
that occurs when someone with immunity to one type of dengue virus is
infected by a different type. It is spread by certain mosquitoes
that bite primarily during the day.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is a viral illness also transmitted by mosquitoes.
It is characterized by fever, rashes, and muscle and joint pains,
accompanied by nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN FAVORS TWO-PARTY POLITICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although speculation is rampant that a new
party might be formed next year to counter the existing political
forces, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun said Tuesday that two-party politics should be the
mainstream trend in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu made the comments while responding to questions from reporters
about a confirmed report that former President Lee Teng-hui has plans
to form a new party that features a "middle of the road" approach, as
a way to provide the public with an option to surmount the rising
strife between the "pan-blue alliance" led by the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the DPP-led "pan-green camp."</P>
      <P>It was widely reported that Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, a KMT member, has been deemed by Lee as the most proper
candidate to serve as chairman of the new party to set the stage in
preparation for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, however, the public "look forward to seeing a
two-party political system fully develop in Taiwan society" despite
the fact that it is anyone's right to form a political party and that
he fully respects any such move.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who has been viewed as the "pan-blue
alliance's" best bet for the 2008 presidential election, claimed to
be unaware of Lee's so-called "third force" but expressed his belief
that Wang is wise enough to gauge the issue.</P>
      <P>In view of the potential change in Taiwan's polarized political
sector, KMT sources have suggested a Ma-Wang ticket for the 2008
presidential race.</P>
      <P>Although various lawmakers of the People First Party (PFP), a KMT
partner in the "pan-blue alliance, " scolded the KMT for taking
advantage of Wang, PFP Chairman James Soong contended that there is
room for a third major political party to be formed apart from the
DPP and the KMT because the people are so fed up with official
corruption and political infighting.</P>
      <P>While the DPP administration is deeply troubled by a string of
official corruption scandals since coming to power in 2000, the KMT
remains incompetent in its attempts to wipe out government
wrongdoing, Soong said.</P>
      <P>What the people really want is a party capable of eradicating
degeneration and serving the genuine needs of the people, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STRICT CONTROLS IMPOSED ON INTERVIEWING FOREIGN SPOUSES: MOI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Tsai Hui-ju)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has
imposed more strict controls on interviewing foreign spouses to
reduce the incidence of fake marriages, Vice Minister of the Interior
Chien Tai-lang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan while reporting to
Taiwan Solidarity Union legislators, who were questioning him on
whether the interview could stop foreign prostitutes from entering
into Taiwan by false marriages.</P>
      <P>Since it began conducting interviews of foreign spouses in 2003,
the MOI determined more than 16,000 cases to be fraudulent -- 12.6
percent of all cases, Chien reported.</P>
      <P>Chien said improvements in the interview process have been made
since 2005, such as increasing the number of interview staff and more
strict review of application materials.</P>
      <P>According to the new regulations, the interviews must be
conducted by two staff members, who are decided by lot and regularly
replaced to prevent illegal conduct from occurring, he added.</P>
      <P>While it takes about two to three months for applicants to
arrange an interview appointment, he said the problem will also
improve after the government sets up an immigration department, which
will be able to offer more administrative support.</P>
      <P>Chang Siao-yue, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, also reported
that since the government asked Taipei's representative offices in
Southeast Asian countries to address the problem in 2005, 30 percent
of applications for marriage with Taiwanese have been declined.</P>
      <P>She suggested the government set up an immigration department
soon and amend immigration laws to reduce the number of false
marriages by simplifying the administration procedure and the
organization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is among the list of destination countries for
prostitution, in a report published by the U.S. Department of State.
The U.S. declines 65 percent of foreign spouse applications every
year, while Taiwan only declines 10 percent of applications from
China and 30 percent from Vietnam, legislators said.</P>

Crops Using Traits Of Distant Relatives
Rows of robotic devices are deciphering the

Scientists here search the results for subtle
genetic differences that explain why a particular
plant is better than others at tolerating cold,
repelling insects, surviving drought or making
more seed.
Armed with this knowledge, crop breeders can
create better corn. But not by gene-splicing,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
expects to have a NT$6.3 billion supplementary budget for arms
procurements included in the legislative agenda during the
legislature's current session, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Chin-lung told reporters that a draft bill for an
annual budget of NT$320 billion to purchase arms from the United
States has already been included on the legislative agenda and will
be screened by the relevant committees.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that it would be inappropriate at present to
have the NT$6.3 billion supplementary budget included on the
legislative agenda, because some people in Taiwan are furious at last
week's high-profile remarks by Stephen Young, the Taipei office
director of the American Institute in Taiwan, who urged Taiwan's
legislature to "act now to pass the robust defense budget this fall."</P>
      <P>"The atmosphere is not right," Tsai said, adding that the KMT
cannot include the budget bill on the legislative agenda now because
that would look as if the KMT was complying to pressure from the
United States.</P>
      <P>He said it is important that all parties concerned should calm
down and that President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Su Tseng-chang
should stop accusing the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" ally -- the
People First Party -- of being "fellow travelers of China."</P>
      <P>Tsai made clear the KMT's position on arms procurement after
lawmakers of the KMT and the PFP joined forces for the 62nd time
Tuesday to block the bill from being debated at the Procedure
Committee. The two opposition parties hold a slight majority in the
220-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>The proposed NT$6.3 billion supplementary budget would allow
Taiwan to conduct a submarine feasibility assessment, buy P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and upgrade its Patriot II missiles.</P>
