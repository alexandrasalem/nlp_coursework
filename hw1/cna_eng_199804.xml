    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS RECEIVED 28TH MOST US FDI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  March  31 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is 28th on the latest list of
the worldwide economies that have received foreign direct investment
(FDI) from the United States, dropping from 23rd on the previous
list, according to an official report.</P>
      <P>Figures in the report, released by the US Trade Representative's
Office on Tuesday, show that Taiwan has received less US FDI than
most other major economies in Asia, in spite of the fact that the
island is the United States' 7th largest trade partner and the third
largest exporter in Asia.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 1996, Taiwan had lured a total of US$4.59
billion in FDI from the United States, up 7.1 percent from the
year-earlier-level, according to the US statistics. Most of the
capital was poured into banking, manufacturing and gross/retail
industries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan lags behind the other three Asian economic tigers in total
US FDI, with Hong Kong, a former British colony, having gained
US$16.02 billion in FDI from the United States; Singapore, US$14.15
billion; and South Korea, US$5.5 billion, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Compared with other major Asian economies, Taiwan only tops
mainland China, the Philippines and India in FDI from the United
States.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that as of the end of 1996, the United
States had made US$796.49 billion in FDI, up 11 percent from the
level a year earlier. The greatest portion of the American funds, or
45.5 percent, went to the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands,
Germany and Japan, the statistics showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LONDON TO ESTABLISH TAIPEI OFFICE TO SEEK TAIWAN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, March 31 (CNA)
(By C.L. Ou &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Greater London Area has decided to set
up a liaison office in Taipei to drum up Taiwan investment in the
British capital city, sources with the London regional government
reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The London First Center, a private and public sector partnership
that provides free consultancy services to overseas companies
considering London as a business and investment location, has decided
to establish its Taipei liaison office in June this year and has
appointed William Tang to be the new office's first representative.</P>
      <P>The Taipei office, to be located on Keelung Road in downtown
Taipei, will have three full-time employees.</P>
      <P>The new center is expected to intensify competition among the
various regions in Britain that see Taiwan as an important source of
foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Like London, other regions in Britain -- including Northeastern
England, Northwestern England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales
-- have all dispatched personnel from their respective development
organizations to Taiwan for investment promotion.</P>
      <P>William Tang, a Chinese-British official who has worked in Taipei
for seven years as a representative of the Northern England
Development Company (NDC), said the London First Center will
cooperate closely with the NDC's Taipei office in an effort to
sharpen Britain's competitive edge in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>The Greater London Area, which boasts 30 of the 91 Taiwan
companies that have relocated business operations to Britain, is a
commendable choice for Taiwan companies because of its
well-established infrastructure and sound financial and legal service
systems, Tang said.</P>
      <P>Among the Taiwan firms already in the Greater London Area are
Liton Electronics, CMC Magnetics and ADI Corp., he added.</P>
      <P>Michael Charlton, managing director of the London First Center,
said that since its establishment in 1994, the center has helped 150
companies from around the world to set up affiliated operations in
London. Given that Taiwan is one of Asia's economic powerhouses and
is continuing to enjoy an economic boom, the founding of a London
First Center in Taipei is only natural, he said.</P>

(By K.C. Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James R. Sasser, US ambassador to
mainland China, reiterated on Tuesday that the US government would be
delighted to see Taiwan and mainland China resume negotiations as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Delivering a keynote speech before a gathering on US-mainland
Chinese relations sponsored by the Asian Foundation here, Sasser
repeated the US policy on cross-strait relations -- that disputes
between Taiwan and mainland China should be peacefully resolved by
the Chinese people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and that the
sole peaceful approach is to hold talks.</P>
      <P>Sasser said he is optimistic that Taiwan and the mainland will
resume talks in the near future, noting that both sides have
expressed a willingness to do so. However, he added, it remains to be
seen under which terms the two sides would reopen talks.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether US President Bill Clinton will give way to
Beijing's terms for joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) during
his planned visit to mainland China in June, the ambassador said he
believes that Washington will stick to its stance by handling the
issue as a purely business matter that has nothing to do with
politics.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two sides need to hold additional negotiations on
relevant issues regarding Beijing's WTO bid, Sasser revealed that he
hopes Zhu Rongji, who became mainland China's new premier last month,
will visit the United States this autumn.</P>
      <P>Expressing his belief that Asian economies, including that of
mainland China, will become stronger and more vigorous in the 21st
century, Sasser said the United States is willing to partner itself
with Asian countries so as to help them obtain even greater
development.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 1 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Intel, the world's leading maker of chips
for personal computers, may invest up to A$6 billion (US$4.03
billion) in Australia if the Coalition government under Prime
Minister John Howard is willing to offer tax concessions to the US
company.</P>
      <P>A company spokesperson told CNA Wednesday morning that Intel
President and CEO Craig Barrett and executives in Intel's
Asia-Pacific and Australian operations will hold a meeting in Sydney
with Howard and other Australian ministers to discuss the possibility
of setting up a huge Intel plant in Victoria.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review, Australia's largest business
daily, on Wednesday quoted sources close to the deal as revealing
that Intel will be looking for a positive signal from Howard that
Australia is serious about attracting high-tech investment.</P>
      <P>Intel is impressed with Australia's decision to introduce a
manufacturer-in-bond scheme, which allows the import of some goods
free of duty and sales tax. But Intel is expected to ask the
Australian government to give the company a favorable taxation
treatment on its Australian revenues because the company plans to
export 98 percent of the products it would make in Australia, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Howard believes such huge investment projects from foreign
companies such as Intel will help boost his bid for a second term as
prime minister, political analysts said.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian dollar is expected to
further drop drastically to as low as 60 US cents in the next few
months due to weaker Asian demand for Australian goods and a weak
Japanese yen, foreign exchange dealers said.</P>
      <P>They said the US dollar is now buoyant against major currencies,
including the Australian and Japanese currencies because of the
strong American economy.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar closed at 66.34 US cents Tuesday, down 0.34
US cents from Monday's closing level. Meanwhile, the US dollar gained
ground against the Japanese yen, closing at 132.73, up 1.5 yen from
Monday's level.</P>
      <P>The dealers predicted the Australian dollar could drop to between
65 and 60 US cents in the second half of this year because the Asian
currency crisis will start affecting the Australian economy as a
result of the weaker demand for Australian products and raw materials
such as coal, iron ore, other minerals and grains.</P>
      <P>They are now tipping the US dollar to rally to at least 135 yen
because hopes are fading for a resurgence in Japan's tired economy

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Half of the staff of a morgue in Sydney
could face criminal charges after an investigation discovered they
had plundered corpses for money, jewelry, clothes, telephone cards
and even shoes in a culture of corruption lasting 10 years.</P>
      <P>The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in a
report that most of the assistants were involved in the corrupt
conduct known as "ratting."</P>
      <P>It said 13 morgue employees out of a staff of 16 and two
undertakers had acted corruptly. Eight employees and the two
undertakers will be referred to the director of public prosecutions
for possible perjury charges and conspiring to arrange false
testimony to the ICAC.</P>
      <P>The undertakers even bribed morgue employees up to A$150 (US$101)
each to refer families of the dead to a funeral home, the ICAC said.</P>
      <P>ICAC Commissioner Barry O'Keefe described the practice as "an
affront to our society."</P>
      <P>"It was disgraceful behavior," he said. "What they did was
systematically offer bribes to morgue employees to steer business
their way."</P>
      <P>The ICAC investigation found that the assistants would conduct a
mock search in front of police and government contractors for
valuables. Once they had left, the assistants thoroughly searched and

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TRADE BARRIERS REMARKABLY REDUCED: US REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  March  31  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwan's "unfair
barriers" to US exports has remarkably reduced last year, and only a
few issues remain to be tackled, the office of the US Trade
Representative (USTR) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The USTR dedicated only five pages to Taiwan's trade barriers in
its 1998 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers,
compared with the previous two years' 11 pages. The five-page
"accusation" is the shortest complaint the US government has filed
against Taiwan over trade in the past few decades.</P>
      <P>Noting that the USTR has just completed the final round of
bilateral trade consultations with Taiwan on the island's terms for
joining the World Trade Organization, the report said that Taiwan now
restricts US goods and services providers' market access in only
three areas: import policies, intellectual property protection and
government procurement.</P>
      <P>In the previous year's report, the USTR had complained about
Taiwan's trade barriers in six major areas: import policies,
intellectual property protection, government procurement, the service
sector, investment restrictions, and Taiwan's tobacco and liquor
monopoly.</P>
      <P>Regarding import policies, the report singled out Taipei's
policies on medical equipment and pharmaceuticals imports as one of
the major sources of disputes between the two sides over the last two
years. Nearly one-fourth of the 1998 report on Taiwan focused on this
issue.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is currently America's third largest overseas
market for medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, the USTR complained
that Taiwan's Central Health Insurance Bureau has adopted a pricing
system on medical equipment that goes against ordinary people's
interests and is in opposition to the principles of transparency,
predictability and openness.</P>
      <P>On the pharmaceutical pricing system, the USTR grumbled about
Taiwan's "overprotection" of its domestic pharmaceutical makers and
"excessive restrictions" on the registration of new foreign producers
and new foreign brands of prescription medicine.</P>
      <P>The 416-page USTR annual report singled out Japan and the
European Union as the United States' top priorities in market-opening
efforts, dedicating 50 pages and 30 pages, respectively, to the two
economies' trade barriers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will eventually replace
the United States as the global superpower and this could "trigger a
major calamity" for the world, Australia's former Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser warned on Monday.</P>
      <P>In a speech to a UNESCO conference on education in the 21st
century in the Asia-Pacific region, Fraser said: "There is now one
superpower, which has claimed a great moral and democratic victory
over communism and which, as a consequence, has become more assertive
in promoting values which are thought to advance American interests.</P>
      <P>"We know quite well that at some point, the Chinese economy will
pass that of America. No great power has ever enjoyed seeing another
climbing up the greasy pole to displace it.</P>
      <P>"The possibility of significant problems between America and
China is real and in our part of the world, it is not difficult to
point to issues which could trigger a major calamity," he added.</P>
      <P>The Australian Associated Press reported that Fraser is one of a
30-member council of former heads of government from around the world
formed in 1983 to discuss globalization and problems of population
and the environment.</P>
      <P>Fraser said there was and still is a cultural divide that needs
to be addressed.</P>
      <P>"Tolerance between cultures and religions, between geographic
regions, is often a scarce commodity. It needs promoting and
supporting," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,  March  31 (CNA)
(By M.C. Chou and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting ROC Legislator Parris Chang said
here on Tuesday that the French authorities have expressed a
willingness to cooperate with Taiwan in a probe of graft allegations
surrounding France's 1991 sale of six Lafayette-class frigates to the
island.</P>
      <P>Chang, of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
along with a legislative delegation including several lawmakers from
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the tiny opposition New Party,
arrived here on Sunday to investigate the allegations.</P>
      <P>According to French press reports, about two-thirds of the US$500
million allegedly paid in commission for the US$3 billion frigate
deal were paid to go-betweens from Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed the importance of finding out the true facts of
the case and that the relevant French authorities have expressed a
willingness to cooperate closely with the delegation, but the DPP
lawmaker was reluctant to reveal the content of the just-concluded
two-day meeting between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chang, also a member of a task force set up recently under the
ROC Ministry of National Defense (MND) to probe a recent series of
scandals involving ammunition depot construction projects for the
country's Combined Services Forces (CSF), said Taiwan should
establish an institutionalized military procurement process with
European countries just as it has done with the United States, in
order to eradicate irregularities.</P>
      <P>Since the Military Procurement Bureau under the CSF has recently
been placed under the direct management of the MND, Chang expressed
the belief that the legislature will now be able to effectively
monitor military procurement.</P>
      <P>Chang and other members of the delegation are scheduled to depart
Paris on Wednesday for Strasbourg in eastern France, where they will
hold seminars with members of the European Parliament-Taiwan

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan might end up being the largest
beneficiary of the Asian financial crisis, officials from the
Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Numerous orders for notebook computers are now flowing into
Taiwan in the wake of the financial impact which has forced Japan and
South Korea, two of the world's largest computer makers, to
sub-contract most of their production to Taiwan computer
manufacturers, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The financial storm which has swept across most of Asia from the
middle of last year has resulted in a general drop in regional
currencies, which has led to many Asian producers suffering higher
production costs and lower profits.</P>
      <P>Japan and South Korea appear to be suffering the most, since they
can no longer enjoy the benefits of self-production due to a global
demand for low-priced computers.</P>
      <P>This trend has forced them to hand over many of their orders to
Taiwan, another of the world's largest computer manufacturers, in
order to reduce the burden of their inflated production costs, the
IDB officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy, bolstered by healthy economic fundamentals,
remains one of the few Asian countries to have suffered relatively
little damage from the financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also has wide experience in the field of OEM computer
manufacture, and is the largest outside contractor of several
heavyweight computer producers worldwide, including Compaq, IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, Fujitsu and NEC.</P>
      <P>According to IDB statistics, the worldwide production volume of
notebooks currently stands at around 14 million units per year. Some
35-45 percent of this amount originates in Taiwan, making the island
the second-largest notebook maker in the world behind Japan.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, a number of Japanese
manufacturers, including Toshiba Corp., have asked their Taiwan
contractors to take over notebook production.</P>
      <P>The IDB officials said the surging orders are expected to not
only boost Taiwan's general income from industrial output, but also
to push it into first position in the worldwide notebook
manufacturing sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOO STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>C.F. Koo, chairman of the Republic of
China's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), stressed on Wednesday the
importance of cross-strait dialogue, predicting that talks between
the SEF and its Beijing counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will be resumed in the near future.</P>
      <P>Koo said after attending a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Central
Committee meeting that the SEF, a quasi-official body set up to
handle cross-Taiwan Strait contacts in the absence of official ties
with mainland China, will send a letter to the ARATS later this week
containing the names of the SEF representatives which will be sent to
the mainland for preparatory consultations.</P>
      <P>He added that the representatives will be either Shi Hwei-you,
SEF secretary-general, or Chang Liang-jen, SEF deputy
secretary-general.</P>
      <P>The SEF wrote recently to the ARATS agreeing to send a delegation
to mainland China. The letter said "appropriate personnel" will be
dispatched in mid-April, or at a time suitable to ARATS officials,
for consultation and planning.</P>
      <P>The ARATS replied via letter on March 26, welcoming the SEF move
and inviting the SEF to present a concrete agenda for talks.</P>
      <P>The first round of talks between Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang
Daohan, which took place in Singapore in 1993, were suspended in 1995
by Beijing in protest over ROC President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the
United States.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 24, Taipei received what it termed a "positive" proposal
from the ARATS, suggesting that preparations begin for political
dialogue and the resumption of negotiations on cross-strait technical
and economic issues.</P>
      <P>Prior to that type of discussion, further exchanges and contacts
between the two sides are necessary, the proposal said, adding: "We
welcome a visit by Koo at an appropriate time. Officials at the
appropriate level can make the necessary preparations through an
exchange of visits."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC MAY ADJUST OIL PRICES IN JULY: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Wednesday that if international oil prices continue to drop and if
the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) reaches its profit target, domestic
oil prices can be adjusted downward in July.
 Wang made the remarks in response to interpellations by
Taoyuan County Legislator Chiu Chui-chen of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and Taipei City Legislator
Chen Han-chiang of the opposition New Party, who wanted to know
why domestic oil prices have not been lowered despite a decline
in international oil prices.
 The minister pointed out that the adjustment of oil prices is under
continuous assessment. When international prices dropped recently,
he said, the CPC originally considered the possibility of lowering
domestic prices. However, two days before the decision was made to
lower prices, international crude prices soared by US$2.00 per barrel,
resulting in a temporary halt to the adjustment plan.</P>
      <P>During each fiscal year, the CPC is legally entitled to a certain
amount of profit. According to Wang, the CPC still needs an
additional NT$5 billion to reach its legal ceiling for surplus in
its fiscal 1998 budget.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE CAN PRACTICE DEMOCRACY: ROC PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, March 31 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's experience shows that Chinese
people are eminently capable of practicing democracy, and that
democratic values fit in well with Chinese culture, Republic of China
Premier Vincent Siew said in an interview with an American reporter
entitled "Taiwan's Experience Shows China Can Adapt to Democracy."</P>
      <P>"Cultural factors will no longer serve as a persuasive excuse for
autocracy," he told Patrick B. McGuigan, whose interview with the ROC
leader was published on Wednesday in The Daily Oklahoman.</P>
      <P>Siew said that Taiwan's experience with democratic reforms has
proved that the argument -- that there is no democratic tradition in
China, and that democracy is therefore not suitable for China -- is
clearly flawed.</P>
      <P>He reasoned that since 1987, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in
Taiwan has been promoting democratic reforms and emphasizing the
concept of popular sovereignty. "This has been well received by the
public in Taiwan and praised throughout the world."</P>
      <P>Siew said that this proves that Chinese can "rapidly adapt to a
democratic system without causing social instability," adding that he
believes that with Taiwan's proven success in instituting democracy,
there is no reason why mainland China, with the same cultural
background, should not also be capable of a similar achievement.</P>
      <P>He added: "The true reason why the mainland has not yet
implemented democracy has nothing to do with Chinese people rejecting
it, but rather because under Beijing's totalitarian rule, people are
not allowed the opportunity to choose a different system."</P>
      <P>During the interview, the premier also mentioned that there are
differences between Confucianism and the Western concept of
democracy. Traditional Confucian thought emphasizes "humanism,"
believing a ruler must consider and take care of the basic needs of
the ruled.</P>
      <P>He cited an example which states that while under Western
democracy, a ruler must have the consent of those ruled, similar
concepts do not exist in Confucianism.</P>
      <P>If traditional Chinese culture has helped build democracy in
Taiwan, Siew said, he believes one of the distinguishing qualities of
Chinese culture is "its ability to incorporate a diversity of
characteristics from other cultures."</P>
      <P>He told McGuigan that history shows that the Chinese people are
accepting of and able to learn from different value systems.
Accordingly, although the values of democracy are not the focus of
Chinese Confucian culture, "having understood that democracy is a
global trend that meets the needs of human nature, we are very
pleased to study and accept it," the ROC premier said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US RELIGIOUS LEADERS SAID HAVING BEEN DECEIVED BY BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Rome,  April 1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several clergymen of Chinese descent in Rome
said Tuesday that the three American religious leaders who visited
mainland China in February have been deceived by communist Chinese
leaders.</P>
      <P>A three-member delegation of American religious leaders made a
20-day visit to mainland China in February to study freedom of
worship there. The three religious leaders are Rabbi Arthur
Schneier, president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation;
Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of
Newark, and the Rev. Don Argue, president of the National Association
of Evangelicals.
 During the visit, they failed to visit the 30 "religious
prisoners" they had planned to see. They spent most of the time in
visiting the places Beijing officials wanted them to see, the
clergymen said.</P>
      <P>They issued statements soon after the visit, saying that the
Vatican should establish diplomatic relations with Beijing in order
to put religious persecution on the Chinese mainland to an end.</P>
      <P>The clergymen, who declined to be named, said communist Chinese
officials are smart in propaganda and are notorious for their skill
to fool foreigners by giving false presentation and deceiving
information.</P>
      <P>If US religious leaders want to find out the real condition of
religious freedom on the Chinese mainland, they have to do it
through "private channels," and try to understand the true nature of
the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Some worshippers from the underground churches in mainland China
have said recently in Rome that they have suffered from more than 20
years of religious persecution because of their loyalty to the
Vatican.</P>
      <P>They said that they were disappointed to hear that some
officials of the Holy See are advocating the establishment of
diplomatic relations with communist China, and that they would be
psychologically unable to accept the communist-controlled "patriotic
churches" in mainland China after the establishment of diplomatic
relations.</P>
      <P>The Chinese communists see religion as "rulers' opium" to numb
the people, and believe that God shall be overthrown by the historical
power of the proletariat, the worshippers from mainland China said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE BUDGET REJECTED BY LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office budget for fiscal
year 1999 was rejected in a preliminary review at the Legislative
Yuan on Wednesday, as a gesture of dissatisfaction with ROC President
Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>It was the first time in ROC history that legislators have
refused to screen a Presidential Office budget.</P>
      <P>At a joint conference of the legislative judiciary and budget
committees, a proposal to refuse to screen the budget was passed by a
9-2 vote, with most of the legislators on hand representing the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Less than 20 minutes
later, the budgets for the National Security Council and the Academia
Historica, two institutions under supervision of the Presidential
Office, met the same fate.</P>
      <P>When the joint meeting opened on Wednesday morning, DPP
Legislator Su Huahn-dji proposed that the Presidential Office budget
of over NT$980 million (US$29.87 million) be rejected on the grounds
that President Lee should take responsibility for a recent series of
aviation disasters and military scandals.</P>
      <P>Su claimed that because of pressure from Lee, Premier Vincent
Siew did not remove Minister of Transportation and Communications
Tsay Jaw-yang at an earlier date, and has been unable to demand that
Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling step down over a snowballing
military-related string of scandals.</P>
      <P>Su went on to remind his colleagues that it was Lee who
engineered the National Assembly's move to strip the Legislature of
powers to check the Executive Yuan during last year's constitutional
reform.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislator Shu thus proposed to immediately
suspend all discussions and reject the budget. Despite strong
protests from ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Liu Kwang-hwa,
meeting chairman Lin Chou-shui of the DPP put the motion to suspend
discussion to a vote. It was approved by 10-1 vote, with the support
of New Party Legislator Lee Ching-hua. Immediately following, the
move to reject the Presidential Office budget was passed by 9 votes
to 2 votes.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chiu Chui-chen further proposed that the National
Security Council budget of NT$120 million and the NT$140 million
Academia Historica budget be rejected as a means of expressing anger
over what he called Lee's meddling with Premier Siew's power to
decide his cabinet members. The proposal was also supported in two
successive votes.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus later condemned the moves, vowing to reverse the
meeting's decisions. According to screening procedure on budgets at
Legislative Yuan, the budgets rejected in the first reading will be
sent directly to the Conference of Joint Committees for a second
reading. As the KMT is the largest party in the Legislative Yuan, the
budgets are expected to be approved without meeting much difficulty.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General to the President Huang Kun-huei, who was
present at Wednesday's meeting without having a chance to defend the
president, said that the Presidential Office helps to carry out
public policies, and that if its budget is eliminated, the citizens
of the ROC will be the ultimate losers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said on
Wednesday that he is not in favor of President Lee Teng-hui visiting
Palau.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks in response to press queries about local
media reports that Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the Business Management
Committee of the Kuomintang (KMT), is pushing for Lee to tour Palau
in May to preside over the inauguration of a KMT-invested hotel in
the western Pacific republic.</P>
      <P>"If consulted, I will recommend that the president not go," Hu
said.</P>
      <P>The KMT Business Management Committee, the business arm of the
ruling party, rejected the accuracy of the reports in a press release
later in the day.</P>
      <P>Also denying the reports, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Roy Wu said
that his ministry has so far received no instructions, nor has itself
had any plans, to make arrangements for the "vacation diplomacy"
foray by the president.</P>
      <P>Trade and economic relations between Taiwan and Palau have been
growing recently along with the exchanges of visits by ranking
officials of the two sides. But there have been no indications that
the two nations plan to forge formal diplomatic ties anytime soon.</P>
      <P>In October 1995, then Vice Foreign Minister Fang Chin-yen visited
Palau to attend a ceremony marking the first anniversary of Palau's
independence. Two years later, Minister Without Portfolio Shirley Kuo
flew to Palau as the special envoy of President Lee for the
inauguration of Palau's President Kunio Nakamura.</P>
      <P>Nakamura visited Taipei in March and August 1995, and again on
May 18, 1996, when he attended the swearing in of Lee as the first
popularly elected president of the ROC and officiated at the opening
of the Palau's honorary consulate in Taipei.</P>
      <P>But officials with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have
complained that Palau has been wavering in its attitude about
entering into full diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>They are of the opinion that it would make no sense for President
Lee to visit Palau before official ties between the two nations are
established.</P>

      <P>An April Fools' Day joke in the
Australian Salvation Army's weekly that claimed Australian Prime
Minister John Howard wants to abolish Easter holidays because
Australia is now a multicultural country isn't getting laughs from
everyone.</P>
      <P>Thousands of copies of the weekly featuring the Howard joke are
being distributed to Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and
Tasmania. But more than 20,000 other copies of the publication are
being pulped in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian
Capital Territory because the joke is regarded as in "bad taste."</P>
      <P>"I feel we tied April Fools' Day with Easter in a tasteful way.
But I accept that other territories have the right to make their own
decisions, and I have no problems with that at all," the weekly's
editor-in-chief Pam Trigg said in Melbourne.</P>
      <P>The weekly said Howard stated it is "inappropriate in a
multicultural society to provide a special holiday for one religious
celebration and not for the holy days of other religious groups."</P>
      <P>The weekly said it was only joking and that it had tried to marry
the story with an Easter message. Many would find it equally

      <P>Relations between former allies Taiwan and South Korea have been
strained since 1992, when Seoul abruptly switched diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Bilateral ties began to thaw after the financial crisis drained
South Korea's foreign reserves late last year and forced leaders to
look to cash-laden Taiwan as a possible source of foreign investment.
The election of Kim Dae Jung, who promised to better relations with

      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang on
Wednesday stressed the importance of obtaining government permission
for Taiwan investments on the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>In an interpellation at the Legislative Yuan, Yeh Chu-lan, an
opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislator representing
Taipei City, asked the minister whether Y.C. Wang, chairman of the
Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), had violated government policy with his
decision to pursue an investment project on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The tycoon announced on Sunday that the FPG will temporarily back
off its investment in a US$3 billion thermal power plant in
Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, by selling 60 percent of the shares it
controls to a foreign company in the United States. But he added the
FPG will buy back the shares after the ROC government eases current
restrictions under its "no haste, be patient" mainland investment
policy.</P>
      <P>In his reply, Minister Wang said that Y.C. Wang is required to
obtain ROC government permission in order to invest in projects on
the mainland. He added that under such a premise, if the government
were to permit ROC nationals to directly invest in the mainland in
the future, the FPG could certainly do so. And in that event, not
only can it buy back its shares in the Zhangzhou thermal power plant,
it could also invest in other projects.</P>
      <P>After hearing the minister's reply, Legislator Yeh criticized the

stimulus package later this month in an effort to rekindle the
flagging Japanese economy, sources from the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA tallies, Japanese investment in Taiwan, which
is mainly focused on high-tech manufacturing, has grown steadily over
the past several years.</P>
      <P>The Japanese channeled some US$850 million into Taiwan in 1997
for various investment projects, posting a whopping increase of 60
percent from the previous year. Japanese investment in Taiwan totaled
only about US$200 million in 1993.</P>
      <P>More Japanese companies in semiconductor, information technology
and electronics manufacturing are considering the relocation of
operations to Taiwan to take advantage of the island's skilled work
force and relatively competitive production costs, according to MOEA
officials.</P>
      <P>Yin and his group will call on relevant Japanese government
officials as well as trade and industrial leaders during their stay
in Tokyo and Osaka.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the MOEA on
Friday announced a six-pronged initiative to correct Taiwan's chronic
trade imbalance with Japan.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics from the ROC Directorate-General of Customs
show that Taiwan posted a record trade deficit of US$1.81 billion
with Japan in March, the highest single-month figure ever.</P>
      <P>That performance pushed the island's trade deficit with Japan in
the first quarter of 1998 to US$4.73 billion. BOFT officials said the
gap is expected to widen further if the sluggish Japanese economy
does not emerge from the shadow of a crippling recession.</P>
      <P>The officials said several key factors will make it difficult to
narrow the imbalance, including fewer Japanese orders for Taiwan-made
electrical machinery and related tools, for years the backbone of
local exports to Japan, because of the depreciation of the Japanese
yen.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan pork product exports to Japan were devastated
following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease at Taiwan hog farms
in March 1997. And greater demands for Japanese know-how and
equipment by Taiwan's manufacturing industries have increased local
imports from Japan.</P>
      <P>To help narrow the persistent trade gap in favor of Japan, the
BOFT devised six measures as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Continuing to host Taiwan product exhibitions in Japan;</P>
      <P>-- Organizing more trade missions to Japan, where Taiwan
businessmen can meet Japanese importers at trade promotion seminars
and workshops;</P>
      <P>-- Establishing more after-sale service centers and distribution
hubs in Japan for Taiwan-made products;</P>
      <P>-- Encourage more Japanese purchases from Taiwan, and inviting
Japanese trade associations, banks, department stores and chain store
operators to visit Taiwan;</P>
      <P>-- Strengthening publicity efforts in Japan for Taiwan-made
products; and</P>
      <P>-- Continuing attempts to remove Japanese trade barriers to
Taiwan products and expediting negotiations with Tokyo over the
resumption of Taiwan shipments of grape and processed meat products
to Japan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Family members of a missing fisherman
from Keelung, northern Taiwan, asked the government on Friday to help
them find their loved one and three of his companions.</P>
      <P>The fisherman, identified as 36-year-old Chen Tsun-chui, was the
chief engineer of the Keelung-registered "Chin Hsin 22" fishing
vessel, which sank Monday night south of the Zhoushan Islands, off
mainland China's eastern coast, after a fire broke out.</P>
      <P>Four of the six persons onboard remain missing, with only the
captain, identified as Tsai Wuan-tsai, and a mainland Chinese fishing
worker named Lin Chih-ming, being rescued.</P>
      <P>Tsai told CNA that he and Lin had reached Keelung on Thursday.
When discussing the incident, Tsai, who appeared highly distraught,
said the engine room of his boat had caught fire on Monday evening.</P>
      <P>After failing to control the fire, the crew abandoned the vessel
by jumping into the sea, he said, adding that he and Lin were rescued
by a mainland fishing boat after drifting for more than 20 hours.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he was unaware of the whereabouts of the other four
crewmen after leaving the sinking boat.</P>

    <HEADLINE>5 TAIWAN FIRMS ACCUSED OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  9  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>California-based Oak Technology Inc.
filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission (ITC) on
Thursday, accusing five Taiwan companies of infringing upon its
patented CD-ROM driver controllers production technology.</P>
      <P>Oak also demanded in its appeal that the US government ban
imports of CD-ROM drivers manufactured by the five Taiwan companies
with pirated Oak technical expertise and personal computers equipped
with those drivers in accordance with US Customs law.</P>
      <P>The ITC, a federal body, must decide by May 8 whether to launch
an investigation into the matter. The probe will take at least 15
months to complete, unless the parties involved settle their disputes
privately beforehand.</P>
      <P>The five companies facing the accusations are United
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), Lite-On Technology Corp., Lite-On
Group, MediaTek, and Aopen.</P>
      <P>Complaints by Oak against major Taiwan electronics companies have
taken many twists and turns. It first filed a grievance with the ITC
on July 22, 1997, accusing nine companies, including Winbond and UMC
of Taiwan and seven others in Singapore and Malaysia, of infringing
upon two Oak patents related to CD-ROM controllers. A week later, UMC
managed to reach a settlement with Oak, which then withdrew its
complaint.</P>
      <P>For its part, the ITC decided on Aug. 19 last year to start
probes into the Oak allegations against Winbond. Before long, Oak
came forward again, accusing UMC of violating their previous
agreement. It claimed that UMC had continued producing and selling
CD-ROM controllers with pirated Oak expertise through an unlisted
company, MediaTek. Oak filed a breach of contract lawsuit against UMC
in a US federal court last October.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Oak reached an agreement with Winbond earlier this
week over the patent rights dispute, in which Winbond agreed to pay
an unspecified amount of royalties to Oak.</P>
      <P>But on Thursday, Oak unexpectedly took new action against UMC and
four other Taiwan firms, asking the ITC to investigate alleged patent
infringement and to ban import into the United States of all related
products manufactured by those companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STOCK TRANSACTION TAX EXPECTED TO HIT RECORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Revenues generated from the stock
transaction tax are expected to top a record NT$120 billion (US$3.65
billion) in fiscal year 1998, sources from the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The MOF collected NT$94.85 billion (US$2.88 billion) in revenues
from transactions on the stock market in the first three quarters of
the current fiscal year, which began on July 1, 1997, representing a
stunning 165.8 percent of the projected goal of NT$57.2 billion set
for the same period.</P>
      <P>Based on a conservative estimate of an average NT$12 billion in
daily transactions on the Taiwan Stock Exchange for the remainder of
the current fiscal year, tax revenues generated from the stock trade
are expected to easily reach NT$120 billion for FY 1998, breaking the
previous record of NT$110 billion posted in FY 1990, said Hsu
Kuo-chung, director of the MOF's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Total national tax revenues amounted to NT$146.1 billion (US$4.44
billion) in March alone. Intakes from nearly all tax categories,
including customs tariffs, commodity taxes and business taxes, have
shown remarkable increases in the past month, the only exception
being revenues from incremental taxes on land value as a result of a
sluggish real estate sector in recent months, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of March, the island's overall tax revenues
amounted to NT$985.4 billion (US$29.95 billion) for the first nine
months of FY 1998, which ends on June 30, marking an increase of
NT$117.4 billion (US$3.57 billion) over the corresponding period of
the last fiscal year, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIVIL CODE LEGAL RESIDENCE PROVISION DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices (COGJ) on
Friday declared unconstitutional a Civil Code provision concerning
the designation of a married couple's legal residence.</P>
      <P>Article 1002 of the Civil Code stipulates that a wife shall take
the domicile of her husband as her legal residence, unless otherwise
agreed by the parties involved.</P>
      <P>According to a COGJ interpretation issued on Friday, the
provision is contrary to the spirit of Article 7 of the ROC
Constitution, because it fails to take into account the wife's right
to choose her legal residence as well as the particular needs of
specific couples.</P>
      <P>Article 7 of the Constitution says: "All citizens of the Republic
of China, irrespective of sex, religion, race, class or party
affiliation, shall be equal before the law."</P>
      <P>The council made the interpretation at the request of Chen
Li-feng, an ROC citizen who asked the council earlier this year to
clarify whether a Taiwan High Court verdict based on the Civil Code
provision concerning her legal residence violates Article 7 of the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>At Friday's COGJ meeting, the 15 participating grand justices
unanimously agreed that the Civil Code stipulation regarding a wife's
legal residence is unconstitutional. The meeting was presided over by
Judicial Yuan President Shih Chi-yang.</P>
      <P>With the council's ruling, the Civil Code provision will be
invalidated within a year.</P>
      <P>The COGJ interpretation also maintains that even if a couple do
not establish a joint legal residence, husband and wife are
nevertheless under mutual obligation to live together.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO HELP BUSINESSES DEAL WITH DUMPING CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on
Friday that it has worked out a series of measures to help businesses
cope with dumping charges.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials noted that between January 1997 and March 1998, a
total of 28 separate cases involving dumping charges have been filed
by foreign countries against Taiwan products.</P>
      <P>This is in contrast to only six cases filed against Taiwan
manufacturers over a two-year period from 1995 to 1996.</P>
      <P>The officials also cited statistics from the United States
indicating that, since 1995, US businesses have filed a total of 69
cases accusing foreign producers of dumping goods in the US market.
Among them, 10 complaints involved products from mainland China,
followed by nine cases against Japanese goods. Taiwan and South Korea
each were involved in seven cases.</P>
      <P>To help businesses cope with mounting allegations of dumping
activities, the BOFT has worked out a package of short-term measures,
which will involve providing information and consultation services,
the holding of seminars to provide technical guidance, and assistance
from the ROC's overseas offices.</P>
      <P>Long-term measures include encouraging businesses to establish
sound accounting systems to prevent exported products from being sold
below fair value in overseas markets, and to set up legal affairs
departments that can keep abreast of the latest international trade
regulations so as to avoid dumping charges, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that while carbon steel tubing, stainless
steel wire rods, along with bicycles and their parts, have been
frequent targets of dumping charges in the past, information products
are rapidly becoming another problem area. They cited the example of
Taiwan static random access memory (SRAM) chip manufacturers and fax
machine exporters that are facing dumping charges in the United
States and Europe Union, respectively.</P>
      <P>The BOFT officials said that information industry enterprises in
Taiwan must be on special guard against dumping charges.</P>
      <P>The government will encourage local semiconductor businesses to
sign with their foreign counterparts agreements aimed at stepping up
the collection and exchange of data on production and distribution to
help reduce the number of dumping cases, they said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Friday warned that haze has blanketed Brunei and much of Kalimantan
Island, and urged people to avoid visiting that area until the
situation improves.</P>
      <P>Tsai Jung-hsiang, MOFA deputy director for East Asian and Pacific
affairs, said at a news conference that the Air Pollution Index (API)
in Brunei has risen since mid-March to 500, well into the "hazardous"
category, while visibility in that Southeast Asian country has
dropped below one kilometer.</P>
      <P>An API above 100 is classified as "unhealthy," while one above
200 is "very unhealthy" and above 300 is "hazardous."</P>
      <P>The haze caused by forest fires has risen to critical levels,
Tsai said, recommending that Taiwan people avoid traveling to the
affected area until the harmful smog disperses.</P>
      <P>Brunei is one of the favorite sightseeing spots for Taiwan
tourists.</P>
      <P>Citing reports from the MOFA's representative offices in the
Southeast Asia region, Tsai said last year's forest fires that were
exacerbated by drought have not all been extinguished yet.</P>
      <P>He told reporters that according to satellite data, there are at
present about 5,000 separate fires, mostly in Kalimantan. The
stricken area, including a wildlife preserve, covers a total of
150,000 hectares.</P>
      <P>The official, citing an assessment by Indonesian environmental
authorities, said the fires are expected to be more widespread this
year than before. If the fires aren't efficiently controlled, they
could spread to another 15,000 hectares of land, the assessment
warned.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday accused
Beijing of being incapable of facing the reality that Taiwan and
mainland China are two separate political entities administered by
different governments.</P>
      <P>He said this failure is the key factor causing the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait to remain deadlocked in a chronic political
impasse.</P>
      <P>Siew said that political separation across the Taiwan Strait is
not a permanent condition, and the fact that Taiwan and mainland
China are ruled by separate administrations is not the primary
obstacle to unification of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Siew said that, as it
takes two to tango, both sides must make the best of every
opportunity for improved relations.</P>
      <P>Taipei's termination of the Temporary Provisions for Suppression
of the Communist Rebellion in May 1991 highlighted the reality of
Taiwan's political separation from the mainland, Siew pointed out,
adding that this recognition has since served as a basis for seeking
improved relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>While it is a fact that both Taiwan and the mainland comprise
China, it is also an undeniable truth that the two sides are
administered under separate political entities. Neither of these
conditions should be disregarded when the issue of cross-strait
relations is addressed, Siew asserted.</P>
      <P>Siew urged the Beijing authorities to temporarily set aside
sovereignty disputes and concentrate instead on efforts to improve
cross-strait ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAA TO REINSTATE RIGOROUS ID CHECKING FOR AIR PASSENGERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
has asked domestic airlines to rigorously implement identification
verification processes at check-in counters for all boarding
passengers, effective Friday.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said the step was necessary to increase flight
security as well as to protect the legal rights of passengers.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that between 1993 and 1997, a dozen people were
found to have sneaked into Taiwan aboard planes from the mainland,
while three people flew from Taiwan's offshore islands to illegally
enter the mainland.</P>
      <P>Although only a small number of stowaways was found to have
entered or departed Taiwan proper through Penghu in the Taiwan
Strait, where ID checks for boarding passengers are not required, CAA
officials said that security loophole poses a potential threat to
society.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that before 1993, passengers were required to
show ID cards when purchasing air tickets, reporting to check-in
counters and prior to boarding their flights.</P>
      <P>The multiple checks were deemed to be a source of inconvenience
for passengers, and the CAA later dropped the preboarding
verification requirement, except for flights to and from Kinmen and
Matsu, two islands off the coast of mainland China.</P>
      <P>While the CAA has never formally scrapped the check-in counter ID
requirements, hectic flight schedules have caused most domestic
airlines to become lax in enforcing the regulation. As a result, the
occurrence of passengers other than the original ticket holders
boarding planes on domestic flights has become increasingly
commonplace.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that 35 million passengers take domestic flights
every year, and the number is increasing.</P>
      <P>CAA officials noted that in case of accidents, lack of proper
verification could cause problems in securing the legal rights of
passengers.</P>
      <P>CAA has therefore decided that verification procedures must be
rigorously implemented from now on. Otherwise, the airline companies
will face stiff fines of between NT$600,000 and NT$3 million
(US$18,180 and US$90,910), a business suspension or even the
revocation of operating licenses.</P>
      <P>The decision to rigorously enforce the regulations came in the
wake of a controversy over whether a certain passenger was actually
aboard the ill-fated Formosa Airlines plane which crashed last month
off Hsinchu, killing all 13 persons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN WATERFRONT WAR INTENSIFYING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The waterfront battle between Patrick
Stevedores Ltd. and union workers is intensifying with the company
being forced to airlift its nonunion labor to thwart a blockade by
protesting unionists.</P>
      <P>Patrick, one of the two leading stevedoring firms in Australia
and the center of the dispute with the Maritime Union of Australia
(MUA), on Thursday chartered helicopters to airlift newly hired
nonunion workers to docks at Port Botany near Sydney after its staff
and workers were chased into the terminal amid a shower of bricks,
stones and water from hoses turned on them by tugboats.</P>
      <P>Patrick is expected to charter more helicopters to airlift its
replacement workers if similar incidents happen at other major ports
where the company operates, according to chief executive Chris
Corrigan.</P>
      <P>He said, "If anyone is looking at the footage of security guards
and dogs (patrolling the terminal) and wondering why they're there,
(it is because) there is violence being perpetrated against our
employees."</P>
      <P>Patrick's nonunion workers are scheduled to begin stevedoring its
first vessel, owned by the Australian National Line, on Sunday. And
then other workers will follow suit at other major ports, including
Melbourne, Brisbane, Townsville and Fremantle.</P>
      <P>Patrick has ignored a federal court injunction which is designed
to stop the company from hiring contract workers.</P>
      <P>After failing to blockade the operations of Patrick, MUA's
national secretary John Coombs said his union will launch a fresh
wave of legal moves against Patrick, Workplace Relations Minister
Peter Reith and the National Farmers Federation's stevedoring
companies.</P>
      <P>Coombs said the MUA and its members plan to block ships to
Patrick's docks in a bid to force a backdown.</P>
      <P>"We intend to make sure Corrigan's got no business, got no ships,
got no cargo, moving over his ports," he said.</P>
      <P>If his legal action fails again, Coombs said, the MUA will rely
on the London-based International Transport Workers Federation using
its clout to warn shippers not to berth in Patrick's terminals in
other countries where the company has operations.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Thursday in Canberra, Prime Minister John
Howard accused the MUA of hindering waterfront reforms and said the
union organization had ill-served its members. Therefore, the MUA has
to face the consequences, he said.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the battle between Patrick and the MUA and other
unions is expected to continue escalating until some kind of solution
is found. No one can predict when the war will end, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO SAFETY VIOLATION DISCOVERED AT WARNER VILLAGE CINEMA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Building safety inspectors with the Taipei
City Government conducted a surprise spot check of safety
facilities at the Warner Village Cinema on Friday, but did not
discover any negligence or irregularities.</P>
      <P>The unannounced safety inspection followed Wednesday's tragic
incident at the cinema, in which a woman's head became wedged between
the ceiling and an escalator handrail.</P>
      <P>The officials with the Office of Safety Standards under the city
government's Bureau of Public Works said they found no violations of
safety regulations after completing a thorough inspection of the
cinema's emergency exits, firefighting equipment, construction
materials, fire protectation zones, escalators and other related
safety facilities.</P>
      <P>The officials said new warning signs have also been erected
between the ceilings and escalators at the cinema, and that all
escalators are operating normally.</P>
      <P>As no irregularities were discovered, the officials said, the
bureau might have no legal basis to become involved in handling the
recent tragic incident.</P>
      <P>Lai Hung-yin, 20, was making her way up to a third-floor
screening room at the new cinema complex when the incident occurred
at about 7:00 p.m. Wednesday. She has since been in a deep coma.</P>
      <P>The Hsinyi precinct under the Taipei City Police Headquarters
has transferred the case to prosecution authorities. The cinema
management faces a charge of involuntary or unintentional injury.</P>
      <P>Following the accident, criticism arose as to whether the cinema
complex had been satisfactorily examined by government inspectors.
Taipei City Government officials said the building had passed all
the required safety checks and met rigorous safety standards.</P>
      <P>The Warner Village Cinema opened shortly before the Chinese New
Year holiday in late January.</P>
      <P>A senior cinema executive was quoted by the local press as
saying that Warner Village's concern at this point is helping the
injured girl and family. The executive said the cinema currently has
representatives with the family and will contribute substantially to
the girl's medical costs and welfare.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAX EVASION BEHIND LARGE FOREIGN ENTERPRISE DEFICIT: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign enterprises in the Chinese
mainland commonly dodge taxes there by running superficially in the
red, according to a report from a mainland Chinese news service.</P>
      <P>An official investigation in mainland China revealed more than 70
percent of foreign firms there have been operating at a deficit, but
the fact that few of them have withdrawn their capital from the
Chinese mainland indicates that these deficits are actually a means
of dodging taxes, remarked the China News Service on Thursday, adding
that this is a problem that must be taken seriously.</P>
      <P>Statistics based on foreign enterprises' income tax data, which
was gathered by the State General Administration of Taxation under
the State Council, show that 54.07 percent of foreign enterprises
were in the red in 1993, with that figure escalating to 63.28 percent
in 1994 and 70.29 percent in 1995, the news service reported, noting
that in some provinces the levels reached between 80 and 90 percent.</P>
      <P>Foreign enterprise investments ran a total deficit of 55.24
billion Chinese yuan (US$6.67 billion) in 1996, a 48.69 percent
increase over the previous year's level, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Many of these deficits, however, are artificial and aimed at
avoiding taxes, it said.</P>
      <P>Tax authorities monitored more than 47,000 foreign enterprises in
1991-1995, and found that these dodged a total of 4.2 billion yuan in
taxes, said the report, which noted that these firms accounted for
only about 25 percent of the total number of foreign enterprises
doing business in the Chinese mainland during that period.</P>
      <P>The report attributed the huge number of foreign enterprises
reporting deficits to how foreign businesses are taxed. Because taxes
on foreign enterprises are levied starting from the "profit year,"
firms have been postponing this time by increasing investment costs
and underreporting profits, resulting in deficits that are actually
superficial, it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE AIR FORCE RECEIVES ADVANCED F-16 JET IN US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, April 10 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has received the first of its
new C/D version of the F-16 Fighting Falcon -- a superior jet fighter
that will extend the capability of the Republic of Singapore Air
Force (RSAF), The Straits Times reported Friday in a dispatch from
Fort Worth, Texas.</P>
      <P>The sleek fighter is the first of Singapore's purchase of a full
squadron of 18 F-16C/Ds under a 1994 order made with the US-based
Lockheed Martin. The remaining 17 are scheduled for delivery at
regular intervals over a period of more than a year, the report said.</P>
      <P>During the roll-out ceremony in Fort Worth, Texas, on Thursday,
Lt. Gen. Bey Soo Khiang, the chief of Singapore's defense force, said
that the acquisition was a "quantum leap" for the RSAF.</P>
      <P>"The addition of the multi-role F-16C/D to the RSAF's Order of
Battle represents a quantum leap in the capability of the RSAF to
achieve our superiority over the skies of Singapore and contributes
to the ability of the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) to fulfill its
mission," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"The aircraft, with its superior performance characteristics,
technologies and capabilities, will not only greatly extend the
operational envelope of the RSAF but also usher the RSAF into new
dimensions of air warfare."</P>
      <P>A flight demonstration of the F-16 followed the ceremony, the
report said.</P>
      <P>In Singapore, the Defense Ministry said in a statement that the
purchase is a step in the "ongoing modernization" of the RSAF.</P>
      <P>The RSAF has been gearing up for the new-generation F-16C/D, one
of the most sophisticated fighters in the world and used by Israel,
South Korea and the US Air Force and Navy.</P>
      <P>Singapore pilots, engineers and technicians have been training on
all aspects of the fighter -- using leased F-16C/D aircraft -- since
January 1996 at the Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, Arizona.</P>
      <P>Bey also highlighted the value of training in the United States.</P>
      <P>"Besides providing RSAF pilots with the expanse of training
airspace they cannot find back home, the opportunity to fly the
F-16C/D in a quality environment of good training areas and
facilities, and realistic training programs and exercises, allows the
RSAF pilots to attain high professional standards in F-16C/D flying
and operations," he said.</P>
      <P>He told The Straits Times that the RSAF had evaluated various
aircraft -- including the F-18 -- for over a year from 1994 but
concluded that the F-16C/D was "a superior aircraft" and "markedly
different."</P>
      <P>Compared to the earlier F-16A/Bs, the C/Ds have stronger wings,
more powerful engines and better avionics.</P>
      <P>Besides the 18 F-16C/Ds ordered earlier by Singapore, a second
purchase of 12 more was made in 1997, bringing the total potential
fleet to 30 F-16C/Ds for the RSAF.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISA PROCESSING TIME FOR ALIEN WORKERS TO BE SHORTENED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The visa processing time for legal
foreign workers will be substantially shortened in the near
future, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chu Chien-yi, director-general of the MOFA's Bureau of Consular
Affairs, told a news conference that the ministry is establishing
computerized foreign workers information systems at its
representative offices in five Southeast Asian countries --
Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>"When those systems are completed by the end of June, the visa
processing time for foreign workers will be shortened from the
current one month to only about seven days as our offices in those
Southeast Asian countries will be able to contact responsible
government agencies at home through Internet or E-mail in handling
all related paperwork," Chu said.</P>
      <P>At present, about 250,000 foreign laborers are legally working
in Taiwan, contributing much to Taiwan's major construction
projects. About 136,000 of them come from Thailand, 103,000 from the
Philippines, 15,000 from Indonesia and 1,000 from Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Chu said as the government is also expected to open the
domestic job market to Vietnam in the future, the MOFA will also
establish a similar foreign worker information system at its
office in that country.</P>
      <P>Currently, local employers must first file visa applications with
the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) for foreign workers they intend to
hire. The CLA will then send all related documents to the MOFA's
offices in relevant Southeast Asian countries. The procedures
usually take one month to one-and-a-half months to complete.</P>
      <P>"With the completion of the computerized information networks,
the CLA will be able to send papers and other related data to
our overseas offices through E-mail, and vice versa," Chu explained.</P>
      <P>In addition to shortening the visa processing time, Chu said,
the new systems will also allow the MOFA's offices in the five
Southeast Asian countries to contact with the CLA, the Bureau of
Entry and Exit, as well as other relevant govenrment agenices
through Internet. "By so doing, we'll be able to exchange dynamic
information about foreign workers in our countries."</P>
      <P>The new systems are also expected to facilitate passport
inspection at airports, prevention of fraudulent use of passports,
tracking of health bills of foreign laborers and prevention of entry
of illegal workers, Chu added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Legislator Kao Hui-yu from the
opposition New Party suggested on Friday that her party and the
ruling Kuomintang should cooperate in the upcoming Taipei mayoral
election as well as in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a state affairs forum at the Legislative Yuan, Kao
pointed out that the KMT is in the embarrassing position of still not
having a candidate for the Taipei mayoral election to be held at the
end of this year.</P>
      <P>Kao said that since those opposed to incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen
Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party expect the KMT and New
Party to cooperate, the ruling party should back New Party candidate
Wang Chien-shien's run for Taipei mayor in exchange for the New
Party's support of the KMT candidate in the 2000 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Kao claimed that if her idea is followed, the New Party will
surely win the Taipei mayoral election this year and that the KMT
will have a better than 80 percent chance of retaining the presidency
in 2000. This would be the best form of "co-rule," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS IN PRIMARIES: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)) The opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) on Friday decided that more evidence is required before
it can dismiss one of its members on charges of cheating in the
primary elections held on March 29 to select DPP candidates for a
variety of year-end elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee said after a meeting that as
the allegations against incumbent Taipei City Councilor Liao
Ping-liang for his part in the scandal might not be an isolated case,
they decided that it would not be fair to punish Liao at present.</P>
      <P>The meeting also decided that the major opposition party should
conduct a thorough review and check the qualifications of the DPP
voters in Taipei City, Taipei County and Kaohsiung City, the three
regions that are home to most DPP members. Should any more
irregularities be discovered relating to the primaries, the party is
determined to impose severe punishment on those found responsible for
the cheating, the committee stressed.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting took place, it had been widely expected that
in order to show the party's determination to root out irregularities
in the primaries, the DPP leadership would accept suggestions made by
a DPP anti-bribery special task force that Liao be kicked out of the
party and the case be handed over to the prosecutor's office.</P>
      <P>Task force officers revealed on Thursday that acting on
information supplied by DPP member Hsu Yang-ming, who is seeking DPP
candidacy in the year-end legislative election, they found that Liao
had collected the national identification cards of 235 DPP members
and had changed the domicile addresses on the cards to addresses in
his constituency -- the eastern district of Taipei City -- thus
enabling them to vote for him.</P>
      <P>They claimed that most of the domicile addresses were found to be
either those of Liao's service offices or those of Liao's wife's
houses. After the balloting, the members were given money and asked
to apply for new ID cards.</P>
      <P>Liao, who is seeking reelection as city councilor in the eastern
district of Taipei City and who won the most votes in the primaries,
was present at the meeting to defend himself. Besides submitting
evidence to prove that at least part of the accusation is untrue,
Liao said that he is totally innocent, although he admitted that some
of his aides might have been responsible for the counterfeiting.</P>
      <P>As part of an effort to address the problem of irregularities in
the primary elections, the DPP has worked out a reformed nomination
system under which public opinion polls will make up 75 of the
nomination process, while the primaries will only account for the
remaining 25 percent. Meanwhile, the party's annual membership fee,
payment of which is a prerequisite for voting in the primaries, will
be cut from NT$1,000 to NT$100.</P>
      <P>The DPP held the islandwide primaries on March 29 to select
candidates for the year-end legislative elections as well as for the
mayorships and city councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung. Over 60 percent
of the 84,000 eligible DPP members turned out to vote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO BOOST EXPORTS TO US AND EUROPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid declining exports to neighboring
Asian countries, local economists have urged the government to take
measures to spur shipments to the United States and European
countries.</P>
      <P>Affected by shrinking exports to Japan, South Korea and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states in
recent months, Taiwan suffered a first-quarter trade deficit of US$70
million in 17 year, a stark contrast to the US$1.8 billion trade
surplus posted in the same period of 1997.</P>
      <P>As it will take time for Japan and the ASEAN countries to rebound
from the current economic downturn, economists said Taiwan shipments
to those countries may not increase in the short term, adding that
the government should move to boost domestic demand and spur exports
to the US and European countries as a way of maintaining stable
economic growth.</P>
      <P>Analyses carried out by the International Monetary Fund and the
Economic Intelligence Unit show that Thailand and Indonesia are
expected to post negative economic growth for 1998, while South Korea
will see zero growth, and only Malaysia will chart a 2-percent
economic growth rate this year.</P>
      <P>The sharp currency deprecations of the last few months, while
they might have helped boost the exports of Southeast Asian
countries, have also reduced import demand from those same countries.</P>
      <P>Compared to year-earlier figures, Thailand saw a drop of 8.6
percent in imports in December 1997, while its imports in January
plunged by 29.8 percent. Imports by South Korea fell by 39.6 percent
and 29.5 percent in January and February, respectively, while
Indonesia witnessed a reduction of 17.3 percent in imports in
December of last year.</P>
      <P>Sluggish local demand in Southeast Asian countries has also
resulted in declining demand for machinery facilities from Taiwan and
has affected Taiwan businesses' willingness to invest in those
countries, economists pointed out.</P>
      <P>T.C. Chen, professor of economic science at National Taiwan
University, opined that the government should target the US and
European countries, rather than Japan and other Asian countries, in
its efforts to increase exports.</P>
      <P>The US economy, which has improved steadily for the last seven
years, is expected to remain stable in the years ahead, Chen said,
adding that the European Union countries, fueled by the imminent
introduction of a common European currency, are also enjoying
improved economic fortunes.</P>
      <P>Since the Asian financial crisis is expected to continue taking a
heavy toll on Taiwan exports in the coming months, Chen said Taiwan
should turn the situation to its own advantage by exploring the
possibilities of shipments to Western countries.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) under the
Executive Yuan on Friday announced a course of action to
strengthen measures designed to prevent the spread of several new
cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) which have reappeared in
southern Taiwan's Tainan County.</P>
      <P>The measures include the use of eartags to prove that piglets
have been vaccinated against the disease, and hog raisers who violate
the regulation will face fines of between NT$10,000 and NT$50,000. In
addition, from August, hogs without the eartags will be prohibited
from going to auction or slaughter.</P>
      <P>The announcement was prompted by a report received on April 7 by
the Tainan County animal disease prevention office from the Tainan
County pork market on a number of pigs which had arrived at the
market with symptoms resembling FMD. Later diagnosis by the Taiwan
Research Institute for Animal Health confirmed the disease as Type O
FMD.</P>
      <P>Chen Bao-ji, director of the Animal Industry Department under the
COA, said on Friday that after tracing the infected pigs back to
their farm of origin, it was discovered that the farm in question has
been under investigation, and that the pig farmer, who failed to
produce vaccination papers, will be subject to a fine of between
NT$10,000 and NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that starting from the end of May, the COA will
strictly enforce a disinfecting program on pork markets and
pig-transport vehicles islandwide, adding that based on past
experience, the marketplace and vehicles are the most important

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although political leaders who took part
in the grand religious ceremony to greet the arrival in Taiwan of
what is believed to be a tooth of the Buddha on Thursday defended
their participation, more than one third of the respondents to a
public opinion poll opposed the politicians' involvement in the
activity.</P>
      <P>More than 50 percent of those polled believed the politicians
took part in the ceremony with a cynical hidden agenda of making some
personal political capital out of the event.</P>
      <P>However, most dismissed fears that the politicians' involvement
will stir up a popular fad for Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Opinion on whether the arrival of the tooth in Taiwan will bring
peace and prosperity to the island was divided equally, with about 30
percent saying that it will and the same percentage saying that it
won't.</P>
      <P>Although 32 percent of those polled said they believe the
presence of the relic will check the prevailing trend of violence on
the island, only 25.8 percent think the building of a temple to house
the tooth is warranted, while 34.6 percent oppose it and 37.6 percent
have no opinion.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 44 percent of those interviewed feel the
enthusiasm for religion triggered by the holy relic and a recent tour
around the island by the Tachia Matsu -- the goddess of the sea in
Chinese mythology -- will contribute to the island's social reform.</P>
      <P>The Buddha tooth was brought to Taiwan by a local temple with
great pageantry on Thursday. Government leaders, from Premier Vincent
Siew on down, flocked to greet it at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport.</P>
      <P>Although they argued that the arrival of the tooth is to ensure
peace and prosperity for the country, critics said politicians should
avoid taking part in religious activities in their official
capacities.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted via telephone by a local cable TV station,
interviewed 897 adults on Thursday and Friday with a margin of error
of 3 percentage points.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government on Friday rebutted an
accusation by mainland China that Taiwan is taking advantage of the
Asian region's financial woes to further its political agenda,
stressing that Taiwan will continue to offer assistance to crisis-hit
countries on a mutually beneficial basis.</P>
      <P>Roy Wu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, described
as a serious distortion of facts recent accusations by mainland
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and his deputy Qian Qichen that Taiwan is
trying to damage mainland China's relations with its diplomatic
allies amid the current Asian financial upheaval by deliberately
allowing the New Taiwan dollar to depreciate.</P>
      <P>The mild depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar is a natural
result of current trends and is also a clear reflection of Taiwan's
free market economy, which Wu said is far beyond comparison with
mainland China's controlled economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's aid proposals to neighboring countries hard hit by the
economic turmoil which broke out in July 1997 were worked out based
on humanitarian considerations and have won enthusiastic responses
from the countries concerned, Wu said, adding that contrary to
Beijing's accusations, they were not raised with any intention of
blocking mainland China's ties with those countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC, as a constructive member of the global village, is
willing to provide substantive assistance to help those countries
over their current difficulties, and will continue to do so in the
future under the framework of free market regulations, for the mutual
benefit of all concerned, Wu stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS AGAINST POSSIBLE DRAM DUMPING CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs warned on
Friday that US firms might file dumping charges against Taiwan-made
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips after scoring a victory in
their fight against Taiwan's alleged dumping of static random access
memory (SRAM) chips in the US market.</P>
      <P>Chen Jui-lung, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT), said that the US International Trade Commission (ITC) will on
Saturday unveil the reasons why on April 1 it upheld a ruling of the
US Department of Commerce (DOC) which subjects Taiwan's SRAM chip
makers to a variety of punitive dumping tariffs.</P>
      <P>Chen said that after the US Department of Commerce publishes the
ITC report, the punitive duties on Taiwan's SRAMs, ranging from 7.59
percent to 113.85 percent, will go into effect.</P>
      <P>According to the ruling, the SRAMS produced by Taiwan's Winbond
Electronics will be subject to a 102.83 percent punitive tariff,
while those from United Microelectronics Corp. will receive a tariff
of 93.87 percent, Alliance Semiconductor Corp.'s SRAMs will suffer a
50.58 percent tariff and such chips from Integrated Silicon Solution
Inc. will receive a 7.59 percent punitive tariff. Texas-Acer
Instruments, Best Integrated Technology and Advanced Microelectronics
will be subject to a 113.85 percent punitive tariff, while all other
Taiwan SRAM makers will receive a 41.98 percent punitive rate.</P>
      <P>Chen said that US and European Union chip makers are waiting for
publication of the ITC report to decide on their chances of bringing
dumping charges against Taiwan-made DRAMs. The report will state
whether the ruling was based on concern over a potential threat to US
SRAM makers or on fears that Taiwan's alleged dumping has already
caused substantial harm to the US SRAM industry.</P>
      <P>The BOFT will help local SRAM makers to appeal the case in the US
Federal Court of International Trade within 30 days of the report's
issue, Chen said, adding that if the ruling was based on a concern
about a potential threat, Taiwan makers will stand a better chance of
overturning the verdict.</P>
      <P>Chen warned that as the US makers are very likely to file dumping
charges against Taiwan's DRAMs, which are expected to deal a far more
serious blow to Taiwan if the charges stick, Taiwan DRAM makers
should take measures to respond to such a scenario.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung County Magistrate Liao Yung-lai
on Friday welcomed German chemical giant Bayer AG to invest in
high-tech low-polluting industries in the central Taiwan county,
three weeks after Bayer abandoned a NT$50 billion petrochemical
project there.</P>
      <P>Liao, who insisted that Bayer Taiwan's proposed project to
produce toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) in a facility to be constructed
in the Taichung Harbor area be subjected to a referendum, thus
forcing the project to be scrapped on March 18, arrived in Taipei on
Friday afternoon to visit Bayer Taiwan to try to sell his idea.</P>
      <P>Liao considers the TDI project to be a high-polluting industry.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party county magistrate
said that if Bayer Taiwan invests in high-tech low-polluting
industries, the local government will provide the company with the
necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>Liao pointed out that his opposition to the TDI project and his
decision to hold a referendum was only fulfilling campaign promises
he made to his constituents, adding that other investment cases will
not necessarily be subjected to referendum.</P>
      <P>He received a very lukewarm response from Bayer officials.</P>
      <P>John Chen, deputy general manager of Bayer Taiwan, reaffirmed
that Bayer Taiwan has no intention of continuing with the TDI project
in Taiwan and that the company has no other investment plans for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the Taichung harbor district land lease
contract for the setting up of the TDI plant has been approved by the
Taiwan Provincial Assembly, the contract has not been signed, and it
will be up to the parent company in Germany to decide whether the

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI UNDAUNTED IN CROSS-STRAIT EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Undaunted by Beijing's cold shoulder,
Taipei has decided to go ahead with an initiative calling for joint
cross-strait efforts to help Southeast Asian countries weather the
regional financial crisis.</P>
      <P>A Taipei mission to be headed by Shea Jia-dong, deputy governor
of the Central Bank of China (CBC), is scheduled to leave on Sunday
for the United States on a 12-day publicity tour to drum up American
support for the initiative.</P>
      <P>In a Friday seminar on the Southeast Asian financial storm and
cross-strait cooperation, Shea said Taiwan is both capable of and
serious about engaging in a salvation mission to help its Asian
neighbors, but at present, he added, the major hurdle to the mission
lies in the US attitude rather than in Beijing's opposition.</P>
      <P>Shea asserted that no country in the world has the right to
deprive the countries of Southeast Asia of seeking aid from Taiwan in
times of difficulty.</P>
      <P>Beijing's willingness to call off its boycott of Taiwan's
initiative would be beneficial to all parties concerned, he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he stressed that the CBC does not intend to drag down
the value of the New Taiwan dollar to stimulate export growth. If
there are no adverse factors on international monetary markets, the
CBC will continue to safeguard the NT dollar in order to avoid
causing a domino effect on other Southeast Asian currencies.</P>
      <P>Tien Hung-mao, director of the Institute for National Policy
Research, who was also present at the seminar, voiced his support for
the mission's upcoming US trip, saying that it is essential for
Taiwan to make itself heard internationally, since mainland China
receives most of the attention from world media, and dominates the
Chinese voice.</P>
      <P>As example of this, Tien lamented the fact that the Taiwan
initiative, voiced by both President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Vincent
Siew several days ago, received scant attention from the
international community.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, a professor of economics at National Taiwan
University, pointed out that Beijing's willingness to set sovereignty
disputes aside and cooperate with Taiwan would benefit not only the
trouble-ridden Southeast Asian countries, but also cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Beijing's refusal to even consider the initiative, he added, is
an infringement on the overall interests of the countries of
Southeast Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ZEALAND CONCERNED ABOUT DROP IN TAIWAN TOURISTS, IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Zealand is concerned about a downturn
in the number of tourists and immigrants from the Republic of China
on Taiwan, Frank Lin, ROC representative to that country, said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the two countries do not maintain formal
diplomatic ties, the ROC is currently New Zealand's seventh-largest
trading partner and its sixth-largest source of tourists.</P>
      <P>However, bilateral trade between Taiwan and New Zealand has
declined steadily since 1995 and the numbers of Taiwan tourists and
immigrants have also seen a downward streak.</P>
      <P>"The trends have caused concern among New Zealand officials,"
said Lin, who returned to Taipei earlier this week for home
consultations.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, New Zealand has issued immigration permits to
more than 35,000 ROC nationals over the past 10 years, and about
70-to-80 percent of them have actually moved to New Zealand.</P>
      <P>"As most Taiwan immigrants have capital, professional expertise
and experience, they have become an increasingly important force in
New Zealand society," the de facto ROC ambassador to New Zealand
said.</P>
      <P>Lin further said the country attaches great importance to its
substantive ties with the ROC. In addition to sending cabinet
ministers to visit Taiwan and stationing an ambassadorial-level
career diplomat here, New Zealand is also mulling new measures to
boost relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said New Zealand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a
Taiwan Information Paper in April 1996 which acknowledged that
ROC-New Zealand relations can no longer proceed totally outwith an
official framework. "It's no longer a problem for staff members of
(the Taipei) representative office there to meet with New Zealand
officials or parliamentarians to discuss matters of mutual concern,"
he pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to New Zealand government tallies, tourist arrivals
from Taiwan totaled 65,000 in 1995, but the number declined to 55,000
in 1996, further dropping to 45,000 in 1997. Each Taiwan tourist
spends an average of NZ$2,500 (about US$1,387.5) in New Zealand.
Against this background, Lin said, the decline in tourist arrivals
from Taiwan is causing widespread concern.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, immigrants from Taiwan have also decreased in recent
years. "Some New Zealand officials think the decline might have
something to do with the anti-Asian immigrant rhetoric of some
candidates during New Zealand's 1996 parliamentary election," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>In fact, Lin said, both the government and people of New Zealand
welcome Taiwan immigrants, tourists and investors. "Wellington Mayor
Mark Blumsky has said on many occasions that ROC nationals are
welcome in his country," Lin said, adding that Blumsky is scheduled
to visit Taiwan next year to attract Taiwan tourists and investors.</P>

      <P>Police at the Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
International Airport had an unusually exhausting Saturday night when
they had to conduct comprehensive safety checks to decide whether two
bomb threats targeting international flights operated by local
airliners were hoaxes.</P>
      <P>The first bomb threat came at around 8:15 p.m. when the Cathay
Pacific Airways counter at the airport received an unidentified
telephone call, claiming that a bomb had been placed on the Hong
Kong-bound China Airlines (CAL) flight 617. The aircraft with 73
passengers aboard was on the runway preparing for takeoff.</P>
      <P>Airport police immediately had the plane towed off the runway to
allow a thorough investigation to take place, while the passengers
were taken to the nearby Transit Hotel.</P>
      <P>After an intensive search of the aircraft and passengers'
luggage, police determined at 10:30 p.m. that the bomb threat was a
hoax, and after a nearly three-hour delay, the plane departed for
Hong Kong at 11:50 p.m.</P>
      <P>However, as police were busy handling the CAL bomb threat,
another unidentified telephone call reached the airport police
station at 8:40 p.m., this time claiming that EVA Airways flight No.
016 and Thai Airways flight No. 766 were to be hijacked.</P>
      <P>Although a check revealed that there was no Thai Airways flight
No. 766, the EVA Airways flight No. 017 was scheduled to take off for
Los Angeles at 11:50 p.m. A thorough check was conducted to make sure
no explosive device had been placed aboard the aircraft and the
flight was permitted to depart for Los Angeles at 11:50 p.m. as
scheduled.</P>
      <P>Police said they have launched an investigation into the
identities of the men who made the phone calls, warning that anyone
who is caught carrying out hoaxes that might endanger flight safety
will face up to three-year jail terms or fines of up to NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Local airlines have been troubled by a series of hoax bomb
threats over the past few weeks. The last such hoax occurred some two
weeks ago on March 29, when the CAL counter at the Shungshan domestic
airport received a call claiming that there was a bomb aboard a
Taipei-Kaohsiung flight which was already airborne. Earlier that same
day, a bomb threat had forced a Macau-bound TransAsia Airways flight
to return to Hsiaokang International Airport at Kaohsiung.</P>

      <P>The present exchange rates of the New
Taiwan dollar and Japanese yen against the US dollar -- currently
about 33 and 130, respectively, to the greenback -- are reasonable
and acceptable, said Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the Taipei-based China

Japan should be capable of defending the value of its currency and
that he believes the present exchange rate of 130 yen for one US
dollar is reasonable.</P>
      <P>Regarding whether a lower yen would put pressure on the NT
dollar and the mainland Chinese yuan to depreciate, Liu said as long
as the Japanese yen remains stronger than 140 to the US dollar,the NT

    <TEXT>
      <P>A grand Buddhist gathering to celebrate
the recent arrival of a tooth of Buddha and to pray for peace was
held on Saturday at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei,
with over 10,000 Buddhists from around the island and overseas
present.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew presided over the religious gathering, which
was sponsored by the International Fokuang Association.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan also took part in the historic assembly
on behalf of President Lee Teng-hui to pay homage to the sacred
relic, which is believed to be one of three teeth of Buddha left on
earth after the sage's cremation.</P>
      <P>As horns and drums played solemnly and followers of Buddhism
filled the air with musical chanting, the tooth, kept in a delicate
pagoda-shaped reliquary, was escorted slowly to a temporary altar in
the hall by 40 Tibetan horn-playing monks, another 150 monks from the
island, members of the delegation that escorted the Buddhist relic
from Bangkok to Taiwan, and other escort teams from around the
island.</P>
      <P>Lien presented incense and then said prayers for the happiness of
the people living in Taiwan and the prosperity of the country.</P>

four virtuous attitudes of Buddha -- loving-kindness, compassion,
sympathetic joy and equanimity -- and that these also symbolize the
perfect ethic that led to the sage's enlightenment.</P>
      <P>Lien expressed his thanks to Fokuangshan and its abbot Hsin Yun
for sharing the priceless treasure with all the people of Taiwan,
adding that the activity of receiving and venerating Buddha's tooth
can not only promote the spiritual reforms initiated by President Lee
but also encourage ethical religious belief and help build a stable
social environment.</P>
      <P>Prior to Lien's prayer and speech, the Siew opened the prayers
for peace by reciting four wishes.</P>
      <P>Siew said he hopes that the loving-kindness and compassion that
the relic of Buddha embodies can make the country prosper, and that
its miraculous powers can bring peace and stability to the community,
its wisdom and spirit of equity can help the spiritual purification
of humanity, and its joy and freedom can lead to world peace.</P>
      <P>Siew, a devout Buddhist, said when a prayer is made sincerely, it
will be answered.</P>
      <P>A number of legislators and heavyweight officials -- including
senior presidential advisers Koo Chen-fu and Wu Poh-hsiung, Justice
Minister Liao Cheng-hao and Transportation and Communications
Minister Lin Feng-cheng -- participated in the activity.</P>
      <P>The ritual concluded after a ceremony in which people took an
oath to practice the "three goods" espoused by Master Hsin Yun: to
speak good words, keep good thoughts and have good acts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISA PRIVILEGES TO BE REINSTATED FOR TAIWAN VISITORS TO JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government in Tokyo decided on Friday
to uphold an amendment bill on Japan's acknowledgment of the validity
of Republic of China passports and resuming 72-hour visa-free
privileges for Taiwan visitors.</P>
      <P>The government will go ahead with relevant arrangements to
implement the amended entry and exit statutes, which are aimed at
simplifying the entry process for visitors from Taiwan, on the
premise that the amendments do not affect relations across the Taiwan
Strait, said Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi at a press conference on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Obuchi said he fully understands Beijing's concern over the issue
but stressed that the amendments, which are purely businesslike in
nature, in no way alter Japan's stance toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>The amendment bill is expected to be raised for discussion at the
current session of the Japanese Diet, according to an official from
the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If the amendment is passed
quickly by the Diet, there is a good chance that the new regulations
will be implemented at the end of April, he added.</P>
      <P>The revision is being seen as a significant step towards the
resolution of Japan's "overstretched visa handling operations," which
began after the ROC cut diplomatic links with Japan on Sept. 29,
1972, when Tokyo recognized Beijing as the sole legitimate government
of China.</P>
      <P>Since then, the Japanese government has never treated ROC
passports as valid official documents, which means Japanese
immigration authorities can only grant ROC tourists "entry
certificates" to visit Japan, rather than visas.</P>
      <P>In 1990, furthermore, Japan also abolished the 72-hour visa-free
privileges that it had previously extended to Taiwan tourists in
transit through Japan.</P>
      <P>These measures placed an intolerable burden on the operations of
Japan's authorities in charge of applications submitted by ROC
passport-holders.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government's move was only made possible after
intense lobbying by an influential group of pro-Taiwan lawmakers who
have been pushing for better civilian ties between Taiwan and Japan,
prompting the Law and Foreign Affairs Committee of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) to pass a resolution in a joint session on
March 19 to improve Japan's visa and passport policy toward Taiwan
visitors.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Japanese Entry &amp; Exit Bureau show that
859,000 Taiwan tourists visited Japan in 1997, up by 100,000 from the
year-earlier level. The popularity of Japanese tours among Taiwan
people has forced the Japanese embassy in Thailand, which is
authorized to deal with entry applications from ROC citizens, to also
appeal for simplification of the processing operation.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers called on the Tokyo government to amend relevant
statutes to allow for the resumption of 72-hour visa-free privileges
and changes in the method of issuing entry documents to Taiwan
visitors.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, ROC passports will be considered valid
documents, and visa stamps will be printed directly into the
passports themselves, rather than being stamped on separate "entry
certificates" as is currently the case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER CIA CHIEF TO VISIT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) Director James Woolsey and four other American military and
intelligence experts are scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Monday for
a brief visit.</P>
      <P>Parris Chang, an opposition legisaltor-at-large representing the
overseas Chinese community, said here on Friday that he has arranged
the visit with a view to help the people of Taiwan better understand
the development of delicate triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing
relations and work out strategy to cope with increasingly closer
Washington-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>Chang, who also serves as the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party's representative in the United States, said
Washington-Beijing relations have improved significantly since
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin made a state visit to the US
late last October. "Such a development could endanger Taiwan's
diplomacy and security in the long run," he warned.</P>
      <P>During their visit, Woolsey and other American intelligence
experts will meet with ROC President Lee Ten-hui and senior
government officials to exchange views on the possible impact on
Taiwan of mainland China's military buildup in recent years as well
as Taiwan's strategy to address such challenges.</P>
      <P>The four other visitors are Dr. Michael Pillsbury, who once
served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense; Dr. Gordon Oehler,
a former director of the CIA's technology transfer evaluation
center; Dr. Kent Harrington, a former head of the CIA's Asian
intelligence department; and William Wright, a retired vice admiral
who once served as an Asia-Pacific affairs division chief at the US
Department of Defense.</P>
      <P>Chang said all the visitors have played an important role in the
US research of mainland China's military development. "I'm convinced
that the information or opinions provided by them will help Taiwan
better understand mainland China's future military development
strategy as well as America's Asia-Pacific policy," he added.</P>
      <P>Dr. Michael Pillsbury, who once studied Mandarin Chinese in
Taipei in the 1970s, is currently a senior researcher with the
Atlantic Council and an adviser to the Department of Defense. A
report issued by the Defense Department earlier this year,
which warned that mainland China might ignite a military conflict due
to misjudgement of the US stance, was authored by Pillsbury.</P>
      <P>He pointed out in the report that cultural difference is likely
to make mainland leaders not afraid of America's deterrence force in
the foreseeable future. Therefore, Pillsbury said, the US Defense
Department and intelligence agencies should mull how to cope with
mainland China's misjudgement of the situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former CIA Director Woolsey once visited Taipei in the
spring of 1996 when mainland China conducted a series of live-fire
war games and missile tests in waters near Taiwan to intimidate local
voters in the run-up to the island's first-ever direct presidential
election.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bonn,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mass-circulation Austrian daily Die
Presse on Friday published an interview with the Republic of China's
Premier Vincent Siew in which he made a strong case for Taiwan's
approach to mainland China and disclosed how the island has managed
to keep clear of the regional economic crisis.</P>
      <P>Siew was quoted as saying that Taiwan wants to exchange views
with mainland China but hopes Beijing realizes the fact that the ROC
is a legal entity out of its jurisdiction and should be treated
accordingly.</P>
      <P>Taiwan welcomes cooperation in any form with mainland China, so
long as it is based on the principles of equality and mutual respect,
he said.</P>
      <P>Siew told Die Presse's reporter Helmut Hetzel, who conducted the
interview during a recent trip to Taipei, that he would like to visit
Beijing, but only in his capacity as ROC premier, a condition
entailing the recognition of Taiwan as a political entity separate
from the area under Beijing's control.</P>
      <P>Regarding ties between Beijing and Washington, Siew said these
should not affect the Taipei-Washington relationship, and that the
presence of two US aircraft carriers near the Taiwan Strait during
the peak of the 1996 cross-strait crisis, when Beijing test-fired
live missiles into waters around the island, fully reflected US
concerns about stability in the strait.</P>
      <P>The premier said that in his view, the sharp difference in size
between Taiwan and mainland China makes the formula used to
reintegrate East and West Germany inapplicable to the two sides of
the strait.</P>
      <P>He appealed for international support, including that of the
European Union, for Taiwan's eight-year-old bid to enter the World
Trade Organization and its efforts to join the United Nations,
stressing the island's democracy and its economic clout.</P>
      <P>As to the regional financial woes that swept many of Taiwan's
neighbors, Siew said his administration's priority of economic
stability is the main reason the island's economy wasn't overcome as
well.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE LABOR DISPUTE CAUSING DELAYS TO FOREIGN SHIPPING (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  11  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The stand-off between an Australian
stevedoring company and the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) has
caused many delays in shipments and inconvenience to foreign
shipping companies.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Frank Chang, representative of
Taiwan's Yang Ming Transport Corp. in Sydney, said Yang Ming's ships
plying between Australia, Japan, and South Korea have been disrupted
due to strikes by Australian waterfront workers against the Patrick
Stevedore Co.</P>
      <P>There have been some delays in shipments between Taiwan and
Australia, Chang said, adding that P&amp;O Ports' terminals have been
overwhelmed by container cargoes that have been rerouted to avoid
Patrick's ports.</P>
      <P>Patrick and P&amp;O Ports control about 95 percent of the container
and the car transport markets in Australia.</P>
      <P>The shipment delays have caused considerable impact on
Australia's exports, and analysts say if the problem cannot be
resolved in the near future, the image of Australia as reliable
exporter could be damaged.</P>
      <P>Australia is fighting an uphill battle to reform its inefficient
waterfront industry, but the country's radical maritime unions,
backed by international labor groups and the opposition Labor Party,
are determined to resist the tide.</P>
      <P>The reformists come from some big stevedoring and shipping firms
because they are fed up with the MUA monopolizing the waterfront
sector for more than a decade.</P>
      <P>The coalition government under Prime Minister John Howard has had
an agenda to reform the industry since it won the general election in
March 1996, ending the 13-year reign of the Labor Party.</P>
      <P>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has also
expressed its support for any action that will improve waterfront
efficiency.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the MUA and its members are so inefficient that
they only handle an average 18.5 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) per
hour, much lower than the international standard of 25 TEUs per hour.</P>
      <P>Shipping companies said that compared to Asian countries, the
18.5 TEUs are very low because the average figure in Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia ranges from 27 to 35
TEUs per hour.</P>
      <P>"How can Australia compete with other countries, especially Asian
countries, in the world market if its exporters have to suffer such
low handling rates at Australian ports?" one analyst asked.</P>
      <P>"The cargo handling volume at Australian ports is an industry
joke among shipping and stevedoring firms in Asia, and Australia has
become a third-rate country in this respect," another said.</P>
      <P>Maritime wages in Australia are much higher than in Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Korea and other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Moreover, cargo handling at Australian ports is overmanned thanks
to the MUA monopoly, causing unreasonably high costs for Australian
stevedoring firms, according to the analysts.</P>
      <P>It was apparently with this in mind that Patrick Stevedores tried
to raise cargo handling to 25 TEUs through its MUA workers, but the
workers would not cooperate, preferring their current rate.</P>
      <P>After talks broke down in March, MUA workers staged a series of
strikes in Patrick's terminals, causing the company to lose business
and resulting in delays in cargo handling for its clients.</P>
      <P>Patrick then sacked its entire workforce of 1,400 full-time
workers and 600 part-time employees throughout Australia on April 8.</P>
      <P>The mass lay-off, the first of its kind in the history of
Australian industrial relations, sparked immediate and widespread
protest and anger from the MUA, which succeeded in getting a federal
court injunction ordering Patrick to reinstate the dismissed workers.</P>
      <P>Patrick ignored the injunction and employed secretly trained scab
labor to handle its stevedoring at terminals in Sydney, Melbourne,
Brisbane, and Fremantle, using private goons and attack dogs to keep
the sacked union workers out. (MORE)</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To counter the MUA picket lines, Patrick chartered helicopters to
airlift its scab workers into the terminals, prompting MUA National
Secretary John Coombs to say that his union will launch a fresh wave
of legal moves against Patrick, and against Workplace Minister Peter
Reith.</P>
      <P>The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), the biggest union
in this country, has expressed its strong support for the MUA while
opposition leader Kim Beazley has criticized Howard's coalition
government, saying: "The result of this (sacking) is going to be a
sense of insecurity among Australian workers, and devastation to the
family lives of 1,400 Australian workers."</P>
      <P>The MUA has also received support from the London-based
International Trade Federation and the International Transport
Workers Federation, the Brussels-based International Trade Union, and
from Japanese and Dutch union members.</P>
      <P>These foreign union groups said they will boycott Patrick's
operations in foreign ports so that the company cannot do business
outside Australia.</P>
      <P>But Reith said the Australian government will seek legal action
against these foreign union groups to prevent them from undermining
Patrick's operations.</P>
      <P>Last week, John Howard accused the MUA and its members of
hindering government efforts to reform the waterfront, saying that
reform is necessary to create jobs, boost Australian exports and
increase competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He declared that his government is prepared to stand up to the
MUA in the interest of Australian jobs.</P>
      <P>If the government is truly serious in its support for Patrick in
its fight against the MUA and its many supporters, including some of
the world's most powerful union organizations, then the reforms might
be achieved, otherwise, Australia will lose the chance of reforming
the waterfront for at least another generation, some analysts say.</P>

      <P>The motion listed reasons why its members believe Ma Ying-jeou,
now a deputy professor of law at National Chengchi University, should
change his mind and contest the Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>It said that Ma should run to comply with the people's will, as a
variety of public opinion polls have shown Ma enjoys more support
than Chen among the residents of Taipei.</P>
      <P>It went on to say that Ma should respond to his party's will
since the KMT's Taipei committee has expressed the hope that Ma will
represent the party and recover the post of Taipei mayor that the KMT
lost some three years. The motion also urged Ma to run on the grounds
that his father, Ma Ho-ling, also supports his candidacy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND JOURNALISTS WELOCME TO VISIT TAIWAN FOR NEWS COVERAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese journalists are welcome
to cover news events in Taiwan, ROC government spokesman Chen
Chien-jen said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to a United Daily News
(UDN) report that major mainland news media plan to send reporters
to Taiwan for long-term news coverage in line with the development of
substantive relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted mainland sources as saying that each mainland
news organization is expected to assign several of its journalists
to work in rotation now that Taiwan has yet to open its doors for
mainland media to post resident correspondents on its soil.</P>
      <P>The report said major central-level mainland media, including
Xinhua News Agency, China News Agency, the People's Daily and
China Central Television Station, are drawing up personnel dispatch
plans, which will then be sent to mainland authorities in charge of
Taiwan affairs for approval.</P>
      <P>"With Taiwan's support, it won't be a problem for mainland media
to send journalists to Taiwan to work in rotation," a mainland
official was quoted as telling the UDN.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Chen said promoting cross-strait news
exchanges has been the ROC government's established policy. "It is
also one of the eight priority tasks of the Government Information
Office (GIO)," he noted.</P>
      <P>The GIO director-general further pointed pointed out that the
government has long asked mainland China to allow Taiwan media post
resident reporters on the mainland. Beijing, however, has been
reluctant to agree to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is an open society, Chen said Taiwan will be
delighted to see mainland media send more journalists to cover
news events on the island and to give more timely, accurate reports
on various aspects of developments and lives here.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainalnd Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yuh
said Taiwan has opened its doors for mainland journalists to come
for news coverage since September 1991. But so far only slightly
more than 100 mainland media professionals have visited Taiwan for
sightseeing or coverage of specific news events.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chang said, Taiwan media have been far more active
in covering mainland news events. Major Taiwan news organizations,
including CNA and UDN, have regularly sent their staff reporters to
work in rotation on the mainland. Taiwan media have also consistently
given detailed, updated reports on the latest mainland news events,
market trends or everday lives. "In comparison, mainland media have
seldom run in-depth reports on Taiwan. They have even often given
misleading or biased reports on the current Taiwan situation,"
Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chang said, the MAC welcomes the
reported mainland plans to send more journalists to Taiwan for news
coverage.</P>
      <P>Under current Taiwan regulations, mainland reporters can file
applications with the GIO for permission to cover news on the
island. Each mainland reporter can stay here up to two months.
At present, mainland reporters must file applications one
month before their scheduled arrival dates. Starting July 1 this
year, the processing time will be shortened as the Bureau of Entry
and Exit has decided to offer single-stop services for prospective
mainland visitors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NYE'S PROPOSAL FOR CHANGE IN US CHINA POLICY CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 11 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two experts at the Heritage Foundation
on Saturday rebutted the proposal made by former US Assistant
Secretary of Defense Joseph S. Nye that the US government should
clear its current China policy of ambiguity, stressing that such a
move would cause disaster rather than prevent it.</P>
      <P>Kim Holmes and Stephen Yates said in a jointly written letter
published in Saturday's edition of the Washington Post that the
proposals in Nye's "Taiwan Deal," which was carried in the March 8
edition of the same prestigious newspaper, would not serve to bring
Washington, Taipei and Beijing back from the brink of disaster as he
had claimed.</P>
      <P>Nye had proposed that the United States should urge Taiwan to
forswear any steps toward independence and that Washington should
state, as a matter of US policy, that it would not recognize or
defend Taiwan should the island declare independence. In return, he
said, Beijing should agree to give the Republic of China more
"international living space."</P>
      <P>The two experts at the foundation said that although Nye believes
the deal would "bring Washington, Taipei and Beijing back from the
brink of disaster allegedly brought on not only by the 'ambiguity' of
US policy but by the demands of Taiwan's democratic government for
more international recognition," the agreement would "not prevent
disaster, but it certainly could cause it."</P>
      <P>"If implemented, the initiative would increase the chances of
conflict, embolden the Chinese to pressure the Taiwanese, isolate
Taiwan and drag the United States into the middle of a negotiating
process that it intentionally, and wisely, has avoided," they said.</P>
      <P>Holmes and Yates said that Taiwan today is a democracy with a
market economy and is a threat to no one, "while the other party in
the dispute, the People's Republic of China, is an authoritarian
one-party state that proliferates weapons of mass destruction and is
a potential threat in the region."</P>
      <P>"Why would the United States want to side with Beijing?" they
asked.</P>
      <P>They noted that if the United States gets involved directly in
mainland China's campaign to prevent independence in Taiwan, it will
have tipped the balance against Taipei. "The effect would not be to
'preserve democracy and peace' but to discredit democracy and create
instability," they said.</P>
      <P>"Once the United States interposed itself between Beijing and
Taipei, it would involuntarily become a party to prolonging rather
than resolving the conflict. This would set up the conditions for the
deterioration of cross-strait relations, first by emboldening the
mainland Chinese and then by frightening and possibly radicalizing
the Taiwanese," they said, warning that if war breaks out in the
Taiwan Strait, the United States, the chief mediator, might be
dragged into it.</P>
      <P>Beijing authorities would no doubt agree to such a new deal,
Holmes and Yates said, adding, however, that there is little doubt
that the government and people of Taiwan would not support it. "They
would find it unfair that Taiwan must 'forswear independence' even
though Beijing does not 'forswear the use of military force.' Beijing
does not promise to promote Taiwan's participation in international
organizations; it only 'will not oppose' Taiwan's participation in
some organizations," the experts said.</P>
      <P>"If the real challenge for the United States is simultaneously to
preserve democracy and peace, the best way to proceed is not to
isolate a democracy on behalf of an authoritarian one-party state,
but to counter Beijing's efforts to isolate Taiwan internationally
and, as required by the Taiwan Relations Act, assist Taiwan in
deterring potential military aggression," they said.</P>
      <P>"The best way to preserve peace and democracy is not for the
United States to intercede on Beijing's behalf, but to urge both
sides to settle their differences peacefully," they concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD'S LARGEST WAVE BASIN BEING BUILT BY CHENG KUNG U.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  southern  Taiwan,  April  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Cheng Kung
University (CKU) is currently building the world's largest wave basin
in the coastal An-nan district of Tainan to help bolster Taiwan's
standards of coastal structure testing and the evaluation of relevant
engineering projects.</P>
      <P>Researchers at CKU's Hydraulic Engineering Institute will use the
giant wave basin -- a long reservoir 180 meters in length, 80 meters
in width and 1.5 meters in depth -- to conduct experiments on
topographic changes and sediment transport for the Formosa Group on a
contract basis, said institute director Professor Huang Huang-huei.</P>
      <P>The experiments will be performed using an army of irregular wave
makers in the basin in order to find out how the Sixth Naphtha
Cracking Plant that Formosa Plastics is developing in the Yunlin
Offshore Industrial Zone in central Taiwan will affect the shoreline
there, said Huang.</P>
      <P>The building of the An-nan wave basin will efficiently expedite
topographic change and sediment transport experiments in the coastal
area, he said.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that CKU has engaged in such experiments with smaller
equipment for six years under the auspices of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, which supports the development of the Sixth Naphtha
Cracker.</P>
      <P>The experiments in the new basin will be carried out for 25 years
and be financed mainly by the Formosa Group, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a wave flume, touted as the world's second longest, is
also being built opposite the wave basin at the new CKU campus in
An-nan, mainly for the performance of sand liquefaction experiments
and to learn more about the impact earthquakes have on beachfront
structures and about the safety of harbor installations, according to
Huang.</P>
      <P>The 300-meter wave flume will be 24 meters shorter than the
world's longest one in Hannover, Germany.</P>
      <P>Huang joked that the wave flume, once operational, could be a
cradle for nurturing world-class boat racers.</P>
      <P>Both the wave basin and the wave flume, key projects in CKU's
hydraulic engineering experimental plant being built on the An-nan
campus, are expected to be completed and become operational in July.</P>
      <P>CKU is developing the new campus in a vast coastal area of 75
hectares. Land-reclamation work has so far been completed on 11
hectares, said Huang.</P>

      <P>Thousands of followers of Buddha, including a number of
celebrities and political heavyweights, greeted what they regard as
one of the world's most precious relics with reverence and an ancient
ceremony, in which long-haired women scattered flowers and placed
their hair on the ground as the reliquary containing the holy tooth
passed by to show their highest respects to it.</P>
      <P>A high-profile mission headed by Fokuangshan's abbot Hsin Yun --
comprising over 200 devout Buddhists, including Senior Presidential
Adviser Wu Poh-hsiung and Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Dun-yih -- escorted the
sacred relic from Bangkok to its Taipei destination, Fokuangshan's
branch temple near suburban Taipei's Sungshan Train Station. It will
available there for three months for local people to venerate before
being moved to another shrine at Fokuangshan until a temple is built
in suburban Taipei to house it.</P>
      <P>Despite an ecstatic welcome from well-wishers from around the
country, the grand procession from the airport to branch temple
encountered a small roadblock.</P>
      <P>Dozens of members of a local political party rushed onto the
road, blockading the procession. They scattered leaflets and held up
protest flags and slogan boards, telling those lining the procession
route, "We want a new country, not an old Buddha's tooth."</P>
      <P>Criticism of the religious event has been seen not only on the
streets but also in the Legislative Yuan, mass media and Internet.
Arguments both for and against the magnificent activities surrounding
the relic's arrival have centered on the appropriateness of political
leaders' passionate involvement in religious events.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew, Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-fan,
Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh and Interior Minister Huang
Chu-wen were among those greeting the arrival of the relic at the
airport, while Vice President Lien Chan took part in a large-scale
Buddhist ritual in Taipei on Saturday to celebrate the arrival of the
tooth and to pray to Buddha for the country's peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>About 1,200 years ago, the Tang dynasty emperor Hsien Chung
ordered a similar activity, attempting to save China from decay by
sending out parties to search for Buddhist relics, according to
Chinese historic literature.</P>
      <P>The documents indicate that the prestigious legislative leader
Han Yu (A.D. 768-824) tried to stop the attempt by submitting a
written admonition to the emperor that censured the planned act as
absurd.</P>
      <P>The upright official's report also reproached the emperor for
using useless and unrealistic medicines to cure a sick country.</P>
      <P>The admonition was successful in getting the emperor to call off
the costly mission, said two members of the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly, who criticized the current government for supporting
something that an ancient sage had stopped.</P>
      <P>One of the two assemblymen, Chen Kuo-chung of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, asked Provincial Department of Civil
Affairs Chief Chen Chin-Hsin at a assembly meeting on Thursday, "Can
a tooth save a sick society?"</P>
      <P>Premier Siew, who has been accused of helping plant superstitions
on the island over his participation in events relating to the holy
tooth, defended himself by saying that as a devout Buddhist, his
support of the activities for greeting the tooth was to show his
respect for the sacred relic.</P>
      <P>He said that such religious activities teach respect for many
cultures and can help prevent morality from fading and the social
environment from deteriorating.</P>
      <P>Echoing Siew's defense, Interior Minister Huang stressed that
ethical religions never have a bad impact on society but rather can
contribute to peace.</P>
      <P>"Disturbed minds can usually be calmed by a religious power," he
said, adding that Taiwan is now conducting spiritual reforms and that
these can be achieved through religious activities.</P>
      <P>On Saturday at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei,
a magnificent gathering was held to celebrate the arrival of Buddha's
tooth and to pray for peace and the prosperity of the country.</P>
      <P>Thousands turned out for the ceremony, hoping that the miraculous
powers many believe the relic contains will bring them better lives
and the country strength and stability.</P>
      <P>Does the tooth have such powers? Will the prayers be answered?
Several scholars in Buddhism stressed recently that it's more
important.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WELCOMES JAPAN'S REINSTATEMENT OF VISA PRIVILEGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China welcomes the
Japanese House of Councilors' approval of a bill on recognition of
the validity of ROC passports and resumption of 72-hour visa-free
entry for prospective Taiwan visitors, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Roy Wu said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Japanese upper house passed the bill amending Japan's
current entry and exit statute on Friday. The amendment bill is
also expected to clear the House of Representatives, or the lower
house of the Japanese Diet, in the near future.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Japanese Diet will pass the bill during its current
session so that it can be implemented soon to facilitate tourist,
civilian and commercial exchanges between Taiwan and Japan," Roy
said.</P>
      <P>Under the newly amended regulations, ROC passports will be
considered valid documents, and visa stamps will be printed directly
into the passports themselves, rather than being stamped on separate
"entry certificates" as is currently the case.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government referred the amendment bill to the Diet
on March 24 as part of its effort to cut red tape. "We welcome this
bill because it will contribute to growth of bilateral relations and
exchanges in the absence of diplomatic ties," Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Tokyo's decision to amend its current entry-exit statute is being
seen as a significant step to simplify its "overstretched visa
handling operations," which began after Japan switched diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing on Sept. 29, 1972.</P>
      <P>Since then, the Japanese government has never treated ROC
passports as valid official documents, which means Japanese
immigration authorities can only grant ROC tourists "entry
certificates" to visit Japan, rather than visas.</P>
      <P>In 1990, Japan also suspended its 72-hour visa-free privileges
to Taiwan tourists in transit through Japan.</P>
      <P>These measures placed an intolerable burden on the operations of
Japan's authorities in charge of applications submitted by ROC
passport-holders.</P>
      <P>Japan took the step to improve visa services only after intense
lobbying by an influential group of pro-Taiwan lawmakers who have
been pushing for better civilian ties between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Japanese Entry &amp; Exit Bureau show that
859,000 Taiwan tourists visited Japan in 1997, up by 100,000 from the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The popularity of Japanese tours among Taiwan people has forced
the Japanese embassy in Thailand, which is authorized to deal with
entry applications from ROC citizens, to also appeal for
simplification of the processing operation.</P>
      <P>Pro-Taiwan Japanese lawmakers called on the Tokyo government to
amend relevant statutes to allow for the resumption of 72-hour
visa-free privileges and changes in the method of issuing entry
documents to Taiwan visitors.

SPENDING NO CURE FOR 'JAPANESE DISEASE': ANALYST</P>
      <P>Ottawa, April 10 (CNA) A Canadian analyst suspects that the
Japanese economic disease has no easy cure and may even be permanent.</P>
      <P>Richard Gwyn, who writes regularly for the mass-circulation
Toronto Star newspaper, on Friday cited a sign that's been appearing
in Japanese classrooms this school year: "Let Us All Be Individuals."</P>
      <P>"A call to individualism that appears in every classroom at the
same time?" Gwyn asked. "How do you achieve individualism by ordering
everyone to act like individuals?" he questioned.</P>
      <P>He observed that convincing the Japanese to behave in an
un-Japanese way is a great challenge now confronting Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and -- the real power in Japan -- the bureaucrats
and industrialists.</P>
      <P>The nation that had been dubbed "Number One" is infected by
what's being called "the Japanese disease." This year, for the first
time in more than two decades, its economy will actually shrink. Real
estate values are down by a third. Last week, Moody's downgraded its
rating for Japanese banks to D, the same level as for Third World
banks, Gwyn pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said that many experts, including US President Bill Clinton
and the World Bank, are right in their diagnosis of what's needed to
cure Japan's ills, which have gone on now for eight years: massive
spending.</P>
      <P>But their prescription may be faulty, he cautioned. With so much
in savings, both personal and national, Japan already has all the
spending power it needs.</P>
      <P>The Japanese, however, are behaving in a thoroughly Japanese way,
he said. After all those post-war decades of hard work and
self-sacrifice, the Japanese people have lost -- more accurately,
never acquired -- the western habit of wild consumerism, he said.</P>
      <P>It doesn't help that the entire economy is structured to
discourage consumer spending in order to emphasize exporting, he
noted. The way this is done is by massive bureaucratic regulation.
According to the Japanese Fair Trade Commission, the country ranks
35th in the world, even behind Russia, in the proportion of its
economy that's controlled by bureaucratic regulation -- 30 percent as
against just 7 percent in the United States, he cited.</P>
      <P>There's another factor that's probably the most important of all,
he continued. As a result of small families and of nil immigration,
Japan is now the oldest society in the industrialized world. "Old
societies are conservative ones. So they don't spend wildly. Small
houses -- the result of the intense regulation of land use -- further
discourage people from piling up consumer goods," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Hashimoto has promised a "significant" cut in taxes to encourage
people to open their pocketbooks, Gwyn noted, but added, however,
that the Japanese have been Japanese for too long for them to be able
to change their character and turn into free-spending consumers.</P>
      <P>"You'd have to guess, that's to say, that the 'Japanese disease'
is permanent," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE WATERFRONT WAR EXPANDING TO SECOND FRONT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian waterfront battle looks
set to expand to a second front now that Australia's largest
stevedoring firm, P&amp;O Ports, has joined Patrick Stevedores in
demanding talks on work-practice reform with the Maritime Union of
Australia (MUA).</P>
      <P>MUA National Secretary John Coombs accused P&amp;O Ports Friday of
taking the advantage of the industrial turmoil between the MUA and
Patrick to demand talks on waterside reform, local media reported
Saturday.</P>
      <P>He described the P&amp;O Ports' demand as "absolutely unrealistic"
because the MUA and its members are engaged in a waterfront war with
Patrick Stevedores, the second largest employer in Australian ports.</P>
      <P>Patrick has sacked all of its 1,400 full-time workers and 600
part-time workers and started using non-union workers to do
stevedoring for the company, the first time such a situation has
occurred in Australia in about 100 years.</P>
      <P>P&amp;O and Patrick control about 95 percent of Australia's
waterfront and transport operations between the two of them.</P>
      <P>More troubles are expected in the coming days because Patrick
intends to use non-union labor to load and unload cargoes at its
terminals in Sydney, Melbourne, Fremantle, Brisbane and other ports.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Australian government has established a
legal team in London to sue international union officials under
British law if they try to induce shipping companies to break
contracts and boycott Patrick Stevedores' operations or shipments.</P>
      <P>Two union groups in London -- the International Transport Workers
Federation and the International Trade Federation -- have expressed
support for the MUA and the sacked workers and have threatened to
boycott Patrick so that the stevedoring company cannot operate in
Britain or other foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Waiting on the sidelines is SeaLand Inc. of the United States.
SeaLand's Australian operations general manager Andy Andrews told the
mass circulation newspaper The Australian that the US company would
be interested in taking over Patrick's loading operations at major
Australian ports if Patrick wants to sell them.</P>
      <P>"We would consider going into Patrick's ground. We would not rule
anything out in the break bulk operations," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will send 120 illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants from southeastern Fujian Province to the
offshore island of Matsu, where they will await repatriation.</P>
      <P>The decision was made following three months of nonaction by
mainland authorities over the return of illegal immigrants in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some 90 illegals held at the Hsinchu Detention Center and 30
others detained in Ilan have been notified that they will be sent to
Matsu. It is known that four hijackers, including Liu Baocai, who
are currently on parole after serving jail terms in Taiwan, were not
among those on the list.</P>
      <P>Although mainland Chinese authorities picked up over 200 illegal
immigrants on the eve of the Lunar New Year in late January, they
have since failed to respond to requests to pick up additional
detainees.</P>
      <P>With the recent roundup of several groups of illegal mainlanders
in northern and northeastern Taiwan, occupancy at the Hsinchu and
Ilan detention centers has soared.</P>
      <P>And with the coming of summer, crowded conditions in the two
detention centers pose potential hygiene and management problems. So
the government has decided to transfer some of the detainees to Matsu
in order to facilitate their return to the mainland as soon as
repatriation efforts resume.</P>

      <P>Following a series of major air accidents
since the beginning of this year, the railway has again become the
most popular means of long-distance transport among travelers
islandwide.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA), the number

first three months of the year on an annual basis, and its
first-quarter income also increased by 11 percent over the same
period of last year.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-Kaohsiung route has seen the largest growth in terms
of the number of travelers during the first quarter, with the daily
average passenger load rising to 2,509, from 1,848 recorded in the
same period of 1997. The number of passengers on the Taipei-Tainan
route also increased by 28 percent to a daily average of 2,021, while
the growth rate for the Taipei-Taichung route stood around 14
percent, TRA tallies showed.</P>
      <P>A TRA official attributed the newfound popularity of rail travel

    <HEADLINE>ROC TRADE: STRONG WTO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April 11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In Taiwan's most dramatic success to date
in attempts to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), Taipei
reached a far-reaching trade liberalization agreement with Washington
on Feb. 20 and narrowly missed an accord with the European Union (EU)
a week later.</P>
      <P>Out of 26 WTO signatories which have requested bilateral talks,
Taiwan has now reached deals with all but two, the EU and
Switzerland. Suddenly, the organization's members are faced with the
surprising scenario of Taiwan joining before mainland China.</P>
      <P>To be sure, hurdles remain. Negotiations with the EU and
Switzerland must be finalized, and only 17 of the 26 WTO signatories
have formally signed a second set of agreements with Taiwan
addressing its terms of entry. Further down the road, a vote by
two-thirds of WTO contracting parties, and ratification by Taiwan's
Legislature, will be necessary for formal membership.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, and if a WTO working party scheduled for May 8
resolves some of the remaining issues, optimists hope that Taiwan can
join the organization by year's end -- and before Beijing, according
to a report of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).</P>
      <P>Until recently, accepted wisdom held that mainland China must
come first, otherwise there would be a diplomatic furor. Beijing
considers Taiwan a renegade province and consistently opposes its
formal involvement in international diplomatic or economic
organizations.</P>
      <P>But lately, senior officials have flouted Beijing's primacy, the
EIU report said. Richard Fischer, US deputy trade representative, has
told mainland Chinese officials directly that Taiwan's bid will not
be tied to Beijing's accession.</P>
      <P>Likewise, WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero has repeatedly
insisted that Taiwan's bid does not depend on mainland China, saying,
"At the World Trade Organization we are not, fortunately, ruled by
political principles."</P>
      <P>To date, Beijing has been firm and consistent in its opposition
to Taiwan's early membership. Its protests could yet become
hysterical if it looks like the WTO is ready to accept Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regardless, Taiwan's progress plays into the WTO's interests.
Trade negotiators can use the threat of Taiwan's membership to prod
the mainland's moribund efforts at trade reform. Beijing may yet
enter first, but in the meantime, the WTO is cleverly inducing both
sides to accelerate their trade concessions, the EIU report pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Whatever the timing of its entry, Taiwan has already included
major trade concessions in its bid. Only bilateral trade in
agricultural products -- namely trade in pork, rice and chicken --
will be opened regardless of Taiwan's accession. Liberalization in
other areas, listed below, will be triggered by Taiwan's entry into
the WTO.</P>
      <P>-- Chemical and pharmaceuticals. By the year 2002, with some
exceptions by 2004, Taiwan agreed to eliminate tariffs on raw
materials and pharmaceuticals while cutting rates for intermediary
substances to 5.5 percent and manufactured chemicals to 6.5 percent.</P>
      <P>-- Financial services. In the area of banking, insurance and
securities, Taiwan guaranteed full market access and national
treatment for US companies by 2000.</P>
      <P>-- Government procurement. Taipei also agreed to abide by
international transparency norms on government bidding processes.
This covers US$15.4 billion of planned infrastructure projects,
including telecoms, power and rail transport projects.</P>
      <P>-- Industrial tariffs. Taiwan agreed to lower industrial tariffs
from the current 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent by 2002 and to 4.7
percent by 2004.</P>
      <P>-- Motor vehicles. Taiwan agreed to reduce tariffs on imported
small vehicles to 20 percent, to eliminate a 9 percent subsidy on
domestically designed auto components, to cancel local content
requirements on auto parts and to ease restrictions on car leasing
(effective over a 10-year period). Taiwan granted the United States
rights to sell 158,000 cars annually, increasing by 20 percent per
year thereafter. Taiwan also agreed to lower the ceiling for local
parts in auto manufacturing to 40 percent from 50 percent by the end
of 1998.</P>
      <P>-- Privatization of monopoly board. Taiwan is selling off the
state monopoly that controls sales and distribution of alcohol and
tobacco, a change which will eliminate discriminatory treatment of
imports of these goods. Tariffs on spirits will be eliminated by
2000; tariffs on beer will go by 2005. Tariffs on wine will fall to
10 percent by 2002.</P>
      <P>-- Telecoms. The interconnection fee of NT$1.60 (five US cents)
per minute that state-run Chunghwa Telecom charges private cellular
phone operators will go down to NT$1.15 per minute in October.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG HAS GOOD REASON TO BE VIGILANT AGAINST BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April 11 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has stumbled in Hong Kong, giving
people there good reason to be vigilant over their future, a major
Canadian newspaper commented Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail said common sense dictates that mainland China
has many reasons to be on its best behavior in Hong Kong, one of
which being that Beijing has its eye on a "much bigger prize than
Kong Kong."</P>
      <P>"If there is any prospect at all of enticing Taiwan back into a
single China, it is only through making a success of the
administration of Hong Kong and respecting the Basic Law, the
region's constitution," the Mail said in an editorial.</P>
      <P>The editorial pointed out that it is precisely with regard to the
Basic Law that Beijing may have recently made a major blunder.</P>
      <P>It noted the Basic Law includes an article stating that all
central government offices "shall abide by the laws of the Region."
Yet this week, it added, one of the last acts of the outgoing,
Beijing-appointed legislature was to grant an exemption from the
region's laws to the agents and offices of the Beijing government.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese government claimed it is merely a
housekeeping measure conferring on the new government the same
immunities enjoyed by the British Crown under the colonial
administration. Reason to doubt this claim is offered by both the
reason for the legislation and the method of its adoption, the Mail
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Emily Lau, a former legislator, had officially requested the file
compiled on her by the semiofficial Xinhua News Agency. Xinhua
refused to produce the file, and the government refused to prosecute
under Hong Kong's privacy laws. Instead, the retroactive exemption
for all central government agencies was passed.</P>
      <P>"It looks like a conscious decision to remove the actions of
Beijing's servants from the scrutiny of independent courts and
accountability under the law," said the editorial. And the impression
is only reinforced by the unseemly haste with which the law was
adopted, it stressed.</P>
      <P>All three readings of the exemption law occurred in one day in
spite of vocal opposition of the bar association, the law society and
many other groups, it noted.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, the daily said it is too early to tell whether
incidents like this are precursors to a slow, insidious change in the
nature of Hong Kong's institutions. "Hong Kong people, however, have
good reason to be vigilant," it advised.</P>

      <P>A delegation left Taiwan on Sunday for a
weeklong visit of three Asian nations to explore business
opportunities there.</P>
      <P>The delegation, comprised of more than 30 local corporate
executives, will visit South Korea, Thailand and Malaysia to seek
merger opportunities with local enterprises in the three nations.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Core Pacific Securities, which is leading the
delegation, said that in the wake of financial storm that swept
through Asia in mid-1997, businesses in South Korea, Thailand and
Malaysia were hard hit by high interest rates and a tightening of
credit. As those businesses are readjusting investment plans, and are
eager for influxes of foreign capital, a number of lucrative merger
opportunities for Taiwan investors have appeared.</P>
      <P>The delegation arrived in Seoul on Sunday night, where members
will meet South Korean trade officials and visit major enterprises
there.</P>
      <P>The delegation will then head to Bangkok on Wednesday night for
meetings with Thailand's vice premier and trade officials. The group
will also explore trade opportunities in the local finance, steel,
electronics, petrochemicals and real estate industries.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the delegation will arrive on its last stop in Kuala
Lumpur where it is scheduled to inspect the finance, insurance,
steel, leisure, shopping mall and construction industries.</P>
      <P>Core Pacific said that Taiwan has sound business management and
ample capital, which have allowed it to emerge from the financial
crisis largely unscathed. It said that now is the best time for local
businesses to expand by buying into enterprises in the three
neighboring countries.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The outbreak of food-and-mouth disease
(FMD) at Taiwan hog farms in March last year has cost the local food
industry nearly NT$60 billion (US$1.81 billion), the Industrial
Development Bureau (IDB) said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>IDB officials estimated that the domestic food industry will need
at least seven years before production is restored to pre-epidemic
levels.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that overall annual production for the food
industry dropped to NT$495.8 billion (US$15.02 billion) in 1997 from
NT$555.6 billion (US$16.82 billion) the previous year.</P>
      <P>The FMD outbreak has most affected the meat processing, feed and
frozen food sectors. Taiwan exports of pork products to Japan were
halted following a ban on those items by Tokyo as a result of the
epidemic, causing losses of over NT$40 billion (US$1.21 billion).</P>
      <P>The domestic market imported NT$93.3 billion worth of food
products last year, surpassing the value of food exports for the
first time. The amount of food exports as a percentage of total
exports also dropped to 12 percent from 17 percent last year.</P>
      <P>The local food industry poured NT$38.9 billion (US$1.18 billion)
into mainland Chinese and overseas markets last year, the highest
level seen in five years and surpassing its local investment of
NT$38.7 billion (US$1.17 billion).</P>
      <P>The IDB predicted it will be almost impossible for pork exports
to return to the level seen before the outbreak of FMD last year.
With the local market demand showing limited growth, prices for raw
materials increasing steadily, and businesses possessing limited
capacity to conduct research and development, it will be difficult
for the domestic food industry to recover.</P>
      <P>The officials said the value of imported food items could top
NT$100 billion (US$3 billion) this year. With its expected entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Taiwan's market will be opened
wider and the ratio of imported foods will increase, they predicted.</P>
      <P>The officials said that with rising land prices, and soaring
labor costs, the willingness of local food industry enterprises to
invest in Taiwan will be lowered.</P>
      <P>In comparison, local food industry businesses, lured by the
emerging market in mainland China and its cheaper land, raw material
and production costs, will increasingly seek opportunities there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA TO HELP TAIWAN FIRMS FIGHT AGAINST SRAM CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said
Sunday that his ministry will help local firms lodge an appeal in the
US Federal Court of International Trade for reversal of a ruling to
impose anti-dumping duties on Taiwan-made static random access memory
(SRAM) chips.</P>
      <P>In the face of an announcement expected next week by the US
Department of Commerce that punitive tariff rates will be levied
against the Taiwan companies, Wang said the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA), after thorough consultations with local SRAM makers
and industry associations, has decided to challenge the ruling by the
US International Trade Commission (ITC). The commission recently
upheld an earlier judgment that Taiwan SRAM firms should be subject
to US anti-dumping duties, ranging from 7.59 percent to 113.85
percent.</P>
      <P>Wang said the MOEA will do its best to help Taiwan firms conduct
relevant judicial processes and clearly convey their position to the
ITC.</P>
      <P>Attributing the root cause of charges by US competitors that
Taiwan SRAM makers sold products in the United States below fair
market value to differences in calculating production costs, Wang
said Taiwan will ask the ITC to review the case based on "generally
accepted accounting procedures."</P>
      <P>Under ROC law, after-tax dividends delivered by a company to its
employees are not viewed as part of the workers' wages, thus
resulting in lower production costs for Taiwan SRAM makers, the
economic minister elaborated.</P>
      <P>Wang went on to say that the MOEA will help local firms set up an
internationally recognized accounting system as soon as possible and
push them to forge joint venture partnerships with foreign
counterparts as a way of reducing the recurrence of such incidents.</P>
      <P>Wang also expressed concern at news reaching here over the
weekend that the United States and the European Union are likely to
raise anti-dumping charges on Taiwan-made dynamic random access
memory (DRAM) chips as well. He said the impetus of the potential
threat will be greater than that for the SRAM charges, as DRAMs are
one of Taiwan's major export items, adding that the Board of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) under the MOEA will continue to closely monitor
developments.</P>
      <P>BOFT Director-General Chen Ruei-long urged Taiwan businesses to
quickly follow the lead of US and Japanese firms in establishing a
system to counter anti-dumping charges from overseas competitors.
Such a system, which would involve detailed analyses of production
costs and pricing policies, will help them respond rapidly and
effectively to those accusations, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP LASHES OUT AT MINING IN TAROKO NATIONAL PARK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental group on Sunday lashed
out at the government for allowing marble mining in Taroko National
Park in eastern Taiwan, saying it has destroyed the beauty of the
world-class scenic area.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-lung, secretary-general of the Environmental Quality
Foundation, displayed a series of photographs depicting the battered
landscape at the park as a result of the mining, saying he can no
longer bear to witness the damage being done there.</P>
      <P>Liu said the latest data shows there were 22 mining areas,
involving 4,039 hectares, in operation in the national park as of the
end of 1996. Among them, 16 have received approval to extend their
mining privileges.</P>
      <P>He lamented that one of Taiwan's natural scenic wonders has
become a center for the mining of marble.</P>
      <P>The most outrageous case, Liu said, was a decision by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to extend the privilege of the
Retired Servicemen's Engineering Agency (RSEA) to mine marble near
one of the Taroko area's most beautiful spots, Swallow's Grotto.</P>
      <P>He noted that the 22 mining sites were all established before the
designation of the area as a national park, but criticized the fact
that many operators have been allowed to extend their mining
privileges since that time.</P>
      <P>Liu said that only six approved operators are actually engaged in
mining operations, while 13 have declared a moratorium, and the RSEA
has never begun work at three mining areas where it holds privileges.</P>
      <P>Liu claimed that, in fact, operators are not interested in mining
at all. Rather, he said, they are biding their time in hopes of
receiving a huge sum of money as compensation once the government
announces a ban on mining in the Taroko National Park.</P>
      <P>Liu urged the MOEA not only to stop issuing new licenses, but to
revoke those licenses already in effect as well.</P>
      <P>He said the RSEA, as an agency under the Executive Yuan, has a
special responsibity to set an example by halting mining activity in
the national park.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'TRIPLE-WIN' PLAN PROPOSED TO HELP SE ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>High-ranking officials of the Republic of
China on Sunday called on authorities from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to meet as soon as possible in an attempt to help Southeast
Asian nations through their financial troubles.</P>
      <P>The proposal for what was called a "triple win" situation was
made jointly by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD); Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC); and Shi Hwei-yow, secretary-general
of Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Asia Pacific Industrial
Management Research Council, Chiang suggested that the SEF, through
consultations with its cross-strait counterpart, should invite
Chinese mainland authorities and representatives from countries in
Southeast Asia to hold a meeting as soon as possible to discuss the
regional economic and financial situation.</P>
      <P>The CEPD chief said participants of the meeting should work
together to assist the Southeast Asian nations by helping them to
issue government bonds in accordance with the resolutions passed at a
meeting of an ad hoc group under the APEC Business Advisory Council
(ABAC).</P>
      <P>According to those resolutions, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
and nations that have not been so severely hit by the financial
turmoil, including the United States, Hong Kong, and Japan, should
jointly provide guarantees to allow Southeast Asian countries to
issue government bonds and hold regional financial forums to work out
channels for multilateral consultations.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that, as Taiwan is part of Southeast Asia with US$37
billion in investments and close trade ties to countries in the
region, the recent financial firestorm there has also had a big
influence on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that, from an economic angle, joint efforts with
mainland China in helping Southeast Asian countries are a "triple
win" strategy.</P>
      <P>Wu agreed that such a proposal can bring benefits to Taiwan,
mainland and Southeast Asia. He proposed that the SEF contact the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) to introduce the idea and to seek its inclusion on the agenda
for a meeting with ARATS at the end of April.</P>
      <P>Shi noted that cross-strait dialogue has been suspended for more
than three years and that the SEF and ARATS have exchanged letters
six times since February this year, with no concrete results. He
attributed the lack of progress to the absence of specific goals for
talks, and said the Southeast Asian financial meeting might help to
ease hostilities.</P>
      <P>Both President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Vincent Siew had earlier
presented the idea of cross-strait cooperation to assist Southeast
Asia, which has given rise to heated discussion among political
affairs analysts and economists.</P>
      <P>A delegation of scholars and government officials led by Shea
Jia-dong, deputy governor of the Central Bank of China, left for the
United States on Sunday to rally international support for the
initiative.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Navy authorities confirmed on Sunday
that a former military officer who sneaked back to Taiwan from
mainland China in early April has been arrested and is currently
being detained at a military base in Tsoying, Kaohsiung County,
according to the China Times Express on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The report said military investigators are looking into why Wu
Miao-huo returned to Taiwan after fleeing to the mainland aboard a
ship in 1974, and whether he received training as a special agent
while in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Acting on tips, military investigators arrested Wu on April 9 as
was attempting to register his domicile with Tahu Township
authorities in central Miaoli County, the report said, adding that
Wu, currently a military serviceman on active duty in mainland China,
entered Taiwan on a mainland Chinese passport.</P>
      <P>Under ROC law, military officers who flee to mainland China will
be subject to execution if caught. But as Wu has lived on the
mainland for more than 20 years, capital punishment is no longer
applicable to his case, the report said.</P>
      <P>It noted that relevant authorities are conducting a full
investigation into Wu's motives for sneaking back to Taiwan and will
make a decision on whether to expatriate him or to file legal
charges, pending results of the inquiry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR WARNS OF PLA SPYING ON ROC MILITARY DRILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Intelligence data shows mainland China may
attempt to spy on a major military exercise that Taiwan plans to
conduct later this month by simultaneously staging a submarine drill,
Legislator Trong R. Chai warned on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chai, a Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker representing
Chiayi, quoted "reliable intelligence sources" from the United States
as saying the mainland Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is
planning to conduct a Kilo-class submarine combat drill in waters
near eastern Taiwan. The drill will be timed to coincide with the
Republic of China's massive "Han Kuang No. 14" joint-forces exercise
along the eastern coast of the island.</P>
      <P>The PLA submarines may take advantage of the drill to sneak into
ROC territorial waters, putting Taiwan's air/naval defense and
antisubmarine capabilities to the test, Chai warned.</P>
      <P>Chai said that, according to the information he has obtained from
"authoritative" US intelligence sources, one cutting-edge Kilo-class
636 submarine the PLA has recently secured from the Russian
Federation, will join two other more conventional Kilo-class 877
submarines in the drill.</P>
      <P>The PLA's choice of waters off eastern Taiwan for the maiden
active-duty operations of its most advanced submarine, at a time when
the ROC is conducting joint-forces war games, is a blatantly
provocative move, Chai noted. He urged ROC military authorities to
pay close attention to the scenario.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) on Monday
declined to comment on Chai's allegations, on the grounds that the
MND does not comment on intelligence-related speculation.</P>
      <P>A Navy source reported on Monday that foreign warships and naval
vessels, including submarines, from mainland China, the United
States, Russia and Japan, have on occasion sailed near or passed
through the Taiwan Strait on Taiwan's west side and the Pacific Ocean
off the island's east coast.</P>
      <P>In cases where the foreign military vessels were in proximity to
but not inside the 12-mile zone around Taiwan demarcating ROC
territorial waters, the ROC Navy remained on standby, keeping the
passing objects under close surveillance but taking no action, the
source revealed.</P>
      <P>According to the MND, the Han Kuang No. 14 exercise will be held
under low profile between late April and early May in coastal
Hualien, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MND is intentionally keeping publicity surrounding the drill
to a minimum so as to avoid adding fuel to tensions across the Taiwan
Strait, observers said.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous Han Kuang exercises, no demonstrations of
advanced weaponry systems and military equipment or public displays
of the armed forces' combat capabilities will be made during the
upcoming drill, the MND sources said.</P>
      <P>The 14th installment of the Han Kuang series will focus on
testing the ROC military's air/naval defense tactics, electronic
warfare capabilities, and command-and-control operations, the sources
noted.</P>
      <P>No government officials, lawmakers or media representatives will
be invited to witness the drill, they added.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A four-day trade consultation meeting
between Taiwan and the United States on disputed issues related to
intellectual property rights (IPR) opened here on Monday.</P>
      <P>Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Director-General Chen Ruei-long,
Taiwan's chief delegate in the meeting, said Taiwan should not be
placed back on the United States' annual "Special 301" list, as both
the ROC government and the private sector have effectively
implemented efforts in line with ROC laws to protect US intellectual
property over the past year.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will clearly explain this point to the US side and
reiterate Taiwan's firm determination to continue carrying out such
efforts during the course of the meeting, which will also be attended
by officials from the ministries of finance, interior, education and
foreign affairs, and representatives from the Directorate General of
Customs.</P>
      <P>David Burns, a senior official of the United States Trade
Representative (USTR) office in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs who
arrived here on Saturday, said that the United States has not yet
made a final decision on this year's Special 301 list and that the
major purpose of his current visit to Taiwan is to look into what
efforts the ROC has made in protecting US intellectual goods and what
remains to be done.</P>
      <P>The United States is expected to make public this year's Special
301 list by the end of this month. Countries found to lack adequate
IPR protective measures for US products will be named on the list,
becoming subject to punitive trade sanctions.</P>
      <P>A 1998 report on trade barriers released recently by the USTR
showed that the number of Taiwan-made pirated goods seized by customs
agents around the United States in 1997 was up more than 100 percent
from 1996, raising concerns here that Taiwan may be once again cited
by US trade officials on the Special 301 list.</P>
      <P>Expressing concern that Taiwan's international image could be
seriously tarnished if the island reappears on the list, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs said it will present a concrete package of action
guidelines to show Taiwan's determination in cracking down on
commercial piracy in an effort to stay off the blacklist.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on Sunday that relevant
trade authorities will jointly set up a special task force to
restructure the government's monitoring system for Taiwan exports as
a way of effectively stemming outbound shipments of pirated goods and
spare parts.</P>
      <P>In addition to proposing that the United States and Taiwan sign
an accord for the exchange of data on preventing commercial piracy,
the BOFT will step up product inspection on companies with a record
of IPR infringements, while exports by those companies will also be
subject to stricter requirements, according to Wang.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will
be authorized to contact Beijing to enable mainland Chinese
authorities to better understand the latest Taiwan initiative on
joint cross-strait efforts to help Southeast Asian nations, sources
from the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The SEF, a quasi-official intermediary body, will be authorized
to send a letter to the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), the SEF's Beijing-based counterpart, to inform
authorities there of details of the initiative, said Sheu Ke-sheng,
vice chairman and spokesman for the Cabinet-level MAC, Taiwan's top
agency in charge of formulating the government's mainland Chinese
policies.</P>
      <P>The initiative, presented by President Lee Teng-hui and Premier
Vincent Siew in separate venues on April 7, calls for cross-strait
cooperation to help Southeast Asian countries weather the recent
financial turmoil in the region.</P>
      <P>Upon spelling out the initiative, Lee stressed that the appeal is
purely economic in nature without any political intentions. The ROC
president looks forward to a positive response from Beijing to
Taipei's goodwill proposal, Sheu noted.</P>
      <P>The SEF will approach the ARATS "in black and white," so as to
remove any possibility that Beijing could consider the initiative as
merely "empty talk," Sheu continued.</P>
      <P>Sheu, however, declined to specify when the letter will be sent,
saying only that it will be delivered whenever the Beijing
authorities make a positive response to the aid proposal.</P>
      <P>In responding to the initiative, Sheu noted, mainland officials
are welcome to voice their opinions and to forward suggestions of any
kind. The meetings Taipei has proposed to convene involving officials
from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and the Southeast Asian
countries need not necessarily be held under the APEC framework, he
added.</P>

      <P>Singapore has the best record in the
Asia-Pacific region for combating software piracy, according to a
survey by a leading Swiss business institute.</P>
      <P>For three consecutive years, the International Institute for

nation in the protection of intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>In its latest survey, the institute ranked Singapore ahead of
countries like Denmark, Austria, France, Japan, Australia, Belgium,
Great Britain and Israel, in stamping out software piracy, The

      <P>A copy of the survey report, which was published late last year,

      <P>A TDB spokesman said that the Singapore government has already

rights.</P>
      <P>The elements include strong laws to protect owners and a set-up

anticipation of Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization

      <P>Chen Pao-chi, director of COA's Animal Industry Department, said

onslaught of imported goods, the COA will assist larger-scale hog
farms that can remain competitive, while phasing out smaller
operations.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's hog farms having between 1,000 and 5,000
hogs hold an advantage over smaller operators, adding that such
farms account for 40 percent of the local pork operators and form
the backbone of the domestic hog industry.</P>
      <P>Chen said the COA will encourage the phasing out of hog raising
operations that involve less than 200 animals.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that the main priority of the ministry's
plan will be to assist those hog farmers who can remain competitive
in the pork industry.</P>
      <P>He said the COA will also encourage small-scale chicken farms to
close by offering subsidies of up to NT$2 million (US$60,600) for
each farming household that opts to cease operations.</P>
      <P>The COA estimates that production costs for pork should be held
to under NT$3,800 (US$90.9) per 100 kilograms, while those for
chicken should stay below NT$25 (US$0.75) per kilogram, if producers
hope to compete with imported pork and chicken meats.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, COA Chairman Peng Tso-kwei on Monday again asked hog
farm owners to rigorously implement a vaccination program, in order
to ward off another outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), such as
the one that devastated the local hog population last March.</P>
      <P>Peng's remarks followed reports last week that a hog farm in
southern Tainan County has been i nfected with the highly contagious
FMD, forcing the destruction of 49 animals that were afflicted with
the disease.</P>
      <P>After an investigation, agricultural officials found that the
farm's stock had not been inoculated against FMD.</P>
      <P>To avoid a resurgence of the FMD epidemic, Peng has again urged
hog farm operators to vaccinate their herds.</P>
      <P>Peng said that starting from Aug. 1, only those hogs that have
ear tags showing they have been inoculated will be approved for sale
on the market.</P>
      <P>He said that before the threat of FMD has passed, locally
produced pork will be primarily for domestic consumption. It is
estimated that about 6 million hogs will be required to meet local
needs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FATE OF MARINE DEFECTOR TO BE DECIDED BY JUDGES: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fate of a former ROC Marine Corps
officer who returned to Taiwan earlier this month after defecting to
mainland China 23 years ago will be decided by military judges,
Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan Defense Committee
meeting, Chiang said the crime committed by Wu Miao-huo, 48, is
punishable by death under the Republic of China's military law.</P>
      <P>But the minister added that it is up to the judgment of a
military court whether Wu should be given a capital sentence.</P>
      <P>Wu was a first lieutenant with a Marine Corps amphibious
reconnaissance unit stationed on the ROC-held Wuchiu islet off the
southeastern mainland coast when he defected to mainland China in
1974 on a speedboat.</P>
      <P>According to ROC military regulations, defection to the mainland
is punishable by death, but the offense is subject to a 20-year
statute of limitation. However, as Wu was an active-duty military
officer when he defected, the charges in his case are valid for up to
25 years. Thus, Wu still faces possible execution.</P>
      <P>Police authorities said Wu secretly returned to Taiwan in early
April as a national of the "People's Republic of China." Military
prosecutors arrested him at his father's home in Tahu, Miaoli County,
last Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu is currently under custody at a naval detention center in
Kaohsiung's Tsoying district for questioning to determine the motives
behind his return.</P>
      <P>Military prosecutors in charge of the case were quoted by local
media as saying that they are trying to ascertain whether Wu had come
back on any particular mission. Rumors have it that Wu was assigned
the task of assassinating certain political figures in Taiwan. He was
also said to have received intelligence training on the mainland, but
military authorities declined to comment on all such reports.</P>
      <P>Wu's father, Wu Ah-hsin, said on Monday that his son had come
back simply for a family reunion. "Miao-huo has returned to see me
and other family members," the elder Wu said, adding that his son is
unlikely to carry any special mission because he did not try to
conceal his identity when entering the island using an
identification card issued by mainland Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>Wu Ah-hsin, a Hakka farmer, said his son had mostly stayed at
home since his return and never touched on any sensitive issues. Wu
said he hopes the military authorities will inform him of his son's
current condition. "Military authorities have not contacted me since
they arrested Miao-huo several days ago," he said sadly.</P>
      <P>Local press reports said Wu Miao-huo had been awarded a 10,000
yuan cash reward by mainland authorities for his defection. Wu
claimed he was recently working as an engineer at a chemical plant in
the northwestern mainland province of Shanxi. He reportedly has
established a family there and has two children.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dissidents in a southern province of
mainland China sent a co-signed letter to mainland China's President
Jiang Zemin last Saturday urging him to learn from the spirit of
justice of Hu Yaobang, the late General Secretary of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), and to proceed with political reform.</P>
      <P>Twelve dissidents in Zhejiang Province called for a redress of
the injustices served on the June 4th pro-democracy movement, and for
political reforms, including a lifting of the ban on organizing
political parties and newspapers.</P>
      <P>Those who co-signed the letter were Mao Guoliang, Wang Dunghai,
Wang Yuotsai, Wu Gaoxing, Yeh Wenxiang, Zhao Wangmin, Zhen Daxiang,
Jin Xiouyuan, Huang Zhdao, Zhang Jinlin, Cuei Jianchang and Fu Quan,
according a report from the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and the Democratic Movement in Mainland China.</P>
      <P>April 15th marks the ninth anniversary of Hu's death, and his
courage in reversing miscarriages of justice, as well as his spirit
of bold reform, is still deeply impressed on the people, said the
letter.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the "four modernizations" in industry,
agriculture, technology and national security proposed by the Beijing
authorities, the dissidents proposed their own "four modernizations"
which named press liberalization, the adoption of multiparty
politics, administration according to the rule of law, and the
separation of the armed forces from the control of the CPC."</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin Xinshu, a dissident from Fujian Province,
published an open letter to the Beijing authorities on April 8. Lin
was released on March 19 after almost a month in detention for
objecting to the nomination of former premier Li Peng as chairman of
the National People's Congress, mainland China's parliament.</P>
      <P>In his letter, Lin urged the authorities to permit freedom of
speech, redress the June 4th pro-democracy movement, and release
dissidents Wang Dan, Sheng Lianching and Yang Chinghun.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of his open letter, Lin has been

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN AIRPORT TO BE UPGRADED, NOT TO BE CLOSED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, April 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
has no plans to close the Kinmen Airport and will take immediate
steps to imporve its safety facilities, a senior aviation official
said here on Monday.</P>
      <P>CAA Deputy Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng made the promises
while meeting with Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai and
Legislator Chen Ching-pao at the Kinmen County Government.</P>
      <P>Chang was visiting the offshore frontline island to clarify his
recent remarks made after a spate of domestic air disasters that the
Kinmen Airport doesn't meet safety standards and that it's "pure
luck" there haven't been flight accidents here.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks have prompted a large number of tour groups to
cancel their plans to make sightseeing trips to this offshore
defense outpost in the past few weeks, dealing a serious blow to
Kinmen's tourist industry which is instrumental to the county's
economic well-being.</P>
      <P>Chang asked Kinmen County Magistrate Chen to convey his
sincere apology to all Kinmen folks, saying he felt regret that he
had made such inadvertent remarks. "I should have expressed my
opinions more precisely and prudently."</P>
      <P>Chang assured Chen that the Kinmen Airport will not be closed.
"Moreover, the CAA will adopt measures to renovate its facilities
and make it one of the safest domestic airports."</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said air traffic is Kinmen's most important
link to the outside world. "Your earlier comments on Kinmen airport
facilities have prompted nearly 100 tour groups to cancel their
travel plans," Chen complained, adding that 14 percent of the
county's population make their living on tourism-related services.
"A sharp downturn in tourist arrivals could spark economic turmoil on
this tiny island."</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the Kinmen Airport was adapted from a
military airfield. Like Taipei's Sungshan Airport, the Kinmen
Airport is classfied as a "special airport" which is subject to
stricter safety standards, including weather conditions and more
rigorous training requirements for pilots.</P>
      <P>"As long as all CAA-set safety standards are faithfully
followed, there won't be any problems for aircarft to take off from
or land at the Kinmen Airport," Chang claimed.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that some potential elements, particularly
forest windbreaks and military facilities near runways, may affect
the airport's flight safety.</P>
      <P>Chang said the CAA will cooperate with the Kinmen County
Government and the Kinmen garrison command to remove all
potential hazards. "The CAA will also install a highly advanced
transponder landing system (TLS) and a glide path system at the
Kinmen Airport to increase flight safety."</P>
      <P>Chang further said the CAA will study the feasibility of
either expanding the Kinmen Airport at its present site or
relocate it to Hsihung in the future to meet the demand of the local
tourist industry.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen island group, which lies closer to the southeastern
mainland Chinese coast than to Taiwan, is one of Taiwan's most
important defense outposts. It has become a popular travel
destination since it was opened to civilian tourists a few years ago.</P>

      <P>A Changhua-based doctor
of traditional Chinese medicine who relates insomnia to deficiencies
in liver function, on Monday urged adults suffering from chronic
insomnia to have their livers checked.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chuang Yi-ming of Changhua's Hsiuchuan Memorial Hospital said
the reasons for insomnia are little-known, but according to his
diagnostic experience, he said, liver and psychological problems are
major culprits.</P>
      <P>Citing the case of a 45-year-old woman, Chuang said the patient,
who had suffered chronic insomnia and relied for years on sleeping
pills, was diagnosed to have a "liver deficiency complex."</P>
      <P>After about 20 days of treatment, the patient's chronic symptoms,
including insomnia, headache, fatigue, stiff neck, stomach disorder,
bitter mouth and dry throat were cured, and she was able to give up
the sleeping pills.</P>
      <P>Chuang pointed out that most patients with liver problems don't
have good circulation, as the blood has difficulty passing through
the liver smoothly, causing pressure to the upper half of the body
and leading the patient to develop symptoms similar to his sample
case.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao on Monday
was standing firm on his decision to resign after submitting an oral
resignation to Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen, the sole government official
present at a 30-minute meeting between Siew and Liao in the
afternoon, said the justice minister remained firm in his intention
to resign from the post and asked Siew to approve his resignation
despite the premier's efforts to retain Liao in office.</P>
      <P>Describing the atmosphere of the meeting as "serious," Chen said
he was unsure whether Siew's efforts to retain Liao have been
effective, but added that it was apparent that the two men failed to
reach consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said the premier had high praise for Liao's abilities and
performance over the past 22 months, and encouraged him to remain in
the post in order to make a greater contribution to the country and
society. But a firm Liao insisted on leaving, and asked Siew to help
"fulfill his wish."</P>
      <P>Liao was quoted by Chen as saying that because of family factors,
he hopes to be able to shift to other areas in order to devote
himself to social welfare activities and his teaching career.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Liao denied that his offer to resign has
anything to do with the ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) plan to field him
in the December mayoral election in Kaohsiung City or personnel
changes in the Investigation Bureau, which is under the
jurisdiction of the Justice Ministry.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper had reported on Monday morning that Liao,
potentially one of the most popular KMT candidates for the end-year
mayoral election in Kaohsiung City, might shortly resign from office
and would not accept any further assignments from his superiors,
including running in the mayoral race in Taiwan's second-largest
city.</P>
      <P>According to the front-page story carried by the United Daily,
Liao admitted that he has considered quitting politics in order to
devote himself to his family, educational and social welfare
activities. The justice minister was quoted by the newspaper as
saying that he would not accept any arrangements for his
participation in the year-end mayoral election.</P>
      <P>The report said Liao's family welcomes his decision with "open
arms," and that he was considering tendering his resignation to
Premier Siew at a proper time.</P>
      <P>The report was indirectly confirmed by Liao later on Monday
morning at an inquiry session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Admitting that he is under heavy pressure, Liao said his decision
was not made rashly and that he wishes to shift his energies to other
fields.</P>
      <P>Speaking later in the meeting, the justice minister said the idea
of quitting politics has been on his mind for a long time, as he has
had almost no family life since assuming the post.</P>
      <P>Now that the operations of the Justice Ministry are running on
track, Liao said that the time has come for him to leave.</P>
      <P>According to public opinion surveys, Liao, 52, has been one of
the country's most popular cabinet members since becoming justice
minister in June 1996 on a platform of a continued crackdown on
organized crime and gangsters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S TRADE DEFICIT WITH SOUTH KOREA MAY ZOOM TO US$4 B.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seoul,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Y. C. Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's trade deficit with
South Korea is likely to soar to more than US$4 billion this year,
ROC Representative to South Korea Lin Chun-hsien said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the forecast while meeting with a delegation of senior
business executives from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, Lin said, trade between
Taiwan and South Korea has continued to grow rapidly. But Taiwan has
consistently incurred a deficit in its trade with South Korea in
recent years. The trade imbalance exceeded US$2 billion in 1997 and
is expected to zoom to US$4 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Lin said South Korea has been hit hard by a financial crisis. As
a result, its demand for Taiwan products is not expected to increase
significantly this year. Nevertheless, Lin said, South Korea's
financial crisis has provided good opportunities to buy into major
South Korean enterprises.</P>
      <P>"Because of their special national character, it won't be easy
to operate joint-venture businesses with Koreans," Lin noted, adding
that straightforwardness is a special Korean trait. "If prospective
investors understand this, there are still room for cooperation with
Koreans."</P>
      <P>The 37-member delegation was organized by Taiwan's Core Pacific
Group with a view to seek possible investment or joint-venture
opportunities in South Korea as many KOrean conglomerates are being
plagued by cash shortages.</P>
      <P>Lin Ke-ming, leader of the delegation and president of Core
Pacific Securities Co., said Taiwan has suffered huge trade dificts
with South Korea, indicating that Korean products are very
competitive in the Taiwan market. "We hope to seek investment
opportunities in South Korea's electronics, construction, financial
services and petrochemical industries," he noted.</P>
      <P>The mission, which arrived in Seoul on Sunday, was the first
foreign group to visit here for market inspection. The Korean
government, business and media have all attached great importance to
its arrival.</P>
      <P>The delegation met with Korean Minister of Industry and Energy
Park Tae-young and Minister of State for Trade Han Duk-soo on
Monday. The Korean officials have briefed Taiwan visitors on South
Korea's current interest rate levels, stock market situation,
investment regulations, the general invesmtnet climate and other
related issues.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the group met with senior executives of
Dong-Ah and Samsung groups to discuss possible cooperative deals.
The mission is scheduled to meet with officials of other Korean
business groups, including Hanhwa, Tongyang and Jinro, on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Mission members include chief executive officers of major Taiwan
firms, such as Core Pacific Group, China Petrochemcial
Development Corp., Hong Tai Electric Industry Corp. and Chiao Lung
Construction and Development Co.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's electronics giant Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) will be donating NT$45 million
(US$1.4 million) to a local dance troupe, the Cloud Gate Dance
Theater, in a move aimed at boosting local cultural development.</P>
      <P>TSM Chairman Morris Chang signed a written promise Monday that
commits his firm to contributing NT$45 million over the next three
years to the Cloud Gate Dance Theater Fund, which finances the
troupe.</P>
      <P>Chang said at the brief signing ceremony that he has always
declared that if Taiwan wants to become a scientific and
technological powerhouse, it has to boost its cultural development
and quality of life to attract talent from around the world.</P>
      <P>The cash donation reflects TSM's concern for social development
and is part of the firm's efforts to give something back to the
society that has helped it grow into a world-class semiconductor
manufacturer, he said.</P>
      <P>Yuan T. Lee , president of Academia Sinica and honorary head of
the Cloud Gate Theater, played a key role in the deal. He introduced
Chang to the troupe's founder and general art director Lin Huai-min
two weeks ago and brokered the agreement.</P>
      <P>Lin, who was on hand at the ceremony, said TSM's donation is the
largest the group has received and that it will encourage the members
of the troupe, which was set up 25 years ago with the goal of putting
the island on the world map of the performing arts.</P>
      <P>After a quarter-century of study and practice, the theater is
coming of age and standing on its feet, Lin said, adding that it
deserves a share of society's resources. He said he hopes to raise
NT$200 million (US$6.5 million) to finance the troupe.</P>
      <P>Interest from the fund will be used to set up a permanent dance
studio and a second troupe, both of which will be aimed at being
valuable cultural assets for Taiwan, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLASTICS FACTORY APOLOGIZES FOR BLAZE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 13 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nan Ya Plastics Corp., a subsidiary of the
Formosa Plastics Group, on Monday apologized for a blaze that broke
out late Sunday in its factory in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Nan Ya spokesman Wu Chai-chou said that a preliminary
investigation revealed the fire might have been caused by chemicals
stored at the factory which burst into flame because of high
temperatures.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the exact amount of damage was being calculated,
adding that all of the facilities in the damaged plant, Nan Ya's No.
4 factory in Jen Wu Township, Kaohsiung County, were insured.</P>
      <P>Nan Ya currently has four production bases on the island, with
the PVC plastic sheets the firm produces commanding 60 percent of the
local market. The Jen Wu No. 4 factory had been producing NT$140
million in goods per month, one quarter of the firm's total monthly
production value.</P>
      <P>The fire broke out at 5:30 p.m. Sunday and triggered several
explosions before being brought under control four hours later. By
the time that firefighters were able to put out the flames at 7 a.m.
Monday, the facilities, covering more than 3,300 square meters, had
been almost completely destroyed.</P>
      <P>The heavy smoke from the fire covered the entire neighborhood,
which prompted police to temporarily close off a section of highway
next to the factory for safety reasons, as visibility had been
severely affected.</P>
      <P>No casualties were reported in the fire, but two residents were
sent to the hospital because of feeling uncomfortable after inhaling
the thick smoke.</P>
      <P>Over 100 residents living near the factory protested in front of
the factory on Monday morning, saying the plant had endangered their
lives. The angry residents scuffled with police when they began
pelting the gate of the factory with eggs.</P>
      <P>The residents set up tents in front of the factory to show their
determination to fight against the factory until their demands were
met. The protesters have asked Nan Ya to strengthen industrial safety
measures, buy each resident in the area fire and accident insurance,
and handle the compensation issue immediately.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
predicted in its latest report that, buffeted by the Southeast Asian
financial turmoil, the world economic growth rate will drop to 3.1
percent this year, the lowest level in five years.</P>
      <P>The report on the prospects of the world economy said that
Taiwan's 5 percent annual growth is the highest among the four Asian
tigers, but that this rate still only enables the island to secure
the 26th position in the world.</P>
      <P>Due to the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, the IMF adjusted
the world annual growth rate downward 1.2 percent compared with its
projection made last October. The annual growth rate for the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations recorded the sharpest
modification -- from 5.4 percent to negative 2.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The IMF forecast a 1.8 percent economic growth rate for the four
Asian tigers this year, the lowest level since the end of the World
War II and marking the first time in years that the growth of the
four Asian tigers is expected to be lower than that of the world as a
whole.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to post an annual growth rate of 5 percent
this year and 5.2 percent next year, while Singapore will record 3.5
percent growth this year and 5 percent next year, Hong Kong 3 percent
this year and 4.3 percent next year, and South Korea negative 0.8
percent this year and 4.1 percent next year.</P>
      <P>As for mainland China, its projected growth rate fell to 7
percent this year compared with 1997's 8.8 percent and 1996's 9.7
percent. Meanwhile, the inflation rate on the mainland is predicted
to rise to 2 percent from last year's 1 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An analysis by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) says that the New Taiwan dollar depreciated by
7.6 percent in real terms in the nine months between July 1997 and
this March.</P>
      <P>According to the most recent IMF report, in the past three
quarters the US dollar has virtually and effectively appreciated 9.4
percent, with the British pound up 9 percent and the Japanese yen
rising 2.1 percent, though the yen also depreciated 11.5 percent
against the US dollar during the same period.</P>
      <P>Although the effects of the Asian financial turmoil have not been
severe in Taiwan, the island's currency nonetheless fell 7.6 percent
in real terms during the last three quarters.</P>
      <P>In the same period, mainland China's yuan appreciated 7.3 percent

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thailand and three other Asian countries
have won a significant victory at the Geneva-based World Trade
Organization (WTO) in a dispute with the United States over shrimp
exports.</P>
      <P>A WTO panel in Geneva said on Monday that Washington has no right
to ban imports from shrimp-producing countries that fail to properly
protect sea turtles. The decision confirmed a preliminary ruling
issued last month.</P>
      <P>Thailand, the world's largest shrimp exporter, had challenged the
ban, along with Malaysia, India and Pakistan, saying the ban, based
on US domestic law, is a trade barrier forbidden under WTO rules.</P>
      <P>The issue was largely academic for Thailand, 80 percent of whose
shrimp are farmed rather than being caught at sea. But Thai
authorities pursued the case on principle, saying countries cannot
block trade by imposing their laws outside their borders.</P>
      <P>Even if Washington appeals the decision, Asian countries are
confident of winning, the WTO report quoted Krirk-Krai Jirapaet,
Thailand's ambassador to the WTO, as saying.</P>
      <P>If Washington does not file an appeal within 60 days, it must
either change its law or negotiate fines to be paid to the WTO, the
WTO report added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Monday responded indirectly to allegations that Beijing's newly
acquired submarines will monitor Taiwan's forthcoming military drill
off the island's eastern coast, noting that such a move would be
contrary to Beijing's general way of training and commissioning its
military vessels.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry's terse one-paragraph statement stopped
short of rebutting directly opposition legislator Trong R. Chai's
claims that Beijing is to send its Russian-made Kilo 636-class
submarines to international waters off Taiwan's east coast to keep an
eye on the island's annual military maneuvers slated for sometime
next month.</P>
      <P>Chai, attributing his information to US intelligence authorities,
said Beijing's move is aimed at testing both Taiwan's anti-submarine
tactics and the possibility for its submarines to penetrate Taiwan's
defenses.</P>
      <P>Although the ministry cited its policy of not commenting on
intelligence operations, it also assured the public in the statement
that the armed forces always keep a close watch on Beijing's military
movements and that Taiwan's defense forces will never be caught off
guard.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a US defense official told CNA in Washington that he
knew nothing about Beijing's alleged submarine drills and described
as "virtually none" the possibility that the US government would ever
leak such information to a Taiwan opposition lawmaker.</P>
      <P>The official, who requested anonymity, said whenever intelligence
information is relayed to a foreign country, this is done through
official channels, and that he is therefore informed in such cases.</P>

      <P>A mainland fishing boat that collided with
a Navy ship over the weekend is waiting for repairs at a shipyard in
Keelung, northern Taiwan, a Navy spokesman said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Navy ship was sailing from Suao on the east coast of Taiwan
to the port at Keelung on Saturday when it collided with the mainland
boat in heavy fog.</P>
      <P>The collision left a hole in the fishing boat, which was later
towed to the Keelung shipyard.</P>

Shipping has completed a damage assessment on the mainland vessel and
the Navy will ask a private shipping company to undertake the repair
work.</P>
      <P>As for the cause of the incident, the Navy will ask relevant
agencies to conduct an investigation and will manage follow-up
matters through the Straits Exchange Foundation, a semiofficial body

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate of 6.8
percent in 1997 was the world's 14th highest level, a report on the
global economic prospective released Monday by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) shows.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Republic of Georgia (11 percent),
the Republic of Estonia (10.9 percent), and the Republic of Belarus
(10 percent) -- three federal republics of the former Soviet Union --
grabbed the top three spots in world economic growth rate last year.
Mainland China ranked the fourth with an 8.8 percent economic growth
rate.</P>
      <P>Affected by the Asian financial crisis, the report forecast that
the world economy will only grow by 3.1 percent in 1998, with the

percent and developing countries expected to register 4.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate has been adjusted downward to 5
percent for 1998, the lowest level for the island in 16 years but the

      <P>The IMF predicted that the four Asian tigers -- Taiwan, Hong

    <HEADLINE>NAVY ADMITS NEGLIGENCE IN HANDLING DEFECTOR'S CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Navy General Headquarters (NGH) on
Tuesday admitted negligence in handling an inquiry into whether a
former ROC Marine Corps officer who defected to mainland China some
24 years ago is still on a Navy wanted list.</P>
      <P>Lee Chih-li, director of the NGH's legal affairs department, made
the confession after the defector's father Wu Ah-hsin accused the ROC
military of having deliberately set a trap to apprehend his son.</P>
      <P>Wu on Monday displayed to the local press a letter from the NGH
sent to him last year saying the Navy had not issued a warrant to
arrest his son, Wu Miao-huo. "After receiving this letter, I came to
believe that the defection charges against my son had been
invalidated. Under this assumption, I let my son return to Taiwan
earlier this month for a family reunion," the elder Wu claimed.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his return, Wu Miao-huo was arrested by military
police. He is now under custody at a naval detention center in
Kaohsiung's Tsoying district for questioning about motives behind his
return.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the elder Wu's allegations, Lee stressed that it
may have been negligence, but not a conspiracy, for the NGH to have
issued such a letter to Wu, a Hakka farmer residing in Miaoli County
in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee recalled that Wu sent an inquiry to the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) on Jan. 19 last year asking whether the ministry's
arrest warrant against his son remained valid.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MND issued its arrest warrant against Wu Miao-hou on
June 17, 1974, about three months after the then Marine Corps
lieutenant defected to the mainland on a speedboat from the ROC-held
Wuchiu islet, off the southeastern mainland coast.</P>
      <P>As more than 23 years had passed, Lee said, MND officials were
unaware of the existence of an arrest warrant against Wu when they
received Wu Ah-hsin's inquiry last year.</P>
      <P>The MND then transferred the letter to the NGH legal affairs
department. Lee said although the Navy also issued an arrest warrant
against Wu in October 1974, his name was not included on an annually
published list of fugitives because of negligence on the part of
staff members.</P>
      <P>As a result, Lee said, the NGH legal affairs department wrote to
Wu's father last year, saying his son was no longer being sought by
naval authorities.</P>
      <P>"I myself as well as other NGH staff members in charge of this
case were to blame for the negligence," Lee confessed at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Lee said he has reported the case to Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm.
Wu Shih-wen and asked to be punished for his oversight. Other
relevant NGH staff members will also be disciplined in accordance
with military regulations, he added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the NGH's negligence would lead to a more lenient
sentence for Wu Miao-huo, Lee said he did not think so.</P>
      <P>According to ROC military law, defection to Communist China is
punishable by death. And, as Wu was an active-duty officer when he
defected, the charges in his case are valid for up to 25 years. Thus,
Wu still faces possible execution.</P>
      <P>There has been much speculation concerning the reasons behind
Wu's defection. Lee said military prosecutors will conduct a
thorough, prudent investigation into the case before giving a
verdict.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO PUSH FOR LABELING OF CHINESE MEDICINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health will push for the
labeling of Chinese medicines within six months, a DOH official said
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chung-gwo, newly installed chairman of the DOH Committee of
Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy, made the remarks after he toured the
famous gathering spot for practitioners, vendors and users of
traditional Chinese medicine on Tihua Street in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chang went to several medicinal shops in the area to learn more
about how the vendors sell, label, display and store their products.
He noted that some of the medicines are stocked in bulk quantities
inside large bags with tags informing customers of the prices, but
providing no additional information. Other shops offer the same
product in sealed packets containing smaller doses of the
medicine.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that over half of the traditional Chinese
medicine in Taiwan is now sold in the small-sized sealed packages.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that there are currently no regulations requiring
shop owners to label medicinal products in the manner that food items
are packaged to provide consumers with clear, pertinent information.
This lack of legislation, he said, has contributed to rampant
counterfeiting of Chinese medicines and poses a potential threat to
public health safety.</P>
      <P>Chang said his committee will promote a system of uniform product
information labeling for Chinese medicines within six months. A
standard label will include the name of the medicine, major
components, package size and weight, the date and place of
production, date of expiration, as well as the name of the
manufacturer and the importer, where applicable.</P>
      <P>He said that in the future, products will be tested for the
presence of heavy metal trace elements, pesticide residue and
microorganism count. In addition, product stability, shelf life and
storage methods will also be the focus of routine checks at local
medicine shops.</P>
      <P>It is known that once the measures are implemented, herbal
medicines from the Chinese mainland will be affected most.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chin-sung, president of the Chinese Medicine Commerce
Association, said that 90 percent of the herbs and other plant and
animal ingredients for traditional medicines found in Taiwan
originate from mainland China. The rest, mainly such products as
ginseng, hippocampus and pepper varieties, come from South Korea, the
United States, Vietnam and Indonesia.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese-American forensics expert Henry
Lee said on Tuesday that he has brought the result of his latest
analysis on the brutal murder of former Taoyuan County Magistrate Liu
Pang-you.</P>
      <P>But Lee, who was here to attend an annual meeting on
firefighting, would not reveal the results of his analysis or say
whether it may help solve the high-profile murder case.</P>
      <P>Liu and seven others were shot to death in an execution-style
slaying at his official residence in the morning of Nov. 21, 1996.
The cold-blooded murders shocked the nation.</P>
      <P>Lee, considered one of the world's leading forensics experts, has
been solicited by the National Police Administration to help with the
investigation. Lee had previously gone to the murder scene to collect
evidence, which he then took the back to the United States for
analysis at his laboratory in the state of Connecticut.</P>
      <P>Police said that his reconstruction of crime scene has thrown
much light into the case. Among other things, he has established the
order in which the nine victims were killed. Lee also said that the
perpetrators of the crime wore gloves, a conclusion which differs
from the findings of the police task force.</P>
      <P>Teng Wen-chang, who survived the attack but suffered a massive
head wound, has been unable to recall details of the event and has
been of little help to police investigators.</P>
      <P>Lee met with Ting Yuan-chin, director-general of the National
Police Administration, and Yang Tzu-ching, director of the Criminal
Investigation Bureau, on Tuesday morning to exchange views on the
results of his analysis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER STRESSES DESIRE TO RETAIN JUSTICE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday that
he will do his best to retain Justice Minister Liao Chen-hao, who
submitted a formal written resignation to Siew in the morning after
revealing on Monday his intention to do so.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he will not allow such a capable cabinet member to
leave, the premier said he believes that Liao will consider
withdrawing the resignation given the current situation in society
and his sincere desire to retain him.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at an interpellation at the Legislative Yuan,
Siew also appealed to people not to politicize the matter or view the
development as a political wrangle.</P>
      <P>Liao's decision to resign is simply because of a "personal need
for change" and should not be seen as a "conspiracy," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Denying criticisms from lawmakers with the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party that his administration is on the verge of "falling
apart," Siew said he will seek to convince Liao to retain in the
post in order to make greater contributions to the country and
society.</P>
      <P>Siew admitted that he has been busy handling a series of major
incidents since assuming the post eight months ago, but he said he
does not think that his administration is facing a "crisis." The
premier added that he feels ashamed of nothing because all he wants
is to serve the people and the country.</P>
      <P>Liao is the second minister to resign in the last 30 days,
following Tsay Jaw-yang leaving the top spot in the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications last month. The justice minister
said on Monday that he was considering quitting politics for quite a
while because of family factors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, State Public Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa said he and
more than 20 prosecutors from prosecutors offices islandwide will
call on Liao at Liao's office in the afternoon to express their
desire that the minister stay to continue his crackdown on organized
crime and underworld activities.</P>
      <P>According to public opinion surveys, Liao, 52, has been one of
the country's most popular cabinet members since assuming the post in
June 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PARTICIPATES IN US$1 BILLION LOAN PACKAGE TO THAILAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is one of 17
countries that are providing a loan of US$1 billion to boost
Thailand's exports after the country has experienced a financial
crisis since July last year.</P>
      <P>Thai exporters will be able to draw upon the international loan
from April 16 through the Export-Import Bank of Thailand in order to
purchase raw materials, officials here said.</P>
      <P>According to official Thai News Agency, lead arrangers of the
syndicated loans are 10 international financial institutions, namely
ABN-AMRO Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia Asia, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
Bangque National de Paris--Singapore Branch, Barclays Capital,
Citicorp Investment Bangkok (Singapore), Development Bank of
Singapore, DKB Asia and the Industrial Bank of Japan.</P>
      <P>The 10 lead arrangers are joined by 54 international financial
institutions from 17 countries, namely the Republic of China,
mainland China, Japan, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates,
Australia, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Austria, Spain, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and
South Africa.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Thai Prime Minister's Office said that the total
commitment raised by the lead arrangers involves more than US$1.4
billion, but that Thailand intends to borrow only US$1 billion, or 40
billion Thai baht.</P>
      <P>The international loan agreement was signed on April 1, 1998, in
the presence of Thailand's Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.</P>
      <P>Representing Thailand in signing the loan agreement was
Pridiyathorn Devakula, president of the Export-Import Bank of
Thailand, and Mitsuo Sato, president of the Asian Development Bank
(ABD), who inked the agreement on behalf of the ADB and the
international banks joining the facility program.</P>
      <P>Thailand Finance Minister Tarrin Mimmahaeminda represented the
country's Ministry of Finance as guarantor for the Thai side. The
accord is also guaranteed by the ADB.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the facility is to improve the accessibility of
credit for export-oriented businesses, Thai officials said.</P>
      <P>The EXIM Bank of Thailand will extend the loans to exporters
through qualified Thai commercial banks and the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand.</P>
      <P>The conditions for loan extensions are to be set by the ADB. The
facility has a five-year repayment period. The annual interest rate
charged by the ADB is 6.93 percent, and that charged commercial
lenders is 0.80 percent over the London Interbank Offered Rate of
six-month deposits in US dollars.</P>
      <P>The loans extended under the program are intended to finance raw
materials purchased by exporters who will be able to borrow the
facility from April 16.</P>
      <P>In the face of the current economic slump, exports are seen to
play a key role in stimulating the country's economy, Thai officials
said.</P>
      <P>However, liquidity crunch is a major problem, making it difficult
for exporters to buy raw materials to manufacture for export. The
reason is that Thai commercial banks and financial institutions have
been cautious about extending credit to businesses, they explained.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance officials said that this co-financing
loan facility will be the first Thailand is to receive from the
international banking community after it experienced a financial
crisis beginning in early July last year.</P>
      <P>It shows confidence in the Thai economy by the international
money market and signals the recovery of the Thai economy, they
stressed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,  April  14 (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The impact of the Asian financial turmoil
on mainland China has been so great that the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said it expects Beijing
to revise its forecast for the mainland's 1998 economic growth from 8
percent down to 7.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Economic statistics released by mainland China's State
Statistical Bureau under the State Council indicate that the OECD's
estimation is correct, said the Paris-based newspaper Le Monde on
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the statistical report, the industrial product
growth rate was 8.2 percent in the first quarter of this year, far
below the 11 percent rate of the same period of 1997. The mainland's
annual economic growth rate was 8.8 percent in 1997.</P>
      <P>Industrial products had an 11.3 percent growth rate in January
1998. The rate plummeted, however, to 4.9 percent in February, though
it climbed to 9 percent in March.</P>
      <P>Although the mainland's industrial products scored a 13 percent
growth rate in 1997, the rate in the last quarter of that year had
declined to 9.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's economic development has been export-oriented.
Growth in the export sector, however, slowed to 12.8 percent in the
first quarter of this year, down from 20.9 percent in 1997,
indicating that the impact of the Asian monetary crisis that broke
out in July last year has spread gradually to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's import sector has also been affected by Asia's
financial troubles. The mainland's imports from other Asian regions
in the first quarter of 1998 increased 7.3 percent, including an 11.6
percent increase in imports from South Korea and a dramatic rise of
33.5 percent in imports from Thailand, the statistical report
indicated.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji stressed during his visit to
Paris last week that Beijing will not devalue the yuan. In order to
minimize the impact of the economic sluggishness in Asia, Beijing
turned parts of its exports in the first quarter to regions other
than Asia, with a 17 percent increase in exports to regions other
than Asia, including a 40 percent raise in exports to Central
America.</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities are fully aware of the importance of a
sound financial system in getting rid of the impact of the Asian
currency crisis, said the Le Monde.</P>
      <P>Beijing is planning to overhaul its financial systems within
three years, restructure state-owned enterprises, stimulate internal
markets and invest in construction projects on a huge scale,
including the building of public housing, schools, hospitals and
public service projects, the French daily reported, adding that all
of this will be aimed at achieving the expected economic growth
level.</P>

      <P>A retired Australian has announced he
will establish a A$3 million (US$2 million) fund for research into
human cloning.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review, Australia's leading business
newspaper, reported Tuesday that Paget Sayers has run an
advertisement in the daily that he would support funding for "human
cloning research."</P>
      <P>Sayers said he is interested in advancing cloning to the point of
making copies of human bone marrow, skin and organs for medical
purposes.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as a "facilitator" of funding for cloning
projects, Sayers emphasized that he is not talking about cloning
whole humans.</P>
      <P>Sayers, 68, who became wealthy in the giftware trade, is known
for having espoused a number of radical causes. He attracted
attention when he visited North Vietnam at the height of the Vietnam
War and proposed importing North Vietnamese cigarettes into Australia
to illustrate the point that Canberra was not officially at war with
Hanoi. In 1996, while a euthanasia debate raged across Australia, he
proposed building a suicide hospice in Sydney.</P>
      <P>Sayers said he and his friends could provide more money for the
cloning projects so that such work could provide medical benefits,
including an end to the steadily increasing cost of human organs for
transplant operations.</P>
      <P>Sayers is now running the newly created Einstein Institute for

    <TEXT>
      <P>Business migrants from Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and South Africa have invested large sums
of money in Australia that have created more job opportunities for
Australians and contributed a lot to the Australian economy, Federal
Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said the five locations were Australia's top sources of
"business skills migrants," accounting for 80 percent of all such
arrivals. Business migrants from Hong Kong took the lead with 27
percent, followed by Indonesia, 19 percent; Taiwan, 16 percent; South
Africa, 11 percent; and Malaysia, 7 percent.</P>
      <P>In a news release faxed to CNA Tuesday, Ruddock said the latest
data from the survey of business skills migrants who arrived during
1994-95 looks at their progress 36 months after their arrival in
Australia.</P>
      <P>He said businessmen from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia
and South Africa have invested almost A$300 million (US$197 million)
in businesses in Australia.</P>
      <P>"The number of jobs created by business migrants investing in
existing Australian businesses has doubled -- each migrant is
creating an average of 14.9 additional jobs, up from 7.4 jobs in the
previous survey," he said.</P>
      <P>"The number of migrants successfully engaging in business also
continues to grow, with some 88 percent of arrivals currently in
business, up from 78 percent in the previous survey of 1993-94
arrivals," he said.</P>
      <P>"About 45 percent of these are in wholesale trade, 14 percent are
in retail trade, another 14 percent are in business and property
services and 10 percent are in manufacturing," Ruddock said.</P>
      <P>He said a total of 4,143 business migrants (excluding family
members) have arrived in Australia under the business skills class
since it was introduced in 1992.</P>
      <P>"The government believes these migrants will continue to improve
and strengthen their position in the marketplace over time with great
benefit to the Australian economy," he said.</P>
      <P>Business analysts, however, said the official figures do not
fully reflect the actual data from business migrants. Business
migrants from Taiwan alone have invested at least A$1 billion since
the early 1990s, they said.</P>
      <P>Business migrants will continue bringing Australia economic
benefits and contributing to job creation, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCIENTISTS LEARN HOW FLIES ESCAPE FROM SWATTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 14 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Flies have stick-tape feet, elastic wing
hinges and a navigation system to enable them to escape from a swat
in less than 30 milliseconds, according to American and Australian
scientists.</P>
      <P>US researchers have discovered the secret of the guidance system
that enables the buzzing pest to bob and weave so skillfully,
according to a report in Tuesday's edition of The Sydney Morning
Herald.</P>
      <P>Two tiny, drumstick-shaped organs called halteres respond to
visual and physical cues as they stabilize and steer so-called "true"
flies, Dr. Michael Dickson and his colleagues at the University of
California at Berkeley and DePaul University in Chicago reported in
the journal "Science."</P>
      <P>The scientists said flies with their halteres removed quickly
crash to the ground.</P>
      <P>Australian Museum entomologist Dr. Daniel Bickel said the
halteres, which evolved from the hind wings of primitive flies,
orient the insects in flight, much like the gyroscope in a modern
aircraft's autopilot.</P>
      <P>The beating of a fly's wings is controlled by separate "flight
muscles" attached to the thorax or front part of the insect's body,
Bickel said.</P>
      <P>The flight muscles cause the thorax to vibrate up and down, he
said.</P>
      <P>The resulting contraction and compression of the thorax moves the
wings, which are "hinged" to it by a rubbery material called resilin.</P>
      <P>"Resilin is the most highly elastic substance found anywhere,"
Bickel said.</P>
      <P>Dickinson and his team revealed the dual mechanism of the
halteres by tethering flies inside a chamber. They observed that
muscles controlling the halteres stiffened or "fired," depending upon
whether the flies "saw" vertical, sideways or diagonal patterns of
moving stripes.</P>
      <P>Bickel agreed with their conclusion that the halteres serve as a
"major control center or relay station" for visual or physical
messages to change the direction of flight.</P>
      <P>He said the fly's foot pad glands coat the tips of hairs on its
six feet with a light adhesive. To unstick itself, the fly must lift
its feet by starting at one end of each foot.</P>
      <P>"It's like peeling a piece of sticky tape," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PAI HSIAO-YEN'S DEATH ANNIVERSARY MARKED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One year after her only child's
kidnapping and murder, local television celebrity Pai Ping-ping said
she has found comfort only by dedicating herself to the campaign for
a more secure living environment here.</P>
      <P>Pai published a book recounting her daughter Pai Hsiao-yen's
tragic death and the incident's impact on her hearts and minds on
Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of Hsiao-yen's murder.</P>
      <P>Pai told a news conference that proceeds from the book, titled
"Fly Bravely! My Dear Daughter," will all be donated to police for
purchasing an ambulance in hopes to save more lives.</P>
      <P>The popular actress-TV hostess said she earnestly hopes her
daughter's death will help awaken local people to fight crime and
create a safer and more harmonious living environment. "I also hope
my daughter's soul will finally lay to rest," an emotional Pai
added.</P>
      <P>In remenbrance of her daughter, Pai has set up cultural
foundation to promote children's and adolescents' physical
safety and well-being.</P>
      <P>Pai said at Tuesday's conference she feels regret that the only
surviving mastermind of Hsiao-yen's kidnapping-murder, Chen
Chin-hsing, still refused to disclose the source of the large
quantities of firearms previously possessed by him and his
accomplices.</P>
      <P>"Although Chen had made a public apology to me during a court
hearing over Hsiao-yen's death, I couldn't believe he truly repents
his sins until he reveals the source of his firearms," Pai stressed.</P>
      <P>Hsiao-yen was a 17-year-old senior high school student when she
was kidnapped near her home in Linko on the outskirts of Taipei on
April 8, 1997. The kidnappers originally demanded a record ransom of
US$5 million, but they never showed up to pick up the money. Her
chained and naked body was discovered in a ditch in Wuku, Taipei
County about 10 days after her murder on April 14 last year.</P>
      <P>Hsiao-yen's tragic death, following two other high-profile
murder cases reported in late 1996, shocked the nation and sparked a
public outrage over the government's inability to curb the mounting
crime rate. Two massive-scale demonstrations were staged in Taipei
last May to push the government to take effective measures to stem
crime and bring to justice all suspects involved in all those
cold-blooded criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Under intense police efforts, two of the three masterminds of
Hsiao-yen's kidnapping-murder, Lin Chun-sheng and Kao Tien-ming,
committed suicide in separate shootouts with police last year.</P>
      <P>The only surviving key suspect, Chen Chin-hsing, surrendered
to the police last November after a 24-hour standoff at the residence
of a South African diplomat in suburban Taipei. Chen took hostage
the South African diplomat and his family. Though the diplomat and
one of his daughters were unintentionally injured by Chen in the
process, his wife, youngest daughter and a baby in the family's
care were released unharmed.</P>
      <P>During their run, Chen and Kao Tien-ming also committed many
other crimes, including the murder of three persons at a Taipei
plastic surgery clinic and a series of rapes.</P>
      <P>Chen was given unprecedentedly harsh sentences by the Panchiao
District Court on Jan. 22, 1998, including five death sentences, two
life terms in addition to 59 years and six months in prison. Chen
has appealed his case to the Taiwan High Court, whcih held its first
hearing on Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF OFFICIAL VISIT TO MAINLAND POSSIBLE THIS MONTH: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said on Tuesday that a
visit to Beijing later his month by a deputy secretary-general of the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) is highly possible.</P>
      <P>Lin said there is a good possibility that the SEF will dispatch a
deputy secretary-general to Beijing on April 21-22 in response to a
proposal put forward by its Beijing-based counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The proposal came in a message from the ARATS to the SEF on
Monday, suggesting a meeting to discuss relevant issues which would
pave the way for a visit by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Although the date proposed by the ARATS is only one week away,
Lin said the SEF will very likely dispatch a deputy secretary-general
to Beijing at that time, which is also very close to the fifth
anniversary of the historic first meeting between Koo and ARATS
Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>However, Lin was reluctant to disclose which of the two SEF
deputy secretary-generals will be appointed to embark on the mission.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang met for the first time on April 29, 1993 in
Singapore, marking the first contact between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait in more than 40 years.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS are semiofficial organizations set up by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to deal with bilateral exchanges in
the absence of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Regular SEF-ARATS talks were unilaterally suspended by Beijing in
1995 after ROC President Lee Teng-hui paid a visit to the United
States in the summer of that year. Beijing interpreted Lee's historic
visit as a move towards the promotion of Taiwan independence.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday received
a group of Canadian members of Parliament (MPs) and reiterated the
Republic of China's determination to realize national reunification
in accordance with a gradual, sequential plan.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan, the Canadian
MPs, including Gar Knutson, Celine Hervieuxipayette, Inky Mark,
Charles Hubbard, Stan Dromisky, Pauline Picard and Devinder Malhi,
paid a courtesy call on Lee at the Presidential Office, where they
exchanged views with the ROC officials on issues of mutual concern
between the ROC and Canada.</P>
      <P>Lee told his guests that in addition to having had rapid economic
development, the ROC on Taiwan has been very successful in various
reforms, and that people on Taiwan not only have wealthy lives but
also enjoy full democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>Taiwan attained these achievements in a relatively short period
of some 50 years, the president pointed out. He said the ROC would
like to share the invaluable "Taiwan experience" with the Chinese
mainland and other countries in the world.</P>
      <P>The visiting Canadian MPs, who said they were deeply impressed
with Taiwan's political, economic and social development, agreed with
Lee that the "Taiwan experience" could serve as a model to others.
They also expressed their hope that in addition to strengthening
their current economic and trade relations, Canada and the ROC can
also enhance their cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The visitors also expressed concern over cross-strait relations
and asked about Taiwan's current challenges.</P>
      <P>In his reply, Lee reiterated that there has been no change in the
ROC's determination to seek national reunification. The president,
however, also pointed out that there are still large gaps between
both sides of the Taiwan Strait in their political systems as well as
in the ways of life of their inhabitants.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC government devised the "Guidelines for
National Unification" in the hope of achieving the peaceful
reunification of China gradually, in order to let those on both sides
of the strait enjoy political freedom, democracy and an equitable
distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>The president also said that the ROC is a sovereign state and
said that it therefore expects to be able to join international
organizations and to make its own contributions and give feedback to
the international community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PROFESSOR DEFENDS HIS ARTICLE'S REFERENCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, April 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Professor Li Chia-wei of
National Tsinghua University on Tuesday defended the form of
references to Taiwan in his essay published in the US periodical
Science in March, saying that they do not run counter to the Republic
of China's national policy.</P>
      <P>Li and mainland Chinese paleontologist Chen Junyuan jointly
discovered the oldest-known fossils of complex animal life forms,
known as "pre-Cambrian sponges with cellular structure," earlier this
year in Guizhou, southern mainland China.</P>
      <P>The two scientists identified sponge remains and animal embryos
in the 580-million-year-old Early Vendian Doushantuo phosphate
deposit in central Guizhou.</P>
      <P>Their finding has moved back the date of the earliest appearance
of complex and varied forms of life on earth by 40 million to 50
million years.</P>
      <P>The finding is poised to supply important data toward
understanding the mystery of evolution's "big bang," known as the
Cambrian explosion.</P>
      <P>"Our discovery of the oldest animal fossils, including sponges
and various kinds of animal embryos, indicates there were probably
varieties of animals belonging to several known phyta that lived 40
million to 50 million years before the Cambrian explosion," Li said
in an interview with Taiwan media in February.</P>
      <P>The important discovery -- published simultaneously in separate
reports in the March issue of Nature, a British journal, and Science
-- look set to rewrite the history of life on the planet.</P>
      <P>The journal Science, however, was castigated on Tuesday by the
New Nation Front, a pro-Taiwan independence political group
comprising several members of the Legislative Yuan, for identifying
Li as being from "Taiwan, China."</P>
      <P>The New Nation Front, organized by six ex-members of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, blasted Li for using funds
from the ROC National Science Council to conduct his research with
mainland Chinese scientists but then "not using Taiwan's name."</P>
      <P>In response, Li, now deputy president of National Tsinghua
University, discounted the fact that the article in Science
identified him as an expert from the "National Tsing Hua University,
Hsinchu, Taiwan, China" and the National Museum of Natural Science,
which he formerly headed, as being in "Taichung, Taiwan, China."</P>
      <P>Likewise, the article identified the mainland Chinese
paleontologist as an expert from "Nanjing, China," Li noted.</P>
      <P>Li said he followed a tacit understanding that when an academic
report involves cross-Taiwan Strait issues, the authors choose to
define or interpret the meaning of "one China" differently. While
Taiwan-based academics have their own interpretation of "one China,"
their counterparts in mainland China have another, he added.</P>
      <P>Li said he does not think that the references in the Science
report to "Taiwan, China" infringe upon the ROC's sovereignty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
announced on Tuesday that from midnight, April 15, domestic prices of
oil products will be reduced by an average of 1.51 percent.</P>
      <P>The price reductions will affect consumer prices as follows: high
grade gasoline -- cut from NT$18.4 to NT$18.2; unleaded 95 gasoline
-- down from NT$18.2 to NT$18; unleaded 92 gasoline -- down to NT$17;
high-grade diesel oil -- NT13; and ordinary diesel oil -- NT$11.8.</P>
      <P>Household liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be cut from NT$11.33
to 11.11 per kilogram, while LNG for cars will be reduced from
NT$10.9 to NT$10.8.</P>
      <P>According to the CPC, as of the end of March this year, the
company's cumulative surplus in fiscal year 1998 amounted to NT$11.03
billion, which, compared to the budget goal of NT$16.55, means there
is still a shortfall of NT$5.52 billion.</P>
      <P>However, due to a decline in international oil prices and the
stability of the new Taiwan dollar, participants in an oil price
advisory group meeting held on April 10 expressed their optimism on
future oil price trends.</P>
      <P>Prompted by this optimism, and in order to reflect the decline in
oil prices, the CPC said it decided after careful consideration to
adjust domestic prices of oil products downward.</P>

      <P>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has

(CPI) will hit 4 percent this year, but local officials disagree.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Central Bank of China (CBC) said on Tuesday that
after taking into consideration the fluctuation of the new Taiwan

      <P>The forecast is based on the fact that despite price hikes for
foodstuffs, especially vegetables, caused by Typhoon Herb in 1996,
Taiwan's CPI growth only reached 3.07 percent for that year.</P>
      <P>Seasonal demands and currency fluctuations are two major factors
which decide changes in consumer prices, the CBC officials said,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A steady Japanese yen is beneficial to
Taiwan's currency, and if the yen rebounds in the future, it will in
turn make room for the new Taiwan dollar to appreciate, Liu Tai-ying,
chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) Business Management Committee, said
on Tuesday without elaborating.</P>
      <P>Liu, who made the remarks before departing for Tokyo to take part
in a meeting, noted that if the yen plummets substantially in the
future, the NT dollar will have difficulty maintaining its value.
Again, he did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>However, the ruling KMT's top business manager stressed the
unlikelihood of the yen depreciating further, given the fact that
major world economic watchdogs such as the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) have reached a tacit consensus that maintaining financial
stability in Northeast Asia and Southeast Asia is essential if
another financial storm is to be avoided in the region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, commenting on the latest IMF forecast which projected
Taiwan's real economic growth for 1998 at 5 percent, Liu admitted
that Taiwan's economy has to some extent been affected by the
Southeast Asian financial meltdown, but stressed that it will
definitely be no problem for Taiwan to achieve growth of at least 5
percent this year.</P>
      <P>In a report on global economic prospects released on Monday, the
IMF forecast that Taiwan's economic growth rate for 1998 will be
adjusted downward to 5 percent, the lowest level for the island in 16
years but the highest rate among the four "Asian tigers."</P>
      <P>The IMF predicted that the four "Asian tigers" -- Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Singapore and South Korea -- will chart an average 1.8 percent
annual growth this year, the lowest increase since World War II.</P>

      <P>Taiwan on Tuesday called for the signing
of a memorandum or an accord on the exchange of customs monitoring
data with the United States in order to bolster cross-border
crackdowns on intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements.</P>
      <P>Taiwan made the proposal during the second day of a bilateral
trade consultation with the United States on disputed issues related
to IPR protection.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the US delegation, led by David Burns, a
senior adviser to the US Trade Representative (USTR) office, accused
the ROC government of failing to trace sources of commercial piracy,
and the Taiwan customs authorities of failing to stop pirated goods
from being shipped abroad, serious charges which could see Taiwan be
placed back on the US' annual "Special 301" watch list this year.</P>
      <P>The Special 301 list is expected to be published by the end of
this month. Countries found to lack adequate IPR protective measures
for US products will be listed, making them subject to punitive trade
sanctions.</P>
      <P>Burns quoted a recently released 1998 USTR report on trade
barriers as saying that the number of Taiwan-made pirated goods
seized by customs agents around the United States in 1997 was up more
than 100 percent from 1996.</P>
      <P>Burns also noted that while the USTR plans to include Paraguay on
this year's Special 301 list, US customs authorities found that a
number of pirated goods from Paraguay actually originated from

    <HEADLINE>SPINAL CORD INJURY TREATMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, April 13 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at the Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis have discovered how cells called
oligodendrocytes, which insulate the axons of neurons, might die
after catastrophes in the central nervous system.</P>
      <P>They also found that compounds that block glutamate's destructive
action reduce stroke-related injury of oligodendrocytes in culture.
These findings appeared in the March 1998 issue of Nature Medicine.</P>
      <P>More recent work has revealed that these compounds, called AMPA
receptor antagonists, also protect white matter in the injured spinal
cord. The compounds are being examined in clinical trials to evaluate
safety, and it soon might be possible to test their effectiveness
against central nervous system damage.</P>
      <P>"Preserving the function of just a small fraction of the damaged
long cables that go down the spinal cord could provide meaningful
improvement in day-to-day function for people who sustain spinal cord
injury," says John McDonald, assistant professor of neurology at the
School of Medicine and director of the Spinal Cord Injury Unit at
Barnes-Jewish Hospital.</P>
      <P>In the early 1980s, researchers at Washington University in St.
Louis discovered that glutamate, a chemical messenger that neurons
squirt onto other neurons, turns into a killer when it floods onto
neighboring cells from ruptured neurons. They named this phenomenon
"excitotoxicity" because glutamate can overexcite receptors on nearby
neurons, opening channels that admit lethal amounts of calcium. These
receptors are called NMDA receptors because they can be stimulated in
the laboratory with a glutamate mimic called NMDA.</P>
      <P>Subsequent experiments convinced the neuroscience community that
oligodendrocytes are invulnerable to glutamate damage.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 20 percent of Taiwan's indigenous
river fish species have become extinct because of pollution, and
fishing with poison and electricity, according to a survey by a local
scholar.</P>
      <P>The increasing amount of leisure time enjoyed by Taiwan's
population, which has seen more and more people converging on the
island's rivers for swimming, boating, camping and fishing during
holidays, has further threatened fish stocks, according to the survey
by Lin Yao-shun, professor of botany at the National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>Lin, who authored the survey after spending a year studying the
creeks of Nanshih and Tungho in Wulai, Taipei County, found that
there are only eight fish species left in Nanshih, which was
previously infested with native fish species, while only seven
species survive in Tungho.</P>
      <P>The alarming decrease is also apparent in other Taiwan rivers,
further illustrating the rapid disappearance of native fish species.</P>
      <P>Of the some 150 fish species recorded in Taiwan, 20 percent have
already been wiped out by overfishing and pollution, said Lin.</P>
      <P>In the two creeks studied by Lin, it is common to see people
fishing with poison, electricity or nets. Most of their catches end
up on the tables of local restaurants catering to tourists, according
to the survey.</P>
      <P>Although poisoning and electrocution of fish is illegal in
Taiwan, offenders are never caught by law enforcers, said Lin in his
survey.</P>
      <P>Increasing leisure time also threatens fish stocks as hikers and
picnickers contaminate rivers, altering the temperature and volume of
water flow, which in turn disrupts fish breeding patterns, said Lin.</P>

following an oral resignation he delivered during a meeting with Siew
on Monday.</P>
      <P>Liao was quoted by government spokesman Chen Chien-jen as telling
Siew that he hopes to devote himself to social welfare activities and
his teaching career, as well as to spend more time with his family.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Liao denied that his intention to resign has
anything to do with the ruling Kuomintang's plan to field him in the
December mayoral election in Kaohsiung City, or with personnel
changes in the Investigation Bureau, which is under the jurisdiction
of the Justice Ministry.</P>
      <P>Public opinion surveys show that, Liao, 52, has been one of
Taiwan's most popular cabinet ministers since taking office as
justice minister in June 1996 on a platform of a continued crackdown
on organized crime and gangsters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S  MILITARY  `BARELY ADEQUATE', SAYS FORMER CIA CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) Director James Woolsey said in Taipei on Tuesday that Taiwan's
lobby in the US legislature is inadequate, and that the ROC Ministry
of National Defense (MND) apparently lacks comprehensive planning for
military procurement.</P>
      <P>Woolsey, who is visiting Taipei with four other American military
and intelligence experts, said that only after visiting Taipei in
person has he come to realize that the MND's patterns of strategy and
military procurement are actually 20 years out of date, leaving
Taiwan's military barely capable of coping with modern trends.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Beijing might continue to exert pressure on the US
to reduce sales of weaponry to Taiwan, Woolsey noted that Washington
has no plans at present to alter its arms sales policy regarding
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Whatever the PRC demands, Woolsey said, the United States will
continue to sell "adequate" arms to Taiwan in accordance with the
Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan bolster the establishment of a missile
defense system, saying that only by developing this type of system
can Taiwan effectively secure the island's security.</P>
      <P>Woolsey pointed out that the ROC government, particularly its
representative office in the United States, has failed to lobby the
US Congress, so that there is no pressure on the US legislature to
push for more military sales to the island.</P>
      <P>Woolsey and the four other American visitors -- Dr. Michael
Pillsbury, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, Dr. Gordon
Oehler, a former director of the CIA's technology transfer evaluation
center, Dr. Kent Harrington, a former head of the CIA's Asian
intelligence department, and William Wright, a retired vice admiral
who once served as an Asia-Pacific affairs division chief at the US
Department of Defense -- are here at the invitation of Parris Chang,
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party's representative in
the United States.</P>
      <P>They were invited to Taipei to help the people of Taiwan better
understand the development of the delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing
trilateral relationship, and to help work out a strategy to cope with
increasingly close Washington-Beijing ties, said Chang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CATHOLIC ORGANIZATION ISSUES STATEMENT ON NAME CHANGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Regional Bishops' Conference,
a Catholic organization in Taiwan, on Tuesday issued a statement
clarifying the recent change of its Chinese name.</P>
      <P>The organization, comprised of bishops from the Taiwan area,
recently changed its Chinese name to "Taiwan Chiao Chu Chu Chiao
Tuan" from the original "Chung Guo Chiao Chu Chu Chiao Tuan,"
although its English name remained unaltered.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that the decision was made within the
Taiwan Catholic church after discussion and an opinion poll, that the
name-change has nothing to do with politics, and that it was made to
streamline the administrative operations and future work of the
Taiwan Catholic church and to root the Catholic church more firmly in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, the opinion poll was conducted before
Most Rev. Paul Shan, Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Kaohsiung, was
elevated to archbishop by the Holy See. The poll shows that more than
83 percent of local pastors, parish priests, nuns, and Catholics in
general, supported the change of name.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official dismissed a
report that the change of name may be related to the Holy See's
alleged intention of establishing ties with mainland China. He also
suggested that the media should spend less time making wild and
unfounded reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IC PRODUCTION EXPECTED TO TOP US$4.5 B. IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With a total of 17 silicon wafer
manufacturing plants operating on Taiwan, the island's IC production
is expected to top NT$150 billion (US$4.57 billion) in 1998, up a
whopping 44 percent from the previous year, the Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's IC industry churned out NT$105.3 billion worth of
products in 1997, marking a relatively hefty growth of 15 percent
from the preceding year. The value translated into a 3 percent share
of the global IC market, as compared with 2.4 percent posted in 1996,
said a spokesman for ITRI's Electronic Research and Service
Organization (ERSO).</P>
      <P>According to Chen Hsing-hsiung, deputy general manager of ERSO,
the IC production value, tentatively put at around US$4.6 billion for
1998, could be much larger if related foundry services, packaging
technology and testing engineering are counted in.</P>
      <P>IC manufacturing -- with foundry services, packaging technology
and testing engineering included -- will undoubtedly become the
flagship of Taiwan's electronics industry, which is in turn the
backbone of Taiwan's industrial development, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Taiwan's electronics sector churned out NT$247.9 billion
(US$7.56 billion) worth of products, an increase of 30 percent from
the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The figure is predicted to grow further by a stunning 48 percent
to NT$360 billion (US$10.97 billion) this year, according to an ERSO
estimate.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the buoyancy in the electronics industry's
performance to operational expansions in existing manufacturers and a
continual influx of newcomers.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that he called the island's IC industry growth of
15 percent last year "relatively hefty" because of how this figure
compares to those of other major IC making countries.</P>
      <P>The world's IC industries generally experienced a slump in 1996,
down a record of 9 percent from the previous year. Although they
regained some momentum in 1997 by securing an average growth of 4
percent, their performances were considered slow in contrast with
Taiwan's continued growth over the past several years, Chen pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, the world's largest semiconductor maker in foundry
service, now dominates 45 percent of the global foundry service
business, as compared with 35 percent a year ago.</P>
      <P>The remarkable increase in foundry service is mainly because
orders from leading IDM companies -- including such big names as IBM
and Intel, which design, manufacture and test ICs -- have continued
to grow, according to Chen. Last year, about one-fourth of Taiwan's
foundry services were conducted for IDM firms, and the ratio is
expected to grow to between 30 percent and 35 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's IC industry, however, is not free from troubles. As
compared with the overall production, which commanded about 9 percent
of the global IC output last year, the IC industry's transaction
value was relatively low, commanding about only 4.4 percent of the
world's total.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the low transaction value to several factors,
including Taiwan's manufacture of low-added-value IC chips, its
taking up of low profit-margin foundry services and its production of
other relatively low-priced IC items.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that Taiwan's IC industry must seek to
innovate its production pattern, and upgrade its research and
development levels if the island is to survive the "third
semiconductor industry revolution."</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  April 14 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Computer Associates International Inc.
(CA) of Long Island, NY, announced Tuesday it has signed a global
agreement with Tatung Corp., Taiwan's leading vendor of workstations
and PC servers, under which Tatung will use CA's Unicenter TNG to
manage its worldwide operations.</P>
      <P>Under the new agreement, Tatung will adopt Unicenter TNG to
integrate its PC-based global information technology infrastructure,
including monitoring its overseas factories. Unicenter TNG's
management of multiplatform environments will enable Tatung to
integrate heterogeneous and distributed servers, databases,
application systems and network architectures in its worldwide
offices and manufacturing sites.</P>
      <P>"We recognize the fact that in the coming century, our ability to
compete and satisfy our customers will be increasingly contingent on
having a robust, reliable computing and communications
infrastructure," said Tatung President W.S. Lin in a CA news release.
"Unicenter TNG will be a key strategic technology for Tatung because
it will enable us to maximize the performance of that infrastructure
while minimizing our long-term cost of technology ownership."</P>
      <P>The release said that Unicenter TNG can lower operation costs and
raise productivity, a critical component to Tatung's global logistic
system. In addition, it said, Unicenter TNG features -- such as
software delivery, network management and "advanced help desk" --
will help Tatung's MIS staff to maximize the efficiency of their IT
resources and leverage control of their global network for
competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>Last fall, Tatung agreed to bundle CA's Unicenter TNG Framework
with all its UNIX and Windows NT servers at no additional cost to
customers, and to resell Unicenter TNG through its Computers and
Communications Business Division. In addition, Tatung's Institute of
Technology was authorized to incorporate CA's enterprise management
methodology and technologies into its standard curriculum.</P>
      <P>CA is the world leader in mission-critical business software. The
company develops, licenses and supports more than 500 integrated
products that include enterprise computing and information
management, application development, manufacturing and financial
applications. CA employs over 11,000 people in 160 offices in 43
countries and had revenue of US$4.5 billion in calendar year 1997.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  14  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Canadian women expelled from Mexico
told a press conference in Montreal Tuesday that the Mexican
government wants to get rid of witnesses who can talk about
repression in Chiapas.</P>
      <P>Julie Marquette and Sarah Baillargeon were arrested and deported
over the weekend. Marquette said, "It's clear they (the Mexican
authorities) don't want people to see what's going on. They don't
want the rest of world to have proof of what they're doing."</P>
      <P>The two Quebec women insisted their role in Chiapas was "strictly
passive" and that they were not serving as political activists in any
way. They said they were there only to observe the respect of human
rights.</P>
      <P>But what they observed from last Thursday until their arrest was
anything but respect, Marquette claimed. The thousand or so people in
a village had formed an autonomous village administration; the two
Canadians were invited, along with 30 other Mexicans and foreigners,
to observe.</P>
      <P>Marquette said soldiers arrived by night -- about as many police
and soldiers as the villagers -- and rounded up the Zapatista
sympathizers and burned houses; they also arrested the observers and
smashed their cameras and video equipment, she said.</P>
      <P>Marquette, 21, and Baillargeon, 24, said they were treated like
criminals after their arrest in the southern state of Chiapas. They
added they were refused water, food and freedom.</P>
      <P>Marquette said she will never remain silent after this
experience. She called on the government of Canada to address the
issue of human rights abuses in Mexico on a government-to-government
basis.</P>
      <P>The two were in Chiapas for Salut Le Monde, a Montreal-based
human-rights group. They are among 12 people deported on charges of
trying to help the aboriginal people create an independent state.</P>
      <P>Mexico has accused the observers of meddling in its internal
affairs. It said it was defending national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said earlier he
disapproves of the way the expulsions were handled. He said he plans
to ask his Mexican counterpart about the deportations during a
regional summit next weekend in Santiago, Chile.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Vice Economics Minister Yin
Chi-ming of the Republic of China said on Tuesday that high-tech
Japanese companies should take advantage of the current situation to
invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the recent Asian financial crisis has had only a
limited impact on Taiwan, Yin said this is because of Taiwan's solid
industrial base, the ROC government's liberalization policies and the
island's flexible small and medium-sized business sector, adding that
Taiwan's high-tech sector -- including the biochemical,
pharmaceutical and aerospace industries -- will continue to grow.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference here, Yin said he expects Japan's
investment in Taiwan to reach a new high this year, noting that the
figure surged to US$850 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's expanding trade deficit with Japan, Yin
attributed the phenomenon to Taiwan's growing importation of key
parts and components from Japan, and he expressed the hope that the
ROC's mounting trade imbalance with Japan would narrow with the
increased establishment of joint venture partnerships between
companies of the two countries.</P>
      <P>The vice economics minister also called on mainland China not to
politicize the motives of Taiwan's aid proposals for crisis-hit
Southeast Asian countries, saying that doing so would not help
resolve the problems. "Helping needy neighboring countries is
tantamount to helping ourselves," he noted.</P>
      <P>Yin arrived in Osaka on Sunday at the head of a 20-member trade
delegation. The delegation then proceeded to Tokyo on Tuesday and is
scheduled to return to Taiwan on Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC DEPUTY GOVERNOR MEETS US DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting senior ROC banker on
Tuesday urged the United States to support a Taiwan initiative to
help battered Asian economies under the framework of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Shea Jia-dong, deputy governor of the Central Bank of China
(CBC), made the appeal while meeting with US Deputy Secretary of the
Treasury Lawrence H. Summers.</P>
      <P>Shea told Summers that the Taiwan initiative doesn't require
Asian governments to provide funds. "They only have to serve as an
underwriter," he noted.</P>
      <P>According to the proposal, the central banks of battered Asian
economies issue the US dollar-denominated bonds for sales in APEC
countries to raise funds for repaying their short-term foreign debts
or financing major development projects.</P>
      <P>APEC groups 18 economies -- Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, mainland China, Mexico, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand and the US.</P>
      <P>Shea said the proposal is mainly aimed at absorbing private
capital to help cash-strapped Asian countries revitalize their
economy.</P>
      <P>In addition to the central banks of the bond issuing countries,
Shea said the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as well as private and
state-owned banks of APEC economies willing to join the program can
also serve as underwriters for such bonds. "By so doing, the bonds
will be able to attract even more investors," he said, adding that
the ADB once floated Dragon bonds in Taiwan, which had received good
market response.</P>
      <P>Shea told Summers that the APEC Business Advisory Council
already approved this Taiwan initiative at its annual meeting held
in early March in Mexico. Several APEC members, including Malaysia
and Indonesia, have also expressed keen interest in the project.</P>
      <P>In response, Summers said he has never heard of this proposal,
adding he is willing to carefully study its feasibility.</P>
      <P>Summers further said the US will be willing to throw its support
behind any special Taiwan initiatives to help its Asian neighbors in
case those programs are acceptable to the international community.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, ROC representative to the US, told Summers that
the Republic of China cannot participate in many international
relief programs and economic cooperation conferences. For instance,
the US didn't invite Taiwan to attend a meeting of central bank
governors and finance ministers from 22 economies, also known as
G 22 meeting, to be held in Washington, D.C. later this week.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC is willing and can afford to join various
international cooperative programs, Chen said he hopes the US would
support its bid to enter major international financial and economic
organizations.</P>
      <P>For his part, Summers suggested that the ROC more actively
contact all countries around the world to explore bilateral or
multilateral cooperative programs in various fields.</P>
      <P>Summers further said he has on many occasions helped clarify some
misunderstandings about the New Taiwan dollar's devaluation last
October.</P>
      <P>Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for
International Economics, once accused Taiwan of having intentionally
allowed its currency to depreciate, asserting that the devaluation
was totally unnecessary and violated every norm of international
cooperative behavior.</P>
      <P>Summers said he disagreed with Bergsten's view and has helped
clarify such misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>Shea, heading a high-profile delegation of finance and economics
officials, arrived in Washington, D. C. on Sunday. Shea's mission is
to seek opportunities for Taiwan to join international financial
cooperative programs.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Shea and other mission members also met with Lawrence
Meyers, a governor of the US Federal Reserve System, to exchange
views on a range of issues, including the possible impact on
Taiwan's economic growth of the Asian financial crisis, the
greenback's future moving directions and the development of single
European currency.</P>
      <P>Following its Washington visit, the group will also travel to
New York and Chicago to meet with American financial experts and
bankers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PROPOSES IMPROVED EXPORT MONITORING SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) on Wednesday proposed to make comprehensive amendments to
Taiwan's export monitoring system (EMS), in an effort to stay off the
US' "Special 301" watch list of countries not doing enough to stem
intellectual property rights (IPR) infringements.</P>
      <P>The proposal was made during the second day of a bilateral trade
consultation meeting with the US on disputed issues related to IPR
protection.</P>
      <P>The US delegation, led by David Burns, a senior adviser to the US
Trade Representative (USTR) office, accused Taiwan of being the US'
second-largest source of pirated goods in the world in 1997, behind
only mainland China, serious charges which could see Taiwan placed
back on the Special 301 list this year.</P>
      <P>Having discovered that the number of Taiwan-made pirated goods
seized by customs agents around the US in 1997 was up more than 100
percent from 1996, and that some popular "Nintendo" video game
software from Paraguay actually originated in Taiwan, the USTR began
to cast doubt on the executive efficiency of Taiwan's EMS since 1992,
according to Burns.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation, headed by Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT)
Director-General Chen Ruei-lung, promised to see to it that Taiwan's
EMS is immediately bolstered and improved.</P>
      <P>The measures will include increasing the Directorate General of
Customs' responsibility for cracking down on IPR infringements and
violations, conducting all related inspection work in customs
offices, and changing the "pass first, inspect later" pattern for all
17 categories of US-bound computer software products into a pattern
of "inspect first, pass later."</P>
      <P>The new EMS will also impose 100-percent inspections on export
products from companies with a prior record of IPR infringements,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The US is expected to publish this year's Special 301 list by the
end of this month. Countries found to lack adequate IPR protective
measures for US-bound products will be named on the list.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE COPS DETAIN 22 UNION WORKERS FOR BLOCKING CARGO LOADING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian police have detained 22
sacked workers of Patrick Stevedores Ltd. for blocking trucks
carrying containerized cargoes for loading at the company's terminal
at Port Botany in Sydney.</P>
      <P>A police spokesman said thousands of former workers of Patrick,
accompanied by their spouses and children, staged a picket line near
the port, blocking the way for trucks to load cargoes at Patrick's
terminal.</P>
      <P>It is understood the 22 detained workers will be questioned for
blocking the cargo loading, but it remains to be seen whether they
will be charged.</P>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday defended the
police action and condemned the picketers.</P>
      <P>The sacked workers, mainly members of the Maritime Union of
Australia (MUA), were supported by the Australian Council of Trade
Unions (ACTU), Australia's biggest union group, and scores of
university students.</P>
      <P>ACTU assistant secretary Greg Combett on Wednesday accused the
Australian government of conspiring with Patrick to sack MUA member
workers, saying the ACTU "will support the MUA all the way through"
in its protest against the firing of the union workers by Patrick.</P>
      <P>Both the MUA and Patrick are suing one another at the federal
court.</P>
      <P>The MUA is suing Patrick for unlawful sacking and wants all 1,400
fired workers to be reinstated. But Patrick is suing the MUA for
unlawful picket lines in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth,
Fremantle and other ports to block cargo loading.</P>
      <P>Labor industry analysts believe the showdown between Patrick and
the MUA will continue in the coming week or even months until a
compromise is reached between them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY EXERCISES SEEN RENEWING CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Military exercises by Taiwan and
mainland China are expected to renew tension between the two sides,
according to a mass circulation newspaper in Australia Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, The Sydney Morning Herald's
correspondent David Lague reported that mainland China will conduct
military exercises near the Taiwan Strait this week and that the
Republic of China's Defense Ministry will conduct exercises later
this month.</P>
      <P>In an article headlined "Two Chinas Rattle High-tech Sabres in
Taiwan Straits," Lague quoted military analysts in Beijing as
predicting that the exercises could renew tension between Taiwan and
mainland China because the Taiwan Strait is one of the world's most
dangerous flash points.</P>
      <P>The daily reported both Taiwan and mainland China will test new
high-tech weapons and tactics in the exercises, which are clearly
aimed at fighting a war across the 160 km of water that separate the
two rivals.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) will mount
massive military exercises to boost its capability to fight high-tech
wars, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily also reported Taiwan will mount similar military
exercises later this month.</P>
      <P>Military analysts believe Taiwan now still holds the edge in
technology over mainland China, but they note that the PLA has been
shopping for new fighters, artillery, tanks, communications, warships
and radar.</P>
      <P>Tension between the two sides has receded since early 1996 when
the United States sent two aircraft carrier battle groups to the
South China Sea to deter mainland China from attacking Taiwan when
Beijing was conducting missile tests near the island, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>However, the risk of a military clash remains a threat to
regional peace as support for independence remains strong in Taiwan
while Beijing refuses to rule out the use of force if the island
declares its independence from the mainland, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the United States, which is determined to
boost its ties with mainland China, has warned Taiwan's independence
movement by sending senior defense officials, including William
Perry, Gen. John Shalikashvili and Brent Scowcroft.</P>
      <P>The US officials told Taipei that Washington would not support
Taiwan if it declares independence because it would bring the United
States into direct confrontation with mainland China, the daily said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCOTTISH, AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTS SEE CLONING AS POTENTIAL LIFESAVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cloning technology may one day provide a
cure for quadriplegia, paraplegia, serious illnesses such as malaria
and Parkinson's disease, and may also be able to save the lives of
thousands of people awaiting organ transplants, according to Scottish
Professor Ian Wilmott, who stunned the world last year when he
introduced "Dolly" the sheep, the first mammal to be created through
cloning.</P>
      <P>Wilmott and a group of other scientists are currently in
Australia to discuss cloning at a scientific meeting at Monash
University in Melbourne.</P>
      <P>Dolly is expected to make headlines again soon when she gives
birth because she is now pregnant, Wilmott told reporters on Tuesday.
"She is now coming up to two years old... normal breeding age. So she
is pregnant," Wilmott said.</P>
      <P>Wilmott said he opposes the cloning of humans and is comfortable
with a British law that prohibits human cloning.</P>
      <P>"If you were to make a copy of somebody, I don't think you are
treating that child as an individual. So it's a sort of a child abuse
story," he said.</P>
      <P>"I have not heard of a reason for cloning a person which I find
attractive, ethically acceptable," he added.</P>
      <P>But Wilmott said there is a clear distinction between cloning a
human being and producing cells in order to treat diseases.</P>
      <P>He said breakthroughs following on from the cloning of sheep may
eventually cure many diseases in humans.</P>
      <P>Professor Alan Trounson, deputy director of the Institute of
Reproduction and Development at Monash University, agreed, predicting
that one day a human will be cloned for "very, very good medical
reasons."</P>
      <P>"I think it's a fact of life that everything has both a good side
and a bad side," he added, pointing out that it will be up to society
to determine how far cloning will go in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS HIGHLIGHTS S'PORE'S STRENGTHS, SAYS LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   April   15  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian economic crisis has
highlighted Singapore's strengths as a center for high-tech, high
value-added manufacturing, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the regional crisis may have given Singapore
breathing space for a few years, but as neighboring economies
recover, they will emerge as leaner and stronger competitors.</P>
      <P>The government is committed to ensuring that the manufacturing
sector remains a major pillar of the Singapore economy for the long
term, he said at the opening of a S$1.3 billion (US$810 million)
semiconductor plant in Singapore by Japan's Hitachi and Nippon Steel
Corp. Tuesday.</P>
      <P>To keep Singapore's manufacturing sector vibrant, Lee pointed to
three strategic thrusts: building capabilities through science,
technology and innovation; manpower resource management; and building
outstanding companies by nurturing local enterprises.</P>
      <P>However, he said, manufacturers must embrace innovation to seek
new business opportunities and areas of growth.</P>
      <P>The government is also looking into further infrastructure and
facilities that would help foster more research and development and
innovative activities, he added.</P>
      <P>And to encourage what he termed "techno-entrepreneurs" to set up
in Singapore, he said the government is exploring ways to assist
start-ups.</P>
      <P>Suggestions include encouraging start-ups to offer alternative
forms of remuneration, such as stock options and setting up an
additional platform for those with good technologies, but no track
record, to raise funds from the public.</P>
      <P>Looking beyond financial incentives to give the economy a
competitive edge, Lee said: "We also need to create an environment
that nurtures creativity, where rules and regulations are not beyond
what is necessary. An environment that is conducive to calculated
risk-taking and is tolerant of 'intelligent' failure."</P>
      <P>He hailed the opening of the Hitachi Nippon Steel silicon wafer
fabrication plant as a milestone for Singapore, being the first such
plant here involving majority stakes from two leading Japanese
corporations.</P>
      <P>The plant -- which will make 64-megabit dynamic random access
memory computer chips -- is a joint venture between Singapore's
Economic Development Board (which will control 30 percent of the
company), Japan's electronics giant Hitachi (35 percent) and
engineering conglomerate Nippon Steel (35 percent). It will employ
600 engineering professionals and skilled workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE STOCK MARKET HITS RECORD HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian stock market, buoyed by
US banking mergers, rose further Wednesday morning after hitting a
record high Tuesday, while the Australian dollar hit a three-month
low Tuesday and headed further down against the greenback early
Wednesday, market analysts said.</P>
      <P>They said the bank merger mania in the United States has
encouraged Australian investors to buy banking shares in this
country, bringing the All Ordinaries Index to a record high of 2840.9
on Tuesday, up 35.1 points from Monday's closing level. The index
rose another nine points in morning trading Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The stock market is bullish because the bank merger mania has
thrilled many Australian investors," one analyst said, adding, "They
believe the mania will have a far-reaching impact on the banking
industry in Australia."</P>
      <P>"There is much room in our stock market for further expansion as
the index remains relatively low now," another said.</P>
      <P>But the Australian dollar dropped 0.64 US cents further after
plunging to a three-month low of 64.90 US cents on Tuesday, down 1.05
US cents from Monday's closing level, foreign exchange dealers said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the plunge of the local currency to a string of
factors, ranging from the waterfront dispute between Patrick
Stevedores and the Maritime Union of Australia, to an expectation of
further interest rate cuts.</P>
      <P>The dispute has and is delaying shipments as more and more ships
are forced to wait for both loading and unloading their cargoes in
major Australian ports, they said.</P>
      <P>"The waterfront dispute is turning off international investors.
The international community perceives that our own backyard problems
are now more sharply in focus. They are adopting a wait-and-see
attitude now," one dealer said.</P>
      <P>Businessmen hope that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will
reduce banking interest rates further so that Australia can improve
its competitive edge in the world market. The RBA made five interest
rate cuts between July 1996 and July 1997, bringing the official rate
to 5 percent from 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Dealers believe the Australian dollar could drop further if the
waterfront problem continues to worsen. They expect the Australian
currency to drop to 63.20 US cents, which is the 11-year low it hit
earlier this year.</P>

      <P>Although the idea of sending reporters to
Taiwan for long term news coverage has been mulled by the mainland
Chinese news media, "no plan has yet been mapped out," in this
regard, according to a Beijing-datelined story from the Hong
Kong-based Wen Wei Bao on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The story centered on an upcoming 10-day visit to Taiwan on April
17 by a 16 member delegation comprised of heads and representatives
of mainland China's 11 central government-level media, at the
invitation of the Cultural Foundation of Taiwan's United Daily News.</P>
      <P>The delegation is scheduled to visit some 20 media organizations
in Taiwan, including the Taipei-based Central News Agency, the

    <HEADLINE>YANG MING SHIPPING COMPANY TO JOIN NEW WORLD'S ASIA-MED SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Yang Ming shipping company is
expanding its relationship with The New World Alliance (TNWA) with
the deployment of vessels on its Asia-Mediterranean service, The
Business Times of Singapore reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A joint statement from Yang Ming and TNWA -- which comprises
shipping companies from Singapore, South Korea and Japan -- said that
beginning "later this year" Yang Ming will participate in the
Asia-Mediterranean service as a vessel operator, the report said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Yang Ming's Head Office in Taipei said that they
have yet to decide how many vessels the company will deploy on the
service, the report added.</P>
      <P>TNWA members currently operate eight 2,413 twenty-foot-equivalent
unit (TEU) container vessels on the route.</P>
      <P>The deal is an extension of a cooperation pact announced by Yang
Ming and TNWA earlier this year, the report said.</P>
      <P>The decision to join the TNWA on the Asia-Mediterranean route
sees Yang Ming bring to an end its five-year cooperation program with
France's Compagnie Maritime d'Affreitment (CMA) on the same route.</P>
      <P>The Yang Ming spokesman said that the new deal will enable the
carrier to offer better-quality service to its customers in Japan.</P>
      <P>The TNWA Asia-Mediterranean service calls at Pusan Port in South
Korea and the Japanese ports of Kobe, Nagoya and Yokohama before
sailing on to Taiwan and then the Mediterranean via the Middle East,
whereas the joint service with CMA originated in Taiwan and did not
call at any Japanese ports.</P>
      <P>Yang Ming has also established a vessel-sharing agreement with
China Ocean Shipping Co. and K-Line on the trans-Atlantic trade
route, the spokesman added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US, TAIWAN REACH CONSENSUS ON CRACKING DOWN ON PIRATED GOODS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade officials from the United States and
Taiwan on Wednesday reached consensus on cracking down on pirated
goods from Taiwan entering the US, on the third and last day of a
round of consultations on US intellectual property rights (IPR)
infringements.</P>
      <P>The US delegates, led by David Burns, a senior official of the US
Trade Representative (USTR) office, promised to provide data every
quarter from US customs concerning IPR infringements for Taiwan's
reference.</P>
      <P>The US side will also provide complete information on 165 cases
involving counterfeit products originating from Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's chief negotiator Chen Ruey-long of the Bureau of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) said the information provided by the US will allow the
government to learn what kinds of pirated goods were seized by US
customs officials and how they violated US trademark, patent, or
copyright laws.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government will then be able to take action to plug
loopholes in the laws regulating the export of goods, which will have
a positive effect on combating the export of pirated goods.</P>
      <P>He reemphasized the fact that the government and private sector
have made a great deal of effort to ensure IPR protection. "Taiwan
attaches great importance to IPR protection, and cherishes its image
in the international community," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the US will not put Taiwan back on the
"Special 301" list because of the IPR issue.</P>
      <P>To increase the efficiency of the crackdown on counterfeiting,
Taiwan also promised to strengthen its export monitoring system
(EMS), which is also of serious concern to the US, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The US negotiators noted that while the USTR plans to include
Paraguay on this year's Special 301 list, US customs found that a
number of pirated goods from Paraguay actually originated from
Taiwan, prompting the US to cast doubt on Taiwan's EMS.</P>
      <P>The US will decide by April 30 whether to list Taiwan among
countries that fail to adequately protect IPRs. Inclusion on the list
would subject Taiwan to punitive retaliatory trade sanctions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham)
in Taipei has expressed concern to the office of the US Trade
Representative over the possibility that Taiwan will be placed on the
"Special 301" watch list, which is to be announced by the end of the
month.</P>
      <P>AmCham President Jeffrey Williams told US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky in a letter dated April 13 that the chamber has
noted that a number of company and industry representatives in the US
have asked that Taiwan be designated as a priority foreign country or
be put back on the Special 301 watch list this year.</P>
      <P>Saying that AmCham was pleased that Taiwan was removed from all
Special 301 lists in late 1996 and was able to avoid being named to
any category in 1997, the president expressed worry that Taiwan will
be listed as a copyright violator because of its deficient efforts to
curb intellectual property rights infringements.</P>
      <P>The chamber agreed that more effort should be made by Taiwan to
improve its laws and enforcement measures on IPR, he said, adding
that putting Taiwan back on one of the Special 301 lists at this time
would not be a good idea as it would be counterproductive to the
overall ongoing efforts by both the Taiwan side and US government and
industry to improve IPR in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He stressed that while continued monitoring of Taiwan's progress
in the area of IPR protection should be carried out, there is no need
to return Taiwan to one of the Special 301 lists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEARCH FOR MISSING F-16 GOING ON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All available evidence still does not
fully ascertain that a F-16 jetfighter which lost contact during a
routine training flight on March 20 crashed into the sea, a senior
intelligence official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yin Chung-wen, director of the National Security Bureau, was
quoted by opposition New Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang as having made
the statement at a closed-door Legislative Yuan Defense Committee
meeting.</P>
      <P>Yin told lawmakers present at the meeting that the security
bureau basically respects the views of the Air Force General
Headquarters (AFGH) and the Ministry of National Defense (MND) on the
possible fate of the aircraft and pilots aboard.</P>
      <P>Both the AFGH and the MND said the twin-seat F-16 from the Chiayi
air base was most likely to have crashed into seas off Penghu, an
island group lying off the southwestern Taiwan coast.</P>
      <P>However, Yin said neither the wreckage of the plane nor any oil
spill has so far been discovered in waters near where the aircraft
was supposed to have crashed. "So at the moment, we still do not have
adequate evidence to justify claims that the fighter crashed into
seas," Yin was quoted as stating at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Yin promised that his bureau will employ all resources at its
disposal to assist in search of the warplane and the two Air Force
officers aboard -- flight instructor Maj. Wen Chin-sung and trainee
Capt. Chang Chia-cheng.</P>
      <P>"Yin was very cautious and prudent while talking about the
issue. I support his reserved attitude," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin recounted a Cold War-era incident to caution military
authorities to exercise wariness in handling the case to avoid being
misled by any Communist Chinese tricks. In the 1950s, a US U2
reconnaissance plane was shot down during a high-altitude flight in
the air space of the now-defunct Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the incident, then US President Dwight D.
Eisenhower said the plane had intruded into the Soviet air space by
mistake. But a few days later, Gary Francis Powers, the U2 pilot,
publicly admitted on Soviet television that he was engaging in a
secret monitoring mission.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, rumors have it that the missing F-16 plane has
appeared in the southern mainland Chinese city of Guangzhou.</P>
      <P>MND officials said they would not comment on such unfounded
reports. They quoted an analysis by an MND-AFGH joint task force as
indicating that the plane was most likely to have crashed into seas.</P>
      <P>Following a comprehensive study of the loyalty, character, daily
lives and family backgrounds of the two pilots aboard, as well as of
the flight path and all radar records showing the entire process from
the start of the plane's flight until the disappearance of its
signals, the officials said, the task force has few reasons to
conclude that the plane had been commandeered to rival mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the officials said they see no reasons for Beijing
authorities to conceal the news should the F-16 really have defected
to the mainland.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the officials said, the missing plane was not the
most advanced F-16 C/D version. It is not difficult for the mainland
to obtain information about software and hardware on the F-16 A/B
fighters.</P>
      <P>The officials said what mainalnd China really wants is
intelligence about the ROC Air Force's combat strategies or tactics.
The two pilots' ranks are, however, not high enough to allow them
access to such information, the officials asserted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the officials said, neither side of the Taiwan
Strait any longer offers financial incentives or other rewards to
defecting military officers from the other side. Against this
background, the officials said, chances that the two F-16 pilots have
defected are slim.</P>
      <P>The officials further said the military has not given up its
search and rescue operations, adding that the MND is also
investigating the whereabouts of the plane through various
intelligence channels.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-NUCLEAR ACTIVISTS DEMAND CLOSURE OF N-POWER PLANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local anti-nuclear alliance on Wednesday
staged a demonstration in front of the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy
Council (AEC), calling for closure of Taiwan's three existing nuclear
power plants.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Anti-Nuclear Action Alliance also demanded that the
council revoke a permit for a controversial fourth nuclear power
plant now under construction.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the alliance further blamed the AEC for failing
to revise the domestic radiation exposure dose limit in accordance
with new standards set by the International Committee of Radioactive
Protection (ICRP) in 1990.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still follows the per capita annual radiation dose limit
of 5 mSv. set by the ICRP in 1977. In fact, the spokesman said, the
ICRP reduced the limit to 1 mSv. per person annually in 1990. "The
council should immediately lower the domestic radiation exposure
ceiling to 1 mSv to conform with the ICRP standard and better protect
local people's health," he urged.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also condemned the AEC for its inability to stem
the use of radioactive steel plates and bars in construction of
residential buildings on the island.</P>
      <P>Several private residences constructed between 1993 and 1994 were
recently found to contain contaminated steel bars. "Six years have
passed since the first batch of radioactive homes were discovered.
What has the council done to improve the situation?" he asked.</P>
      <P>The first group of radioactive homes were mostly built between
1982 and 1984. More than 180 additional radioactive buildings have
been discovered over the past years, and many of these structures
were constructed between 1987 and 1992.</P>
      <P>"Since the AEC has required all local steel mills to install
radioactivity monitoring equipment starting in 1992 and such
facilities have also been installed at all toll stations along the
Sun Yat-sen Expressway, how can residential buildings constructed in
1994 contain contaminated steel bars?" the spokesman said. "We demand
to know whether the AEC has performed its supervisory duties
faithfully and whether it has discovered the culprits behind these
problems."</P>
      <P>As nuclear waste from the three existing nuclear power plants is
believed to be the primary source of radioactive contamination, the
spokesman said the three plants should be closed as soon as possible
to resolve the "hot houses" problem once and for all.</P>
      <P>The alliance has designated April as anti-nuclear awareness
month. It has planned a series of activities to enlist support for
its cause, including a large-scale parade in Taipei scheduled for
April 26 to mark the 12th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster in the now-defunct Soviet Union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE PORT SETS RECORDS IN CONTAINER HANDLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  15 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Port of Singapore Authority Corp.
(PSA) has set two new records in the area of container handling so
far this year, in terms of the number of containers handled in a
single month and on a single-vessel call.</P>
      <P>In March, the PSA set a new record for the number of containers
handled in a single month -- 1.31 million twenty-foot equivalent
units (TEUs). This is the highest monthly throughput recorded so far
since containerization began at the Port of Singapore in 1972, the
PSA said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The previous record was established in October 1997, when PSA
handled 1.27 million TEUs in that month. The record throughput
handled last month was 10 percent higher than the throughput handled
in March last year.</P>
      <P>On April 2, the PSA also set another new record -- the largest
number of containers handled during a single-vessel call -- with
5,600 TEUs being loaded and unloaded from the 6,600-TEU Susan Maersk
at a vessel rate of 125 moves per hour, the authority said.</P>
      <P>On average, the PSA handles about 2,000 TEUs for a
third-generation vessel.</P>
      <P>The PSA's overall annual average container rate for 1997 is 88
moves per hour, which is the fastest in the world, the authority
said. The average turnaround time for a vessel with 1,000 containers
at the PSA is about 11 hours, it added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER MEETS FORMER CIA HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew expressed the hope
that the United States will continue to sell high-performance
defensive weapons to Taiwan in line with the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remark when he met James Woolsey, former director
of the US Central Intelligence Agency, here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that the Republic of China has made substantial
progress in democratic development and advancement of human rights in
the past decades. He said this not only serves as a model for other
Asian and Pacific countries, but also exerts a positive force for
political reform in the mainland China.</P>
      <P>To safeguard the well-being of Taiwan people, as well as the
peace and stability of the Asian Pacific region, he urged the United
States to continue selling weapons to the ROC so long as Beijing
continues to refuse to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed cautious optimism on whether the ongoing economic
reforms in the mainland will be successful.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that new mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in
embarking on an ambitious overhaul of state-owned enterprises and the
agricultural sector, will be forced to lay off over 20 million
workers from unprofitable state-run businesses alone. He said chronic
mass unemployment will result in destabilization on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that although Zhu has achieved initial
success in controlling inflation in the mainland economy, many
uncertainties lie ahead.</P>
      <P>Siew said Beijing's reforms in agriculture must involve more than
simply the upgrading of productivity. Educational reform is also an
urgent need as most of the peasants in the mainland are illiterate,
and it will be a daunting task to provide them with new knowledge and
technical skills, he said.</P>
      <P>On the role Taiwan can play in the financial crisis currently
afflicting Asia, Siew said Taipei is willing to provide assistance.
However, he emphasized that the problems cannot be solved by any
individual country, but rather through multilateral mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Siew reiterated the proposal that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
should work together to discuss with Southeast Asian nations to find
means by which to ensure financial stability and sustainable economic
growth in the region.</P>
      <P>Woolsey, who served as head of the CIA between 1993 and 1995,
arrived here Monday for a private visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DIPLOMAT URGES AUSTRALIA TO BOOST EXCHANGE OF VISITS BY OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A diplomat from the Republic of China on
Wednesday urged the Australian government to encourage "frequent
visits by cabinet-level officials" between the two countries in order
to help facilitate bilateral trade and investment.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a conference in Melbourne held under the theme
"Expanding Horizons: Taiwan and Australia's Future," Benjamin Liang
said despite the end of diplomatic relations between the Republic of
China and Australia 27 years ago, trade and investment relations
between the two countries "have thrived."</P>
      <P>He cited several investment ventures, including Dual
Technologies, D.G. Technologies, Da Hsing Winery, High-tech Quartz
and Newspaper Recycles, that have been successfully implemented since
he became the director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Melbourne 21 months ago.</P>
      <P>He said two-way trade between Taiwan and Australia totaled US$4.2
billion in 1997 with Australia enjoying a large trade surplus.</P>
      <P>He told Australian participants at the meeting that Taiwan has
made enormous reforms by eliminating nontariff barriers and lowering
tariffs in recent years.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has also made considerable concessions to
Australia, including the first import of 2,000 Australian-made cars,
a 40 percent cut of tariff differentiation faced by Australian beef,
doubling the quota of Australian apples, and first-time access for
stone and citrus fruits in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But if Australia wants to get bigger market share in Taiwan,
Liang said: "I feel that the Australian government could encourage
frequent visits by cabinet-level officials to Taipei and vice versa
either as individuals or as officials. This is most important for
furthering networking and understanding."</P>
      <P>He reminded Australia government officials not to "take Taiwan's
Australian dollars market for granted."</P>
      <P>"Have high officials visit Taiwan and attend activities such as
the Joint Conference of Australia-Taiwan Business Council and the
ROC-Australia Business Council to enhance substantive relations
between Taipei and Canberra. I certainly hope that Canberra will
continue to work with us to promote these objectives," he said.</P>
      <P>As the ROC continues its efforts to move forward in its economic
liberalization and globalization, "Taiwan's presence in international
community should not be denied," he said.</P>
      <P>Other speakers at the conference were Prof. Bruce Jacobs,
director of the Center of East Asia Studies of Monash University; Ron
Bowden, a member of the Legislative Council who serves as the
chairman of the Taiwan-Victoria Parliamentary Friendship Association;
and his vice chairman, Noel Naughan, also a member of the Legislative
Council; and Jeff Turner, trade director of the Australian Business
Center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The conference was sponsored by the Australian Institute of
International Affairs in Melbourne.</P>

      <P>Southeast Asian countries and South Korea
are calling on Japan to lower or abolish customs duties on a range of
items and to boost domestic demand, according to reports of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Japan's imports from Asia have fallen steeply at a time when
countries affected by the currency crisis are trying to rebuild their
economies through exports.</P>
      <P>According to the WTO report, Indonesia and Malaysia are pressing
Japan to lower customs duties on plywood. Thailand is calling for
preferential treatment on jewelry and foodstuffs, such as pork and
chicken. And the Philippines would like to see a cut in duties on
tropical fruit including papayas, pineapples and bananas.</P>

      <P>These countries are also calling on Japan to agree to abolish
import tariffs on marine and forest products by June this year as
part of the voluntary liberalization programs put forward at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last summer.</P>
      <P>Japan's imports from members of the Association of Southeast

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 15 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Wednesday told
visiting former US Central Intelligence Agency Director (CIA) James
Woolsey that the Republic of China and the United States share the
same aspiration for democracy, freedom and human rights, and have
maintained long-term friendly ties.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the ROC has become one of the youngest democratic
countries in the world after having carried out democratic reforms
over the past several years. Saying Taiwan is willing and able to
help other countries, Lien asserted that it is a gross injustice that
Taiwan has been ignored internationally due to its refusal to accept
communism as a political system and lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Lien told the former CIA head that Taiwan is glad to see the
process of constructive engagement between the United States and
mainland China. But, he said, the ROC also hopes Washington can
develop relations with Taipei that are on a parallel with its ties
with Beijing.</P>
      <P>On the possibility that Taiwan might be placed on the "Special
301" watch list for its alleged failure to offer sufficient
intellectual property rights protection, Lien said that Taiwan values
its trade and economic relations with the United States, adding that
such conflicts are common among trade partners. The vice president
expressed optimism that solutions to the IPR protection issue can be
worked out.</P>
      <P>Lien also touched on cross-strait relations. While urging the
mainland authorities to resume the long-stalled dialogue between
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and
Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation, Lien pointed out that Taiwan
does not hold any predetermined stance on the meeting and does not
exclude the possibility of negotiating any issue.</P>
      <P>Lien reiterated that competition between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should be in comparison of political systems instead of
in military confrontation, adding that the Chinese have the right to
choose the lifestyle they want. The vice president voiced confidence
that "Time is on our side."</P>
      <P>Woolsey praised the substantial progress Taiwan has made in
democratic reform, economic development and human rights protection.
He also suggested that Taiwan strengthen its communications with the
US government and the Congress as part of efforts to upgrade
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Woolsey, who served as CIA head between 1993 and 1995 under
President Bill Clinton, arrived in Taiwan on Monday along with four
intelligence and military experts for a private visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY EXCHANGES NOT A FOCUS OF CLINTON-JIANG AGENDA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite increasing military exchanges
between Beijing and Washington, military issues are not expected to
be a centerpiece of the agenda for a forthcoming summit meeting
between the top leaders of the two countries, Pentagon sources said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's resistance, the sources said, military
exchanges between the United States and mainland China are still far
from close and face many restrictions.</P>
      <P>As a result, the sources said, military exchanges will be only
one of the many topics for discussion when US President Bill Clinton
makes a state visit to the mainland to meet with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in late June.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing still resists strategic-level military
contacts with Washington, the sources said no military agreements are
expected to be signed during Clinton's mainland visit. Nor will
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen be among Clinton's entourage.</P>
      <P>The sources further said armed forces-related topics to be
touched upon in the upcoming Clinton-Jiang summit meeting will focus
on cooperation in disaster relief or rescue operations as well as in
investigations into the fate of American servicemen listed as missing
since the Korean War in the early 1950s.</P>
      <P>The sources said Washington has been promoting exchanges of
visits by high-ranking military officials in hopes of pushing the
People's Liberation Army to increase openness and transparency.</P>
      <P>The United States also hopes more personnel exchanges will help
reduce the risk of misunderstandings or accidental conflicts, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Under this policy, arrangements were made for mainland Defense
Minister Chi Haotian and Logistics Department Director Wang Ke to
visit the US Pacific Command in Hawaii and several military academies
during their respective US trips in December 1996 and in early April
this year.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the sources said, mainland China is still reluctant
to open its strategic military installations to US observers or to
arrange for them to meet with its combat unit commanders.</P>
      <P>It marked a breakthrough when Cohen was offered access to an air
force command center in Beijing during his January visit to the
mainland, the sources said. During that visit, Cohen also signed an
agreement with the mainland, aimed at avoiding naval conflicts
resulting from unfamiliarity with each other's operational procedures
or principles.</P>
      <P>Another mainland military top brass, Zhang Wannian, who serves as
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Chinese
Communist Party, is also scheduled to visit the United States on May
5-21.</P>
      <P>Washington-Beijing relations were strained during the 1996 Taiwan
Strait crisis, but their engagements, including military exchanges,
have gradually resumed and become ever closer since Anthony Lake,
then White House national security adviser, made a visit to Beijing
in the autumn of that year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA NOTES 'SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS' IN MAINLAND CHINA'S TRADE REGIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April 15 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian government said Tuesday that
despite the immense opportunity that the Chinese mainland presents,
there are "a number of significant systemic problems and practices"
impeding access to that market.</P>
      <P>In a trade policy report, Ottawa listed such obstacles as the
mainland's high import tariffs and nontariff barriers, inappropriate
standards and investment hurdles, as well as the inability to appeal
rulings by Beijing officials through a judicial review process and a
lack of transparency on the part of the communist regime.</P>
      <P>High tariffs on imports are one of the principle impediments to
Canadian exports, said the report titled "Opening the Doors to the
World: Canada's International Market Access Priorities 1998." It was
released by International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi.</P>
      <P>"A common problem with the Chinese market is a lack of
transparency and the inconsistent application of laws, regulations
and import practices," the report pointed out.</P>
      <P>In customs procedures, for example, it is not uncommon for the
same product to be subject to different levies in different ports.
"This makes for uncertainty in the calculation of export costs and
impedes the establishment of consistent, long-term commercial ties,"
it said.</P>
      <P>Another key issue is the application of standards, it added, as
there are continuing concerns that standards and requirements for
statutory inspection are being used as impediments to market access.</P>
      <P>Canada, it stressed, is attempting to obtain a transparent list
of those standards, in the context of discussions with mainland China
and through the WTO accession process. Canada is also working to
identify those standards that are disguised barriers to trade or
unnecessary impediments to imports, it said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Canadian government released its "China and
Hong Kong Trade Action Plan," stressing that Canada's policy approach
"takes full account of the reality of China's rapidly growing
importance in world affairs."</P>
      <P>Canada, it said, considers an economic partnership with mainland
China to be a "key element supporting long-term relations and
encouraging further integration in global and regional political and
economic institutions."</P>
      <P>Mainland China is Canada's fifth largest export market. It is
third largest if the Hong Kong Special Administration Region is
included. In 1997, Canada's combined exports of commodities to the
Chinese mainland and Hong Kong reached C$3.78 billion (US$2.64
billion), with imports from the two areas totaling C$7.55 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUSHKIN MUSEUM COLLECTIONS TO BE DISPLAYED IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The curator of the Pushkin Fine Arts
Museum of Russia, Irina Antonova, arrived in Taipei on Thursday to
publicize an upcoming exhibition of the renowned collections from the
Pushkin.</P>
      <P>The museum is famed as the enclave of pivotal Western European
art collections acquired by Russians during the reign of Catherine
the Great.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, to be held at the National Museum of History
(NMH) sometime later this year, will mark the largest-scale painting
exhibition in Taiwan from any Russian museum. It will turn a new page
in cultural exchanges between the two countries, said NMH Director
Huang Kuang-nan.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the Pushkin Fine Arts Museum and the State
Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, better known as the Winter Palace
Museum, are two most prestigious museums in Russia, with equal clout
in art circles.</P>
      <P>The pearls of the Pushkin collections are mainly from the czarist
era, with objects from the period when Catherine the Great reigned
over Russia between 1762 and 1796 being the centerpieces, Huang said.</P>
      <P>During the czarist times, he said, Russian officials were sent to
Europe every season on shopping binges to procure highly valued
paintings which accumulated within the walls of the Pushkin Museum
through the centuries.</P>
      <P>The celebrated Pushkin painting collections, masterpieces ranging
from the 16th century to the 20th century, include great works by
Rembrandt, Botticelli and Rubens.</P>
      <P>Paintings by 19th and 20th century masters including Gauguin,
Matisse, Picasso, Cezanne and Monet, also are found in the Pushkin
collections, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>This will not be the first time for the NMH to cooperate with
Russia in presenting cultural exhibitions. More than three years ago,
the NMH sponsored an exhibition of Silk Road Buddhist artifacts from
Khara Khoto, one of the important West Asian cultural collections
housed at the State Hermitage Museum.</P>
      <P>The NMH also tied a sisterhood knot with the Moscow Museum of
Eastern Ethnic Cultures recently for cultural cooperation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
open dialogue soon on measures to protect the personal safety and
property of Taiwan businessmen in the mainland, Lee Ching-ping,
deputy secretary-general of the semiofficial Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after reports said that Taiwan businessman
Yeh Jung-fu, 44, of Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, was killed at his
residence in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, on Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>Yeh's wife, who was in the home at the time of the attack, was
said to be safe under police protection after being briefly abducted
by the assailants. No further details as to the cause of Yeh's death
are available as of press time.</P>
      <P>Lee said the SEF has asked a Taiwan business association in
Quanzhou to help Yeh's family learn the facts of the incident and to
handle related matters. SEF will also send a message to its mainland
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), to request help in the investigation of the murder case.</P>
      <P>Reports said that security forces in Quanzhou had nabbed one of
the two suspects and that the other one was still at large.</P>
      <P>The SEF is now helping two of Yeh's children and other family
members prepare necessary papers to travel to the mainland, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Interior Minister Huang Tzu-wen also said Yeh's case
highlights the need for both Taiwan and mainland authorities to list
crime fighting as a top priority once cross-strait talks resume.</P>
      <P>Huang said he believes the top agenda item in cross-strait talks
should be the prevention of smuggling activities involving guns and

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S LARGEST NAVY SHIP DECOMMISSIONED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Navy held a grand ceremony at
the Hsinpin naval wharf at Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan on
Thursday to mark the retirement of its largest logistical service
ship Yu Tai.</P>
      <P>The naval repair ship, launched in 1944, first served in the US
fleet and was transferred to the ROC Navy in 1975. During its 23
years of service here, the Yu Tai has played a critical role in
logistical services, including naval fleet repair, refueling and
spare parts supply.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of naval officers who had served on the Yu Tai and their
families were invited to attend its decommissioning ceremony, which
was presided over by Yeh Chu, head of the logistical service fleet
under the Naval Fleet Command. Among the participants were the Yu
Tai's nine previous captains.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Yeh said the Yu Tai has contributed
much to the Navy over the past two decades. It has taken part in more
than 40 military exercises and seven overseas friendship promotion
missions. It once sailed to Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Singapore,
Indonesia and Fiji for goodwill visits or offering aid and medical
services.</P>
      <P>The 16,000-ton Yu Tai ship is reputed as a floating factory. It
has a well-endowed workshop and a large warehouse. It can also serve
as an emergency medical center in addition to offering repair,
refueling and maintenance services for seaborne warships.</P>
      <P>The ship stands 191 feet high, with a length of 492 feet and a
width of 73 feet. Equipped with machineguns and other weaponry
systems, the ship can accommodate 247 persons. Over the past 23
years, it has logged more than 183,900 nautical miles.</P>
      <P>Following its retirement, Yu Tai will be auctioned off and
dismembered, naval authorities said, adding that its functions will
be assumed by a large fuel-ammunition supply ship now in service with
the Navy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAN ON ELECTRONIC DEVICES ON PLANES REAFFIRMED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cellular phones are banned on planes and
passengers who violate that regulation will be dealt with severely,
Chang Chia-chu, vice minister of transportation and communications,
reaffirmed on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after reports said that a woman on a
domestic airliner had used a cellular phone in mid-flight earlier
this month.</P>
      <P>The woman, surnamed Wu, was reported to aviation security
officials by another passenger on the UNI Airlines flight from
eastern Hualien to Taipei on April 5. The passenger reported that Wu
had used her cellar phone onboard the plane, an act which could
endanger the safety of others.</P>
      <P>Aviation authorities traced the woman, who admitted to using the
cellular phone but said she only operated the device when the plane
had safely landed and was taxiing on the runway. She claimed to have
never used the phone while in mid-flight.</P>
      <P>But Chang said civil aviation regulations clearly state that
flight crews and passengers should not use electronic devices that
could disrupt the planes' communications, whether the aircraft is
taking off, in mid-flight, landing or taxiing on the runway.</P>
      <P>Those who violate the regulations will be subject to up five
years' imprisonment, mandatory community service or a fine of up to
NT$150,000 (US$4,545), Chang said.</P>
      <P>If the charges against Wu can be substantiated, she could become
the first person to be punished in Taiwan for violating the ban
against using electronic devices aboard aircraft.</P>
      <P>Rigorous implementation of prohibitions against such devices, set
to begin on May 1, is one of a series of measures aimed at increasing
aviation safety announced by the Civil Aeronautics Administration in
the wake of a spate of air disasters in recent months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA SEES PROTECTIONIST PRESSURES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  15  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian government report said that
trade dependency has given Taiwan "strong impetus to trade and market
liberalization," though "domestic political pressures in this vibrant
democracy" continue to result in protectionist and discriminatory
market access conditions.</P>
      <P>The report, released by Canadian International Trade Minister
Sergio Marchi on Tuesday, noted that Taiwan is a "major exporter and
a major source of investment for the region, particularly to China
and Southeast Asia," and is becoming "an important regional
importer."</P>
      <P>The report, titled "Opening Doors to the World: Canada's
International Market Access Priorities," does not seem pleased with
Taiwan's market access for several Canadian products.</P>
      <P>Though a tentative deal was reached late last year between Ottawa
and Taipei over Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO), outstanding details are "yet to be clarified by Chinese
Taipei," it said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has yet to commit itself to open up its market to Canadian
agricultural, industrial and services products before a formal
conclusion of bilateral negotiations, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The report expressed displeasure over Taipei extending
preferential access to the United States for meat items "of export
interest to Canadian suppliers" for the period preceding its WTO
accession, noting that Taipei did this in early 1998, "subsequent to
the tentative conclusion of our bilateral accession talks."</P>
      <P>"This incremental discrimination facing Canadian products in the
Chinese Taipei market must ... be resolved for Canada to officially
conclude the bilateral market access negotiations with Chinese
Taipei," it stressed.</P>
      <P>The policy report said that a commitment to equitable access for
all high-quality Canadian beef was not forthcoming from Taiwan.
"Canada will continue to press Taiwan to end this discriminatory
practice," it said.</P>
      <P>Those thorny issues aside, "the past year saw outstanding
financial services issues resolved satisfactorily in both the banking
and insurance sectors," the report continued. It expressed pleasure
over Taipei's offers for basic telecommunications services, as well
as for advanced telecom and environmental services.</P>
      <P>The report further pointed out that Canada's negotiations with
Taiwan over joining the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement have
"progressed well."</P>
      <P>It said Taipei has concluded bilateral negotiations with most of
the 26 trading partners over WTO accession, and the focus of the
talks will likely shift to the multilateral stage, where the Working
Party Report and Protocol of Accession are still to be negotiated.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Canada's fourth largest Asia-Pacific export market,
accounting for some 6 percent of Canada's total exports to the
region. In 1997, Canada exported C$1.57 billion (US$1.1 billion)
worth of goods to Taiwan, making it Canada's ninth largest export
destination overall. During the same year, Canada's commodity imports
from Taiwan amounted to C$3.47 billion. The two-way trade hit the C$5
billion-mark for the first time last year.</P>
      <P>The Canadian government expects Canadian exports to Taiwan will
grow further in 1998 due to the continued growth in the economy.
Taiwan is among Canada's stronger non-NAFTA destinations for
value-added products and a growing market for agricultural and
agri-food products, it said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A business leader on Thursday urged
mainland China to map out details for a comprehensive plan to
protect Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang Ping-chao, president of the Business Development Foundation
of the Taiwan Strait, made the remarks in the wake of the murder of
Taiwan entrepreneur Yeh Jung-fu, 44, in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan has been asking mainland authorities to sign an
agreement to provide guarantees for protecting Taiwan residents
doing business there since the early 1990s. But he said the requests
have been denied on the pretext that such agreements could only be
signed among sovereign nations.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's State Council, responding to strong demands from
Taiwan businesses, has mapped out investment protection regulations
for Taiwan people. But after criticism that the measures lacked
substance, Beijing has drafted a set of revised regulations and
invited Taiwan businessmen to express their views.</P>
      <P>Chang said that at present only about a dozen provinces and
cities in the mainland have worked out regulations to protect Taiwan
businessmen, and that the security afforded therein applies only to
those individual areas, rather than to the entire mainalnd.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Beijing can devise a comprehensive set of
regulations and set up a uniform window of communication with Taiwan
businessmen operating in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that top priority should be given to the guarantee
of personal safety for Taiwan residents living and working in various
cities and provinces around the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>He also advised Taiwan businessmen to exercise caution when in
the mainland, saying that they should respect local workers, be
careful in their words and actions, and avoid behaving like

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite an overall trend toward
sluggishness in the global economy, Taiwan's processing zones run by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) continue to enjoy good
performances in foreign trade.</P>
      <P>The total value of imports and exports in three processing zones
on the island reached more than US$1.98 billion in the first quarter
of this year, up around 3.1 percent from the same period of last
year, according to the Kaohsiung-based Export Processing Zone
Administration (EPZA).</P>
      <P>Of that amount, exports claimed the lion's share at over US1.78
billion, up 3.2 percent from the previous year. The figure shows that
the processing zones gained a strong competitive edge after making a
transformation from low-end industrial manufacturing to high-tech
operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the successful switchover from labor-intensive
industries to more automated production has also contributed to the
resolution of severe labor shortages that had previously plagued the
processing zones.</P>
      <P>EPZA statistics show there are currently over 60,000 workers
employed by the three export processing zones, located at Kaohsiung

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO UNIFY DOUBLE-TRACK TAX SYSTEMS WITHIN TWO YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In line with the principle that taxes
should be levied equitably, mainland China is to unify its taxation
of domestic and foreign investments by the year 2000, an official
with the mainland State General Administration of Taxation under the
mainland State Council disclosed.</P>
      <P>This development indicates that the Beijing authorities will not
be likely to continue to use the favored tax policy put in place more
than 10 years ago to attract foreign investments.</P>
      <P>Officials related to the matter remarked that conditions for
Beijing to unify the taxation of domestic and foreign investments are
now basically ripe.</P>
      <P>In order to coordinate the implementation of the policy for
unifying the income tax on domestic and foreign enterprises, experts
in Beijing have suggested that matching reform measures should also
be launched.</P>
      <P>These measures, the officials said, should include enlarging
certain market areas for the entrance of select foreign investment,
unifying the financial and wage systems of domestic and foreign
enterprises, setting charging systems and standards that are
applicable to both domestic and foreign investments, building a
social security system that will put domestic and foreign investments
on the same footing, and giving domestic and foreign enterprises the
same regulations concerning recruiting workers.</P>
      <P>Since the Chinese mainland began opening itself to the rest of
the world in 1979, there have been many measures adopted to attract
foreign investments. The favored tax measure is the most attractive
of these.</P>
      <P>The differences in how domestic and foreign enterprises are
treated under the double-track enterprise income tax system have come
to be harmful, according the Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Bao on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After the double-track income tax is abolished, foreign

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG BUYERS SEEK COMPENSATION FROM TAIWAN PROPERTY DEVELOPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven representatives of a group of
Hong Kong property buyers delivered a petition on Thursday to the
Chung Hwa Travel Service, Taiwan's representative office here, asking
Taiwan authorities to help them seek compensation from a Taiwan
property developer which closed up shop and disappeared after taking
their money.</P>
      <P>The petition was received by a Chung Hwa section chief, who said
the Republic of China government is paying close attention to the
incident and will contact the relevant authorities in order to gain a
more complete understanding of the matter.</P>
      <P>An official with a local workers union, surnamed Soong, who
helped submit the petition to Chung Hwa, told CNA that the Leili
Development Corp., a property developer based in Taiwan, is accused
by the Hong Kong buyers of financial fraud.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, a total of 108 Hong Kong people signed
purchase contracts with a branch office of Leili here in 1995,
agreeing to buy property built by the company in the central Taiwan
city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>They each paid an initial down-payment followed by monthly
payments during the construction of the 32-story residential
building. However, when Leili failed to complete the building by the
end of 1997 as scheduled, its branch office in Hong Kong was found to
already have shut down and its operation in Taiwan was also reported
to have ceased.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong buyers then dispatched representatives to Taiwan in
a bid to get to the bottom of the matter and to seek help from ROC
lawmakers, but their efforts were fruitless, which led them to raise
the case with the Taiwan authorities in Hong Kong, Soong said. He
added that they will call a meeting on Friday to decide whether to
again send representatives to Taiwan to seek compensation or take
legal action.</P>
      <P>Soong said the 108 Hong Kong buyers have paid Leili more than
HK$10 million, but pointed out that the actual figure may be much
higher, as some other local residents who also purchased the Leili
property might have not contacted his union.</P>
      <P>Soong called on the ROC government to help the Hong Kong people
resolve the case and said Taiwan should take legal action to offer
full protection for Hong Kong residents wishing to buy real estate on
the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC: BEIJING'S REACTION TO TAIWAN INITIATIVE 'TOO PASSIVE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  16  (CNA)
(By F.M. Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's reaction to Taiwan's latest
initiative to invite mainland China to cosponsor a meeting with
officials from Southeast Asian countries on possible resolutions to
the current regional financial turmoil was "too passive," Taiwan's
top official in charge of mainland Chinese policies told a Japanese
daily newspaper on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Republic of China's cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), in an exclusive interview with Asahi
Shimbun, called for an early resumption of the cross-Taiwan Strait
dialogue that Beijing suspended unilaterally in 1995.</P>
      <P>On resuming the cross-strait dialogue on general affairs or
technical issues, Chang said Taipei is expected to make the decision
before the end of this week and will inform Beijing who Taipei will
dispatch to the mainland for the new round of talks.</P>
      <P>To begin the cross-strait dialogue by reopening talks on
technical issues would be meaningful in two ways, Chang noted,
explaining that it would represent the resumption of the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue and that it could pave the way for C.F. Koo,
chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), to visit
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Koo's mainland visit was agreed to during the first ice-breaking
rendezvous between Koo and his Beijing counterpart, Wang Daohan,
chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), in Singapore in April 1993, Chang added.</P>
      <P>During the historic meeting, Taipei and Beijing laid a framework
for regular dialogue and contacts between the SEF and ARATS, the two
quasi-intermediary bodies authorized to handle cross-strait exchanges
in the absence of official contacts between the two archrivals.</P>
      <P>Which SEF officials Taipei chooses to send to Beijing for the new
round of talks, probably later this month, is not a matter subject to
Beijing's prior "understanding," said Chang, adding that the SEF's
only obligation is to supply ARATS with the names of the SEF
representatives.</P>
      <P>Chang said that since Beijing suspended the cross-strait dialogue
in the summer of 1995 following President Lee Teng-hui's landmark
visit to the United States, which Beijing interpreted as a move
promoting Taiwan independence, Lee, former Premier Lien Chan and
incumbent Premier Vincent Siew have made a total of more than 110
offers for talks, holding out an olive branch to the Beijing
authorities and calling for the resumption of the cross-strait
dialogue.</P>
      <P>The calls fell mostly on deaf ears until recently, when the
Beijing authorities made gestures favorable to the easing of
cross-strait tension, paving the way for the possible resumption of
the cross-strait dialogue, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang emphasized that it was Beijing that had turned down the
dialogue initiatives, and that Taipei, for its part, had always been
eager for the SEF to be able to arrange for Koo to visit the
mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui told visiting
former US Central Intelligence Agency Director James Woolsey on
Thursday that the Republic of China's offer to Beijing to cosponsor a
meeting among Southeast Asian states on the regional economic crisis
is not political and has no hidden agenda.</P>
      <P>He said he regrets that Beijing has stonewalled the proposal out
of suspicion of Taipei's motives.</P>
      <P>Lee challenged Beijing on April 7 to set aside the cross-Taiwan
Strait feud and join forces with Taipei in helping neighboring states
survive their financial woes. The goodwill gesture, however, has met
with silence from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lee called on Washington to treasure its ties with Taiwan while
engaging Beijing, citing Taiwan's strategic importance as well as its
aggressive pursuit of democracy, freedom and justice, which he noted
are values also espoused by the United States.</P>
      <P>Lee also emphasized at the meeting the importance of resuming the
cross-strait dialogue in order to iron out differences and avoid
misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that since the Republic of China has long been a
sovereign nation, it is absolutely unnecessary to declare Taiwan's
independence.</P>
      <P>Woolsey, who led the CIA from 1993 to 1995 during the first
administration of US President Bill Clinton, arrived in Taiwan on
Monday for a private visit.</P>
      <P>Also at Thursday's reception were four members of Woolsey's
entourage, Vice Adm. William Wright and Drs. Kent M. Harrington,

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Thursday that
mining inside national parks is counter to government policy and the
needs of the nation, and that it should not be permitted.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks at a cabinet meeting in which a couple of
bills were discussed. He stressed the importance of safeguarding all
national parks and demanded that all related government agencies pay
attention to this need and adhere to policies governing conservation.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, a coalition of environmental groups lashed out at the
government for allowing marble mining in Taroko National Park in
eastern Taiwan, saying this has destroyed the beauty of the
world-class scenic area.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the protests launched by the conservationists and
ecologists, Siew said that with the coming of the 21st century, the
conservation of the environment has become one of the topics of the
most concern for not only the Republic of China but also the whole
world.</P>
      <P>The premier cited Yangmingshan National Park as an example of the
government's policies and foresight. According to Siew, if there had
been no planning of national parks in the past, people would not be
able to enjoy such wonderful and natural spots as Yangmingshan,
located to the north of Taipei.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taroko and Yangmingshan, Taiwan also has Kenting,

    <HEADLINE>TIBETAN GOVERNMENT-IN-EXILE CONSIDERS PROPOSING HK MODEL TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After decades of attempts to gain
autonomy from mainland China, the Tibetan government-in-exile in
Dharamsala, northern India, is considering proposing a "Hong Kong
model" to Beijing that would give Tibet similar status to that of the
former British colony.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the CNA on Thursday, Professor
Samdhong Rinpoche, chairman of the 46-member Tibetan parliament, said
the idea of the Hong Kong model will be raised by the Dalai Lama,
Tibet's spiritual leader, and discussed by his parliament.</P>
      <P>"I believe the Hong Kong model will be workable for the autonomy
of Tibet because it is a democratic system based on the (Hong Kong)
Basic Law," he said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has for many years rejected the Dalai Lama's
proposals for self-rule in Tibet because Beijing lacks
self-confidence, he said, adding that mainland China has ceased
dialogue with the Dalai Lama since 1993.</P>
      <P>He said the Tibetan government-in-exile hopes Beijing will resume
the dialogue so that the Dalai Lama can negotiate the autonomy issue.
"We would use the Hong Kong model if we are given the chance of
dialogue with China," he said.</P>
      <P>He said that since the takeover of the Chinese communists in the
mainland in 1949, the Beijing regime has sent Han Chinese to settle
in Tibet and has controlled the indigenous population through various
types of torture.</P>
      <P>"This method of control is so harsh and inhuman and Tibetan
people cannot accept that," he said.</P>
      <P>In 1959, there was a major uprising against Chinese rule in
Tibet, the failure of which forced the Dalai Lama to flee from Tibet
to India, where he set up his government-in-exile.</P>
      <P>Samdhong Rinpoche said Tibet is not seeking independence from
mainland China. Instead, the Tibetan government-in-exile is seeking
genuine autonomy.</P>
      <P>"Tibet will still benefit from Chinese protection," he said,
"because we don't have the material infrastructure and China could
provide that."</P>
      <P>However, he also said that if Tibet is given self-rule or
autonomy, Han people sent to Tibet after 1959 would not be allowed to
interfere with Tibetan affairs.</P>
      <P>Samdhong Rinpoche is currently on a month-long visit to
Australia.</P>
      <P>He appeared before the Australian Parliamentary Human Rights
Sub-committee in Canberra on Thursday. The sub-committee inquires
into the regional dialogue on human rights.</P>
      <P>Before coming to the Australian national capital, he visited
Sydney and from Canberra he will go to Melbourne for a short visit
before going to his final destination -- Tasmania.</P>
      <P>In Tasmania, he will give a three-week lecture at the University
of Tasmania before winding up his visit on May 9.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STRAIT CRISIS COST US$23 BILLION: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The military exercises and missile
tests mainland China held from late 1995 to 1996 to rattle Taiwan
cost the island a staggering US$23 billion, The Straits Times on
Thursday quoted a Taipei economic think-tank as reporting.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan bourse and the financial market were the first to
react to the crisis that erupted in the Taiwan Strait, noted the
Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research (CHIER) in its "Impact of
China's Literary Attacks and Military Intimidation in 1995 and 1996
on Taiwan's Economy."</P>
      <P>"Within half a month of the start of the cross-strait crisis, the
stock index fell 1,000 points, the Taiwan dollar saw a drop of
NT$1.50 against the US dollar and the public was fearful and
anxious," the Chinese-language report was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Between July 21 and 26, mainland China fired a number of
surface-to-surface missiles into international waters off the Taiwan
coast. According to Dr. Chou Ji, director of the CHIER's Economic
Outlook Center who coordinated the report, the effects were almost
immediate.</P>
      <P>He told The Straits Times: "The psychological effect of the
crisis on the public and its impact on the financial market were felt
very quickly. This was particularly so as the crisis hit when the
region was at peace."</P>
      <P>In response to the shock, Taipei initiated a series of moves to
shore up its stock market and stabilize its currency at around
NT$27.50 against the dollar, the report said.</P>
      <P>"It was a costly but necessary endeavor," said Dr. Kuan
Chung-ming from National Taiwan University's Economics Department,
one of eight researchers involved in the report.</P>
      <P>"The factors that caused the violent fluctuations in the markets
were not normal market forces at work and the government was right to
intervene," he said.</P>
      <P>The research team argued that the Taiwan bourse and money market
had already shown signs of fatigue, and that Beijing's intimidation
merely precipitated the dip into a cyclical trough.</P>
      <P>The report also pointed out that Taiwan was able to adjust and
adapt to the crisis very quickly.</P>
      <P>With the help of the government's defense measures, the situation
was effectively controlled and by the time Taipei held its first
presidential election in March 1996, the financial markets were
relatively calm, although trading in the stock market was thin, the
report said.</P>
      <P>"What ultimately helped the quick recovery was the realization --
both at home and abroad -- that China's war games were not aimed at
destroying Taiwan or its economy," Dr. Kuan was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's purpose was political and its message was that so long
as Taiwan does not declare independence, China will not take drastic
measures," he said.</P>

donated a Cessna U206 anti-poaching aircraft to help stop poachers
preying on endangered African wildlife.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony held Wednesday at the Santa Monica Municipal
Airport, Los Angeles County, California, Stephen Chen, ROC
representative to the United States, presented the gift to the
Wilderness Conservancy, a US-based nonprofit organization dedicated
to ending poaching in Africa.</P>
      <P>Back in 1996, the ROC government began a new phase of dedication
to the cause of stamping out poaching when it donated an American
Champion Super Scout spotter plane to be used in South Africa's
Kruger National Park and it's neighboring countries. Wednesday's
second, larger donation represents the ROC government's increased
dedication to the cause.</P>
      <P>According to the Wilderness Conservancy, poaching has reached
such severe levels that certain wildlife populations have been
utterly decimated in several African countries. Poaching remains
commonplace because of traditional Asian medicine's demand for rare
animal parts.</P>
      <P>The ROC was once among the most-criticized countries in the world
for not doing enough to stop the traffic of these materials into
Taiwan, but the government now imposes stiff penalties on offenders.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao said on
Thursday that he will return to work next Monday, ending a three-day
period of media speculation over his resignation.</P>
      <P>Liao, who tendered a tearful resignation on Tuesday, told a news
conference that after three days of soul-searching and talks with his
superiors, he has decided to stay on in his post.</P>
      <P>"During the past few days, I found that the public has high
expectations for a crime-free society. Taiwan is still far from being
an island governed by the rule of law. I think I must stay on to
continue the fight against organized crime," Liao said.</P>
      <P>The minister also expressed his heartfelt gratitude for concern
extended to him by his superiors and various quarters of society over
the past few days. "I will redouble my efforts to repay their
kindness," he vowed.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife, Liao paid a visit to Vice President Lien
Chan early Thursday morning. During their 30-minute meeting at Lien's
home, the vice president was quoted as having encouraged Liao to
continue his anti-crime crusade.</P>
      <P>"During the talks, the vice president asked me to come back to
work, as our country's law and order still needs strengthening," Liao
said.</P>
      <P>Liao, one of the country's most popular Cabinet ministers,
assumed his current post some two years ago during Lien's tenure as
premier. He has gained much acclaim and popular support for his
intense anti-crime, anti-corruption campaign.</P>
      <P>After trying to resign on Tuesday, the respected crime fighter
was quoted by the press as blaming his decision on lawmakers with
links to the underworld who put pressure on the government to remove
him, but he gave no details and provided no other reason for his
action other than that he wished to devote himself to activities
outwith the political arena.</P>
      <P>Upon receiving Liao's resignation letter, Premier Vincent Siew
had a long talk with Liao, asking him to remain in the Cabinet to
fight crime and work for the people's well-being before returning his
resignation letter and giving him a three-and-a-half-day leave to
mull his decision.</P>
      <P>Liao's move caused grave concern in the government, the
Legislative Yuan and among the public. President Lee Teng-hui met
with him on Tuesday evening, when, in addition to inquiring about his
reasons for wanting to resign, Lee also clearly asked Liao to change
his mind on the grounds that the government needs his devoted
service.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia expects a steady increase in
its wheat exports to Taiwan in fiscal 1997-98, the Australian Wheat
Board (AWB) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, an AWB spokesman said Australia
exported about 63,000 tonnes of high-protein wheat to Taiwan in
fiscal 1996-97, up from 35,000 tonnes in 1995-96.</P>
      <P>"We believe there is still room for a steady increase in our
wheat exports to Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>But he said Australian wheat exports to mainland China will fall
further after a massive decline in 1996-97, when Australia only
exported 150,000 tonnes compared to 2.2 million tonnes in 1995-96.</P>
      <P>"We are afraid that we have to sell less wheat to China again
this year because there will be a bumper crop again in the mainland,"
he said. Mainland China used to be one of Australia's biggest wheat
markets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports about 1 million tonnes of wheat from the United
States, Canada and other countries, he said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said wheat production in 1997-98 is estimated at
about 19 million tonnes, 14.5 million tonnes of which will be
exported to more than 50 countries -- with Iran, Egypt and Indonesia
among Australia's major markets.</P>
      <P>This compares with a record harvest of 23.6 million tonnes and a
record export of 19 million tonnes in 1996-97. In 1995-96, Australia
produced 16.7 million tonnes of wheat and exported 13.2 million
tonnes of the output, the spokesman said.</P>

(PLA) in line with plans to reduce government and Communist Party
bureaucracy, according to the South China Morning Post.</P>
      <P>Military sources said one or two of the seven military regions
could be abolished.</P>
      <P>The sources said the Beijing Military Region -- which covers, in
addition to Beijing and Tianjin, the provinces of Hebei and Shanxi
and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region -- is one of those likely to
be dismantled.</P>
      <P>However, the sources added that the Beijing Garrison, a unit
under the Beijing region with exclusive responsibility for guarding
the capital, would be strengthened. Other units in the Beijing region
would be absorbed by neighboring military regions.</P>
      <P>It is understood that apart from the need to simplify the PLA's
structure, mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, chairman of the
military commission, believes the loyalty of the Beijing Garrison
would be better assured if it was separated from the region.</P>
      <P>The garrison includes elite units responsible for the safety of
top party and government leaders as well as of major offices in the
Zhongnanhai party headquarters.</P>
      <P>A Beijing military source said, however, it is unlikely that
military regions would be renamed "war zones" as had been reported
earlier.</P>
      <P>In addition, new units could be set up to realize the goal of
"winning regional warfare under high-tech conditions." A unit
handling advanced equipment such as space and laser weaponry could
also be established.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic analysts said the details of the restructuring will be
finalized in two to three months.</P>
      <P>They said the plan will not affect senior officers or PLA

      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said on
Thursday that the Republic of China will try to persuade the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) to provide guarantees to help Southeast Asian
countries reach early stability in the wake of the recent financial
turmoil which has swept the region since the middle of last year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar at the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic
Research, Chiang pointed out that a lobbying mission will leave next
week for Manila to visit ADB headquarters, where it will urge the ADB
to provide guarantees to assist Southeast Asian nations in issuing
government bonds.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the institute invite its counterparts on the
opposite side of the Taiwan Strait to discuss cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in assisting the affected countries of Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CEPD Vice Chairman Schive Chi suggested that the
government should use its foreign exchange reserves wisely to help
solve the issues of local enterprises in their overseas financing, as
well as provide export insurance to facilitate imports from Southeast
Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ROC-USA Economic Council, the CEPD deputy chief
said the ROC government can strengthen international financial
cooperation by signing cooperation agreements with the central banks
of the relevant countries; at the same time, the ROC government
should study the feasibility of joining APEC nations to provide
guarantees for government bonds issued by Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Turning to the private sector, he suggested that private
enterprises seeking investment and cooperation opportunities in
Southeast Asia should consider the risk factors involved very
carefully.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF ASKS FOR ARATS HELP TO PROBE MURDER OF TAIWAN BUSINESSMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) sent
a message on Thursday to its mainland Chinese counterpart -- the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- asking
for its help in resolving a murder case involving a Taiwan
businessman.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference after learning of the incident, SEF
Deputy Secretary-General Chang Liang-jen urged the ARATS to help
arrest the killers and provide the victim's family with necessary
assistance to help them through the aftermath of the tragedy.</P>
      <P>The body of Yeh Jung-fu, 44, a knitted garment maker from the
southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung, was discovered by his wife at
their house in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, on Tuesday night. She was
abducted by her husband's killers, who broke into the house, but she
later escaped and reported the case to local police.</P>
      <P>Quanzhou public security authorities said they have already
nabbed one suspect and are searching for the other two accomplices,
who remain at large. The three alleged assailants were reported to be
employees at Yeh's factory.</P>
      <P>Citing SEF statistics, Chang said that more than 160 similar
incidents involving the personal and property safety of Taiwan
businessmen in mainland China have been reported over the past seven
years since the founding of the SEF. He stressed that Taiwan and the
mainland should place the issue of Taiwan businesspeople's interests
and personal safety high on the agenda if the two sides resume talks.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS are semiofficial organizations representing
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle bilateral exchanges in
the absence of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said a group of Taiwan tourists who were
reported by a local newspaper to have been detained by mainland
authorities are scheduled to return to Taiwan on Monday.</P>
      <P>Slamming the report as "untrue," Chang said the 22 Taiwan
tourists are currently in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported on Thursday that a group of Taiwan
tourists had been detained in mainland China after the owner of a
Taipei-based travel agency closed up shop and escaped with their
clients' payments.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A woman was accused on Thursday of
violating a ban on the use of cellular phones aboard aircraft, the
first such charges to be brought in Taiwan's aviation history.</P>
      <P>Aviation police said that they have transferred the case to the
Taipei Prosecutor's Office, which will investigate the first
violation of the ban on using electronic devices aboard aircraft and
might charge the violator, identified as Wu Yu-chuan.</P>
      <P>The aviation regulations state that flight crews and passengers
are prohibited from using electronic devices that could disrupt
aircraft communication systems while on board, with violators facing
up to five-year jail terms, or mandatory community service, or fines
of up to NT$150,000 (US$4,545).</P>
      <P>Wu was reported by another passenger on the UNI Airlines flight
from eastern Hualien to Taipei on April 5 to aviation security
officials for using her cellular phone on the flight.</P>
      <P>Although Wu admitted using the phone, she claimed she waited
until the plane had landed safely and was taxiing to a halt before
operating the device. However, her informer insisted that the phone
call was made while the plane was still airborne.</P>
      <P>Rigorous implementation of the prohibition on such devices is one
of a series of measures taken by aviation authorities to improve
flight safety in Taiwan in the wake of a spate of air disasters in
recent months which have claimed the lives of more than two hundred
people.</P>

      <P>Visiting Deputy Speaker of the Irish
Parliament Rory O'Hanlon said on Thursday that the Irish Republic's
foreign policies will not be influenced by the recent Northern
Ireland peace pact.</P>
      <P>O'Hanlon said that the peace deal, which will see Northern
Ireland remain part of Britain but will give Dublin a say in its
affairs for the first time, will have a deep impact on Northern
Ireland, relations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,
and ties between Britain and the Irish Republic.</P>
      <P>O'Hanlon, who is also chairman of the ruling Republican caucus,
stressed that the peace pact, which will be put to referenda in
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in May, will benefit all
parties if it is put into effect, adding that US President Bill
Clinton also made a valuable contribution to the working out of the
agreement.</P>
      <P>Asked if the deal will influence the Irish Republic's foreign
policy and whether it will lead to any breakthroughs between the
Irish Republic and Taiwan, he replied that his country's foreign

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BE INVITED TO JOIN ADB-INITIATED EAST ASIA FORUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 17 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will be invited to join an East
Asia financial forum to be formed under the auspices of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), according to a news briefing issued by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The press release said the Manila-based regional bank plans to
propose the formation of an East Asia financial forum at its annual
board meeting to be held in Geneva late this month.</P>
      <P>The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
will form the backbone of the proposed forum, but such non-ASEAN
economies as Taiwan, mainland China, South Korea and Japan will also
be invited to join the group, the IMF news briefing said.</P>
      <P>It quoted a report carried in Singapore's Business Times as
saying the forum, if established, will strengthen financial policy
coordination among major economies in the region as well as supervise
the region's economic development with an aim to ensure regional
financial stability and economic well-being.</P>
      <P>The Singaporean daily said ADB Governor Mitsuo Sato is expected
to make the overture at a luncheon he will host in Geneva on April 28
in honor of finance ministers and central bank governors of the ASEAN
countries and South Korea, all of which will be founding members of
the new organization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, mainland China and Japan will be admitted into the forum
shortly after its inauguration, the paper said, adding that the four
non-ASEAN economies will be included mainly because drastic
fluctuations of the currency of any of these countries will
inevitably trigger chain reactions throughout the region.</P>
      <P>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>As the proposed new regional financial forum will neither include
the United States nor any other Western country in the Pacific
region, the report has caused IMF concern.</P>
      <P>IMF governors reportedly worry that the proposal is designed to
curb the IMF's involvement in addressing the Asian financial crisis
which has plagued many countries in the region since last summer.</P>
      <P>The IMF has reiterated on many occasions that it must play a
central role in helping battered Asian economies tide over their
current financial woes.</P>
      <P>At an IMF provisional committee meeting on Thursday, US Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin called on support for the strengthening of
IMF functions in resolving international or regional financial
crises.</P>
      <P>The IMF, an affiliate of the United Nations, is currently
convening its spring board meeting in Washington, D.C. Taiwan lost
its IMF seat in 1980 when mainland China was admitted into the
organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC UNVEILS CREATIVE PRIVATIZATION PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC), in a daring and unprecedented move, has decided to give up
most of its non-refining operations in a bid to reshape the veteran,
but competition-threatening firm.</P>
      <P>The CPC's brash chairman, Chen Chao-wei, who demonstrated his
business genius and outspoken management style as head of the Taipei
Rapid Transit Co., announced on Friday that the CPC will transfer all
non-refining businesses, including security and public safety,
transportation, and gas station operations islandwide. Those
activities have a combined business potential worth at least NT$10
billion (US$305 million) annually.</P>
      <P>Chen described the plan as a creative initiative that benefits
all. Shares in the affected CPC operations will be all offered to
private investors through open bids and to current CPC employees who
will be forced to retire under the company's privatization plan.</P>
      <P>The plan, Chen stressed, will not only help upgrade operational
efficiency, but will also boost the willingness to take early
retirement among senior CPC employees.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed stiff resistance to the company's privatization
on the part of the CPC staff to a failure to see a silver lining in
the shakeup and to the previous CPC management's inability to come up
with viable plans to revitalize the company.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that CPC's annual personnel costs were a titanic
NT$24 billion (US$732 million), equivalent to 7.3 percent of the
company's annual business transactions and almost double of that of
major international oil companies, Chen described the CPC as a
"dust-covered golden bowl."</P>
      <P>Chen said the corporation is indeed capable of providing a
positive working atmosphere for its staff as well helping retiring
personnel to experience a "second spring" with new job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Citing a long list of CPC business operations, Chen noted that
the company maintains 22 oil reservoirs and storage tanks islandwide,
which cost NT$1.7 billion (US$52 million) annually for safety
maintenance alone.</P>
      <P>Ocean-going oil tankers and liquefied natural gas (LNG) transport
vessels owned or leased by the CPC cost some NT$9 billion (US$274
million) each year to carry supplies to Taiwan. Domestically, the CPC
operates some 300 tank trucks which distribute the products
islandwide, generating transactions worth several billion New Taiwan
dollars a year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, under its new business plan, CPC envisages a series of
bold and potentially lucrative initiatives for gas station
operations. The plan includes an islandwide franchise system for gas
stations which are currently losing money.</P>
      <P>Former CPC employees will have the option to invest in the
franchises on a leasing basis. The franchise stations, if located in
rural areas, will be allowed to engage in side businesses, such as
car washes or convenience stores, to supplement income.</P>
      <P>The independently operated gas stations, if located on idle CPC
properties, can also be developed into CPC business centers, with
ground-level gas station services, upstairs offices and overhead
parking areas. Similar operations in Japan have proven highly
lucrative.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO UNVEIL WHITE PAPERS ON HOG, CHICKEN RAISING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will soon
unveil its white papers on hog and chicken raising in anticipation of
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>In discussing the reports Friday, COA officials noted that
Taiwan's poultry industry is expected to face pressure from US
imports. Accordingly, the council has assessed the impacts of the
foreign products on Taiwan's poultry industry both before and after
it joins the WTO.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the island's bid to enter the WTO, Taiwan has
agreed to accept 5,000 tons of US-produced pork bellies, 10,000 tons
of chicken, 5,000 tons of beef offal and 7,500 tons of pork offal,
for import starting June 1.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-chi, director of the COA Animal Industry Department,
warned that the poultry industry will soon begin to feel the pinch of
US imports.</P>
      <P>But Chen said the council will seek to ensure a viable domestic
poultry industry. He added that persuading owners of small-scale and
noncompetitive chicken and hog farms to shut down will be one of the
measures adopted to achieve that goal.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the COA will invite scholars, experts and
representatives of the poultry industry to continue consultations on
how to establish a competitive poultry industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In view of the expected onslaught of US chicken meat, especially
imported drum sticks, which are favored by local consumers and can be
produced at NT$45 per kilogram cheaper than the domestic variety, COA
officials said chicken producers in Taiwan will definitely feel the
impact.</P>
      <P>The COA will attempt to keep the overall prices for unprocessed
chicken meats at between NT$25 and NT$27 per kilogram, so that
consumers can enjoy cheap products and chicken farm operators can
earn reasonable profits.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the hog raising industry, COA officials said Taiwan
has also made a concession to the United States by agreeing to allow
imports of 5,000 metric tons of US pork bellies and 7,500 metric tons
of pork offal prior to its WTO entry.</P>
      <P>The officials said, however, that local hog industry should be
able to withstand the losses resulting from the imports, expected to
be around NT$700 million (US$21.21 million).</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Affected by the regional financial
meltdown in Southeast Asia and by economic stagnation in Japan,
Taiwan's projected economic growth for 1998 will be readjusted
downward to 5.95 percent, the Chung-hua Institute for Economic
Research (CIER) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The private economics think tank predicted in December that
Taiwan's 1998 annual economic growth would top at least 6.37 percent,
perhaps reaching as high as 7.1 percent. That estimate was made on
the premises that the Asian financial turmoil would cease to ravage
the region and that no major natural disasters would occur in Taiwan
the following year.</P>
      <P>CIER economists, describing Taiwan's economy as a "small-scale,
open system," said it has failed to stay completely unscathed by the
Asian financial upheavals in the first quarter of this year even
though the domestic economic performance was basically healthy.</P>
      <P>Sluggish foreign trade during the first quarter dragged Taiwan's
economic growth down in the period. But, on the strength of brisk
domestic consumption and private sector investment, the island's
economy could still maintain a growth of 5 percent or above in the
first quarter of this year, the economists forecast. Final figures
for the period have yet to be released by the government.</P>
      <P>Domestic investment in 1998 is seen to carry the momentum
experienced last year by posting a rise of around 11.21 percent. With
the beginning or expansion of several key projects, involving the
sixth naphtha cracking plant, islandwide transportation networks, an
industrial park in southern Taiwan, telecommunications market
opening, reconstruction of housing for military dependents, and
privately operated power plants, Taiwan's domestic investment is
expected to chart an impressive growth of 18.14 percent this year,
they forecast.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the think tank said the island's inflation growth will
probably be well controlled at around 2.72 percent this year, as
compared with previous estimates of 3.34 percent.</P>
      <P>Stable prices due to ample supplies of raw materials on
international markets and lower prices for crude oil have combined to
keep inflation at a mere 1.55 percent through the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Although the growth of inflation will be limited this year, the
expected 2.72 rise is higher than the negligible 0.9 percent level
seen in 1997, the CIER experts pointed out.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar, meanwhile, is forecast to mildly fluctuate
at around NT$32.5 against one US dollar for the rest of the year,
they added.</P>
      <P>The CIER also predicts that Taiwan's economy will expand by 6.39
percent in 1999 under the preconditions that the Asian financial
storm passes and that most of the economies in the region recover.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAN JYH-HORNG TO BECOME DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL OF SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday morning
approved the nomination of Jan Jyh-horng, currently the director of
the Research and Planning Department of the cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), to the post of deputy secretary-general of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The SEF is expected to fax a letter to its mainland counterpart,
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
Friday afternoon to inform the Beijing-based body that the SEF would
like to send Jan to Beijing to help in the resolution of protocol
matters prior to the visit of a Taiwan delegation.</P>
      <P>Jan is the first MAC official nominated to join the high-ranking
working staff of the semi-official SEF since the SEF's founding seven
years ago. His appointment indicates that the MAC and SEF will
interact closely, something that should be helpful to the teamwork of
the Taiwan negotiators as a whole, said Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman
and spokesman of the MAC, on Friday.</P>
      <P>ARATS sent the SEF a letter dated April 13 that suggested one of
the foundation's vice secretary-generals travel to Beijing on April
21 or 22 -- or any other time that would be convenient for both sides
-- to discuss a future visit by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu or to
exchange views concerning the SEF and ARATS cosponsoring a seminar.</P>
      <P>Sheu declined comment on when Jan will leave for Beijing to pave
the way for the "ice-breaking journey." However, he stressed that
since the MAC has authorized the SEF to respond to Beijing's offer,
the foundation will surely indicate the appropriate time for Jan's
visit in its letter to ARATS.</P>
      <P>Jan's visit will focus mainly on protocol affairs involving Koo's
future trip and it is unlikely that substantial issues will be
discussed, Sheu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIA TO LIFT SOME IMPORT RESTRICTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>India is to lift import restrictions on
340 items in an apparent effort by the Hindu nationalist-led
government to signal its intention to continue trade liberalization,
according to reports of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>India was simplifying and decentralizing bureaucratic procedures
for exporters, and making it easier for companies in key export
sectors to import capital goods with duty concessions, the WTO report
said.</P>
      <P>While major Indian exporters organizations hailed it as "export
friendly," Bibek Debroy, a New Delhi-based international trade
expert, was quoted as saying that India's trading partners were
unlikely to be impressed with what he called a half-hearted attempt
at trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>While the new government -- led by the Bharatiya Janata Party --
has lifted restrictions on some paper products, textiles and
chemicals, Debroy said many of the newly liberalized items, such as
fish, wooden dolls and hairbands, were "easy items" which were
neither particularly important nor controversial, the WTO report
said.</P>
      <P>It would be tough to convince the WTO that India was serious
about phasing out import restrictions, Debroy was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>In an agreement with trade partners such as Australia, Japan, the
European Union and Canada, India has five years to phase out all its
remaining import restrictions while a dispute with the United States
on the same matter still remains.</P>
      <P>The trade liberalization policy shows the new government is
"going to reform but the reforms are going to be very, very slow,"
the WTO report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BLUEBERRY HOLDS KEY TO HEALTHY LIVING</HEADLINE>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If you want to live a long and healthy
life, eat more blueberries as Canadian bears do, researchers said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>They told the annual meeting of the Wild Blueberry Association of
North America in Halifax that the humble wild blueberry has
antioxidant qualities that may hold the key to cancer prevention,
protection from cardiovascular disease, and retarding the effects of
aging.</P>
      <P>The conference heard reports that natural pigments called
anthocyanins, along with other phytochemical compounds, have been
found to be responsible for the tiny blueberry's healthy punch.</P>
      <P>US Department of Agriculture scientist Ronald Prior found that
blueberry contains the highest antioxidant capacity among 40 fruits
and vegetables tested, though it still lags behind its European
cousin, the billberry.</P>
      <P>Willy Kalt, a horticulturist who works for Agriculture and
Agri-food Canada in Nova Scotia, said the blueberry is a superstar in
terms of oxidative capacity. "If you want to choose fruits for their
antioxidant capacity, blueberries are head and shoulders above a lot
of the other commercial fruit you might look at," he said.</P>
      <P>University of Illinois researcher Mary Ann Smith has conducted a
study which shows that components in blueberries inhibit an enzyme
that contributes to the onset of cancer. Cranberries and
lingonberries were found to be of similar benefit.</P>
      <P>Most of the world's blueberry industry is confined to the US
state of Maine and Canada's Atlantic seaboard. Ontario and Quebec
also produce some blueberries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTEL CHIP COUNTERFEITING RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   17   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police busted a computer chip
counterfeiting ring in northern Taiwan on Friday, confiscating NT$100
million (US$3.03 million) worth of bogus Intel chips and arresting
four masterminds involved in the case.</P>
      <P>Intel Corp. of the United States filed a complaint with Taiwan's
National Police Administration (NPA) earlier this year, saying
customs authorities in many countries, including Germany, have
discovered container-loads of bogus Intel chips. The world's largest
maker of computer central processing units (CPUs) said it suspects
all those ersatz products were originated in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to the complaint, the NPA's Criminal Investigation
Bureau (CIB) formed a special task force to probe the case. Acting on
tips, CIB officers managed to nab four key suspects in Hsichi, Taipei
County and Taoyuan on Friday morning.</P>
      <P>The investigators also seized large quantities of counterfeit
Intel CPUs at the suspects' hideouts. The market value of those
products were estimated at more than NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the suspects first purchased
cheap slow-motion CPUs and then had those products' model numbers and
trademarks removed at a still undiscovered underground factory. The
products would then be stamped with Intel trademarks and model
numbers, and sold as Intel high-speed CPUs for huge profits.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said the counterfeiting ring had employed highly
advanced machinery and sophisticated technology in its operations.
Intel has dispatched its Asian affairs executives and a team of
lawyers to look into the case.</P>
      <P>Police authorities said they suspect there are other accomplices
involved in the operations. "We'll continue search for all other
suspects still at large," said a CIB official.</P>
      <P>The official further said it is encouraging that the ring was
broken at a time when the United States is threatening to rank Taiwan
among countries which fail to provide adequate protection for
American copyrights and patents. Countries on the US "Special 301"
watch list face possible retaliatory trade sanctions for alleged
infringement upon intellectual property rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE PM ACCUSES NSW PREMIER OF BACKING WATERFRONT WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Prime Minister John Howard
on Friday accused New South Wales Premier Bob Carr of supporting
sacked waterfront workers by failing to prevent the protesting
workers from blocking trucks carrying cargo to Port Botany in Sydney.</P>
      <P>Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith on Friday also accused
the protesting waterfront workers of breaking the law and trying to
hold Australia hostage.</P>
      <P>At Fremantle Port in Western Australia, about 140 police
confronted 400 sacked waterfront workers and detained nine of them
because they refused to move away from the picket line where 38
trucks carrying cargo were blocked.</P>
      <P>In Sydney, however, no arrests were made on Friday because about
500 sacked workers overwhelmingly outnumbered the 30 policemen who
had detained 22 protesters a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The NSW police were reluctant to make any arrests because they
did not want to repeat the actions of officers in Western Australia.</P>
      <P>In Melbourne, 45 containers containing cars of Toyota Australia
for export were blocked from being loaded at the terminal operated by
Patrick Stevedores, the company which fired the union dockworkers.</P>
      <P>In Newcastle and Brisbane, the situation was similar, with cargo
moving nowhere because of picket lines manned by the sacked workers.</P>
      <P>The workers ignored court injunctions which forbade them from
setting up picket lines at Patrick Stevedores' terminals in major
ports around Australia.</P>
      <P>The current dispute was triggered after Patrick, one of the
leading stevedoring firms in Australia, sacked all its 1,400 workers
last week.</P>
      <P>The showdown between Patrick and the sacked workers, mainly the
members of the Maritime Union of Australia, is accelerating and will
begin to have an impact on Australia's exports if it continues.</P>
      <P>Toyota Australia on Friday warned that the company would cease
production of cars for export if the confrontation continues. A
company spokesman said Toyota would be forced to lay off about 2,500
workers if the waterfront confrontation does not end soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRELIMINARY REPORT DEBUNKS ITALY'S 'MIRACLE CANCER CURE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  16  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A preliminary report by four Canadian
doctors to Canada's federal government Thursday does not endorse what
has been hailed as a miracle cancer cure in Italy.</P>
      <P>But desperate patients said the doctors are rushing to judge the
treatment by Dr. Luigi Di Bella, fearing a negative report could
deprive them of access to a potential cure.</P>
      <P>"Nobody is against anything," stressed Dr. Victor Fornasier, a
Toronto pathologist and leader of the medical team sent to Italy last
month.</P>
      <P>"The evidence we saw was very, very skimpy. The data we were
presented with was not the sort of data that we would accept here (in
Canada) as being objective," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Giancarlo Florio, founder of the Pro-Di Bella Association, warned
the doctors are speaking "in haste," which he said will prompt more
patients to head to Italy for the treatment.</P>
      <P>Florio said his group represents 6,000 cancer patients and their
families across Canada and is growing daily. "I'm getting people
calling from all over Canada," he said Wednesday, after The Globe and
Mail published a letter to the editor written by one of the team's
doctors.</P>
      <P>In his letter, Hamilton oncologist Andrew Arnold said it would be
premature to support Di Bella's drug and hormone treatment because
the delegation did not get proof that it works. Arnold said he felt
obliged to speak out publicly weeks before the team was to report to
Ottawa because of public pressure for quick answers.</P>
      <P>Fornasier said Arnold was only trying to protect vulnerable
patients by giving them more information. "The difficulty we're
having is we have patients who are on, or should be going on, therapy
but are questioning whether they should not be instead going on the
Di Bella treatment," Fornasier said.</P>
      <P>The Canadian group spent one day with the 85-year-old
physiologist during their weeklong mission. "I don't think they spent
enough time in Italy," Florio said. "We're looking at 40 years or
more of work. To spend a few days to evaluate it, I think is unfair."</P>
      <P>But Fornasier said evidence, not time, was the problem. "I don't
think being there any longer would have made a difference. It would
have been more of the same."
 In their report, the four doctors recommend the government wait
for results from clinical trials currently under way in Italy.</P>
      <P>The report also recommends ways the government can better respond
in the future to alternative therapies for other diseases that are
bound to appear, Fornasier said.</P>
      <P>The final report will be submitted to Health Minister Allan Rock
by the end of April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOINT AID NEEDED TO HELP SAVE YEN FROM DROPPING: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, April 16 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan financial heavyweight said that
if the depreciation of the Japanese yen isn't stopped, the weakened
currency will soon drag down the New Taiwan dollar and then impact
the Hong Kong currency and the mainland Chinese yuan, sparking an
overall financial disaster.</P>
      <P>Sheu Jia-dong, deputy governor of the Republic of China's Central
Bank of China (CBC), gave the warning in a brief interview with CNA
Thursday in New York. He stressed that the economic problems Japan
faces are so severe that Tokyo can no longer solve them on its own.</P>
      <P>Sheu said that joint aid provided by international financial
organizations and rich countries is the only way for Japan to escape
its difficult position.</P>
      <P>Sheu, along with ROC Bureau of Monetary Affairs chief Sean Chen,
took part in a conference Thursday sponsored by Saint John's
University in New York to speak about the ROC's effective measures in
dealing with the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Other ROC officials attending the meeting were Thomas M.F. Yeh,
chief for the Economic Research Department under the Council for
Economic Planning and Development; Cho Shih-chao, deputy director
general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs; and Shih Tsuen-hua, director of the
CBC's New York representative office.</P>
      <P>A number of American economic and financial scholars and experts
also participated.</P>
      <P>During the conference, titled "How Taiwan is Weathering the Asian
Financial Crises," Sheu addressed Taiwan's existing currency policy
and economic prospects.</P>
      <P>He also defended the CBC for allowing the depreciation of the
Taiwan currency, saying that this was aimed at the ROC having
sufficient foreign exchange reserves in case its national security is
threatened.</P>
      <P>The CBC's acceptance of market forces resulted not only in a
vigorous drop in the value of the NT dollar but also disorder in Hong
Kong's financial markets, prompting Beijing to charge Taipei with
conducting a political conspiracy.</P>
      <P>Sheu told the American financial scholars at the conference that
during the first three months after the Asian financial crisis broke
out last July, the CBC spent approximately US$7 billion of its
foreign exchange reserves to defend the NT dollar.</P>
      <P>The effort, however, failed to save the Taiwan currency from
falling, the deputy CBC governor said, adding that the situation
forced his bank to let the local unit follow market forces in order
to stop sacrificing the country's reserves on an "impossible
mission."</P>
      <P>Sheu reiterated the necessity of the ROC preserving its foreign
exchange reserves, explaining that since Taiwan is not a member of
either the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, it cannot
afford financial or political crises that could endanger its
survival.</P>
      <P>He noted that in June 1995, when Beijing conducted live missile
tests in waters near Taiwan, the government used around one-fifth of
the country's foreign exchange reserves to maintain the island's
financial stability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE TAIWAN INVESTORS VICTIMIZED ON MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The personal safety and property of Taiwan
businesspeople operating in mainland China are facing increased
threats, as more of them are falling victim to criminal elements
there, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>Liao Yun-yuan, director of the SEF's Department of Economic and
Trade Service, said the SEF assisted in handling 27 cases involving
Taiwanese businesspeople being victimized on the mainland last year,
while the number of such cases has already reached 19 in the first
three and a half months of this year.</P>
      <P>Among those incidents, five Taiwanese businesspeople were
murdered, six went missing and the remaining eight were either
arbitrarily detained by mainland authorities, kidnapped or
blackmailed.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Yeh Jung-fu, a Republic of China national who ran
a garment factory in the southeastern mainland province of
Fujian, was murdered. His wife was abducted by Yeh's killers, who
broke into their house in Quanzhou on Tuesday night, but she managed
to escape later and reported the case to mainland police.</P>
      <P>"We are no stranger to this kind of tragic case," SEF's Liao
said. "A similar tragedy also occurred during the Chinese New Year
holiday in late January. Liu Kwang-chao, a Taiwan investor who ran a
factory in Guangdong Province in southern China, was abducted and
then murdered by workers at his plant on the lunar New Year Day. Many
SEF staffers were forced to cut short their New Year holiday to help
handle the case."</P>
      <P>Citing SEF statistics, Liao said 162 similar incidents involving
the personal and property safety of Taiwan businesspeople in
mainland China have been reported over the past seven years since
SEF's founding. In addition, 428 trade and property disputes
involving Taiwan businessmen on the mainland have also been reported
during the same period.</P>
      <P>Liao attributed the increasing safety threat to Taiwan
businesspeople mainly to the changing economic climate on the
mainland. "Rapid economic development and urbanization in mainland
China's coastal provinces have resulted in a sharp increase in
population in the region as well as in criminal activities. And
cash-rich Taiwan investors have become a major target of mainland
criminal elements," he noted.</P>
      <P>According to SEF tallies, most criminal cases involving Taiwan
victims took place in Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan provinces, all of
which accommodate a large number of Taiwan-invested firms.</P>
      <P>Liao said mainland China has attracted more than US$190 billion
in direct foreign investment. Of the amount, 66 percent came from
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. "Mainland authorities should take
effective measures to protect Taiwan investors' personal and
property safety in addition to protecting their legitimate business
interests," he urged, adding the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
should resume talks as soon as possible in order to pool their
wisdom and energy to fight crime and protect people's safety and
well-being.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday that
he would welcome the two sides of the Taiwan Strait exchanging
information on their military exercises to help establish mutual
trust and avoid unnecessary military confrontation.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in response to questions by Legislator
Chang Chun-hsiung of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The premier said that in view of the current state of
cross-strait relations, he is in favor of exchanging information on
military exercises with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that the establishment of a mutual trust mechanism
would make military maneuvers between the two sides more transparent
and could help avoid misunderstandings that could trigger real
combat.</P>
      <P>He noted that in 1991 the government terminated the Temporary
Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion and
said it would not seek to resolve cross-strait problems by military
means.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's military focus has shifted to the solidification of the
island's defenses, Siew noted. He lamented the fact that Beijing,
however, has yet to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the government's policy to maintain cross-strait
peace and stability remains changed, and said that he would welcome
the building of a mutual trust mechanism to aid national development
and the well-being of the people.</P>
      <P>The establishment of mutual trust would ease hostility and
tensions and would contribute to the peace and stability on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, the premier said.</P>
      <P>He said that although Taiwan people should be on guard about
Beijing's military exercises along the southeast coast of the
mainland, there is no need to overreact.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense is keeping abreast of mainland
military movements and will keep the public informed about the
situation, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew's remarks came on the heels of a denial by Beijing that it
would launch large-scale military maneuvers. Beijing announced that
it would only hold routine training program drills.</P>

      <P>Most married couples in Taiwan opt to co-manage their household
finances, while their counterparts in Indonesia and South Korea
choose to let the wives be the financial ministers, the latest public
opinion poll conducted by MasterCard International shows.</P>
      <P>According to the "Asian Ideals" survey, which reveals Asians'
views on marriage, only 28 percent of Taiwan respondents said wives
should be the financial rulers of the house and a mere 6 percent said
husbands should be in charge of the finances, the lowest figure among
all Asia-Pacific economies, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>The survey, which MasterCard International conducted in December
1997 by questioning more than 5,000 adults in 13 nations and areas in
the Asia-Pacific region, sought Asian views on marriage, family and
relationships.</P>
      <P>Regionally, the survey found, 50 percent were in favor of joint
bank accounts for married couples, while 38 percent were not in favor
and 11 percent were undecided.</P>
      <P>Support for a joint account was highest in Australia (73
percent), India (72 percent), the Philippines (70 percent), Singapore
(63 percent) and New Zealand (62 percent), and lowest in Thailand (39
percent), Indonesia (30 percent) and Japan (11 percent). Most people
in Taiwan joined the naysayers' camp, with only 31 percent of the
respondents in favor, the poll shows.</P>
      <P>When asked to choose between money and happiness, the
overwhelming choice across Asia was happiness (55 percent), followed
by money and happiness equally (38 percent). Fewer than 10 percent of
respondents in each country, except Japan, considered money more
important. The Japanese were the only consumers to put money ahead of
happiness -- by 21 percent to 13 percent.</P>
      <P>In comparison, 77 percent of surveyed Australians said happiness
comes first, the highest ratio among all Asians, and 50 percent of
the Taiwan respondents ranked happiness above money.</P>
      <P>Another sign that today's Asians have become more modern and
career-oriented: 51 percent of those surveyed announced they would
like to remain single.</P>
      <P>Thai and Indonesian singles were by far the most inclined to say
they would like to remain unmarried (93 percent and 80 percent,
respectively). Taiwan people and Hong Kongers were similarly
inclined, albeit to lesser degrees (65 percent and 60 percent,
respectively). Those less inclined to a preference for staying single
included Filipinos (32 percent), Japanese (30 percent), Indians (28
percent) and Malaysians (22 percent), the poll found.</P>

bid to enter the Asia-European Summit (ASEM).</P>
      <P>A statement from Ambassador Sastrohandojo Wiryono said: "There
has been no change in Indonesia's support of Australian entry into

      <P>Earlier this month, however, Indonesian Vice President J.B
Habibie was reported to have supported Malaysia's Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad in vetoing Australia's entry to the body when he
attended an ASEM meeting in London.</P>
      <P>Australia was angry with Habibie's support of Mahathir because
Prime Minister John Howard and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer had
tried very hard to help Indonesia get better deals with the United
States, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the IMF
bailout of the world's largest Islamic country from its financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>In addition, Australia has also provided credit funds for its

      <P>The Taipei-based Eastern Multimedia Corp.
forged a strategic alliance with US West Inc. on Thursday in Taipei,
a significant deal that is expected to upgrade cable TV services in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A contract signing ceremony was held Thursday at the Lai-Lai

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has lodged a protest with
Indonesia over Vice President J.B. Habibie's support of a veto of
Australian entry into the Asia-Europe Summit (ASEM), expressing anger
because Canberra has played a vital role in helping Indonesia in its
financial crisis dealings with the United States, the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</P>
      <P>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told Indonesia that
he was "personally hurt" by Habibie's actions at the ASEM summit in
London this month because the Indonesian vice president was unduly
influenced by the anti-Australian sentiment of Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</P>
      <P>Mahathir has repeatedly opposed Australia's ASEM entry for the
last two years, thwarting Canberra's attempts to become a member of
the organization which is a key body through which Asia and Europe
are seeking to develop closer economic ties.</P>
      <P>Australia acknowledges that Habibie did not specifically speak
out against Australia's ASEM admission, but he did discuss the issue
with Mahathir, when he reportedly said that the ASEM needs quality
not quantity, and that the body should consolidate its membership.</P>
      <P>"The question of expansion is not one we are pursuing at
present," Habibie was quoted as saying to Mahathir. This ruled out
Australia's entry, officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade in Australia told The Australian Financial Review, Australia's
leading business daily, in an exclusive interview on Friday.</P>
      <P>They said Downer was particularly irked because of his strong
personal efforts to help Indonesia. He made unscheduled visits to
Washington recently to urge the United States, the World Bank and the
IMF to be more flexible in their demands for economic and financial
reforms in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Downer's efforts enabled Indonesia to renegotiate with the IMF
for a better deal.</P>
      <P>Australian protests were directed to Indonesian ambassador to
Australia Sastrohandojo Wiryono, but Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas denied that Habibie supported Malaysia in vetoing Australia's
ASEM membership.</P>
      <P>Australia will now be unable to join the ASEM before its third

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Bao-ji, director of the Animal
Industry Department under the Council of Agriculture (COA), said on
Friday that milk consumers will be the biggest winners after the
Republic of China enters the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>According to Chen, cheaper milk from Australia and New Zealand is
expected to find its way into the Taiwan market in the first year of
the ROC's WTO entry, when 100,000 tons of milk in liquid form will be
allowed into the country.</P>
      <P>Milk production costs in both Australia and New Zealand are about
30 percent to 40 percent lower than in Taiwan, and the COA predicted
that Taiwan's milk market will be dominated by milk products from the
two countries, which means that consumers will have the choice of
buying high-quality milk from abroad at lower prices.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan currently produces an annual total
of 330,000 tons of milk. He predicted that imported milk will reach
20,000 tons by the year 2004, and that these imports will have a
heavy impact on the domestic processed milk market, although fresh
milk will be less affected due to transportation time and marketing
networks.</P>
      <P>However, the COA predicted that the competition from imported
milk will force local dairy farmers to upgrade their fresh milk and
lower prices, providing a win-win situation for the island's
consumers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND EAGER FOR TAIWAN INVESTMENT AS ISLAND LOOKS SOUTHEAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is in dire need of money
from Taiwan if it wants to maintain an economic growth of 8 percent
this year, but Taiwan investors have been going shopping in the
industrial and financial sectors of cash-strapped Southeast Asia
instead.</P>
      <P>In a feature article covering almost two-thirds of the business
page in Friday's edition of the mass circulation newspaper The
Australian, Geoff Hiscock, the daily's Asia business editor, said
though mainland China regards Taiwan as a renegade province, it also
recognizes the island as an important source of foreign capital that
Beijing doesn't want to lose.</P>
      <P>Hiscock said Taiwan businessmen have invested at least A$35
billion (US$2.3 billion) in mainland China in the past decade.</P>
      <P>"China needs Taiwan's money more than ever if it is to keep on
target for 8 percent growth in 1998," Hiscock said.</P>
      <P>He quoted Dr. Wang Jian-chyuan, a fellow researcher at the Chung
Hwa Institute for Economic Research in Taipei, as saying that Taiwan
is fortunate to have close economic ties with mainland China and the
United States.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has survived the worst of the Asian crisis because
it is structurally different and its business cycle is different. He
said most Taiwan companies are small and medium-sized, unlike those
in Japan and South Korea, where big corporations dominate.</P>
      <P>Many small and medium-sized companies have to rely on their own
funds because it is difficult for them to borrow money from banks,
Hiscock noted, adding that these firms are known for being very
flexible in their operations as well as for their lack of offshore
debt.</P>
      <P>He said that while most companies in Asia are facing hardships
from the Asian crisis, Taiwan companies -- like their US, European
and Australian counterparts -- are looking to invest in the
industrial and financial sectors in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Leading the commercial charge are Chinatrust Ltd., the flagship
firm of the Koo family business empire, and the China Development
Corp. (CDC), the investment arm of Taiwan's ruling party, the
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Hiscock reported the CDC is buying 52 percent of Bangkok First
Investment and Trust for US$15 million and may lift its existing 10
percent stake in Indonesia's Tamara Bank. It has also signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Malaysian financial group Rashid
Hussain Bhd and is looking at a steel investment with Malaysia's
Amsteel Mills.</P>
      <P>He said that under Jeffrey Koo, Chinatrust has set itself a goal
of becoming a global Chinese bank. Its merchant bank arm, KG
Investments, has already made one acquisition in 1998 through a
purchase of a 44 percent stake in Securities One, the brokerage firm
of failed Thai financial group Finance One Plc., for 2.1 billion baht
(US$52.55 million).</P>
      <P>These are just the first waves of what could be a Taiwan money
tsunami in 1998.</P>
      <P>He said that by June, Taiwan's economic planners expect to have a
war chest of A$920 million (US$613 million) for a new investment
holding company in Southeast Asia and that the CDC is taking the lead
in forming this company.</P>
      <P>And Chinatrust itself has a A$600 (US$400) million direct
investment fund, he added.</P>
      <P>Together, CDC and Chinatrust will have a combined and formidable
A$1.5 billion (US$1 billion) of buying power, Hiscock said.</P>
      <P>He reported that P.K. Chiang, chairman of the ROC Council of
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), led a group of Taiwan
businessmen on a successful visit to Southeast Asian countries early
this year.</P>
      <P>Hiscock quoted Thomas Yeh, director general of the CEPD, as
saying that the new wave of Taiwan investment in Southeast Asia is
part of Taipei's "Go South" policy, which aims to diversify Taiwan
investment away from mainland China.</P>

      <P>Legislator Yen Chin-fu announced on Friday
that he will enter the race for the chairmanship of Taiwan's main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Yen announced his bid during a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session.</P>
      <P>Just before posing a question to Premier Vincent Siew, Yen said
he will take part in the May 24 DPP chairmanship election.</P>
      <P>A self-confident Yen said he has the ability and a strong sense
of mission which qualifies him to run for the post. "If I'm elected,
I will lead the DPP in promoting the well-being of my fellow
countrymen and set a model for the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Yen became the third DPP politician to formally announce his bid
for the party's chairmanship. The other two hopefuls are Lin
Yi-hsiung, a senior party adviser, and Chang Chun-hung, a DPP
legislator-at-large and head of the pro-independence party's largest
Formosa faction. Incumbent DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang has said he
will not seek reelection.</P>
      <P>During Friday's interpellation, Yen also asked Siew whether his
KMT is prepared to form a coalition Cabinet following the year-end
legislative election.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that we'll face a legislature where no political
party controls a majority following the next legislative election
scheduled for late this year," Yen claimed.</P>
      <P>In response, Siew said such a scenario is only Yen's personal
forecast, but Yen immediately reminded Siew that the DPP has already
managed to take control of more than half of the island's city mayor
and county chief posts following last November's local elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on
Friday that the Vatican has usual contacts with mainland China
because freedom and human rights in the mainland are among the pope's
concerns.</P>
      <P>Officials with the ministry said that the government and people
of the Republic of China should not be too "sensitive" about the
engagement between the Vatican and the mainland, adding that nowadays
countries in the world like to explore opportunities for developing
ties with other governments.</P>
      <P>They said Pope John Paul II has shown concern for peace, freedom,
prosperity and human rights throughout the world and that it is
natural that he is also concerned about the Catholics in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after the Holy See's Secretary of
State Jean-Louis Tauran said on Thursday that the Vatican and
mainland officials have usual contacts in third countries. They
noted, however, that he added that these haven't led to any
substantial breakthrough in Vatican-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Tauran said that it is a good thing that the mainland is becoming
aware of the importance of the Vatican as a partner in the
international community. He added, however, that "in the field of
religion, a normalization of relations with the Vatican is not yet a
priority for China."</P>
      <P>Foreign officials noted that Beijing has set two conditions for a
normalization of relations between the mainland and the Vatican: that
the Vatican not interfere with religious affairs in the mainland,
including the appointment of bishops, and that the Holy See severs
its formal ties with the Republic of China. These conditions are
believed to be totally unacceptable to the Vatican, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>Currently, Catholics in the mainland are obliged to be members of
the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and renounce their loyalty
to the pope. There are an estimated 10 million pro-Vatican Catholics
in the mainland.</P>

United States; Austria; and Belgium. Mainland China ranked 19th.</P>
      <P>The BERI assessment, or the Profit Opportunity Recommendation
(POR) rating is based on three criteria: operation risk index;
political risk index; and remittance and repatriation factor.
Countries are evaluated in each category separately before a final
cumulative assessment is made.</P>
      <P>In terms of operation risk index, Taiwan and Singapore placed
second, behind only Switzerland. The operation risk is related to a
country's trade and investment environment, which is evaluated by 105
managing executives from around the world.</P>
      <P>In the category of political risk index, Taiwan came in fifth
position, behind Switzerland, Singapore, Austria, and Norway.
Political risk evaluates the political and societal conditions of
each country and is evaluated by 75 members of BERI's standing
committee.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked third in the remittance and repatriation factor,
behind only Japan and Switzerland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREDRICK CHIEN TO SPEAK ON ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan launches a campaign to
promote the notion that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should
jointly help Southeast Asian nations to recover from the recent
financial crisis, Dr. Frederick Chien, Speaker of the National
Assembly of the Republic of China, will convey a strong message to
the American people that Taiwan will spare no effort to support its
neighbors.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the prestigious Heritage Foundation, a
right-wing US think tank, Chien will speak before the foundation's
13th "Public Policy Seminar" on the Asian financial crisis and
Taiwan's position on the issue. Chien and his wife arrived on
Thursday at San Francisco Airport en route to Palm Springs in
Southern California, where the seminar will be held.</P>
      <P>Chien indicated that in his 20-minute speech before some 400
participants, he will analyze the recent Asian economic turmoil from
the economic angle, but added that the subject of Taiwan's initiative
to work with mainland China to help Southeast Asian nations will
certainly be brought up later during a question-and-answer session.</P>
      <P>The former foreign minister and US representative declined to
comment on whether he has been asked by the ROC government to promote
its latest overture, but said he knows very well the position,
attitude and thinking of President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Vincent
Siew, the two major forces behind the idea.</P>
      <P>Chien said Taiwan's initiative is sure to receive a positive
response from the international community, since the Asian financial
crisis is still the dominating issue for all the nations of the
Pacific Rim and beyond, as well as international financial
institutions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MONEY MORE IMPORTANT THAN HUMAN RIGHTS WHEN DEALING WITH MAINLAND CHINA: EU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union, which is always a
strong proponent of human rights, is following the lead of the US and
Australia by softening its human rights stand in favor of trade and
economic links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mass circulation newspaper The Australian on Friday ran an
article in which it says that the tone of the first EU-mainland China
summit in London earlier this month was significantly different to
the discordant voices of the past, when disagreement over mainland
China's human rights record invariably left a blot on their
relationship.</P>
      <P>The article, headlined "Never Mind Civil Rights, Money Matters,"
said the EU has gone down the track taken by Australia and the US --
that is, it is much better to engage mainland China in positive and
friendly discussions than to alienate it.</P>
      <P>The US renewed mainland China's most-favored nation status
without tying it to human rights conditions two years ago, while
Australia set up a channel for bilateral dialogue to discuss human
rights with mainland China last year after refusing to support a
Danish-sponsored condemnation of human rights in mainland China at
the UN Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva last June.</P>
      <P>The article says the EU's new approach to engaging mainland China
follows a series of failures on the human rights issue because
Beijing has never taken kindly to outside interference in its human
rights record.</P>
      <P>The EU, like the US and Australia, has learned that to risk
annoying mainland China is to deny itself business opportunities in
what is potentially the largest consumer market in the world.</P>
      <P>The article says this shows that, in an increasingly
materialistic and pragmatic world, there's little room for idealism
or moral principles.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Friday that the Republic of China will hold or take part in
trade fairs in 11 countries with which it maintains diplomatic ties
as part of efforts to strengthen friendly ties with those nations.</P>
      <P>Liu Yi-ming, deputy director of the MOFA's Economic and Trade
Affairs Department, said that as mainland China is still trying to
woo the ROC's allies in Central and South America and Africa -- ROC
diplomatic strongholds -- in an attempt to isolate the island
internationally, the government will undertake a series of measures
designed to strengthen ties with these countries. Holding or
attending trade fairs is considered to be an effective way of doing
this, he noted.</P>
      <P>Liu said that from July this year, Taiwan will hold or attend
trade fairs in Panama, Paraguay, Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica,
Dominica, and Dominican Republic, in Central and South America, as
well as in the African countries of Malawi, Swaziland, Senegal, and
Burkina Faso.</P>
      <P>He said that the China External Trade Development Council will be

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WELCOMES IMPROVEMENT IN US-MAINLAND CHINA TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday that Taipei is delighted to see the
recent improvement in bilateral Washington-Beijing ties, as long as
the US' engagement with mainland China does not hurt the parallel
development of two-way relations between Taiwan and the US.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-shun, director of the MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, said that although US President Bill Clinton said after
his meeting with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in October
that Washington will develop parallel relations with both Taiwan and
mainland China, Taiwan still needs to pay close attention to the
impact on Taiwan of the second Clinton-Jiang meeting slated for the
end of June.</P>
      <P>He stressed that so long as Taiwan's interests are not
jeopardized, Taiwan will welcome improved ties between the US and
mainland China, since they will lead to greater stability and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a public hearing held by New Party Legislator Chen
Yi-hsiung, Shen said that Washington, based on the foundation laid by
the previous Clinton-Jiang meeting, is hoping to continue with
efforts to improve its overall relationship with Beijing during the
upcoming meeting between the two heads of state.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, Washington is also expecting to convince
Beijing to play a greater role in helping Southeast Asian countries
through the current financial crisis and take measures to reduce its
huge trade surplus with the US. In addition, Clinton is expected to
discuss the issue of weapons proliferation with Jiang.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
said Washington and Beijing are unlikely to sign a formal accord
stating Beijing's "three no's" policy toward Taiwan during the June
summit, as there remains strong opposition among the US private
sector to Washington's engagement with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lin also said he expects the mainland to become more flexible in
its dealings with Taiwan because of a more stable Beijing leadership.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng Tuan-yao, a professor at National Chengchi
University, warned the government of possible negative effects on
Taiwan caused by the Clinton-Jiang meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, bilateral relations between the US and
mainland China are currently at the "honeymoon" stage, since a record
high of 135 US congressmen visited mainland China last year and many
US academics and scholars have been "brainwashed" by the Chinese
communists into thinking that anything beneficial to the US and the
mainland will also be good for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC government should do something to clarify these American
misunderstandings, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three airline passengers were arrested on
Friday and are currently being interrogated by aviation police at
eastern Taiwan's Hualien Airport for attempting to smuggle bottles of
gasoline onto an aircraft.</P>
      <P>The three passengers, who all work for the same company in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung, were discovered to have four bottles
of gasoline in their bags when they were undergoing security checks
before boarding a TransAsia Airways flight to Kaohsiung at 5:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>However, the three contended that the bottles of gasoline were
samples they had been using for a demonstration at an exhibition
sponsored by Chinese Petroleum Corp. Because they were too late to
have their luggage checked in when they reached the TransAsia
counter, they had to bring the luggage with them as hand baggage,
they claimed.</P>
      <P>They also told police that they had reported the gasoline to the
security personnel before undergoing the security check, but said the
security personnel immediately took them to the aviation police.</P>
      <P>The security personnel, however, had another version of the
events, saying that the three passengers said nothing about
contraband until the bottles were discovered. Aviation police are
investigating the case.</P>
      <P>Security has been especially tight at airports islandwide over
the past few weeks following a series of air traffic accidents and
incidents. There has been speculation that a recent unexplained fatal
crash might have been caused by an explosive device on the plane,
while a man attempted to commit suicide aboard a domestic flight a
few weeks ago by sprinkling smuggled gasoline in the plane and
setting fire to it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTEL APPRECIATES TAIWAN'S CRACKDOWN ON BOGUS CHIPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco, April 17 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World microchip giant Intel Inc. of
the United States on Friday expressed gratitude to Taiwan's law
enforcement authorities for their crackdown on a computer chip
counterfeiting ring and for confiscating US$3 million-worth of bogus
Intel Pentium II chips.</P>
      <P>While praising Taiwan police and expressing appreciation for the
haul, Intel reiterated its determination to cooperate with law
enforcement authorities around the world to eradicate counterfeiting
of its products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's National Police Administration (NPA) was tipped off by
Intel, the world's largest maker of computer central processing units
(CPUs) earlier this year about alleged counterfeiting of Intel chips
in Taiwan. The NPA consequently formed a special task force to probe
an alleged counterfeiting ring suspected of forging Intel's
latest-generation CPUs.</P>
      <P>In Friday's action, the NPA's Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
raided five locations in northern Taiwan, nabbing five suspects and
confiscating thousands of bogus Intel CPUs and tools for making them.
The forged products were estimated to have a street value of about
NT$100 million (US$3 million).</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the suspects first purchased
relatively low-end Pentium II 233 CPUs and then removed their
identification marks at a still undiscovered underground factory.</P>
      <P>The products were then inscribed with new model numbers and
identification using laser technology, describing them as the latest
high-speed Pentium II 266 or Pentium II 300 CPUs, models which could
fetch NT$12,000 (US$366) and NT$18,000 (US$549) apiece, respectively.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said the ring had employed highly advanced
machinery and sophisticated technology in its operations. Other
masterminds are believed to be behind the operation, and police will
continue to track down all the suspects still at large, according to
a CNA report from Taipei on Friday.</P>
      <P>An Intel spokesman would not identify which country or area in
the world is accused of being the source of the greatest volume of
counterfeited Intel chips, saying only that bogus Intel CPUs have in
the past also been found in other Asian countries, Europe and the
United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An annual economic and trade
consultation meeting between the Republic of China and the 15-member
European Union (EU) will open in Taipei next Tuesday, diplomatic
sources here said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Gerard Depeyre, a deputy department chief in charge of foreign
trade at the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, will leave
for Taipei on Sunday to attend the meeting. Depeyre will be
accompanied by another EU official in charge of Taiwan affairs,
Peter Guillford, on his Taipei visit.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the meeting will include market opening, tariff
concessions, crackdowns on commercial piracy, and financial service
market deregulation, as well as the promotion of investment and
bilateral industrial and technological cooperation.</P>
      <P>The two sides will also exchange views on their strategies for
coping with the fallout from the recent Asian financial turmoil and
their current general economic situations.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan and the EU finalized negotiations over terms
for the ROC's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in late
February, they are still divided on some trade issues, particularly
Taiwan's tariff systems for liquors and compact cars. The two sides
have yet to sign a formal agreement on Taiwan's WTO accession terms.</P>
      <P>EU officials are expected to take advantage of the upcoming
annual trade meeting to discuss these remaining issues with their
Taiwan counterparts.</P>
      <P>For its part, Taiwan is expected to express its concern about the
EU's anti-dumping policy and measures, as a number of Taiwan
products, such as portable fax machines, bicycles, automobile audio
equipment, nuts and screws, synthetic fibers and monosodium
glutamate, have either been slapped with prohibitive punitive duties
or have been subject to anti-dumping investigations over the past six
months.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of
Mongolian and Tibetan affairs on Saturday urged the Mongolian
government to grant visa-free privileges to Taiwan visitors as a
method of helping to accelerate bilateral exchanges between Mongolia
and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mongolian and
Tibetan Affairs Commission, said that although Taiwan visitors are
currently given 30-day landing-visa treatment with a valid invitation
from any Mongolian organization, Ulan Bator is being urged to scrap
visas for Taiwan visitors altogether.</P>
      <P>Taiwan residents make an average of five million trips abroad
every year, Kao noted. In comparison, the number of Taiwan visitors
traveling to Mongolia averages only about 500 per year so far, a
minuscule proportion of the total, he said.</P>
      <P>Kao said his commission will continue to promote exchanges with
Mongolia, a former province of China which gained independence
earlier this century. In 1990, the Mongolian Communist Party yielded
its monopoly on power. A new constitution took effect on Feb. 12,

    <HEADLINE>UK SPIRITS INDUSTRY PRESSING TAIWAN FOR UNIFORM WHISKY TAX</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  April  17  (CNA)
(By C.L. Ou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The UK Scotch Whisky Association has
raised its voice again, calling on Taiwan to introduce a uniform tax
rate for all spirits, irrespective of origin or type, in the hope of
securing an equal footing for Scotch whisky in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Tim Jackson, a spokesman for The Scotch Whisky Association, said
on Friday that the association has approached Hugh R. McMahon, a
member of the European Parliament representing the Glasgow area, to
voice its concern.</P>
      <P>McMahon in turn has written to EU commissioner for Foreign Trade
Sir Leon Britten, asking him to reject what he called a Taiwanese
"interim" offer on whisky taxation, as this would give Japanese,
American, Canadian, Indian, Belgian and French whiskeys a US$3.66 tax
advantage over a bottle of scotch.</P>
      <P>Under current legislation, other imported whiskeys in the Taiwan
market are subject to a lower monopoly tax rate of NT$198 per liter
compared with scotch and Irish whiskey, which is taxed more than
double, at NT$440 per liter.</P>
      <P>Jackson expressed the association's unhappiness over this
discrepancy, saying it puts Scotch whisky in a disadvantageous
position. In 1997, the value of Scotch whisky exported to Taiwan was
some US$104 million, the second-largest UK export to Taiwan, but the
figure has been falling since 1995.</P>
      <P>According to Jackson, as a result of recent EU-Taiwan WTO market
access negotiations and high-level UK-Taiwan, Taiwan has indicated
that it will do its best to ensure enactment and implementation of
the draft "Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Law" (TATL), which will embrace a
uniform tax rate of NT$185 per liter for all spirits from Jan. 1,
1999; and failing which, a uniform rate of NT$198 will apply from
that date until such time as the TATL takes effect.</P>
      <P>Jackson added that Taiwan has offered to apply an "interim" tax
arrangement for, among other things, whisky, to reduce the current
tax rate of NT$440 per liter for scotch and Irish whiskey to NT$285
per liter, between the EU's signature of a WTO market access
agreement and Jan. 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan representative in London said, however, that they are
not aware of what Jackson called the "interim" tax arrangement, let
alone the "uniform" rate of NT$198 or even NT$185. The Taiwan
representative expressed serious doubts about Jackson's version, but
declined further comment, saying that Taiwan has sent a package to
the EU commission for consideration.</P>

      <P>The Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) will hold a workshop in Taipei for

reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The seminar will focus on discussing national innovation systems
in selected catch-up economies, including South Korea, Austria,
Hungary, Mexico, Spain and Taiwan, the council said.</P>
      <P>NSC officials said the OECD, which acts as a think tank for rich
industrial nations, decided to convene the workshop in Taipei only
after strong lobbying from the NSC. Taiwan hopes to become an OECD
observer member before being admitted as a full member.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has a reputation as one of the four Asian Dragons with
brilliant economic achievements, the officials said, the OECD has
invited the nation to join its catch-up economies research program.</P>
      <P>In addition to exploring national innovation systems in the
above-mentioned six countries, the participants will also discuss
their national development strategies and major reform programs
during the two-day meeting.</P>
      <P>NSC Chairman Huang Chen-tai will deliver a report on Taiwan's
"virtual center" program, which is aimed at studying and drafting
national science-technology development policies and strategies.
Several local scientists will also present papers on science and
technology-related topics to offer the participants from Europe and
Asia-Pacific countries a glimpse into Taiwan's national innovation
system and relevant development projects.</P>
      <P>The OECD was founded in 1961 to promote the economic and social
welfare of its member countries, and to stimulate and harmonize
efforts on behalf of developing countries. Its recommendations are
not binding but can play a role in shaping its members' economic

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO CONTINUE PARALLEL ENGAGEMENT WITH ROC, MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  17  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative to the United
States Stephen Chen said on Friday that the US should continue to
develop relations with Taiwan on a parallel track with its ties with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call amid concern that the recent improvement in
bilateral Washington-Beijing ties might hurt the parallel development
of bilateral US-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>In a speech entitled "Parallel Engagement: Taipei's Concept of
US-Mainland Relations," at the World Affairs Council in Dallas,
Texas, Chen stressed that a parallel engagement policy with the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will meet long-term US interests, as well
as help maintain prosperity and peace in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chen, who became head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in the US last October, said the people of
Taiwan understand that full-engagement between the US and the
mainland will bring the US substantial political, economic and
strategic benefits, which will in turn prompt the mainland to be a
more responsible member of the international community.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the US understands there is no reason to ignore
Taiwan, a powerful economy willing to contribute to the international
community. When the US develops relations with Taipei that are
parallel with its ties with Beijing, it will encourage Taiwan to
further develop a free and democratic system which will serve the
best interests of US and Taiwan, and also help promote regional
security and prosperity, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 has provided
a legal framework for the US to develop parallel relations with both
Taiwan and mainland China. In the past 19 years that the US has had
full diplomatic ties with the mainland, relations between the US and
Taiwan have also progressed. This kind of engagement policy has
created a "three-wins" situation, he noted.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the parallel engagement policy represents
confirmation of the achievements Taiwan has made in its trade,
economic, political and societal sectors. He also expressed the hope
that the US can maintain the parallel engagement policy and apply it
to regional and global issues.</P>
      <P>This was Chen's first visit to Dallas since assuming his current
post. The overseas Chinese community and Taiwan businessmen in Dallas
were scheduled to host a party in Chen's honor on Friday night.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly appointed Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng's Beijing
trip will be seen as successful if he can resolve procedural matters
relating to reciprocal visits between the Taipei-based SEF and the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), said Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman and secretary-general of
the SEF, on Friday.</P>
      <P>Jan is scheduled to visit Beijing on April 22 for consultations
on matters of protocol regarding the visit of a Taiwan delegation to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Jan, currently the director of the Research and Planning
Department of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), was
formally nominated by Premier Vincent Siew on Friday morning to the
post of SEF deputy secretary-general, making him the first MAC
official to join the high-ranking staff of the semi-official SEF
since its founding seven years ago.</P>
      <P>Contacts between the SEF and the ARATS have been suspended for
almost three years, thus giving Shi high expectations of Jan's
upcoming Beijing trip.</P>
      <P>The reason for the trip has been defined as "procedural
discussion" by Shi, who is hopeful that it will not only lead to the
restoration of the agreements reached in the past, but will also
serve to express his hearty welcome to a visit to Taiwan by Tang
Shubei, vice chairman of the ARATS.</P>
      <P>The SEF delegation with Jan at its head is slated to leave for
Beijing at 8:30 a.m. on April 22 traveling via Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW, JUSTICE MINISTER LIAO MEET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew met on Saturday with
Minister of Justice Liao Cheng-hao, welcoming Liao's return to the
Cabinet to work for the nation and the people.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen described the atmosphere of
the hour-long meeting as "amicable," adding that Liao also expressed
regret that his resignation, which was later withdrawn, had been the
cause of grave concern for Siew and among the public.</P>
      <P>Chen said in a press conference that Siew attaches importance to
team spirit, morale and ethics in the Cabinet, as those values are
important to societies, nations, groups and individuals.</P>
      <P>Chen denied that an Executive Yuan statement made after Liao's
decision to withdraw his resignation on Thursday was intended to
admonish Liao. The statement said that Liao's resignation had caused
"considerable impact on the morale and image of the Cabinet," calling
for "respect for administrative ethics and the safeguarding of team
spirit" after the conclusion of the matter.</P>
      <P>Thanks to President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President Lien Chan,
Liao changed his mind and agreed to return to the Justice Ministry,
the spokesman said, but stressed that it was Premier Siew who asked
the president and vice president to help talk Liao out of his
determination to step down.</P>
      <P>Siew was quoted as saying that his Cabinet, which he has dubbed
the "Action Cabinet," is not afraid of heavy workloads or pressure,
and that he believes that what the Cabinet has been endeavoring to
accomplish will be felt by the people.</P>
      <P>The popular justice minister first revealed his intention to step
down from his post on Monday. Later in the day, Siew and Lee met
separately with Liao to try to retain him. But he still tendered his
official resignation on Tuesday. Liao's decision to scrap the
resignation was made shortly after a meeting with Lien on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liao has received high approval ratings in a variety of public
opinion polls for his determination and brilliant performance in
cracking down on gangsters and maintaining law and order. There were
strong calls from the public and from legislators regardless of their
party affiliation for him to stay.</P>
      <P>The meeting between Siew and Liao was seen as a gesture to mend
any rift or discord between them in the Cabinet. Liao did not notify
Siew of his decision to withdraw the resignation in person before he
made the announcement in a press conference on Thursday. After the
announcement, Liao rushed to the Executive Yuan to report this to
Siew, but his request for a meeting was refused on the ground that
Siew was receiving other guests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDENTS PROTEST TUITION HIKES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 students from Taiwan's nine
state and private universities took their grievances to the streets
on Saturday to protest a government plan to raise tuition fees from
next semester.</P>
      <P>The students, shouting "Down with high tuition policy," "No raise
for three years," and "Annual hikes make us sick," surged up to the
gates of the Ministry of Education (MOE), where they wanted to meet
Education Minister Lin Ching-chiang to voice their anger over the
alleged increase in tuition fees.</P>
      <P>After waiting for about two hours in front of the MOE gates,
which police blocked them from entering, the students met with Vice
Education Minister Yang Kuo-tsu, who promised to look into the
proposed plan, and signed his name on a giant poster of a check to
endorse its "no raise for three years" message.</P>
      <P>Yang said the MOE is planning to invite legislators, academics
and other relevant specialists to form a committee to study
exclusively the appropriateness of any readjustment in tuition fees
for higher education, and work out a standard formula for
readjustment.</P>
      <P>The students, temporarily satisfied with Yang's promise, said
they will come back and stage another rally if tuition fees for the
fall semester, which will be announced by the MOE in May, are found
to have been increased.</P>
      <P>Rumors have been circulating that the MOE is planning to raise
college and university tuition fees by some 5 percent starting this
fall, prompting students to take their anger to the streets.</P>
      <P>Minimum tuition for students in state-run universities in Taiwan
is now about NT$24,000 per person per semester, while fees in private
institutions start from around NT$50,000. The figures do not include
fees for medical schools and other departments of specialist study.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAILS WSC MEMBERSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior ROC government officials on
Saturday expressed welcome to a World Semiconductor Council (WSC)
decision to admit both sides of the Taiwan Strait next year.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said Taiwan's semiconductor
industry will gain greater access to trade information and
technological expertise following the island's entry to the
non-governmental world semiconductor trade promotional organization.</P>
      <P>The WSC passed a resolution at its second annual meeting held in
Carlsbad, California on Friday, inviting Taiwan and mainland China
to attend its 1999 annual meeting as full members on conditions that
the two Chinese economies scrap tariffs on semiconductors as soon as
possible and support all activities sponsored by the WSC and the
Government Consulting Mechanism.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said joining the WSC will help
boost the development of Taiwan's already vibrant semiconductor
industry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now the world's fourth largest semiconductor producer
after the United States, Japan and South Korea. Its 1996 annual
production reached US$8.4 billion and total investment amounted to
US$19 billion. Taiwan is expected to replace South Korea as the
No. 3 supplier soon.</P>
      <P>With its strength in the industry, Taiwan was admitted to the
Global Government Forum (GGF), a government-to-government
international organization to coordinate policies on the
semiconductor industry, earlier this year. Minland China is still
not a GGF member.</P>
      <P>The WSC, founded in August 1996, is a private forum dedicated
to promoting development, trade and investment in the semiconductor
industry as well as removal of tariff trade barriers.</P>
      <P>Lin said a seat in the WSC will enable local semiconductor
makers to better understand the regulations and development
directions of the global semiconductor market. "It is also expected
to help avert recurrence of a scenario that occurred several years
ago. In the past, Taiwan's static and dynamic random access memory
chips production once suffered a dramatic slump because of patent
disputes."</P>
      <P>Lin further said mainland China's entry to the WSC is also good
news for Taiwan as it will push the mainland to remove tariff
barriers and thus facilitate sales of Taiwan-made semiconductors to
that vast market.</P>
      <P>The WSC currently have four full members -- the United States,
Japan, the European Union and South Korea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC, ROC VYING FOR OVERSEAS CHINESE SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  17  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A report published by the Canadian
Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS) says mainland China's "next
major foreign policy goal will be to create the conditions for
reunification with Taiwan on its own terms."</P>
      <P>"With this in mind, both the People's Republic of China and the
Republic of China are intensifying their efforts to garner the
financial, technical and political support of overseas Chinese around
the world," the report points out.</P>
      <P>It advises Canada to "exercise vigilance" to ensure that the
rights and freedoms of Chinese Canadians are not threatened, as the
divide and rule tactics that characterize Beijing's united front work
will form the basis of this campaign.</P>
      <P>Authored by Ottawa-based analyst Holly Porteous, the paper was
published by CSIS in its Winter, 1998 issue of "Commentary." The
editor notes it reflects the personal view of the author and does not
imply CSIS authentication or endorsement.</P>
      <P>Porteous says Beijing has been applying the lessons it learned
from Hong Kong to Taiwan. He quoted Taiwan officials as saying
mainland China is employing united front techniques to strangle
support for groups supporting Taiwan's independence and to create
conditions for reunification.</P>
      <P>His paper, entitled "Beijing's United Front Strategy in Hong
Kong," explains that united front work is a combination of isolating
the enemy and forging alliances. In the context of Hong Kong, it has
sought to win over leaders from every sector of society, including
academics, the media, youth and civil servants.</P>
      <P>In the case of Taiwan, the paper says, nurturing economic ties
has the added benefit of helping to create a constituency for
reunification. Taiwan has been the second-largest foreign investor in
mainland China, behind only Hong Kong, according to 1994 figures
cited by the paper.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese are a major target for Beijing's united front
work, which has "pitted the PRC against the Republic of China in a
fight for investment and political support," according to the paper.</P>
      <P>It points out that mainland China has sometimes asked for more
than just money from overseas Chinese. "Inducing Chinese abroad, by
threat or by appeal to patriotism, to conduct economic and technical
espionage, is also an aim of united front work," it notes.</P>
      <P>With the first stage of the Hong Kong handover transition now
complete, Beijing will focus on maintaining a steady state as
political and economic relations with Hong Kong are solidified, and
turn its attention to wooing Taiwan, it observes.</P>
      <P>Eager to achieve a smooth transition in Hong Kong, Beijing has
placed too great an emphasis on alliances with Kong Kong's corporate
barons, political toadies and criminal elements, the paper says.</P>
      <P>As a disenfranchised middle class demands greater representation
of its interests, Beijing risks seeing its carefully crafted united
front fall apart, it adds. It warns that if Beijing fails to address
the alienation of the middle class, there is a "potential for
political instability in the territory."</P>
      <P>In conclusion, it says that although the successful
implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy in Hong Kong
is not likely to cause Taiwan to agree to reunification under
mainland China's current conditions, its failure "will surely" scotch
any chance of bringing Taiwan into the fold peacefully.</P>

      <P>Australia's Colonial Insurance, with the
help of lobbying by former Prime Minister Paul Keating, has emerged
the winner of a battle to obtain a license to sell life insurance in
the huge mainland China market, beating rival company National Mutual
Insurance.</P>
      <P>The People's Bank of China on Friday advised Colonial's Beijing

      <P>National Mutual failed to win a license, despite intense lobbying
by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, and the daily quoted insiders as
saying that the reason was due to Hawke's stance following the 1989

      <P>Hawke condemned Beijing for the atrocity and granted temporary

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE SETS NEW RULES TO STOP SOFTWARE PIRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, April 18 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore government has introduced
new regulations aimed at stamping out software piracy at the source.</P>
      <P>The new rules allow only manufacturers approved by the Singapore
Economic Development Board to import mastering and replication
equipment for CDs, CD-read only memory (CD-ROM), video CDs, digital
video discs and DVD-ROMS.</P>
      <P>Makers of optical discs -- including compact discs and video CDs
used for computer software and movies -- are now compelled to obtain
licenses to import the equipment needed to manufacture master copies
and duplicate the discs.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for approval is an undertaking not to
violate intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>Those who violate this condition will have their licenses to
manufacture revoked, according to a joint statement issued Friday by
the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Trade Development Board (TDB)
and the Economic Development Board.</P>
      <P>Approved manufacturers also need TDB approval to transfer the
equipment to another company, re-export it after use or dispose of it
as scrap.</P>
      <P>And those who import the equipment for re-export must first
obtain approval from the TDB.</P>
      <P>The TDB said its officers might conduct random checks to verify
that the regulations are complied with.</P>
      <P>Those who flout the regulations face fines of up to S$100,000
(US$62,344) or three times the value of the goods, whichever is
greater, as well as a maximum two years in jail.</P>
      <P>Subsequent violations will attract jail terms of up to three
years and fines of up to S$200,000 or four times the value of the
goods.</P>
      <P>In a related move Friday, nine Singapore optical disc
manufacturers signed a code of conduct in which they undertook to
help in the fight against piracy by ensuring copyrights are

    <TEXT>
      <P>A woman charged with having harbored the
criminal trio responsible for the kidnap and murder of high school
student Pai Hsiao-yen claimed innocence on Saturday, saying that she
should be treated as a victim.</P>
      <P>The defendant, surnamed You, admitted that between last June and
August she had harbored Chen Chin-hsing, Lin Chun-sheng and Kao
Tien-ming while the three were fugitives, but stressed that she had
done this because her life had been threatened.</P>
      <P>In a court hearing at the Panchiao District Court on Saturday,
You said that Chen broke into her house and raped her last June. At
that time, Chen and his two partners were Taiwan's most wanted men
over their involvement in the kidnap and murder of TV celebrity Pai
Ping-ping's 17-year-old daughter last April.</P>
      <P>You, who made a living before her arrest by selling niches for
cremains, said that Chen had given her about NT$900,000 (US$27,270),
which she used to rent houses and buy a used car for them, as well to
buy mausoleum niches. You didn't report the events to police until
last August when Lin committed suicide during a gun battle with
police.</P>
      <P>Chen, however, who was present at the court hearing to explain
what became of the NT$5 million he and the others got from the kidnap
of Taipei County Councilor Tsai Ming-tang during their days on the
run, said that he had given most of his NT$1.66 million share to You
to "compensate" her.</P>
      <P>Judges at the court said that they will investigate further the
flow of the ransom money, including how much You had been given and
what she had done with the money, to help them weigh her
responsibility in having harbored the trio.</P>
      <P>Chen, the only survivor of the notorious trio, surrendered to the
police last November after a 24-hour standoff in suburban Taipei at
the residence of a South African diplomat, where he had taken the
diplomat and his family hostage. Lin and Kao committed suicide during
separate shootouts with police in August and October, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chen received sentences of unprecedented severity from the
Panchiao District Court in January, including five death sentences
and two life terms, in addition to 59 years and six months in prison.
Chen has appealed his case to the Taiwan High Court, which held its

    <HEADLINE>POLICE PROBING MASTERMIND OF INTEL CHIP COUNTERFEITING RING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five suspects involved in an Intel
microchips counterfeiting ring were released on bail on Saturday
after being questioned by prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Prosecution authorities said the five men, who were arrested by
police on Friday, were only "downstream processors" in the criminal
counterfeiting operations. They have asked police authorities to
continue investigation into the case in order to bring to justice
"upperstream" masterminds.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said they
suspect that the Intel chip counterfeiting was a cross-border crime,
with top masterminds still staying offshore.</P>
      <P>Lin Yung-yu, one of the suspects nabbed on Friday, told CIB
agents that all finished bogus computer chips were airlifted to a
Hong Kong businessman, surnamed Yen, through an express delivery
company.</P>
      <P>According to the five suspects' correspondence records, CIB
investigators said they suspect there might be US-based
businesspeople involved in the case, who might have given orders to
Hong Kong-based Yen.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the suspects first purchased
relatively low-end Intel Pentium II 233 central processing units
(CPUs) and then removed their indentification marks and model numbers
at an underground factory.</P>
      <P>The products were then inscribed with new model numbers and
identification using laser technology, describing them as the latest
high-end Pentium 266 or Pentium II 300 CPUs, models which could fetch
NT$12,000 (US$366) and NT$18,000 (US$549) apiece, respectively. Intel
Inc. of the United States is the world's largest CPU maker.</P>
      <P>Acting on tips, police raided five hideouts in northern Taiwan
early Friday morning and managed to nab the five suspects as well as
large quantities of forged Intel microchips and tools for making
them. The seized goods were worth more than NT$100 million (US$3
million) in market value.</P>
      <P>Industry sources said with upgrading of Taiwan's computer
technology, similar counterfeiting or forgery cases are expected to
continue increasing in the years ahead. They urged the government to
revise the current regulations and impose harsher penalties on
violators in order to deter such criminal activities.</P>

with mainland China in the absence of official ties across the
Taiwan Strait, made the statement after a mainland fishing boat
reportedly had salvaged the wreckage of the crashed Daily Air
chopper and the remains of its crew members.</P>
      <P>The SEF once faxed a message to its mainland counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), on March
19, asking it to help search for the wreckage and the pilots'
bodies.</P>
      <P>If necessary, SEF officials said they will contact the ARATS
again for its assistance in reclamation of the pilots' remains.</P>
      <P>The body of the chopper's pilot Liu Han-chieh and parts of the
plane wreckage were already salvaged, but the remains of co-pilot
Lin Ming-lai and cockpit captain Chiang Ching-chuan as well as the
chopper's "black box" have not been discovered.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen was quoted by the United Evening
News as having confirmed that a maritime police squadron stationed in
Penghu did receive a phone call Friday night from a mainland
fisherman saying his fishing vessel, while operating in the open
near Penghu, had discovered the wreckage of the Daily Air chopper and
the remains of its two crew members.</P>
      <P>However, Huang added that Penghu maritime police have so far not
seen any mainland fishing boat in waters near Penghu, an island
group off the southwestern Taiwan coast. "So we still cannot
confirm what the mainland fisherman had claimed in his Friday's phone
call," Huang said, adding that police would not get involved in
negotiations between the mainland fisherman and Taipei-based Daily
Air Corp. over the issue. Nevertheless, Huang said, police will
probe whether the mainland fisherman has really discovered the
wreckage or the pilots' bodies.</P>
      <P>The mainland fisherman, identified only by his family name
Chang, reportedly has demanded that Daily Air pay him US$50,000 in
cash in exchange for the wreckage and the crewmen's bodies.</P>
      <P>A daily Air spokesman said the company would give payment only
if the mainland fisherman has reclaimed the chopper's "black box" or
the crewmen's remains.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the company has contacted the mainland
fisherman. "The mainland fisherman didn't clearly said he had
discovered bodies of the two crew members. We suspect he might have
only salvage some pieces of the plane wreckage," the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>He further said post-crash investigations have almost been
finalized. "We currently only need the black box to support our
judgements on the cause of the crash," the spokesman said. The black
box refers to a flight information recorder and a cockpit
voice recorder. The device can help understand the situation of the
aircraft as well as pilot operations before a flight accident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YANGTZE RIVER STURGEON SUCCESSFULLY BRED IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yangtze River sturgeon, a fish
endangered in its native habitat in mainland China and valued for its
tasty caviar, has been successfully bred at a fish farm in northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chieh-li, the owner of a fish farm in Wulai, a town to the
south of Taipei known for its cool and sweet spring water from the
mountains, announced recently that he has been able to breed the rare
Yangtze River sturgeon, better-known as the Chunghua sturgeon, and
that he had sold some of the largest ones, weighing about 35
kilograms apiece, for some NT$200,000 (US$6,000) per head.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who also raises rainbow trout, a freshwater delicacy, said
he imported some 200 very young Chunghua sturgeon from the United
States four years ago in an effort to raise the endangered but highly
sought-after species.</P>
      <P>Since most of the 5-centimeter baby fish are now 130 cm long and
could sell for about NT$200,000 apiece, he is poised to reel in a
fortune in sales.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he expects to find out whether the sturgeon in his farm
will end up caviar producers or not in about two years. Mainland
Chinese claim that Chunghua sturgeon produce caviar and isinglass
superior to those of fish from the Black Sea, he noted, adding that
if he finds this is true of his fish, he will start another business
as a caviar seller.</P>
      <P>The Yangtze River sturgeon, technically a freshwater shark, is a
large, ganoid relic freshwater fish belonging to the family
Acipenseridae of the Northern Hemisphere.</P>
      <P>Sturgeon caviar is considered one of the world's best. The globe
contains only seven species of sturgeon -- with the Chunghua
sturgeon, native to the Yangtze River, and Shih's sturgeon, found in
the Amur River on the border between Russia and mainland China, being
the two most treasured.</P>
      <P>The Chunghua sturgeon, which can grow up to 6.2 meters long, is
facing the threat of extinction in the wild due to the development of
the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN COMPANY MAKES IMPRESSIVE GAINS IN AUSTRIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Vienna, April 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A phthalic anhydride (PA) production plant
in Austria that was near bankruptcy when it was taken over by
Taiwan's Dahin Group three years ago has become a profitable
business, providing encouragement for more Taiwan firms to invest in
Europe's manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The Dahin Group purchased Atmosa Petrochemie GmbH in Schwechat,
Austria, in April 1995, the first time a Taiwan petrochemical firm
had made an acquisition in a member state of the European Community.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan firms were already active in Europe at that time,
most of them were engaged in marketing rather than production. The
acquisition also made Dahin the first Taiwan company to invest in
manufacturing in Austria.</P>
      <P>The Austrian investment project was thus a brave step for Dahin,
a listed company with an accumulated capital investment amounting to
NT$1.6 billion (US$48.5 million). Since its establishment, Dahin has
expanded its market from Taiwan to mainland China, Japan, Europe and
the United States.</P>
      <P>Dahin purchased Atmosa's existing PA production facilities at the
Schwechat petrochemical park near Vienna after a brief but intense
evaluation in the spring of 1995. The production facilities had been
closed for two years after long years of operating at a deficit.</P>
      <P>Since the purchase, the plant has been revitalized and made into
a profitable business. Within two years, the annual production
capacity was boosted from 38,000 tons to 50,000 tons.</P>
      <P>A Dahin executive disclosed that the US$20 million that the
company spent to acquire the plant was only about one-fourth of the
amount that would have been needed to establish a new plant of the
same capacity, adding that the purchase was a good business decision.</P>
      <P>While the plant's performance has come to be praised by Austria's
Economics Ministry, Dahin has responded by expressing its
satisfaction with the investment climate in Austria. Although the
cost of labor is much higher in Austria than in Asia, the country has
a number of advantages, including high worker productivity and low
interest rates, the executive said.</P>
      <P>One reason Dahin made the investment in Austria is the stable
demand for PA in the international market.</P>
      <P>In 1996, about 45 percent of Atmosa's production was shipped back
to Asia. Last year, the company's share of markets in Europe --
specifically in Italy, France, Germany and Eastern Europe -- showed
considerable growth.</P>
      <P>Businesses in Eastern and Southeastern Europe have shown great
interest in entering cooperative agreements with Dahin, with some
companies already having made contacts toward this end. If everything
proceeds smoothly in Dahin's discussions with firms in Slovenia, the
group's next European project may be realized there, the executive
said.</P>
      <P>Dahin's main production facilities are now located in Taiwan,
mainland China, Thailand and Indonesia, but Atmosa's success has
given the petrochemical group courage to branch out beyond Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA FUNDING 3 DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN M'LAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  17  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada on Friday announced support for
three projects in mainland China that will help reduce poverty in
rural regions, heighten women's awareness of their rights and train
telecommunications engineers.</P>
      <P>Dianne Marleau, Canada's minister for international cooperation,
made the announcement after signing cooperation agreements with the
government of mainland China during a visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>"Poverty reduction requires a comprehensive approach. That is why
we propose projects that consider the many aspects of poverty,"
Marleau said. Canada is offering greater access to basic health care
services and increasing food production, hoping this will improve the
living conditions of the poor in rural mainland China.</P>
      <P>Canada estimates that 270 million mainland Chinese live on less
than US$1 a day. "Most live in isolated, rural regions ... like
Ningxia, Gansu, Shanxi and Guizhou," a government release said.</P>
      <P>The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), operating
under Marleau's department, will provide up to C$5.7 million (US$4.07
million) in funds for the five-year project. Canada's Mennonite
Central Committee (MCC), one of the project partner's, will
contribute another C$900,000.</P>
      <P>The second project, designed to make women aware of their rights,
will be promoted through training programs and a public information
campaign. CIDA will contribute up to C$5 million to the Association
of Canadian Community Colleges, which will manage this five-year
project.</P>
      <P>The third initiative supports the development of a
telecommunications network through the mainland Chinese Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunication. Newbridge Networks Corp. and the
Advanced Engineering Training Institute of Carleton University, both
in Ottawa, will train mainland Chinese engineers in the technology of
developing digital networks. These engineers, in turn, will be
qualified to train others.</P>
      <P>CIDA's contribution to the initiative of up to C$1.2 million in
funds is matched by a C$1.1 million contribution by Newbridge
Networks Corp. and Carleton University for the three-year project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MONORAIL PLANNED FOR JFK AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  17  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Concluding a 14-month study, the New
York/New Jersey Port Authority on Thursday approved plans to build a
US$1.2 billion monorail to link JFK International Airport with the A
train and the Long Island Railroad (LIRR).</P>
      <P>Officials said that if opposition from city officials and
airlines is overcome, they expect a circular rail route connecting
the nine terminals at JFK to be completed by 2002, along with the
extension to the Howard Beach station of the A line.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the hookup with the LIRR's Jamaica station should be
completed by 2003.</P>
      <P>The US$1.2 billion project will be funded through two sources:
US$930 million from the US$3 surcharge for each departing plane
passenger and US$300 million from the Port Authority's capital
budget, officials said.</P>
      <P>The Board of Commissioners officially OK'd the plan, awarding the
US$930 million design and construction portion of the project to
Perini Corp., Bombardier Transit Corp. and Shanska USA.</P>
      <P>But New York City Mayor Giuliani's office blasted the
announcement.</P>
      <P>"This project cannot begin until a final agreement is reached
with the city, " said Anthony Coles, Giuliani's senior adviser. "The
mayor must be certain that the project will be in the best interest
of all New Yorkers, not just the Port Authorities," he said, adding
that "at present, a final agreement has not been reached and, by
making this announcement prematurely, the Port Authority, once again,
is placing its own priorities over the priorities of New York City."</P>
      <P>The Washington-based Air Transportation Association also opposes
the plan and has filed a suit attempting to block use of the
passenger surcharge, arguing the money can't be used for non-aviation
purposes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTARCTIC MELTDOWN ESCALATES AT TERRIFYING PACE, SCIENTISTS SAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The collapse of the largest ice shelf
group on the Antarctic Peninsula is escalating at a terrifying pace,
and scientists have confirmed the loss of another 200-square
kilometer mass of ice in the region.</P>
      <P>The scientists said about two-thirds of the 12,000-square km
Larsen Ice Shelves now threaten to break off, and that the latest
loss may be "the beginning of the end" for these shelves, according
to a report Saturday in the mass circulation newspaper The
Australian.</P>
      <P>Scientists are yet to decide whether to blame humans or a natural
fluctuation for the rapid warming of the region's climate that has
resulted in mounting losses of ice shelves in recent years from the
Larsen group, which runs much of the length of the peninsula's east
coast and west coast ice shelves, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Antarctica annually sheds millions of tons of ice from shelves
that grind down from the continental ice cap to float on the ocean
then break up to form huge icebergs, the daily said.</P>
      <P>The British Antarctic Survey has linked an unusual rise in air
temperature to the alarming shelf losses.</P>
      <P>Led by Dr. David Vaughan, the survey scientists pinpointed a
zero-degree temperature gradient over the peninsula each January as
the limit of viability for ice shelves.</P>
      <P>But they found this line had moved south over the past 50 years
as the climate of the peninsula warmed by 2.5 degrees Celsius --
several times the global average.</P>
      <P>Scientists said over the past two years, ice shelf break-offs
have escalated. Last year, Professor Helmut Rott of the University of
Innsbruck calculated the total loss of the Larsen group ice shelves
at 5,600 square km.</P>
      <P>In the latest finding, researchers from the University of
Colorado analyzed satellite images taken over the past two months and
pinpointed the break-off of a chunk 40 km long and five km wide.</P>
      <P>"This may be the beginning of the end for the Larsen Ice Shelf,"
said Ted Scambos, one of the researchers.</P>
      <P>He said there is not enough evidence to find a "smoking gun" yet.
But he warned that "ice shelves appear to be good bellwethers for
climate change since they respond to change within decades, not
centuries."</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  18 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Prime Minister John Howard
has admitted the worsening waterfront dispute is dividing the nation,
while Patrick Stevedores Ltd., one of the two leading stevedoring
firms at the center of the showdown, has threatened to shut down five
regional port operations if the Federal Court forces it to reinstate
its fired union workers.</P>
      <P>Howard said Friday that the waterfront dispute is dividing
Australia because "it is part and parcel of solving the challenge to
our economic future."</P>
      <P>He told a Melbourne radio station that "this idea -- 'well, all
right, we will never do anything through fear of upsetting somebody'"
is a recipe for "seeing the country go down the drain."</P>
      <P>Howard came under fire after police in Melbourne, Sydney and
other port cities detained hundreds of unionist protesters.</P>
      <P>He was later confronted by 450 demonstrators who threw eggs,
apples and tomatoes when he arrived at a luncheon in Melbourne
Friday.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Patrick issued a warning Friday after the
company suffered a severe blow in the British High Court, which
lifted a temporary injunction restraining the International Transport
Workers Federation (ITF) from pressuring shipping companies to
boycott Patrick's non-union facilities in Australia.</P>
      <P>The ITF is one of the international labor union groups behind the
support of the Maritime Union of Australia, which is now using its
thousands of members to block Patrick's operations in Melbourne,
Sydney, Perth, Brisbane, Newcastle, Cairns and other ports.</P>
      <P>Patrick Stevedores, which fired all 1,400 of its full-time union
workers and 600 part-time workers last week, threatened to shut down
its operations at several ports throughout Australia.</P>
      <P>The sacking triggered a national blockade of Patrick's operations
in major Australian ports, disrupting cargo movement at the ports and
delaying shipments of both exported and imported cargoes between
Australia and its trading partners abroad.</P>

mainland fishermen contacted Taiwan marine police stationed in Penghu

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of overseas Chinese stood at
33.24 million at the end of 1997, statistics compiled by the
Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) show.</P>
      <P>The latest OCAC census on Chinese people residing abroad points
out that 26.91 million ethnic Chinese, or 81 percent of the total,
live in Asia, followed by America with 4.73 million and Europe with
940,000. About 540,000 overseas Chinese reside in Oceania and 120,000
live in Africa.</P>
      <P>Oceania posted the largest annual increase in Chinese population
in 1997 at 7.54 percent, while Europe and America charted growth of
4.33 percent and 4.15 percent, respectively, the census indicates.
Africa saw a rise of 3.69 percent in Chinese population last year,
while Asia registered the slightest increase among regions.</P>
      <P>According to the OCAC's new definitions, overseas Chinese include
Republic of China nationals residing abroad and ethnic Chinese
naturalized into other nationalities. Chinese people living in Hong
Kong are no longer considered overseas Chinese.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey commissioned by the OCAC shows that most
Taiwan emigrates in the United States chose to settle there because
of considerations of "personal career development" and "children's
education." "Searching for a good living environment" and
"post-graduation stay" are also cited, while "a deteriorating public
security" at home was also listed by a small percentage of the
respondents.</P>
      <P>The OCAC explained that it chose US-based Taiwan emigrates for
the survey because a large percent of overseas Chinese reside in
America and the Chinese population there is steadily increasing.
Results of the poll will be referred to the ROC government for future
policymaking in relevant fields, it added.</P>

President Al Gore as "Vice President Scrooge" for donating just
US$353 to charity last year on his salary of US$197,699.</P>
      <P>"Who pays for Gore's charities? You do!" declared a flier from
the Republican National Committee claiming the vice president is
pushing US$125 billion in new government spending -- but won't ante
up for charity himself.</P>
      <P>In a further embarrassment to Gore, the New York Post reported
Saturday that video has surfaced showing an impassioned vice
president as he urged a volunteerism summit last spring saying,
"We're going to pitch in as individual Americans and do what we can."</P>
      <P>And late-night comics jumped into the act as Jay Leno ridiculed

    <HEADLINE>MISGIVINGS CITED ON ANNIVERSARY OF CROSS-STRAIT TRANSSHIPMENT OPENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the first anniversary of the opening of
offshore transshipment services between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, shipping companies on Sunday expressed misgivings about
prospects for the trade.</P>
      <P>Statistics have shown a dramatic decrease of 37 percent in the
volume of transshipped goods in the first quarter of this year from
the previous one.</P>
      <P>Marine sources said that some companies which applied to operate
offshore transshipment services have never followed up. Only Yangming
Marine Transport Corp. and Uniglory Marine Corp., which have
profitable transoceanic shipping routes to support them, are still
holding on.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese freighter Sheng Da arrived at the southern
Taiwan port of Kaohsiung on April 19, 1997, after departing from the
mainland port of Xiamen, becoming the first ship to ply the
once-prohibited route.</P>
      <P>Sources said shipping companies were upbeat then, thinking that
the Sheng Da's voyage had opened a new era in indirect shipping
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and that mainland China
would open more ports to engage in cross-strait indirect shipping
following the major breakthrough.</P>
      <P>But those expectations evaporated after mainland authorities
explicitly stated that no more ports besides the one at Xiamen and
another at Fuzhou would be opened.</P>
      <P>Uniglory Marine officials said the dramatic drop in business in
the first quarter was closely linked with the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia. With purchasing power in the region declining, cargo
bound for Southeast Asia from Fuzhou and Xiamen via Kaohsiung also
plunged.</P>
      <P>They said the company had to make up for losses arising thereof
by relying heavily on shipments to and from the United States and
Europe.</P>
      <P>Yangming officials said that its volume of transshipped cargo
managed to see growth in the first quarter. But as the volume of
cargo from the mainland to other places is far greater than that from
Kaohsiung to the mainland, the company often has a large number of
empty containers going to Xiamen, causing operational costs to swell.</P>
      <P>To cut costs, Yangming is planning to build small container ships
to handle regional shipping, they said.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Port Authority had estimated that transshipped
cargo volumes at Kaohsiung Harbor in 1998 would increase sharply from
the 120,000 TEUs recorded last year. But judging from the fact that
the first quarter saw only 20,000 TEUs of transshipped goods, they
have adjusted that estimate downward.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   19   (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Strait Peaceful Unification
Association, a civic organization aiming at promoting exchange,
reciprocity and peaceful unification across the Taiwan Strait, was
formally inaugurated in Taipei on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony was presided over by Liang Su-yung,
president of the association.</P>
      <P>On hand to extend their congratulations were Wang Tso-yung,
president of Control Yuan; former Premier Hau Pei-tsun; Chiao Jen-ho,
chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC); former
OCAC Chairman Tseng Kwang-shun; Chen Li-fu, former senior advisor to
the president; and Hsu Li-nung, former national policy advisor to the
president, among others.</P>
      <P>Liang explained at the meeting that his organization, based on
the desire for peace, not war, will promote the peaceful unification
of China under the following three principles:</P>
      <P>-- Marching toward peaceful unification under the principle of a
single China;</P>
      <P>-- Peaceful coexistence for two political entities on both sides
of the strait, with sovereign rights for both sides over the
territory;</P>
      <P>-- No independence for Taiwan, and no resort to force by the
mainland.</P>
      <P>He said the association will dedicate itself to the following
tasks:</P>
      <P>-- Promoting peaceful interaction and positive interchange
between people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>-- Protecting the rights and interests of Taiwan businessmen, and
enhancing cross-strait economic relations by advocating the immediate
opening of trade, navigation and postal communications.</P>
      <P>-- Engaging in various activities for peaceful cross-strait
unification and a renaissance of Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>-- Ending cross-strait hostilities and signing a peace treaty.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Wang said it is easier for the two sides of the
strait to make peace than to go to war. He stressed Chinese should
not fight Chinese.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Hau stressed in the ceremony that promoting
cross-strait democratic unification should be the common mission of
the entire Chinese people. He added that the principle of a single
Chinese nation has been put forth in the Guidelines for National
Unification.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Huan, senior advisor to the president, the
biggest barrier to cross-strait unification is the one-party
dictatorship in Communist China. He said the past atrocities on the
mainland, such as the reign of terror by the Red Guards and other
political and social campaigns, were the results of errors made by a
handful of leaders in the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>Chen Li-fu, honorary president of the association, said he
believes the unification of China should be accomplished on the basis
of a shared Chinese culture between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND MISSION DUE TO SELL WATER SUPPLY PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A nine-member delegation of mainland
Chinese officials arrived in Taipei on Sunday to attend a seminar on
planning and development of water resources across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The delegation was led by Chen Guoliang, a section chief of the
water supply and planning task force of Fujian Province, which lies
opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A pro-Beijing newspaper based in Hong Kong pointed out that
mainland China attaches much importance to the seminar and that the
visiting delegation includes officials from the central government's
ministries of finance and water resources, and the State Planning
Commission.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Water Resources Minister Niu Maosheng was quoted
by the newspaper as saying that cross-strait joint efforts in
planning and developing water resources are of great significance to
both Taiwan and mainland China, as how to conserve and use water
resources is one of the most important agenda for all countries in
the face of the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Niu was reported as hailing the concerted efforts, especially
between Taiwan and Fujian, as "practical" because of the close links
in climatic and hydraulic patterns between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to the report, water resources authorities with Fujian
Province carried out a test on April 9, involving the use of large
rubber bags to transport fresh water from Weitou Bay outside Jinjiang
City to a mock destination -- the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen Island.</P>
      <P>The result showed that the vessel dragging large rubber bags
containing more than 200 tons of fresh water could move as far as 9.2
nautical miles, while the actual distance between Kinmen and Weitou
is only 5.6 nautical miles, the report said. It added that the
successful test proved Fujian has the ability to provide water to
Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands before construction of underground
channels for transporting water between the two sides is completed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which lay closer
to Fujian Province, have been hard hit by a drought in recent years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the mainland jointly held a seminar in July 1995 in
Fuzhou, the capital city of Fujian Province, to find ways of fighting
drought and floods.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REGIONAL CRISIS DRAWS SINGAPORE, MALAYSIA CLOSER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The regional economic crisis has drawn
Malaysia and Singapore closer by making clear the need for them to
work together and the gains from doing so, the prime ministers of
both countries said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad expressed the similar views in their
speeches at the official opening ceremony of the Second Link, a new
crossing bridge between Singapore and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Both leaders cited the joint opening of the 1.9-km crossing,
which links Tanjung Kupang in Johor, Malaysia, and Tuas in Singapore,
as an "important milestone" in bilateral ties and pledged to boost
bilateral cooperation further.</P>
      <P>Goh said that opening the new S$1.5-billion bridge during the
current period of economic turbulence showed that "cooperation is the
way to go."</P>
      <P>The construction of the Second Link was "testimony to the
achievements that we can attain by putting our hearts and minds
together," he said.</P>
      <P>A bilateral commitment to cooperate was all the more important in
these difficult times, he said, noting that the financial turbulence
that had hit the region had caused currencies to depreciate, weakened
economies, cut asset values sharply, and eroded confidence in several
economies.</P>
      <P>"This shared pain shows how inter-linked our destiny is. But the
regional crisis has also made us work even closer together. As a
result, we will emerge stronger from our tribulations... As close
neighbors with historical ties, Singapore and Malaysia have much in
common, and much to gain from working together. Troubled economic
times have made this clearer," Goh said.</P>
      <P>He declared the new bridge a "symbol of a new phase in the
Malaysia-Singapore relationship."</P>
      <P>Expressing a similar view in his speech, Mahathir said he was
very heartened that the crisis had brought the two sides closer in
trying to resolve their problems, "despite the recent hiccup" in
bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the souring of ties following a remark by
Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew about crime in Johor last
March.</P>
      <P>Mahathir said: "Frequent consultations and discussions have made
us more aware of the sensitivities and the problems that we face. Of
more importance is the fact that it had made us more aware of the
strengths that both possess and how these can be harnessed for the
benefit of our peoples."</P>
      <P>"I wish to reiterate here that Malaysia values its links with
Singapore and has always regarded Singapore and Singaporeans as
friends," he said.
Later, the two leaders signed their names on a gold plaque and cut a
ribbon to declare the crossing officially open.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC IMPORTS FROM HUNGARY UP CONSIDERABLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Budapest,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's imports from
Hungary in 1997 grew by 232 percent over the 1996 level, indicating
the efforts of the ROC to balance two-way trade with that East
European country, ROC Representative to Hungary Rock Leng said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In 1997, two-way trade between the ROC and Hungary amounted to
US$196.4 million, up 56.2 percent from 1996 levels. The ROC's imports
from Hungary totaled US$61.1 million against its exports amounting to
US$135.3 million. The ROC continued to enjoy a favorable balance.</P>
      <P>Leng pointed out that relations with the European Union and
neighboring countries have the priority of Hungary's external
relations policy. However, the Hungarian government has initiated
some effort in developing markets in Asia in recent years, witnessing
the prosperity in the Asian Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Hungary is the ROC's second largest trade partner in East Europe,
next only to Poland. In 1997, ROC-Hungary trade accounted for
one-fifth of the ROC's trade with Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>In 1990, the Taipei Representative Office in Budapest was set up,
marking the first representative office of the ROC in the formerly
socialist countries in Eastern Europe. The office has coordinated
with Hungarian economic and trade authorities to reduce trade
barriers between the two countries by signing agreements regarding
product inspection certification and cooperation in regulating
customs tariffs.</P>
      <P>Since the early 1990s, many Taiwan businessmen have visited
Hungary; however, not many have set up permanent offices there. Among
the less than 20 Taiwanese firms, mostly in Budapest, the majority
are engaged in export-import of consumer goods and sales of
computers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has recently
invited an expert from the United States to speak on techniques by
which to trace the sources of seized drugs, officials said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Drug Enforcement Center (DEC) officials under the MOJ's
Investigation Bureau said the ministry had solicited the help of
Robert Bianchi, director of the Special Testing and Research
Laboratory of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to help
build a data bank on drug-related information.</P>
      <P>DEC officials said the data bank will help law enforcement
officials to trace the sources of drugs seized from traffickers and
to identify overseas accomplices and smuggling routes.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that authorities in the United States and
Europe have developed sophisticated techniques to detect the origins
of illicit substances from the raw material stage and to identify the
various methods used to process and transport them.</P>
      <P>They said that the United States has been using these methods for
over 25 years, noting that DEA has determined that a majority of
illegal drugs coming into that country come from four major regions,
namely Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle and areas of southern China,
Turkey and Afghanistan in West Asia, Mexico and South America.</P>
      <P>They noted that US anti-drug authorities have relied heavily on
laboratory analysis to identify international drug rings operating
behind drug traffickers around the United States.</P>
      <P>The officials said the DRC is aware that many drugs circulating
in Taiwan come from Thailand, Hong Kong and Vietnam, and that the
main processing centers for the narcotics are located on the Chinese
mainland and in the Golden Triangle. However, at present they are
unclear about the origin of drugs coming from other regions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's per capita
gross national product (GNP), averaging US$750 in 1996, was less than
one-seventeenth that of Taiwan, which stood at US$12,838 in the same
year, a report from the World Bank shows.</P>
      <P>With the US$750 per capita GNP level, the mainland was listed
among the world's 53 low-income economies, even though it was the
seventh largest economy on the globe in 1996, with a total GNP of
US$906.1 billion, according to the latest World Bank Atlas.</P>
      <P>The per capita GNP figures, published in the World Bank Atlas
every spring, are an important index revealing the individual wealth
enjoyed by people in various nations.</P>
      <P>According to the Atlas, mainland China's 1996 per capita GNP of

    <HEADLINE>FORD PLANS ASIA-PACIFIC PARTS SUPPLY CENTER IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ford Motor Corp. of the United States
plans to set up an Asia-Pacific distribution and resourcing center in
Taiwan, the China Times reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD), confirmed that the world's second largest
automaker has such an investment plan, but added that several East
Asian countries are also wooing Ford and its multibillion-dollar
investment project.</P>
      <P>Ford's Taiwan affiliate, Ford Lio Ho Motor Co., however, would
not confirm the existence of the project, saying it has no comment on
the China Times report at the moment.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Ronald Goldsberry, a Ford vice chairman
in charge of the service department, visited Taipei last week to
explore the feasibility of establishing a resourcing and distribution
center on the island.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Goldsberry was said to have met with Schive to
discuss technical details related to the proposed investment project.
He reportedly also held wide-ranging talks with chief executive
officers of Citibank and the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei
to with a view to better understand the general market situation
here.</P>
      <P>The report further said Ford is scheduled to call a board meeting
in the near future to make a final decision on the project. Thailand
is said to have offered very attractive incentives aimed at luring
Ford to set up its new regional resourcing and distribution center on
its soil.</P>
      <P>Schive said Ford's new investment project complies with the basic
concepts of Taiwan's much-touted Asia-Pacific regional operations
center development plan. "We therefore will do our utmost to talk
Ford into choosing Taiwan as its new investment destination."</P>
      <P>According to Ford's plan, it will pour at least NT$10 billion
(US$303 million) for setting up an auto parts resourcing and
distribution center at a suitable place in East Asia, with mainland
China as its main service target.</P>
      <P>If Ford ultimately decides to locate its resourcing center in
Taiwan, it will use the island as its auto parts and components
purchase, assembling and distribution center. Some components from
the United States or Europe will also be assembled in Taiwan into
large parts packages.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, if the project proceeds smoothly, Ford may upgrade the
resourcing center into its Asia-Pacific auto maintenance and parts
supply center.</P>
      <P>CEPD sources said the Ford project is expected to help boost the
development of the domestic auto parts center-satellite supply system
and related service industries, such as merchandise distribution and
shipping.</P>
      <P>Although Ford's initial capital investment will be only about
NT$10 billion, the sources said, the project is expected to bring
about NT$50 billion to NT$100 billion in peripheral effects to Taiwan
annually.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Taichung Harbor, Kaohsiung Harbor and Changpin coastal
industrial zone are among the likely sites. As Germany's chemical
giant Bayer was recently forced to abandon a long-planned investment
project at Taichung Harbor because of strong opposition from the
Taichung County Government, CEPD sources said Ford may exclude
Taichung Harbor from its target list to avoid any unnecessary
political interference.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said they are confident Taiwan can beat out
Thailand in winning Ford's new investment project by virtue of its
solid economic fundamentals, favorable geographical location, modern
shipping and port facilities, a 500,000-unit domestic auto market and
a robust auto parts industry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's auto parts production reached NT$150 billion (US$4.55
billion) in 1997, second only to Japan's in terms of both quality and
scale, the officials said, adding that Taiwan's auto parts maker has
another competitive edge: the ability to produce diverse types of
parts in small quantity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's main disadvantage lies in uncertain relations across the
Taiwan Strait, but the CEPD officials said they have assured Ford
that ties with mainland China will improve rather than worsen in the
years ahead.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,    April   19   (CNA)
(By M.C. Chou and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese pro-democracy
organizations based in Europe on Sunday issued a joint statement
welcoming the release of Wang Dan, one of the most prominent
dissidents in mainland China, earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The statement, co-issued by the Chinese Alliance for Democracy
and the Alliance for a Democratic China, hailed Wang's character,
farsighted vision and academic achievements. It also praised him as a
role model and the most representative figure among the younger
generation of the mainland Chinese democracy movement.</P>
      <P>It lauded Wang's long-term efforts in advocating democracy on
campus while studying in Beijing University, attributing that as a
prelude to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, in which Wang played a
key role in the student-led movement for greater democracy in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The statement charged that Beijing's recent expulsion of
dissidents into overseas exile is part of a plot to crush the
pro-democracy movement in mainland China. It urged mainland democracy
activists living abroad to cherish their past efforts and to unite
together for a better future in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng, another leading mainland Chinese dissident, was
released on medical parole to the United States by Beijing last year.</P>
      <P>Wang, 29, was arrested in July 1989 and sentenced to a four-year
jail term following the military crackdown on June 4 of that year
against the Tiananmen protesters. The assault resulted in heavy loss
of life and scores of injuries to the unarmed student demonstrators.
He was detained again in October 1996, and sentenced to 11 years in
prison on a charge of "counterrevolutionary activity."</P>
      <P>Wang was freed by Beijing on medical parole on Sunday, and was
put on a direct flight for Detroit, where he is currently undergoing
a series of medical checks at the Henry Ford Hospital.</P>
      <P>Wang is said by his family to have suffered from chronic
headaches, long-term inflammation of the throat and a possible brain
tumor.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of Taiwan's Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), flew to Manila on
Monday morning to discuss a plan to provide guarantees for government
bonds issued in economically battered Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Chiang, Taiwan's top economic planner, was accompanied by Jeffrey
Koo, a Taipei-based business magnate and chairman of the Financial
Crisis Task Force of the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC).</P>
      <P>Chiang and Koo will exchange views with officials from the
Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ABD) to drum up support for a
Taiwan-led initiative that would enable struggling Asian economies to
issue the US dollar-denominated bonds for sale in member nations of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Funds raised by
the issues would be used to repay short-term foreign debts or to
finance major development projects.</P>
      <P>The visit to ADB headquarters comes as a concrete move to
implement four resolutions recently passed by the ABAC Financial
Crisis Task Force, according to Koo.</P>
      <P>One of the resolutions called on ADB members which have been less
affected by the Asian financial turmoil, such as the United States,
Hong Kong and Japan, to jointly provide guarantees for financially
battered Asian countries in issuing government bonds to help
revitalize their economies.</P>
      <P>Other resolutions made by the ABAC task force included the
founding of a regionwide financial forum, working out a multilateral
formula for negotiating financial rescue packages, and devising
methods to help hard-hit economies tide over the financial storm that
has swept the region since July last year.</P>
      <P>Both ROC President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Vincent Siew recently
proposed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait co-sponsor meetings
with Southeast Asian officials to discuss concerted efforts for
halting the regional financial meltdown. Those proposals have touched
off heated debates among politicians and economists at home and
abroad.</P>
      <P>Shea Jia-dong, deputy governor of the Central Bank of China,
recently led an ROC mission to the United States to drum up support
for Taiwan's initiative to have Asia's healthier economies underwrite
government-bonds issued in cash-strapped neighboring countries.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui reaffirmed the
necessity of the Republic of China government's "no hurry, be
patient" policy toward Taiwan investment on the mainland when he met
with a group of visiting Japanese lawmakers on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee said the policy does not aim to restrict investment in the
mainland. Rather, the government is asking Taiwan businessmen who
want to invest more than US$50 million in the mainland to exercise
greater caution and to follow relevant regulations, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the policy of caution is aimed at protecting
the interests of Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>The president also said that Taiwan has emerged intact from
financial crisis which swept through Asia beginning in mid-1997. He
attributed steady growth witnessed in the wake of the storm to
Taiwan's sound economic structure.</P>
      <P>Lee added that the ROC is willing to help other Asian nations
solve their financial problems.</P>
      <P>The four Japanese dietmen who called on the president -- Kamei
Shizuka, Hiranuma Takeo, Aso Taro and Eto Sheishiro -- are all
members of the Liberal Democratic Party. They were accompanied by Lin
Chin-ching, chairman of the Taipei-based Association of East Asian
Relations, and ROC Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Tzu-dan.</P>
      <P>The visitors lauded the economic development achieved in Taiwan
under Lee's leadership.</P>
      <P>The ROC president expressed appreciation for their support,
saying that although there are no formal relations between Taiwan and
Japan, civilian exchanges have been close. He expressed hope that the
lawmakers' visit would help promote cooperation between the two
neighbors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO CONTINUE PROTEST AGAINST ADB NAME CHANGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) on Monday
reiterated the Republic of China's opposition to a change of its
membership designation in the Asian Development Bank (ADB), saying it
will continue to protest the unilateral action.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said Taiwan delegates to the 1998 ADB annual
meeting, slated for April 30-May 2 in Geneva, Switzerland, will stage
a protest again this year against the ADB's alteration of the ROC
membership designation in 1986.</P>
      <P>The officials, however, did not elaborate on how the protest will
be presented during the ADB meeting, saying only that the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will be responsible for organizing the action.</P>
      <P>The ADB changed the ROC's designation to "Taipei, China" after
mainland China was admitted to that body in 1986.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a founding member of the regional financial
organization, rejected the change and has since taken part in ADB
meetings under protest.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said the name change is particularly unacceptable
as Hong Kong will take part in the upcoming ADB meeting as "Hong
Kong, China." This development can be equated to a downgrading of the
ROC to a status similar to that of Hong Kong, which since July 1,
1997, has been a special administration region of mainland China, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Taiwan delegates have voiced complaints against
perceived unfairness in the name change during speeches at ADB
meetings.</P>
      <P>Discounting rumors that Taipei plans to use offers of cash aid to
financially battered Asian economies as a bargaining chip to win back
its formal name in the ADB, CBC officials said financial aid and
membership designation are two completely different issues.</P>
      <P>Newly appointed CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan will lead a 15-member
Taiwan delegation to the upcoming ADB meeting. Perng filled a vacancy
left by Sheu Yuan-dong in March after Sheu was killed in an air
crash.</P>

      <P>Organizations founded by pro-democracy
overseas Chinese congratulated mainland China on its release of
prominent dissident Wang Dan, but warned on Sunday against Beijing's
intrigue.</P>
      <P>The Alliance for a Democratic China and the Democratic China
Front, two active organizations founded by pro-democracy overseas
Chinese, proclaimed that the release of dissidents Wei Jingsheng and
Wang Dan and their departure from the mainland shows that Beijing has
obviously been following the former Soviet Union's policy for dealing
with dissidents -- releasing them into exile in foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The two organizations called for the upholding of the democratic
momentum which has been built up over the decades by numerous Chinese
people who have been willing to sacrifice themselves to uphold the
basic ideals of freedom and democracy, and warned against intrigues
by the authorities in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Alliance for a Democratic China and the Democratic China

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said on
Monday the "red tide" pollution which has devastated Hong Kong
fisheries is unlikely to occur in Taiwan waters.</P>
      <P>COA officials stressed that no cases involving the red tide have
been reported in Taiwan to date, although neighboring Hong Kong has
experienced the worst onslaught of the phenomenon in years, suffering
a severe blow to its fishing industry.</P>
      <P>The officials said, however, that to prevent similar a situation
from occurring here, they would step up water quality control in the
local aquacultural industry and heighten scrutiny of imported marine
products.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the red tide, which induces a buildup of
microscopic plankton that gives a reddish tinge to the water and
deprives affected areas of oxygen, occurs in closed or half-closed
bodies of water or in bay areas such as those around Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>They said strong currents flow around Taiwan and noted the island
has never had reports of red tide pollution, adding the chances of
that occurrence are slim.</P>
      <P>Although red tide will not pose a direct threat to Taiwan, the
COA officials said that they will be on guard against possible
pollution. They called on customs authorities to be alert for
smuggled seafood items from Hong Kong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISSIDENT'S RELEASE LINKED TO CLINTON-JIANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 19 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US ambassador to mainland China
James Lilley said on Sunday that Beijing's decision to release jailed
dissident Wang Dan is closely linked to the upcoming summit between
US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>As the Clinton-Jiang meeting, slated for late June, is only eight
weeks away, Lilley said, Wang's release on Sunday is obviously linked
to Beijing's efforts to increase engagement with the United States.
The Chinese communist regime is very aware that dissidents forced to
live in exile abroad are eventually forgotten, thus arousing fewer
repercussions from the international community.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wang, Beijing has released several other prominent
political dissidents over the past few years, including Wei
Jingsheng, Dai Qing and Fang Lizhi.</P>
      <P>The China expert was quoted by the Washington Post in a
Beijing-datelined story on Sunday as saying that although the
pro-democracy movement has spread from the campus to the state-run
business sector in mainland China, it is still too dramatic to say
that the Clinton administration's engagement with Beijing has been
effective.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi, a top US lawmaker from California and a
strong critic of the mainland's human rights record, issued a
statement on Sunday welcoming Wang Dan's release, but warning: "We
must remember that the Chinese regime's actions have nothing to do
with democratic reform."</P>
      <P>If Beijing wishes to be viewed as freeing its political
prisoners, the dissidents should be allowed to stay in mainland China
and speak freely about political reform at home, Pelosi said in the
statement.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker also urged Clinton to take advantage of his planned
visit to mainland China in June, to "pursue the release of the
countless political prisoners who remain in jail."</P>

      <P>A group of mainland Chinese media chief
executive officers met with Shi Hwei-yow, one of Taiwan's leading
negotiators with Beijing, on Monday.</P>
      <P>Shi, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), extended his hearty welcome to the mainland
news media delegation, saying its visit is yet another sign of a thaw
in stalled relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two sides had reached a consensus on the
strengthening of cross-strait news exchanges during the first
"Koo-Wang" meeting held in Singapore in April 1993, Shi said he hopes
news exchanges will be included in the agenda for future cross-strait
talks.</P>
      <P>Shi also expressed the hope that Beijing will seriously consider
the possibility of allowing Taiwan's news organizations to set up
representative offices and post resident journalists on the mainland,
as well as the reinforcement of cross-strait news verification
services.</P>
      <P>"News verification can help avoid unnecessary cross-strait
misunderstandings or adverse impacts on normal economic activities on
both sides," Shi noted.</P>
      <P>For his part, Xie Hung, leader of the visiting media delegation,
said mainland China also looks forward to increasing news exchanges
and cooperation with Taiwan. "We hope Taipei's SEF and Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan (ARATS) will work hand in
hand to accomplish their lofty mission of promoting cross-strait
exchanges and cooperation in various fields, including journalistic
affairs."</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semiofficial bodies authorized by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties. SEF Chairman C.F. Koo and ARATS Chairman
Wang Daohan held a historic meeting in 1993, also known as the first
"Koo-Wang" meeting, to lay a framework for regular cross-strait
dialogue and exchanges.</P>
      <P>Beijing, however, unilaterally suspended contacts in mid-1995 to
vent its anger at a visit to the United States by ROC President Lee
Teng-hui, which it regarded as a veiled move to promote Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>After a nearly-three-year stall, Beijing has finally agreed to
resume SEF-ARATS contacts. The SEF's new deputy secretary-general,
Jan Jyh-horng, is scheduled to visit Beijing on April 22-24 in a bid
to end the impasse in bilateral talks. Jan concurrently serves as the
planning department director in the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, which charts Taiwan's mainland policy. Observers have said
the arrangement suggests that Taiwan has ended a ban on official
contacts with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that mainland China may restrict the number
of Taiwan journalists allowed to cover Jan's upcoming mainland visit,
Xie said the reports may not be true as such a move would violate the
fundamental principle of encouraging cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>In fact, cross-strait news exchanges have been unbalanced. Over
the past few years, Taiwan journalists have made thousands of visits
to the mainland for news coverage, while only about 100 mainland
reporters have come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Xie and 15 other mainland media executives, who arrived in Taipei
last Friday for a nine-day visit, are the most senior media
personalties to visit Taiwan since mid-1995. The group paid a visit
to CNA Monday afternoon.</P>

      <P>Several major airports in the United

during check-in.</P>
      <P>The new system, designed by the US company Vivid Technologies, is

      <P>The system was one of several on display at the fourth Asia

      <P>Hurd said that the system captures the image of any suspicious

the screening officer, who can then start looking for other bomb
components such as trigger mechanisms, fuses or wires.</P>
      <P>The new system, which can screen up to 1,500 bags per hour, will

      <P>Taiwan has in the past had its own problems with dissident
blacklists, Shi pointed out, adding however that after a decade of
political democratization and economic reform, those problems have
all faded into the mists of history.</P>
      <P>The high-ranking SEF official remarked that Taiwan's political
and economic development should be worthy of reference by the Beijing
authorities, warning that if mainland China's economic reforms are
not matched by political reforms, there will be little room for the
economic reforms to develop.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN DEBT TO RISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's gross foreign debt is
expected to jump by 45 percent to US$316 billion by fiscal 2001-02
from the current US$219 billion, according to Canberra's Access
Economics.</P>
      <P>In a five-year forecast released on Sunday night, Access
Economics warns: "Australia faces its most hostile environment in
over a decade, with calendar 1999 looming as a particularly dangerous
time for business because its domestic demand for imports is on the
rise and its exports to Asia are falling."</P>
      <P>The forecasting body said: "Given the possibility that drought
may decimate the next wheat crop at the end of 1998, the current
account may be back in the Banana Republic range by late 1998 or
early 1999."</P>
      <P>However, good news is that Australia's unemployment rate is
expected to drop by about 7 percent early in 1999 from the current
rate of 8.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Access Economics predicted that Australia's gross domestic
product will rise by 3.5 percent in fiscal 1998-99, up from 3.25
percent as targeted by the government, but the group added that GDP
growth will slow to 2.4 percent in 1999-2000.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The impact of the "millennium bug" will
be as large as the Asian financial crisis and is shaping up to have a
profoundly negative effect on the US economy.</P>
      <P>In a special report, The Australian Financial Review reported the
bug could cut half a percentage point off growth in 2000 and early
2001 in the US economy. This would be the same as the expected
economic damage from the current Asian financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>"The millennium bug will certainly hurt the economy and it could
be a real killer if more of the problems are not fixed," said DRI
chief economist David Wyss.</P>
      <P>All told, the bug could cost the US about US$119 billion in lost
economic output between now and 2001, he said.</P>
      <P>Some analysts even worry that the bug could send the US economy
into a recession.</P>
      <P>But much of Asia is distracted by its economic crisis and
dangerously unprepared for the computer bug, they said.</P>
      <P>However, the impact on the Asian region may be softened by its
relatively low reliance on computers, they added.</P>
      <P>In Australia, the specter of the computer bug meltdown has
prompted civil defense authorities to prepare for a national
emergency while the business world ponders how to work around a
breakdown in essential services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO HOPEFULS REGISTER TO RUN FOR DPP CHAIRMANSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The race for the chairmanship of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) shifted into high gear
on Monday, with two hopefuls completing their registrations as
candidates.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yen Chin-fu, representing the Taipei-South
constituency, registered first, followed shortly afterward by DPP
chief adviser Lin Yi-hsiung, accompanied by incumbent DPP Chairman
Hsu Hsin-liang.</P>
      <P>Yen said self-assurance and a strong sense of mission prompted
him to enter the chairmanship race. "If I'm elected, I'll push for
internal DPP reforms and I'll also do my utmost to lead the party to
power," the outspoken lawmaker said confidently.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lin issued an open letter to all DPP members,
expressing his concern about intraparty squabbling over alleged
irregularities related to party primaries for the year-end elections
for the Legislative Yuan, the Taipei and Kaohsiung city councils and
the mayorships of the two cities.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if he succeeds in winning the DPP chairmanship, he
will convene a seminar on the party's rejuvenation. "I hope to foster
intraparty consensus on reform programs through open debate," he
stressed, adding that his priorities will include recruiting new
members and adjusting the party's structure and membership quality.
"Under my leadership, the DPP will project a new image and take on
the challenges of the three year-end elections with innovative
strategies and tactics."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, incumbent DPP Chairman Hsu said he
earnestly hopes the various party factions will refrain from
interfering with the chairmanship election.</P>
      <P>"I myself will stay away from the race. I hope all factional
leaders and heavyweights will follow suit. Let us make the
chairmanship election a gentlemen's race and let our party members
vote as they please," Hsu urged.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time the DPP chairman is elected directly
by the party members, who are estimated to number slightly more than
80,000.</P>
      <P>The registration period will last for five days, and before the
voting takes place on May 24, the DPP headquarters is expected to
hold three rounds of televised debates for all the candidates.</P>
      <P>A third likely candidate, Legislator-at-large Chang Chun-hung,
didn't show up as expected to register. Chang, a former DPP
secretary-general and prominent member of incumbent Chairman Hsu's
dominant "Formosa" faction, is widely considered to be Lin's
strongest opponent if he decides to run.</P>
      <P>But Chang said on Sunday that he is still soliciting opinions
from leading party figures before deciding whether to throw his hat
into the ring. One of his close friends said on Monday that he will
make his decision before the April 24 deadline for registration.</P>
      <P>Some senior DPP members have advised Chang not to enter the race
as they hope to see Lin win the chairmanship. "They hope Lin's high
moral stature and clean image will facilitate the streamlining of
party discipline and promotion of intraparty unity and harmony," a
DPP official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said on Monday that it will continue
with plans to develop the parcel of land leased by the Germany-based
Bayer Group near Taichung Harbor in central Taichung County.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Schive Chi clarified that Bayer has only
terminated its first-phase development project for the site --
establishing a toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) plant -- and that the
company might still put the lot to some other use.</P>
      <P>Schive said the CEPD would welcome Bayer or any other company
wishing to set up a stronghold on the land, as long as their
investment projects fall in line with the government's Asia-Pacific
business operation hub plan. He added that the CEPD is willing to
help with the development of the lot, which is owned by the Taiwan
Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>The Bayer Group announced in December that it was relocating its
proposed TDI plant to Bay City in Texas, the United States, after the
then newly elected Taichung County Magistrate Liao Yung-lai insisted
on holding a public referendum to decide the fate of the project in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Schive pointed out that the contract by the German chemical
giant to lease the land has been referred to the Executive Yuan for
final approval, since the central government has not received formal
notification from Bayer canceling the project. The Bayer contract
passed the Taiwan Provincial Assembly in February.</P>
      <P>If Bayer plans to set up another type of facility on the land, it
will have to conduct a new assessment of the environmental impact of
any such facility, the CEPD vice chairman added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis has so far
cost about 17,000 jobs in Australia in the past several months and
the country is now bracing for the worst, with more job and business
losses expected in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Council of Australia (TCA) revised its earlier target
of foreign tourist arrivals with a 5 percent decline, which a TCA
spokesman said will cost more than US$530 million in revenue losses
and the loss of 40,000 jobs in Australia.</P>
      <P>The losses will be felt by many businesses, including duty-free
retailers, tour operators, hotels and restaurants, thanks to a
decline in tourist arrivals from South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia,
Taiwan, and Malaysia, and slow growth from Japan, the Philippines and
New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Between October and December 1997, Thailand led other Asian
countries in the decline of tourist visitors to Australia, with a
drop of about 45 percent, followed by Korea, at 26 percent,
Indonesia, at 22 percent, Taiwan, at 10 percent, and Malaysia, at 6.5

      <P>Singapore's retail sales, excluding
cars, plunged 17.1 percent in February over the same month last year,
thquitquitquitquitquit-year fall since the regional financial turmoil
began last July.</P>
      <P>The retail sales index, measured at current prices, dived by a
hefty 30.2 percent compared with January due to lower spending after
Chinese New Year and Hari Raya and the shorter month of February, the
Singapore Department of Statistics said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The year-on-year fall in retail spending in February was due in
part to a higher base a year ago.</P>
      <P>The two festivals were celebrated in February last year but in
late January this year.</P>
      <P>In January this year, "everybody had spent whatever they needed
during Chinese New Year and Hari Raya. And with the economy being so
bad, they did not spend much after that," explained a department
store retailer.</P>
      <P>"And in past years, we have had Indonesians coming here to shop
during the Hari Raya holidays. This year they didn't," the retailer
added.</P>
      <P>The overall retail sales index, including motor vehicles, fell by
a smaller 9.7 percent in February from a year earlier as car sales
surged 45 percent over the period. This represented the sixth
consecutive drop in the index since September last year.</P>
      <P>However, the index slumped 32.6 percent in February from the
preceding month as car sales shrank 41.3 percent, according to data
released by the Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>This was a sharp turnabout from the robust 66.2 percent growth in
car sales in January from December.</P>
      <P>Total retail sales were valued at an estimated S$1.55 billion
(about US$1 billion) in February compared to January's figure of
S$2.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Analyzing on a year-on-year basis, shops selling textiles,
clothes and "personal effects" suffered the biggest fall in sales at
32.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Next were department stores and supermarkets, where cash
registers rang in 20.5 percent less business.</P>
      <P>Business at general provisions shops also fell 19.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Furniture and household equipment stores experienced a 6.7

in sales.</P>
      <P>The catering trade index at current prices posted a 5.3 percent

undergraduate students have traveled abroad at least once.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that 61.5 percent of the respondents

them off the island.</P>
      <P>The most favored travel destinations are the United States,
Canada, Japan and Europe in that order, according to the survey
which was conducted by the Journalism Department of National Chengchi
University on March 23-26.</P>
      <P>A total of 84 percent of those surveyed said they look forward
to making sightseeing trips to the US, Europe, Japan, New Zealand and
Australia, while less than 10 percent said they want to journey
to mainland China or Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>About 60 percent of those who yearn for an overseas
leisure trip cited increasing experience and expanding mental
horizons as their main motivations; 14 percent said they hope to
enhance their proficiency in foreign languages; and 10 percent said
they want to go abroad mainly because they had already traveled to
all domestic sightseeing spots.</P>
      <P>As many as 56 percent said they hope the traditional
pre-graduation jaunt will be longer than a week, and 63 percent said
the reasonable expense for such a trip is about NT$30,000
(US$909.09). Forty-three percent said they will ask their parents to
finance their pre-graduation jaunts, while 28 percent said they will
moonlight to earn needed funds.</P>
      <P>Despite a spate of air disasters reported here in recent months,
only 4 percent said they would not take overseas trips because
of worry about flight safety. In contrast, more than 60 percent
said a lack of funds is the biggest obstacle to their overseas
travel plans.</P>
      <P>In case they are required to take pre-commencement jaunts at
home, nearly all respondents favor a round-the-island journey.
Eastern Taiwan and Penghu, an island group off southwestern
Taiwan coast, are among the most popular domestic tourist
destinations, according to the survey results.</P>

      <P>Taipei City Legislator Yeh Chu-lan of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party on Monday asked the Council
of Agriculture (COA) under the Executive Yuan to help preserve the
area in Meinung, Pingtung County, known as the "Green Valley of
Yellow Butterflies."</P>
      <P>Yeh made the request at the Legislative Yuan during a review of
the COA's budget. She told COA Chairman Peng Chuo-kui that the COA
should voice opposition to the building of a dam in Meinung because
of the need for soil conservation and for the preservation of the
ecology there.</P>
      <P>The proposed dam would flood the valley and destroy the
world-class butterfly reservation, Yeh said, adding that this would
make the government "the laughingstock of the international

      <P>In his reply, Peng said that the COA voices its opinion on
development projects affecting the environment, and that in the case
of the Meinung reservoir construction project, the COA will express
its view in its assessment of the impact the dam would have on soil
conservation and the ecology of the region.</P>
      <P>To help solve the problem of water usage in southern Taiwan, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs decided to revive the long-shelved

Science-based Industrial Park are expected to have no water supply

      <P>Taiwan's total gross national product
(GNP) was the 19th largest in the world for the third consecutive
year in 1996, while its per capita GNP during the same period was the
world's 23rd highest, up three notches from the last evaluation,
according to figures from the World Bank.</P>
      <P>The soon-to-be-issued latest edition of the World Bank Atlas
shows that the world's top 10 economies for 1996 were the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy, mainland China,
Brazil, Canada and Spain.</P>
      <P>The 11th to 20th positions were taken by South Korea, the
Netherlands, Australia, India, Russia, Mexico, Switzerland,
Argentina, Belgium and Sweden, in that order.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not listed in the World Bank's atlas since the island
is not a member of the international financial organization. But
according to statistics released by the Republic of China's
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan's
total GNP for 1996 reached US$274.6 billion, which should make it
stand between Argentina and Belgium, making it 19th in the world.
Meanwhile, Taiwan's per capita GNP of US$12,838 during the same
period should give the island the 23rd position globally in this
area.</P>
      <P>The top 10 economies in terms of per capita GNP in 1996 were
Switzerland, Japan, Norway, Denmark, Singapore, Germany, Austria, the
United States, Belgium and France.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's per capita GNP was Asia's fourth highest in 1996, after
only Japan, which was No. 2 in the world; Singapore, No. 5; and Hong

in Asia, behind Japan, which was No. 2 in the world; mainland China,
No. 7; South Korea, No. 11; and Indonesia, No. 14.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been ranked as one of the world's high-income
economies since 1991, when its per capita GNP hit US$9,636. Ever
since then, the ranking of Taiwan's per capita GNP has been on the
rise, with Taiwan's position moving up from 28th in 1994 to 26th in
1995, and then to 23rd in 1996.</P>
      <P>If the "Chinese Economic Sphere" -- comprising Taiwan, mainland
China and Hong Kong -- were taken together, it would constitute the
world's fifth largest economy, with a combined GNP of US$1.33
trillion that would trail only the United States, Japan, Germany and
France.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China was listed as having the world's seventh
largest economy, its per capita GNP of US$750 is less than
one-seventeenth of Taiwan's. The mainland was listed among the
world's 53 low-income economies, which have per capita GNPs lower
than US$785.</P>
      <P>The lowest-income country was Mozambique, whose per capita GNP
stood at only US$80.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The president of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), Mitsuo Sato, has expressed his support for Taiwan's
proposed program to bail Malaysia out of its financial troubles.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, revealed Sato's support for the plan in Taipei on Monday
after returning from a visit to the ADB's headquarters in Manila, the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Together with Jeffrey Koo -- the head of the crisis task force
under the business sector arm of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, the APEC Business Advisory Council --
Chiang called on Sato Monday morning. They discussed Taipei's
expressed willingness to help economically troubled Southeast Asian
countries issue government bonds.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he believes the plan will help those countries free
themselves as quickly as possible from their difficult economic
situations caused by the regional financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that while showing support for the proposal, Sato
also said that Malaysia is the Southeast Asian country now most badly
in need of aid, and that the ADB will offer it guarantee services,
based on the model used in Thailand, so Kuala Lumpur can release
government bonds.</P>
      <P>The ADB has endorsed over US$600 billion of the government bonds
Bangkok has released since the outbreak of the financial storm last
July.</P>
      <P>Demand for these guaranteed bonds has been larger than the supply
since their release.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the market's response, Sato expressed the hope that
a mechanism that can help Southeast Asian countries issue government
bonds to collect money for economic recovery will be established,
Chiang mentioned.</P>
      <P>He revealed that the ADB will discuss the matter with Koo, who
has been asked to submit a report on the planned mechanism during the
upcoming APEC ministerial meeting on finance on May 22.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Monday received
Grenada Foreign Minister Dr. Raphael Fletcher and expressed his
gratitude to Grenada for the strong support it has shown for the
Republic of China in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Francisco L.Y. Hwang, director of the Ministry of

Fletcher, who also serves as chairman of Grenada's ruling New
National Party, paid a courtesy call on the premier at his office.</P>
      <P>Siew told his guest that the frequent exchange of visits by
high-ranking officials and the realization of a series of cooperative
projects between the two countries indicate that bilateral relations
and the ROC-Grenada friendship have become closer and firmer.</P>
      <P>When asked about Taiwan's development experiences, Siew said he
believes that the island's experience in the fields of agricultural
processing, fishing and animal husbandry, as well as in tourism
promotion, could be conducive to Grenada's overall economic
development.</P>
      <P>Siew also told Fletcher -- who is in charge of foreign affairs,
judicial affairs and domestic affairs in Grenada Premier Keith
Mitchell's Cabinet -- that education has played an important role in
Taiwan's development, noting that the island is densely populated and
its land area and resources are limited.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that education has long been one of the ROC

this field could serve as a reference for Grenada.</P>

      <P>Taiwan received export orders worth
US$10.19 billion in March, down 2.74 percent from the same period
last year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said the March figures pushed Taiwan's total first
quarter export orders to US$28.27 billion. They added that orders
from Asian countries have dropped by nearly 17 percent during the
period from the first quarter of 1997, as a result of financial
turmoil affecting the region.</P>
      <P>With shrinking export orders, the officials said the rate of
Taiwan's overall economic growth this year will depend mainly on
demand in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>They noted that fallout from the Asian financial crisis has
lowered manufacturing sector growth to 5 percent in the first quarter
of 1998, down from 9.36 percent in the previous quarter. But compared
with the decline witnessed in South Korea, Taiwan's manufacturing is
still sound, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials said that several uncertainty factors lie
ahead, including possible currency fluctuations in Asia, which they
said could affect the export orders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO MAINTAIN BID FOR SUBMARINE PURCHASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC government will not withdraw a bid
to acquire advanced submarines for beefing up its naval defense
capabilities, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) reaffirmed on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the statement after an American defense news
weekly reported that the United States will continue to reject
Taiwan's requests for the purchase of conventional submarines, but
will consider selling advanced anti-submarine arsenals to the island.</P>
      <P>The ministry declined to directly respond to the reports, saying
it is the military's policy to avoid comment on media coverage
relating to arms deals.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the ministry stressed that the Republic of China
needs submarines to enhance its defense capabilities in the face of
mounting military threat from rival mainland China.</P>
      <P>The MND further said the cost for deploying anti-submarine
weaponry systems is usually more than tenfold the price of a
submarine.</P>
      <P>An ROC military delegation, headed by Deputy Chief of the General
Staff Lee Chieh, is currently in Washington, D.C., to attend an
annual arms procurement meeting with American military brass.</P>
      <P>Quoting Pentagon sources, the US Defense News weekly reported in
its latest issue that the Clinton administration is considering
selling to Taiwan sophisticated anti-submarine helicopters and radar
systems, including Apache attack helicopters for coastal defense and
the Aegis radar system now in service with the US Navy for long-haul
monitoring of submarine activities. The Aegis radar system can be
installed on Taiwan's Noxas-, Perry- and Lafayette-class frigates to
upgrade their anti-submarine capabilities.</P>
      <P>The Defense News further said the United States may also agree to
sell P-3 Orion anti-submarine aircraft to Taiwan. But the weekly
added that Taiwan has yet to broach such a purchase request.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it quoted unnamed US government sources as reporting
that the Clinton administration will continue to ban sales of
diesel-powered submarines to Taiwan. The United States is also
unlikely to allow its shipyards to arm a foreign-built submarine for
sale to Taiwan, the weekly said, adding there are no plans at present
to sell high-performance AIM-120 medium-range air-to-air missiles and
the advanced versions of Maverick air-to-surface missiles to Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Navy General Headquarters (NGH) on
Tuesday defended the anti-submarine capabilities of its newly
acquired Lafayette-class frigates, saying their equipment is among
the world's most advanced.</P>
      <P>The NGH was commenting on a newspaper report which questioned the
Lafayette frigates' combat capabilities. The report claimed that the
French-built warship is not equipped with torpedo detectors and that
its sonar system can only monitor movements of old-fashioned
five-propeller submarines.</P>
      <P>In response, the NGH said the Lafayette-class frigates are armed
with state-of-the-art torpedo monitoring and warning systems which
can effectively detect various types of surface and underwater
vessels, including both nuclear-powered and conventional submarines.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the NGH said, anti-submarine warfare calls for
three-dimensional combat strategy and tactics. It requires
oceanographic, seabed geologic and hydrological knowledge, and
success in anti-submarine warfare hinges on a number of key elements,
including manpower, equipment, experience and the establishment of a
sound-sampling databank.</P>
      <P>The NGH further said the highly sophisticated sonar system
installed on the Lafayette frigates can accurately detect the
positioning of an incoming torpedo based on the noise emitted from
its propellers.</P>
      <P>Noting that soundwave databanks play a crucial role in
anti-submarine warfare, the NGH said all countries classify such
assets as top secret and do not share the information. "Following
years of efforts, the ROC Navy has managed to establish a large
sound-sampling databank," the NGH said, adding that Taiwan residents
should not doubt the Navy's defense capabilities, including its
anti-submarine capacity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan struck a US$2.8 billion deal with France in 1992 for the
purchase of six Lafayette-class frigates as part of its 10-year
military modernization plan. The frigates, also reputed as "stealth"
warships for their special hull design and ability to evade radar
detection, have all been commissioned into service in the ROC Navy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Dan, the 29-year-old mainland
Chinese dissident who has just been exiled to the United States on
medical parole, said that he only consented to this arrangement for
his parents' health and their peace of mind.</P>
      <P>Wang, a leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement,
made the remark in an exclusive interview published in the Hong
Kong-based Oriental Daily News on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that during his days in the Jinzhou Municipal Prison,
Liaoning Province, his parents had to travel over land and water from
the faraway capital of Beijing to visit him, which he said made him
worry about their safety and health. In order to get rid of this
pressure, according the daily, Wang succumbed to the harsh reality
and wrote to the mainland Ministry of Justice, asking to be
transferred to a prison in Beijing. He then prepared for being exiled
"on medical parole."</P>
      <P>"Each time I saw my parents travel so far to visit me, I felt so
sorry for them," said Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang said he hopes his mother will get a visa to meet him in the
United States in two months.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his eight years in prison, Wang said that reading a
lot helped broaden his horizons and enrich his knowledge and so was
what he treasured most during those years.</P>
      <P>Wang was one of the leaders of the 1989 student movement in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square. After he was imprisoned, it was reported
that he refused to accept medical parole to leave mainland China. The
fact that this ended up being how he left mainland China had sparked
much speculation in Hong Kong's media about the real reasons behind
his departure.</P>

Taiwan 16th in the world in terms of national competitiveness,
surpassing Japan's 18th ranking for the first time.</P>
      <P>Chiang said although the showing reflects well on Taiwan's

continuing slump in Japan, which has long been the locomotive of
regional development, will have a profound spillover effect on
Taiwan's economic and trade performance.</P>
      <P>Noting that Tokyo has unveiled a series of economic stimulus
measures, including an unprecedented 16 trillion yen (US$120 billion)
incentive package earlier this month, Chiang said the effects remain
to be seen. He noted that some Japanese lawmakers have said the
government's remedies have come too late.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with an eye on Tokyo's actions, the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) will map out a plan by the end of the month to
promote trade opportunities for Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said money earmarked for public-sector spending
under the measures announced in Japan can prove lucrative for
Taiwan's telecommunications, communications and environmental
protection industries, while a tax cut plan under that package will
increase the Japanese public's purchasing power for Taiwan-made
consumer goods, they added.</P>

Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to Beijing later this
month and for President Bill Clinton's summit meeting with mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in June.</P>
      <P>To this, Rubin said that if these meetings gave the leaders in
Beijing a reason to do something that they might not otherwise wish
to do, "then our engagement is working."</P>
      <P>There is also fear that, by making well-known leaders of the
pro-democracy movement leave the country, the Beijing authorities
have managed to divert attention away from the human rights agenda.</P>
      <P>Rubin said, however, that it was preferable for Wang and Wei
Jingsheng, another well-known mainland Chinese dissident released
last November, to be out of prison. "They are in the United States
where they are able to speak out freely, and that is certainly much
better than ... when they were in prison languishing and unable to
speak freely."</P>
      <P>While welcoming the release of Wang and Beijing's apparently
greater tolerance of dissent, Rubin said the US government believed
that there were many other political prisoners in mainland China.
"There is a long, long way to go if China is to enter the mainstream
of nations that provide democratic freedoms to their people, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Rubin made the remarks as Wang was spending his first full day of
freedom in the United States and as doctors at Henry Ford Hospital in
Detroit gave him a clean bill of health.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old former student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen
Square democracy movement arrived in Detroit on Sunday from Beijing
after being released from prison and sent into exile by the mainland
authorities.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva, April 20 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is all set to appeal the
recent World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling in favor of India and
other countries on shrimp farming, according to reports by the
Geneva-based world trade body Monday.</P>
      <P>India had complained to the WTO panel last year that its shrimp
exports had been badly hit since the United States imposed an embargo
in October 1996 under a unilateral law requiring shrimp nets to be
fitted with a special device to protect sea turtles.</P>
      <P>India said it is opposed the embargo as "a matter of principle,"
claiming the US law represents a form of trade barrier.</P>
      <P>"Shrimp is one of the significant items on our export list.
Shrimping is a labor-intensive industry that employs hundreds of
thousands of people," an Indian diplomat said. The US demand, he
said, "would have had a significant impact if allowed to stand."</P>
      <P>US officials, stating that Washington is likely to appeal the
preliminary ruling, said they were also deliberating several other
options.</P>
      <P>Those options include simply disregarding the report, which would
lead to fines, or other punitive measures against offenders of the US
turtle protection law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN SAID HELPFUL TO CROSS-STRAIT EQUILIBRIUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  D.C.,  April  20 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Arms sales to Taiwan can help
maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait, and allow both parties in
the dialogue over the future of one China to participate as equals,
Peter Brookes, a staff member with the US House International
Relations Committee, wrote in the latest issue of Defense News
weekly.</P>
      <P>The White House is holding its annual talks with Taipei in
Washington to discuss what types of armaments should be sold to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In light of recent events, including the upcoming summit between
US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
there is concern this issue will become overly politicized and the
White House may decide to curtail arms sales to Taiwan in a gesture
of political goodwill to Beijing, Brookes noted.</P>
      <P>But he said any decision of this sort would set a dangerous
precedent, be inherently bad policy and potentially destabilize
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Last year, the joint statement issued at the conclusion of the
official US visit by Jiang Zemin emphasized that the Taiwan issue is
"the most important and sensitive central question" in relations
between Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>While the United States reiterated its adherence to the "one
China" policy set forth in a series of communiques, it did not
mention the Taiwan Relations Act. That legislation stipulates the
United States will "provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive
character" to "enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability" in an effort "to help maintain peace, security and
stability in the Western Pacific."</P>
      <P>Brookes opined that a deviation from this long-standing policy,
and attempts at a grand bargain on Taiwan promoted recently by some
former US government officials, increases the likelihood of further
upsetting the political and military balance of power across the
Taiwan Strait, and of involving the United States in unnecessary
hostilities between mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The United States, in accordance with public law and prudent
policy, should continue to provide Taiwan with the necessary
defensive arms to ensure the future of Taiwan will be determined by
peaceful means, wrote Brookes.</P>
      <P>A failure to allow Taiwan to continue to procure high-quality
American military armaments will permit Beijing to further isolate
Taipei and increase mainland China's perception that the Taiwan
question can be resolved through military force if necessary. The
promotion of this ill-founded belief is dangerous to all parties, he
added.</P>
      <P>Brookes stressed that the United States should be resolute in its
message to Beijing that, in accordance with US law and policy as
embodied in the letter and spirit of the Taiwan Relations Act, the
future of Taiwan will be settled peacefully. "Continuing defensive
arms sales to Taiwan sends that message and helps assure its
likelihood," he concluded</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SEEN AS MAKING STRATEGIC MOVE BY FREEING WANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China, in dire need of foreign
capital and technology to maintain economic growth, is seen as making
a strategic investment by releasing its most prominent political
dissident ahead of a visit by US President Bill Clinton in June.</P>
      <P>In an editorial headlined "China Makes a Strategic Investment" on
Tuesday, mass-circulation newspaper The Australian says that by
releasing Wang Dan, as it recently did with Wei Jingsheng, Beijing
can reap a useful feedback from foreign investment because overseas
investors may be under the illusion that the Chinese mainland is also
making some progress on political reform after its relatively success
in economic liberalization.</P>
      <P>"But, at the national level, there is no real mood to hear a
plurality of political views. Any liberalization is to do with the
economy, where the emphasis is keeping growth at high levels," the
editorial says.</P>
      <P>"China desperately needs to keep foreign investment flowing in;
the deluge of money that rolled into China in the early 1990s has
waned dramatically in the past two years and the Asian economic
downturn of 1997-98 makes it even harder to win new capital," it
says.</P>
      <P>"In these circumstances, China has made a strategic decision to
release Wang Dan. It knows its interests lie in creating a climate as
devoid as possible of human rights issues before the June visit of US
President Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>"Sending Wang into exile in the United States helps lower the
temperature on that front, and offers Australian and other foreign
businesses contemplating a China investment at least the illusion of
progress on political freedom," it adds.</P>
      <P>The editorial noted China is freeing Wang in order to marginalize
the dissident leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement,
as it did to Wei. Beijing believes Wang will continue to be a symbol
for pro-democracy supporters if it keeps the dissident in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>By exiling both Wang and Wei, Beijing will reduce its pressure on
the political front.</P>
      <P>But the editorial says both Wang and Wei can still use the
Internet to keep in touch with their colleagues "on the inside" to
keep up some pressure for real political liberalization.</P>
      <P>In another editorial headlined: "Wang Free," by the
mass-circulation Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday, it says the
release of Wang Dan is designed to appease the United States because
Bill Clinton is going to visit Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>The editorial criticizes the mainland regime's hypocrisy in the
Wang case. It says this is the second release of Wang, who was freed
from prison in 1993 after serving four years only because Beijing was
bidding for the 2000 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>But Wang was re-arrested and jailed again after mainland China
lost to Australia in hosting the Games.</P>
      <P>The editorial says the release is good news to Wang and his
family. But the timing and circumstance of what really is his exile
to the United States is "no cause for celebration."</P>
      <P>"It is a cynical and manipulative act by a government so far
unable to rule without fear and which regards its power to play with
the lives of those it rules as more important than their basic human
freedom," the editorial says.</P>
      <P>It says Wang's offense has been to demand greater political
freedom for mainland Chinese, and an end to official corruption and
special privileges for the Communist Party elites.</P>
      <P>"These are normal political demands and in a normal society it
would not be forbidden to give expression to them," the editorial
says.</P>

dissident Wang Dan told his mainland compatriots Monday that he is
looking forward to returning to his homeland soon and "working
together with you to build a democratic, civilized and prosperous
China."</P>
      <P>In a statement to Radio Free Asia, Wang expressed gratitude to

      <P>"It was your kindness and sense of justice that kept me going and
kept me calm while I was in prison. Now I am free, but my heart is
not at peace," he said in the interview at Henry Ford Hospital in
Detroit. "China is still a big knot in my heart that I can't forget."</P>
      <P>At the end of the statement, he asked the mainland Chinese people
to "continue to give the kind of support that you gave me to those
who are still in prison."</P>
      <P>Wang, one of the top student leaders during the massive student
protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, was serving an
11-year prison sentence when he was released on what the Beijing

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   21   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jesus Manuel Fajardo Aceves, a
24-year-old Mexican man whose face is shrouded in thick, dark hair,
has been called a "wolf man" since his childhood becasue of his
unique appearance.</P>
      <P>The legendary "wolf man" is currently on a six-month goodwill
visit in Taiwan at the invitation of the Guinness World of Records
Museum in Taichung in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the museum, Fajardo is a victim of hirsutism,
a genetically inherited disorder which was passed down by his great
grandmother. The museum said he comes from the world's only known
family with living members who have the condition. His parents and
daughter do not have the disorder.</P>
      <P>Fajardo, who stands only 160 cm tall, met the local press at a
news conference held at Taipei's Rebar Holiday Inn Crown Plaza on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Despite his extraordinary appearance, Fajardo said he is
virtually a normal man who yearns for making friends with other
people. Because of his hairy face, Fajardo said few of his
Mexican compatriots would make friends with him.</P>
      <P>Fajardo further said he takes great interest in reading, watching
television, listening to music and playing football. He became a
circus performer shortly after his graduation from a primary school
at age of 13. With a scant income, Fajardo said he has been unable to
continue his study. "One of my dreams is to receive higher-level
education."</P>
      <P>During his years as a circus acrobat, Fajardo once married a
beautiful woman. But the marriage lasted for only two years. Before
coming to Taiwan, Fajardo had lived together with his mother and
five-year-old daughter in a Mexican village. His family now makes
living on farming.</P>
      <P>Fajardo said he is satisfied with his current living and has no
intention to seek a change to his face. "I have got accustomed to my
disorder. I have no plan to seek a cure."</P>
      <P>Tai Sheng-yi, chairman of the Guinness Taichung museum, said
Fajardo is a shy, quiet and polite man. "Although Fajardo looks a
bit wild and weird, he has a decent demeanor."</P>
      <P>Tai said the museum has prepared an European-style living
quarter for the Mexican "wolf man." Local people are welcome to
visit Fajardo during his six-month stay at the museum.</P>
      <P>While here, Fajardo is scheduled to visit some ROC government
officials. This will be his longest overseas trip. He once visited
Japan and Brazil, but only stayed there for about two weeks.</P>
      <P>Carlos Santos, Mexican representative to the Republic of China,
who was also present at Tuesday's news conference, said he hopes
Fajardo's visit will help boost bilateral cultural exchanges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Macau is currently experiencing a period
of economic difficulties exacerbated by the regional economic and
financial crisis, said Vitor Rodrigues Pessoa, Macau's secretary of
economic coordination.</P>
      <P>Pessoa told the some 100 delegates at the second day of the 54th
meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia
and the Pacific that "these difficulties have been particularly
noticeable in the tourism sector, now the territory's main activity
sector, as reflected in the drop in the number of visitors ... last
year."</P>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis, however, has not affected the
stability of the local currency, Pessoa said.</P>
      <P>"Given its peg to the Hong Kong dollar, it appreciated
considerably in relation to other currencies in the region," he
noted.</P>
      <P>But Macau's exports have been affected by the strength of its
currency. "In terms of the manufacturing sector -- which is almost
entirely geared toward exports given the small level of domestic
demand -- the competitiveness of the territory's products in the
world markets has been clearly affected," he said.</P>
      <P>The official said despite growth of around 8 percent in value in
1997, a slackening in exports is expected this year.</P>
      <P>Macau is scheduled to end over four centuries of Portuguese rule
and become a Special Administrative Region of mainland China on Dec.
20, 1999.</P>
      <P>Beijing has pledged to allow Macau to retain its economic,

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SAID SEEKING MORE US SUPPORT BY RELEASING WANG DAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing will use mainland Chinese
dissident Wang Dan's release to press for more US support in the
international debates over Taiwan and Tibet and in transfers of high
technology, according to commentaries in the regional media Monday.</P>
      <P>The freeing of Wang also shows Washington was right to stay
"engaged" with Beijing, the commentaries said, noting that this
brought about concrete negotiations leading to his release on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Most Asian editorials pointed out that the release should improve
Beijing-Washington relations and help mainland China gain more
support from the United States in international debates over Taiwan
and Tibet, as well as facilitate the technology transfers that
mainland China needs to upgrade its fledgling economy, The Straits
Times reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang, 29, was freed on medical parole and sent directly from a
Beijing prison to a US hospital in Detroit, Michigan, for a medical
checkup. He was reported to be in good health.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's Chinese-language Ming Pao Daily News was quoted as
commenting: "To enable the Sino-US ties to grow smoothly, Beijing
needed to make some concessions by improving its human-rights record.
The release of Wang Dan prior to Clinton's China visit in June is a
gift for the US President, so that he can claim some credit from the
American people."</P>
      <P>On whether the move indicates Beijing has eased up on political
dissent, the views were mixed, the report said.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily said that the mere fact that Wang was
released on medical parole does not prove that human rights have
improved in mainland China.</P>
      <P>But Malaysia's Sin Chew Jit Poh said in its editorial Monday that
Wang's release demonstrates more flexibility on the part of mainland
China's new leaders in dealing with dissidents and human rights
problems, as compared to the past.</P>
      <P>"It also reflects the positive results of China's reforms," the
editorial was quoted as commenting.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Hong Kong Economic Journal said, the mainland
Chinese authorities had made "a wise decision," no matter what their
motives were.</P>
      <P>It also said that the development shows that mainland China is
more open now and that Beijing leaders have more confidence in
themselves.</P>
      <P>A South China Morning Post editorial said that mainland China's
human rights situation is slowly improving.</P>
      <P>"The pace of change may not be rapid. But nor is it glacial, as a
combination of steady pressure ... and the emergence of a more
pragmatic Beijing leadership begins to have its effect," it was
quoted as commenting.</P>
      <P>In Singapore, both The Straits Times and the Chinese-language
Lianhe Zaobao, as well as Singapore television and radio stations,
reported on Wang's release and his arrival in Detroit on Sunday. But

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESS INTERESTS SHOULD BE ON TALKS AGENDA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Hsu Ke-sheng said on Tuesday that Taiwan and mainland China
should hold talks to discuss the issue of the personal and property
safety of Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Following the recent murder of Yeh Jung-Fu, a knitted garment
maker from Kaohsiung, in Quanzhou, Fujian Province last week, Hsu
said the government should seek to increase the protection of Taiwan
business interests in the mainland through negotiation with the
relevant mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>The MAC official made the remarks here while presiding over a
seminar for local businessmen based in southern Taiwan. More than 200
people, including members of the local business community and
Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih, took part in the event.</P>
      <P>Although some local businessmen disagree with the government's
"no haste, be patient" policy governing Taiwan investment in the
mainland, Hsu said the policy is aimed only at high-end and
infrastructure investment projects worth more than US$50 million,
while other types of investment are not subject to the same
regulations. The major purpose of the policy, he noted, is to
strengthen Taiwan industries and protect the safety of Taiwan
investors in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten years, Taiwan people have made a total of 13
million visits to mainland China, while the number of visits by
mainland people to Taiwan has reached around 250,000, Hsu pointed
out, adding that the mainland has become Taiwan's largest investment
destination, absorbing 40 percent of Taiwan's total overseas
investment.</P>
      <P>With tensions escalating in two-way relations in recent years
following the mainland's missile tests and military exercises in the
Taiwan Strait, he called on local businesses to continue supporting
the government's mainland investment policy and urged Beijing to
resolve bilateral disputes peacefully.</P>
      <P>Hailing Taiwan investors as the major force in promoting friendly
cross-strait ties, Kaohsiung Mayor Wu for his part urged local
entrepreneurs to engage in legitimate business in the mainland,
thereby making it easier for the government to help protect their
business interests there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION INDEX KEEPS GROWING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on
Tuesday announced that the industrial production index for March this
year has reached 137.99 points, the third-highest level of growth for
a single month.</P>
      <P>However, the MOEA statistics show that factors such as a
reduction of exports to Southeast Asia and South Korea mean that the
growth rate is only 3.9 percent up on the corresponding year-earlier
level.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same period of last year, the statistics show
that the production index of manufacturing industries in March
increased by 4.36 percent; water, electricity, fuel oil and gas
industries were up 7.45 percent; while housing and construction
industries plunged by 22.14 percent; and mining industries were
reduced by 13.19 percent.</P>
      <P>Comparing the first three months of this year with the same
period of last year, growth was slower, with industrial production
increasing by 4.48 percent, in which manufacturing industries
increased by 5 percent, an average increase of 7.86 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the MOEA's Statistics
Department, attributed the increase in the production index of
manufacturing industries to the 17.37 percent growth enjoyed by the
electrical and electronics appliances industries, following
double-digit growth last year.</P>
      <P>Faced with the current trend toward low-priced computers, Chang
said, manufacturers have expanded their production capacities to meet
the growing demand for IT products such as semiconductors and
notebook computers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RANKS 16TH IN WORLD COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Maurus Yang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 16th in the 1998 world
competitiveness rating, moving up seven notches from its 1997
ranking, according to a report released by the Lausanne-based
International Institute for Management and Development (IMD) on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was two places ahead of Japan in the IMD World
Competitive Yearbook annual rankings. Japan ranked 18th this year,
down from ninth in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Swiss institute compares the competitiveness of 46 economies
by measuring economic strength, the domestic economy's openness to
international trade, government efficiency, financial services,
infrastructure, management, science and technology, education and
training. The study defines national competitiveness as a country's
ability to help keep businesses competitive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan made progress in all but one category -- the domestic
economy's openness to international trade or internationalization.
Taiwan's "internationalization" ranking dropped from 30th in 1997
to 32nd this year. The slight drop might be related to a sharp
decline in Taiwan's trade surplus, its restrictions on trade with
mainland China and its currency's depreciation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan performed best in the management and science-technology
categories. Its ranking for management climed to seventh from 18th
last year, and its rating for science-technology also advanced to
seventh from 1997's 10th place.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan ranked eighth in terms of economic strength in
the IMD 1998 world rating, 14th in government efficiency, 19th in
financial services, 26th in infrastructure, 18th in education and
training.</P>
      <P>The United States held on to its No. 1 place thanks to
free market policies like privatization and a flexible labor
market, the IMD report said.</P>
      <P>Singapore and Hong Kong held second and third places this year,
as they did in 1997. Mainland China jumped to 24th from 27th place
in 1997. In contrast, South Korea plunged five places to 35th.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN GOV'T SHOULD SHOW SUPPORT FOR WANG DAN: DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April 21 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian newspaper on Tuesday urged the
Chretien government to show support for Wang Dan, the recently
released mainland Chinese dissident.</P>
      <P>"Let's call China's 'release' of dissident Wang Dan what it is:
expulsion and exile, punishment for political speech," The Ottawa
Citizen said in an editorial.</P>
      <P>The Citizen called Wang a "pawn in a cynical game," noting that
he is the second prominent dissident to be released (after Wei
Jingsheng) shortly before planned meetings between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese leaders. Beijing hopes to buy favors
from the West through the high-profile timing of such releases, it
said.</P>
      <P>Though the strategy has succeeded, the United States still speaks
out about mainland China's situation, according to the editorial.
Clinton said he believes mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
"on the wrong side of history" in suppressing the basic rights of
mainland Chinese citizens, it noted. Clinton also met with Wei after
his release, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>Canada's prime minister, by contrast, spurned Wei during the
dissident's recent visit to Ottawa, the Citizen said. And in
November, Chretien refused to meet Harry Wu, another high-profile
activist for more human rights in mainland China, it added.</P>
      <P>The Citizen wondered whether Chretien will "snub" Wang as well.</P>
      <P>It stated that Canadians believe their government has a role to
play in defending human rights. "Here's an idea for the PM: Why not
invite Mr. Wang for a visit and a handshake -- as the TV cameras
roll?" the Citizen suggested.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is the fourth-safest Asian
economy in which to do business, behind only Singapore, Hong Kong and
Japan, according to a respected Hong Kong public opinion poll
company.</P>
      <P>In its 1998 Comparative Country Risk report, the Political and
Economic Risk Consultancy Ltd. (PERC) said: "The biggest change in
our model has been the fall in risk in the Sino economies and the
rise in risk in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
countries" over the past year.</P>
      <P>PERC attributed the lower risk in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland
China to "the improved systemic and socio-political situation."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Indonesia and Vietnam have experienced the
biggest deterioration in risk, said PERC, which advises corporations
on business conditions in the region.</P>
      <P>A total of 12 countries and areas in Asia were graded on the
basis of such factors as market size, economic dynamics, systemic
deficiencies, socio-political risks, corruption, level economic
playing fields, bureaucracy and labor force quality.</P>
      <P>Singapore, which has weathered the regional financial turmoil
well, thanks to its strong fundamentals, was ranked as the
lowest-risk country, with a score of 3.04 (on a country-risk scale of
zero to 10, with zero representing the best possible grade).</P>
      <P>Singapore was followed in descending order by Hong Kong, Japan,
Taiwan, mainland China, Malaysia, South Korea, the Philippines,
Thailand, India, and Indonesia, with Vietnam at the bottom with a

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE FARMERS TO MOBILIZE MEN TO MOVE FARM PRODUCT FOR EXPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian farmers, hit hard by the
waterfront war, on Tuesday demanded that the government take tough
measures against union workers picketing and blocking major ports
throughout the country, and they vowed to mobilize men to move their
farm products for export to Asia and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Wendy Crank, spokeswoman for the National Farmers Federation
(NFF), said NFF members are determined to mobilize to break through
the picket lines of fired union workers so that their produce can be
exported.</P>
      <P>NFF Chairman Don McGauchie called on Australian police to do
"what they're required to do, and that is allow people to go about
their lawful business."</P>
      <P>"There is no right in a peaceful protest to block road access to
people going about their ordinary and lawful business," he said in
Brisbane, one of the major ports facing a wave of picket lines from
the fired workers of Patrick Stevedores, one of the two leading
stevedoring firms at the center of the waterfront dispute. Patrick
fired all 1,400 of its full-time union workers and another 600
part-time workers less than two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The Victorian Supreme Court handed down a decision Monday to ban
the blockade on the Melbourne Port and ordered police to remove the
picketers.</P>
      <P>But the Melbourne Port, like other ports, was unable to operate
because the number of picketers greatly exceeded that of policemen,
making it very difficult for police to move the protesting workers.</P>
      <P>McGauchie said farmers are prepared to use their own trucks to
get through pickets in Western Australia, New South Wales and
Victoria by the end of this week.</P>
      <P>Industry sources and government officials are worried that the
NFF's "get tough stance" may result in bloodshed between farmers and
picketers if the showdown gets out of control.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday that he understands and
sympathizes with the farmers' anxiety at being unable to export their
farm produce.</P>
      <P>Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith on Tuesday condemned the
president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) for her
active support of the sacked union workers blocking most of the ports
across the country.</P>
      <P>Public opinion polls on Tuesday showed that about 50 percent of
people surveyed support Patrick's plans to improve the container
handling rate at major ports. But the polls also showed that many do
not support the way Patrick and the Howard government have treated
the union workers.</P>
      <P>Most of those polled did not approve of the illegal picketing
strategy used by the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA), which is
behind the powerful force against Patrick's and the government's
waterfront reform efforts.</P>
      <P>The MUA is supported by the ACTU, the biggest union group in
Australia, and other union groups in the Down Under, as well as some
international groups in the United States, Britain, Belgium and
Japan.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the waterfront dispute started taking a toll on P&amp;O
Ports, Australia's biggest stevedoring firm, when its union workers
walked off their jobs for an hour to join the picket line at the
Fremantle Port in Western Australia.</P>
      <P>Both P&amp;O and Patrick handle about 95 percent of containerized
cargoes at major ports in Australia. Now P&amp;O is doing some of
Patrick's operations in addition to its own.</P>
      <P>If more union workers from P&amp;O Ports also walk off their jobs,
then Australian exports and imports will be paralyzed, industry
analysts said.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ho Ming-liang, deputy director-general of
the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA), said on Monday that the government and the
private sector should work together to grab a slice of the lucrative
global aviation market.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks following a signing ceremony marking the
establishment of an alliance to train aviation talent in southern
Taiwan between the IDB and private-sector organizations, including
the Aviation and Aerospace Institute under the Tainan-based National
Cheng Kung University and the Air Asia Co., Ltd.</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with the aviation industry estimate that the
world's demand for passenger airplanes will hit around 4,000 units in
the next 15 years, with Asian markets accounting for around 2,000
units. In terms of airplane manufacturing value, the US market will
generate US$330 billion, while Europe and Asia will be worth US$200
billion and US$310 billion, respectively.</P>
      <P>The sources forecast a serious shortfall in the manpower supply
for the aviation industry in southern Taiwan in the coming years,
which is the reason behind the MOEA's efforts to forge a partnership
with the private sector to jointly cultivate new blood.</P>
      <P>The MOEA is currently inviting the private sector to join forces
in a capital increment plan for an airplane repair and maintenance
center, which has been devised in line with the government's desire
to set up a "special aviation industry complex in southern Taiwan"
with the goal of building Taiwan into an airplane repair and
maintenance hub in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>In addition, a planned "intelligent" industrial park to be
located in Luchu township, Kaohsiung County, will also focus on the
production of airplane key parts and components.</P>

      <P>A group of more than 30 Taiwan
manufacturers stationed in eastern South Africa will start a campaign
Thursday to protest the fact that their property and personal safety
have been put in jeopardy with the decline in social order in the
country.</P>
      <P>The move was prompted by a robbery and murder on Friday in the
Isithebe industrial district in Natal Province, eastern South Africa,
when a Taiwan businessman was shot dead after being robbed by three
local persons at his factory.</P>
      <P>The victim was identified as 47-year-old Wang Neng-shi, who set
up the Chinatown Garment Manufacturers company in the industrial
district, and employed around 400 South African people.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Representative Office in Durban, in
addition to the planned protest on Thursday in Isithebe, all the
Taiwan-owned plants there will close for a week -- an act aimed at
emphasizing to the local authorities that no time should be wasted in
stopping the rot in the social order.</P>
      <P>Taipei Representative Office Director Lin Sung-huan on Tuesday
accompanied Wang's family and representatives of the Taiwan
enterprises in Natal Province on a visit to the Natal police
authorities and administrators of the Isithebe industrial district.</P>
      <P>Wang said that during the visit they voiced their hopes that the
industrial zone can be protected from crime and that the local police
can arrest the three murderers as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The opposition Inkatha Freedom Party of South Africa also
released a statement warning that the murder case will have a heavy

    <HEADLINE>TWO SIDES OF STRAIT STILL DIFFER DESPITE RESUMPTION OF TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China are to resume
talks this week following a lapse of about three years, though no
sudden breakthrough is expected because the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait remain unable to see eye to eye, especially in terms of
sovereignty, according to The Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, the review's correspondent Rowan
Callick reported that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
preparing for their first serious talks in three years.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that "after 49 years of separation, no sudden
breakthrough is expected."</P>
      <P>Each side has much to gain from regularizing relations, including
making life easier for the thousands of Taiwanese managers
supervising more than US$27 billion in investment in small and
medium-sized businesses all over mainland China, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the talks will begin modestly, with middle-ranking
officials from the surrogate contact-making bodies established by
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, meeting in Beijing this week.</P>
      <P>"But the big picture presents a gap oceans wider than the Taiwan
Strait," Callick said.</P>
      <P>The mainland is offering Taiwan a status similar to that of Hong
Kong under the "one country, two systems" structure, with the island
being allowed to keep its own military, the daily reported. Under
this plan, however, Beijing would have sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan's goal is "democratic reunification,"
which would require the Chinese Communist Party to take its chances
with competitors in democratic elections.</P>
      <P>Beijing is eager to focus first on the big picture. Mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sees reunification as his route to a
place in the history books and he doesn't need to consult anyone to
cut a deal, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>But the 21 million Taiwanese are in a different boat. President
Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China -- who has already booked his
place in history as Taiwan's first directly elected leader -- saw his
party suffer a devastating loss in mayoral and county head elections
last November when the independence-inclined Democratic Progressive
Party won 72 percent of the seats.</P>
      <P>The daily said the ROC's ruling Kuomintang staged a comeback in
an ensuing poll for councilors but that the talks with mainland China
will be a crucial issue in the parliamentary election in December.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Taiwan has continued opening its market wider
and that such economic clout is opening doors throughout troubled
Asia, much to the irritation of Beijing, which has been seeking to
leverage a role as the effective regional leader out of its defense
of a strong currency that has helped prevent further economic
collapse in the region.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Beijing's adherence to the "one country, two
systems" formula in Hong Kong helps its cause with Taiwan but will
not convince Taipei to concede a return to provincial status.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the Taiwanese are fully aware of the
challenges mainland China still faces as it seeks to modernize.</P>
      <P>Most Taiwanese were born on the island and feel that mainland
China is like another country, the daily said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  21  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mainland China-US summit in June
offers an "ideal target" to bring Beijing into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), but negotiations still have a long way to go,
according to a report on Tuesday from the Geneva-based world trade
regulatory body.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton is due to visit Beijing in late June
for a summit with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is
scheduled to visit Beijing later this month, and US officials are
urging Beijing to be ready for intensive and very significant
negotiations during this visit, so that they can move as far down
this road as possible -- ideally towards agreement.</P>
      <P>Beijing is playing what it believes is a new trump card in its
11-year battle to join the WTO -- its public pledge not to devalue
its currency and make the Asian financial crisis even worse.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's leaders argue that Beijing is making a tough
sacrifice by maintaining a strong currency and thereby making its
exports less competitive, and they suggest that WTO entry should be a
reward for this.</P>
      <P>A week ago, Beijing's top WTO negotiator Long Yungtu attacked
"certain members" of the WTO for "excessive requests" on Beijing's
entry.</P>
      <P>"Now it is time that the major WTO players demonstrate some
degree of responsibility towards China's WTO accession," Long said in
Geneva.</P>
      <P>Long also played down hopes for a quick breakthrough, saying: "We
cannot solve everything with a presidential visit."</P>
      <P>The latest round of WTO negotiations in Geneva ended with little
progress. Western trade officials expressed disappointment at
mainland China's latest tariff cut offer and its failure to propose a
further opening of its services market.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has sought to enter the world trade body on the
easier terms accorded to developing countries, but many WTO
contracting parties say Beijing's economy is too large for such
treatment.</P>
      <P>US trade officials said WTO agreement "will require Chinese
agreement to accession on terms that are commercially acceptable and
commercially valid."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) under the
Executive Yuan on Tuesday announced measures to narrow the gap
between prices for imported and domestic rice.</P>
      <P>The COA noted that under the protective measures, which are based
on an agreement reached with the United States following
consultations on joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
upper ceiling for increased prices for foreign rice may reach as high
as NT$23.26 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must allow the import of foreign rice after entering the
WTO, with the first year import volume amounting to 115,000 metric
tons, rising to 144,000 metric tons during the third year, by which
time the COA estimates that areas devoted to rice cultivation in
Taiwan will have been reduced by 32,000 hectares.</P>
      <P>To cope with the impact of the imported rice, the COA will hold a
meeting every two weeks to review the implementation measures.
According to the COA, after the implementation of the protective
measures, importers will have to bear the cost of the price add-ons,
in addition to paying import costs, customs taxes and transportation
fees.</P>
      <P>The price add-ons, ranging from NT$0.01 to NT$23.26, will be
decided on the basis of the price-gap between the wholesale price of
locally produced rice and the price of imported rice, and will be
reviewed and readjusted every two weeks.</P>
      <P>In order to further reduce the effect of imported rice on
domestic foodstuff prices, the government will control about 60
percent of the imported rice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HOPEFUL OF BEING WORLD'S 5TH MOST COMPETITIVE ECONOMY BY 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Tuesday didn't
hesitate to show his complacency over Taiwan's improved international
competitiveness, up seven notches to 16th place over last year.</P>
      <P>According to the latest report published by the Lausanne,
Switzerland-based International Institute for Management Development
(IMD), Taiwan was the 16th most competitive country in the world in
1997, with stronger economic strength, higher government efficiency,
improved business management and better science and technology
development than a year ago.</P>
      <P>Lien, who made raising Taiwan's national competitiveness one of
his administrative goals during his premiership between February 1993
and August 1997, likened his pleasure at seeing Taiwan's rating
improve to a father's pleasure at seeing his children's' school
scores improve.</P>
      <P>The vice president said sharpening a nation's international
competitiveness is a task without limits or timetable. He urged all
sectors of the nation to make concerted efforts to further raise the
ROC's competitiveness, with the goal of making Taiwan the fifth most
competitive economy in the world by 2000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew also expressed satisfaction over
the ROC's rising competitiveness, which is now even better than the
neighboring economic superpower of Japan. Japan's rating dropped nine
notches to 18th.</P>
      <P>Siew attributed Taiwan's improved competitiveness to its ability
to remain relatively unscathed by the regional economic turmoil in
Southeast Asia, its strenuous efforts to bolster scientific and
technological development, and the constant improvement in government
efficiency.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that Taiwan needs to heed the IMD
revelation that the island should open itself further to
international trade.</P>
      <P>The IMD study compares the competitiveness of 46 countries and
areas around the world by measuring economic strength, the domestic
economy's openness to international trade, government policies,
financial services, infrastructure, management, science and
technology, education and training.</P>
      <P>It defines national competitiveness as a country's ability to
maintain business competitiveness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISSIDENTS RELEASE PART OF BEIJING PLOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   April   21   (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's regime is
implementing economic reforms that have greatly increased many
people's freedom to move, choose their own jobs and travel. But
despite a few signs of liberalization, freedom of expression,
association and belief remain tightly constricted -- a potentially
destabilizing combination, commented The Washington Post in a Tuesday
editorial.</P>
      <P>The paper noted that it was front page news on Monday that
mainland China had sent well-known dissident Wang Dan into American
exile, just as democracy advocate Wei Jingsheng's release and exile
last November was also front page news. But a steady flow of arrests
between these two well-publicized releases didn't make the front
pages around the country or even a mention in most newspapers.</P>
      <P>Among those imprisoned who are not well-known in the West were
Yang Qinheng and Father Lu Genyou. The former was sentenced in March
to three years' hard labor, apparently for speaking on Radio Free
Asia in favor of free unions; the latter, a Catholic priest, was
reportedly arrested on April 5 while preparing to lead a mass,
according to the editorial.</P>
      <P>It added that Wang Dan's release was "part of a delicate unspoken
deal" between the administrations of US President Bill Clinton and
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Clinton dropped America's
customary sponsorship of a resolution on mainland China's human
rights abuses at an annual UN conference. Jiang sent Wang Dan into
exile. Now the way is clear for Clinton's visit to mainland China in
June -- the first by a US president since the Tiananmen Square
massacre in 1989.</P>
      <P>Wang Dan was a student leader of the peaceful protest that
preceded that crackdown, and as a result was jailed until 1993. Like
Wei, Wang Dan had the almost unimaginable courage to resume his
pro-democracy activities immediately after his release, despite the
near certainty that mainland China's communist regime would jail him
again. It did, and he has spent the past three years in jail.</P>
      <P>So there can be only joy that he is free, albeit in forced exile,
wrote The Washington Post. Yet there is a danger, as mainland China
bargains with its dissidents one by one, of losing sight of the
thousands of prisoners of conscience who remain in jail or labor
camps -- and of those who are added to the prison population week
after week.</P>
      <P>As Wang Dan wrote in 1995, before his second arrest, mainland
China could minimize the danger of social and worker unrest by giving
the public "a chance to express its dissatisfaction through
democratic channels." But that would carry a different risk -- to the
survival of the communist regime. "That's why the regime is still
doing what it can to make sure Wang Dan's message won't be heard in
his homeland," concluded the editorial.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LAWMAKERS WANT JAPAN TO COMPENSATE WAR-TIME SEX SLAVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  21  (CNA)
(By F.M. Chang &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan delegation which has joined
legislators from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines for a
symposium on Japan's use of sex slaves during World War II, called on
Tuesday the Japanese government to officially compensate the women
and to issue a formal apology.</P>
      <P>According to Alice Kao, a legislator representing Taiwan's
opposition New Party, the ROC government has paid NT$1 million
(US$37,000), with help from the island's private sector, to each of
the surviving Taiwanese women who were forced to be euphemistically
named "comfort women" to Japanese soldiers during the war.</P>
      <P>The passing of time has left us very little time to give the
former sex slaves real legal and moral compensation, Kao said at a
press conference prior to the opening of the two-day symposium,
hosted by the Japanese Lawyers Association.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's former comfort women have been financially
compensated by their government, Kao said, it is only just that the
Japanese government see to it that legislation is passed to
officially compensate all the surviving women from all over Asia, and
to issue an open, formal apology for the atrocity.</P>
      <P>Seven legislators and other representatives from Taiwan, Japan,
South Korea and the Philippines at the symposium called at the press
conference for the Tokyo government to come up with legislation for
compensation, to openly admit Japan's war crimes, to publicize the
"real history," and to have the Japanese prime minister issue a
formal apology to all the women who are still alive.</P>
      <P>According to the lawmakers, there are still 45 living in Taiwan,
152 in South Korea, and 169 in the Philippines, although there could
be many more, since many of the victims have kept their silence over
the years because of a deep sense of shame.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMANY IS ROC'S BIGGEST EUROPEAN TRADE PARTNER</HEADLINE>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Germany remains the Republic of China's
biggest trade partner among the countries of Europe, with ROC-Germany
bilateral trade amounting to US$1.340 billion in the first two months
of 1998, representing 22.4 percent of the ROC's total trade with
Europe.</P>
      <P>In the January-February period, ROC exports to Germany amounted
to US$613.4 million against imports from Germany at US$727.4 million,
according to statistics compiled by the Taipei Trade Office in
Frankfurt, Germany.</P>
      <P>ROC trade with Europe as a whole amounted to US$5.988 billion in
the two-month period, accounting for 18.1 percent of the ROC's total
foreign trade, and still lagging behind trade with America.</P>
      <P>Trade with the European Union (EU) accounted for 89 percent of
the ROC's trade with Europe during the period, amounting to US$5.329
billion. Among the EU nations, Germany, the Netherlands, France,
Britain and Italy are the leading ROC trade partners.</P>
      <P>In East Europe, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic took the
lead in ROC trade, accounting for 79 percent of the US$125.7 million
total. The potential for bilateral trade between the ROC and East
Europe is yet to be fully explored, with trade volume accounting for
only 2.1 percent of total ROC-Europe trade.</P>
      <P>The trade office pointed out that trade between the ROC and
Russia is expected to pick up with the establishment of direct flight
links. ROC trade with member states of the Community of Independent
States (CIS) in the January-February period amounted to US$250
million, accounting for 4.2 percent of the ROC-Europe trade.</P>
      <P>Computers and related products remained the major ROC export
items, followed by bicycles and motorcycles. Major items imported by
the ROC from Europe included ICs and microelectronics products, radio
and television transmission systems, and aviation equipment.</P>

Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an interview with the United Evening

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MEDIA PROTEST AGAINST BEIJING'S COVERAGE RESTRICTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan journalists on Tuesday lodged a
stern protest against Beijing imposing a limit on how many of them
can cover the news surrounding a Taiwan representative's visit to
Beijing, an event that may serve as a key to reopening the
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, newly appointed deputy secretary-general of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a quasi-official intermediary body
authorized to handle exchanges across the Taiwan Strait in the
absence of formal contacts, left for Beijing Wednesday morning for
consultations on matters of protocol regarding the visit of a Taiwan
delegation to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Beijing visit of Jan, who is also director of the Research
and Planning Department of the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, is a major story in Taiwan because it marks the first
contact between the SEF and its Beijing counterpart, the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), since Beijing
unilaterally suspended the bilateral dialogue in the summer of 1995,
34 months ago.</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities, however, have restricted the number of
Taiwan journalists allowed to cover Jan's mainland visit on the
grounds that "the meeting venue is limited and it is difficult to
arrange accommodations for large number of reporters."</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday night, the Beijing authorities had given permission
to only some 20 reporters and journalists from Taiwan's three
broadcast television stations, including TTV, five of the island's
cable TV channels, including TVBS, and several local print media,
including CNA, to cover Jan's three-day visit in mainland China.</P>
      <P>This number is only about half of the more than 40 applications
submitted.</P>
      <P>Jan, who is supposed to negotiate procedural matters relating to
reciprocal visits between the SEF and ARATS, also expressed
dissatisfaction over Beijing's limit on the number of journalists,
saying that this will be the first issue he raises when he meets with
relevant mainland officials for discussions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APPEASING BEIJING IS BIGGEST THREAT TO HUMAN RIGHTS: TIBETAN SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 22 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A competition among Western countries to
appease mainland China is the biggest threat to human rights because
they can only see the mainland as their largest market by ignoring
mainland Chinese abuses and violations, a leading Tibetan has warned.</P>
      <P>Professor Samdhong Rinpoche, speaker of the Tibetan Parliament in
exile at Dharamsala in India, told the Melbourne-based mass
circulation newspaper The Age that the biggest threat to human rights
is "competition to appease mainland China."</P>
      <P>The daily quoted the monk, who ranks behind only the Dalai Lama
in the Tibetan government in exile, as saying: "People think China is
the most convenient marketplace. Businessmen can do anything they
want if they just bribe a few top officials."</P>
      <P>He noted that in a shrinking global marketplace, the results of
human rights violations would not be contained to mainland China.</P>
      <P>He cited the visit of mainland Chinese leaders to Canada last
year as an example, saying Canadian police broke up student
demonstrations with tear gas.</P>
      <P>"I was told that it was the worst thing done to peaceful
demonstrators in the history of Canada," he told the daily.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan cause is now being supported by leading Hollywood
stars, including Richard Gere, Harrison Ford and Susan Sarandon.</P>
      <P>But Samdhong Rinpoche said the support of ordinary people is as
important in achieving freedom for Tibet. Although there is no
economic benefit in supporting Tibet, "people are spending their own
money, time and energy because they feel that it is a struggle
between right and wrong," he said.</P>
      <P>He told the daily that the young Panchen Lama, who has been in
custody in mainland China for more than two years, should be set free
because there is growing concern for his welfare.</P>
      <P>"He is too small to be tortured and imprisoned in this way," he
said.</P>
      <P>He said the recent movies "Seven Years in Tibet" and "Kundun" are
an indication that the West is more open to hearing about the Tibetan
cause.</P>
      <P>The films can help counter "misinformation" spread by Beijing, he
said, adding that he believes the truth about Tibet will eventually
prevail.</P>
      <P>Samdhong Rinpoche, who fled to India after the failure of the
Tibetan uprising against mainland China in 1959, also serves as the
vice chancellor of the Institute for Higher Buddhist Studies in
Varanasi, India.</P>
      <P>He has given a series of briefings on Beijing's human rights
violations and abuses in Tibet to Australian politicians and
academics he met during his visits to Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne.
He took up a three-week lectureship at the University of Tasmania on
April 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RUPERT MURDOCH'S MARRIAGE BREAKUP STUNS HIS FAMILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  22 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The breakup of the 31-year marriage of
media magnate Rupert Murdoch has stunned his family and friends as
well as financial markets in Australia and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The first public news that Murdoch and his wife Anna have
separated was disclosed in a gossip column in one of Murdoch's
newspapers, The New York Post.</P>
      <P>The great lady of gossip, Liz Smith, wrote in her column: "It is
with some personal sadness that I announce the amicable separation of
Rupert Murdoch and his beautiful wife, Anna. The Murdochs say their
situation is very painful and leaves them torn but they are
attempting to work out their differences."</P>
      <P>Australian media reported Wednesday that even Murdoch's mother
was astonished to hear the news that her son was separating from his
wife of 31 years.</P>
      <P>"It's come as a big shock to us all," Dame Elisabeth Murdoch told
reporters. "We're devastated, of course, because we are so fond of
them both."</P>
      <P>Murdoch's sister, Helen Handbury and Anna's brother, Hans Tory,
were equally surprised, saying they knew nothing about the breakup
until Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 53-year-old Anna and her 67-year-old husband, Murdoch, have
confirmed that they are not living in the same place. Anna has gone
back to England with her daughter, according to a report in
Wednesday's edition of The Sydney Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>The Murdochs have three grown-up children -- Lachlan, Elisabeth
and James, all high-ranking executives in the Australia-based News
Corp. empire.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review, Australia's leading business
daily, reported Wednesday that the news of the breakup was a shock to
the financial market and that market analysts predict the record
recent gains in the shares of Murdoch's A$39 billion (US$26 billion)
News Corp. empire in Adelaide will be reversed somewhat.</P>
      <P>Analysts said investors in Australia and abroad are likely to
push the share price down as the market digests such issues as
succession and stock ownership in the wake of any financial
settlement.</P>
      <P>News Corp. shares ended 11 Australian cents lower at A$11.10
Tuesday. Analysts said the stock market has yet to react to the
marriage split.</P>
      <P>"This is the biggest piece of news on News Corp. that we've heard
for a long time," one analyst told the Financial Review.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE STILL WORLD'S 2ND MOST COMPETITIVE COUNTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has weathered the Asian
economic storm successfully to retain its spot as the world's second
most competitive country for the fifth consecutive year.</P>
      <P>Singapore and Hong Kong were the only Asian entities in the new
list of the top 15 most competitive economies in the world, compiled
by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development
(IMD).</P>
      <P>The authoritative rankings of 46 economies worldwide, released
Tuesday, gave Singapore 84 points, with the United States coming out
on top with 100, The Straits Times reported Wednesday. Hong Kong, in
third place, mustered only 69 points.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China was ranked 16th, seven steps higher than
its 23rd spot in the previous rating.</P>
      <P>Troubled Japan fell to 18th, from the ninth spot it occupied last
year. It was ranked as the second most competitive economy worldwide
just five years ago.</P>
      <P>The United States, as No. 1, was "exceptional" in terms of
competitiveness, according to the top Swiss business school.</P>
      <P>The three city-economies -- Singapore, Hong Kong and ninth-placed
Luxembourg -- continued to perform remarkably well, said the IMD in
releasing its keenly-awaited annual scoreboard.</P>
      <P>"Singapore has been less affected than its neighbors by the Asian
crisis, but will certainly be impacted by the general slowdown in the
region's environment," said Professor Stephane Garelli, director of
the world competitiveness project at the IMD.</P>
      <P>Although Hong Kong maintained its third slot, it "has
nevertheless lost some ground in comparison to Singapore, perhaps due
to transition uncertainties," Garelli said.</P>
      <P>He noted that everything was in place for US competitiveness:
seven years of continuous economic expansion, unemployment at a
24-year low, inflation at a 30-year low and stock exchange indices
that had roughly tripled since 1991.</P>
      <P>"The United States is strongly installed in its position as the
most competitive nation in the world. Privatization, deregulation,
flexibility in the labor market and especially massive investment in
new technology has worked," he observed.</P>
      <P>The IMD's findings, published in the annual World Competitiveness
Yearbook, rank the ability of a nation to provide an environment that
sustains the competitiveness of enterprises.</P>
      <P>The study covers 259 criteria grouped under eight competitiveness
input factors: domestic economy, internationalization, government,
finance, infrastructure, management, science and technology, and
people.</P>
      <P>International statistics and survey data from 4,300 business
policy-makers worldwide polled this year were used to arrive at the
latest rankings, the report said.</P>
      <P>For Singapore, the most significant change is that it came out on
top in the "people" category, in which it was placed fifth last year.
This category covers availability and qualifications of human
resources.</P>
      <P>In the domestic economy factor, it rose to second from third
previously.</P>
      <P>Singapore maintained its No. 1 position under "government" and
No. 2 under "internationalization" factors.</P>
      <P>But its rankings under the "finance and infrastructure" sectors
fell.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT SEES BARRIERS TO CROSS-STRAIT COOPERATION WEAKENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  21  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of a Canadian think tank said
Tuesday that barriers to cooperation between Taiwan and mainland
China under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum will begin to
weaken and diminish.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Dr. William Saywell, president and CEO
of the Asia-Pacific Foundation of Canada, said that the economies of
Taiwan and mainland China have gradually become integrated.</P>
      <P>With the new leadership in Beijing focusing its efforts on
economic growth, there will be greater cooperation between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait as Taipei and Beijing become more and more
pragmatic, Saywell said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's entrepreneurs not only have invested huge amounts in
mainland China but also are buying assets in such Southeast Asian
countries as Thailand and Indonesia, he pointed out, saying that this
is an indication of Taiwan's solid financial strength.</P>
      <P>Saywell and other foundation executives were in Ottawa for a
seminar on Asia's financial crisis. Prominent representatives from
government agencies, academia, business and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) focused discussions on the human and social
dimensions of the current crisis. They also exchanged views on what
Canada can do to help alleviate the human suffering in the region.</P>
      <P>Some experts warned that the economic crisis in Indonesia,
magnified by a severe drought, could develop into a "major human
crisis" with problems of starvation and a breakdown in social
services.</P>
      <P>Other policy makers, NGO leaders and officers of international
financial institutions were more optimistic that programs now in
place under the International Monetary Fund will lead to a slow
recovery.</P>
      <P>However, all agreed that the future of the Suharto government is

    <HEADLINE>NAVY DENIES SPRATLYS MISSILE SPEEDBOAT BASE REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC military on Wednesday denied a
newspaper report that it will build a missile speedboat base in the
disputed Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The Navy General Headquarters (NGH) dismissed the report as
"sheer speculation," saying the the Navy has not set aside budget for
such a project in its work plan for the next fiscal year, which
begins on July 1, 1998.</P>
      <P>The NGH said in a press release that the Navy only has a
makeshift wharf on Taiping Island, the largest island in the Spratly
chain. The pier, completed in 1984, was partially damaged by a
tropical storm in 1990. The wharf has never been fully repaired, but
the damage has not hindered shipment of military supplies or
equipment to the Taiwan-held island in the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the NGH said, the Marine Corps Headquarters has
recently made an overture on repair and renovation of the wharf to
save manpower in military supply transportation.</P>
      <P>"The Navy headquarters is still evaluating the return on
investment of the repair project," the NGH said, adding that even if
the project is implemented, it will not include the establishment of
a missile speedboat base or wharf on Taiping Island as the media had
reported.</P>
      <P>Construction projects in the Spratlys are usually deemed highly
sensitive because the island chain is claimed wholly or in part by
Brunei, mainland China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and
Taiwan. The Spratlys, a cluster of some 60 islets, are believed to
lie amid valuable gas and oil deposits, and also strddle important
international shipping lanes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAN'S M'LAND TRIP NOT RENEWAL OF CROSS-STRAIT TALKS: BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The visit of Jan Jyh-horng, deputy
secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), to the
Chinese mainland will be an exchange of views about activities across
the Taiwan Strait, not a resumption of talks between the two sides, a
mainland official involved with Taiwan affairs said on Wednesday,
stressing that the talks should be restarted with political
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Whether this attitude will be a factor in the first formal
cross-strait discussion since June 1995 is worthy of close attention.</P>
      <P>Jan left for Beijing Wednesday morning at the head of a Taiwan
delegation to discuss the resumption of cross-strait exchanges,
reciprocal visits and dialogue. Meanwhile, a mainland Chinese
official involved with Taiwan affairs said in Beijing via a Hong
Kong-based newspaper, Wen Wei Bao, that the upcoming contact between
the SEF and its counterpart, the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will just be an exchange
of views about activities across the strait, not a restart of the
talks.</P>
      <P>The official said that a restart of the talks must involve
political negotiations. "It is doubtless that political negotiations
have always been and still are the most important task under our
strenuous work," remarked the official, adding that "we will continue
our effort to enhance the exchanges and cooperation between the two
sides prior to the procedural discussions for the political
negotiations."</P>
      <P>He said he believes that since Jan's current trip to Beijing is
aimed at paving the way for SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu's mainland
visit, the contact between the SEF and ARATS will be limited to
protocol matters.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added that during the contacts and exchanges
between the two semi-official intermediary bodies, an informal
exchange of views on procedural discussions for political
negotiations cannot be ruled out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF'S MAINLAND CHINA TRIP TO PAVE WAY FOR HIGH-LEVEL VISITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), Chang King-yuh, said on Wednesday that he
hopes the visit by a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) delegation to
mainland China will help herald a new era in cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng
left for mainland China at the head of the eight-member SEF
delegation.</P>
      <P>Chang said the delegation expects to exchange opinions on
procedural issues with the mainland Chinese side in order to pave the
way for visits by higher-level SEF personnel.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's stance is that bilateral negotiations should start from
the point they had reached before being suspended in 1995 by Beijing,
and that discussions on consensus reached in previous talks should
continue, the MAC head stressed, adding that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should maintain contact to keep dialogue channels open.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks following his attendance of a seminar on
ways to strengthen contacts between Taiwan and Hong Kong people.</P>
      <P>Jan's visit is the first of its kind in nearly three years after
mainland China unilaterally cut regular talks between the SEF and its
mainland Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- following a visit to the United States
by President Lee Teng-hui in June 1995.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized to
deal with bilateral exchanges in the absence of direct
government-to-government contacts. Taiwan and the mainland have been
divided since 1949 after a civil war which saw the defeat of the
Nationalist government by communist forces.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, MAC spokesman Hsu Ke-sheng
expressed the hope that Jan's visit will lead to the resumption of
regular SEF-ARATS exchanges, adding that rekindling institutionalized
negotiations is of great importance for both Taiwan and mainland
China and that the two sides should reopen talks based on the
foundation laid during previous negotiations.</P>
      <P>Hsu welcomed the recent moves adopted by Beijing in response to
Taiwan's repeated calls for a resumption of cross-strait exchanges,
saying that the two sides should expand bilateral activities on a
gradual basis.</P>
      <P>He said Jan's mainland visit may suggest a warming of
cross-strait ties, but pointed out that additional efforts will be
needed if the two sides are to fully resume regular exchanges and
negotiations. Taiwan sincerely desires that future developments in
cross-strait relations can proceed in a positive direction under
the framework achieved in the past, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY PROVIDES HOPE FOR LIVER CANCER VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new photodynamic therapy (PDT) which has
been proved clinically efficacious in the treatment of hepatitis and
hepatoma in ducks may also be an effective cure for hepatitis and
cancer in humans, sources in National Taiwan University's College of
Medicine reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Professor Kao Ming-chien, head of the NTU medical research team
which carried out the tests, said the new PDT treatment, which uses a
laser to kill photosensitized infected cells, has been found to be
effective in killing hepatitis virus and cancer cells in duck livers.</P>
      <P>PDT, also known as photoradiation therapy (PRT), might also be an
effective treatment for hepatitis and liver cancer in humans, as the
DNA polymerase of the B-type hepatitis liver-tropic virus found in
ducks is very similar to the virus that affects humans, Kao explained
in a press conference on Wednesday held at the National Science
Council, which sponsored the research.</P>
      <P>Clinical trials on humans are expected to begin soon, providing a
ray of hope for Taiwan's many hepatitis and hepatoma patients, as
most existing treatments incur nasty side-effects, Kao noted.</P>
      <P>According to medical records, roughly 80 percent of Taiwan's
population have been affected by B-type hepatitis, with 15 to 20
percent of them ending up as carriers of the disease. An attack of
hepatitis B causes severe scarring of the liver tissue, which very
often leads to complications such as cancer in later life.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, as many as 5,700 people die of liver cancer every
year, putting the affliction at the top of a long list of cancers
which kill the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>PDT treatment involves researchers injecting the subject
intravenously with a photosensitive solution, most of which is
discharged through the circulation within 24 hours while some remains
in the infected or cancerous liver cells. The researchers can then
identify the affected cells and use a laser to destroy them.</P>
      <P>Following the PDT or PRT treatment on ducks, Kao said, as high as
82 percent to 99 percent of the hepatitis virus were killed, while 62
percent to 78 percent of the hepatoma cells were destroyed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading Taiwan negotiator left for
mainland China on Wednesday for a low-profile visit to pave the way
for resuming regular dialogue across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, a deputy secretary-general of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said prior to his departure that
his three-day Beijing visit is aimed at helping the two sides better
understand each other's basic stance on future cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Jan's visit was of great significance as it was the first
high-level contact between the SEF and its mainland counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), after a
nearly three-year freeze on such kind of exchange.</P>
      <P>While in Beijing, Jan said he will exchange views with ARATS
officials on how to expand engagements between the two intermediary
bodies to forge cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that the visit will eventually lead to
reopening of institutionalized exchanges and consultations between
the SEF and ARATS," Jan stressed, adding that he expects the visit
to be an important step toward closer ties.</P>
      <P>Jan was scheduled to hold a working dinner with ARATS Deputy
Secretary-General Li Iafei on Wednesday to set the agenda for
bilateral talks on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jan was accompanied by seven other SEF officials, including
Hsieh Fu-yuan, director of the leagal service department; and Tsai
Chin-mei, deputy director of the travel service department. The
group is scheduled to return to Taipei on Friday.</P>
      <P>Jan's visit was the culmination of months of letters exchanges,
and came after Beijing dropped its insistence that Taiwan discuss
sensitive political issues. Taiwan has consistently wanted to resume
talks on practical issues, saying starting with the less sensitive
topics could nurture the atmosphere for discussions on political
matters at a later stage.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended talks on practical issues with
Taiwan in mid-1995 in anger over a Taiwan campaign to upgrade its
international profile that cultimated in a visit to the United States
by President Lee Teng-hui in June that year.</P>
      <P>Though the road to cross-strait rapprochement is bound to be
bumpy, Taiwan hopes Jan's visit will lead to a second summit meeting
between the top negotiators from the two sides.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman C. F. Koo and his ARATS counterpart, Wang Daohan,
held a historic summit meeting in Singapore in April 1993, better
known as the first Koo-Wang meeting, to lay a framework for
bilateral exchanges in the absence of official ties. A second
Koo-Wang meeting was being planned at the time when Beijing
unilaterally froze bilateral talks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China and Paraguay are the only
countries among the 84 invited to participate in the July Mathematics
Olympiad in Taiwan which have yet to decide whether to take part in
the international competition.</P>
      <P>A special commission dealing with preparations for the contest
opened its third workshop in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chen-tai, chairman of the ROC National Science Council, and
Education Minister Lin Ching-chiang, jointly hosted the workshop,
during which a report was released on the preparations to date by
Chen Chao-ti, dean of the College of Science of National Taiwan
Normal University and a member of the Institute of Mathematics of the
Republic of China, which is sponsoring the competition.</P>
      <P>Chen said that they have sent an invitation to mainland China's
Mathematics Society, which responded by saying it is still awaiting
official approval for the contest to go ahead in Taipei on July
10-21.</P>
      <P>In Paraguay's case, Chen told the commission financial straits
might be preventing the Central American country from participating,
and suggested providing it with financial support to allow it to take
part.</P>
      <P>Walter E. Meintka, the visiting secretary-general of the
consulting committee of the International Mathematics Olympiad
contest, also attended the workshop, during which he said he is
satisfied with Taiwan's preparations.</P>
      <P>The contest for schoolchildren from around the world is aimed at
discovering, inspiring, and challenging the students' potential in
the scientific field, and to act as a cradle for leaders in the field
of mathematics.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that the ROC has been granted the right to
sponsor the contest. Taiwan first took part in the annual mathematics
competition in 1992.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, the island has ranked an average 10th
position in the contest, with its best performance in 1993 when it
reached fifth place.</P>
      <P>The mathematics Olympiad was held for the first time 1959, and
involved only four countries -- Czechoslovakia, Poland, former East
Germany and host Romania. After more than 30 years of development,
the number of participating countries has greatly increased, and
there are also international physics and chemistry Olympiads, but
they are held separately on different dates, with different nations
taking part.</P>

      <P>A man was arrested Wednesday morning at
Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport for trying to smuggle
a large quantity of firearms into the country, aviation police said.</P>
      <P>Police said the man, identified as 58-year-old Tseng Shou-yen,
had returned to Taiwan from Los Angeles on an Eva Airlines flight
when an X-ray machine disclosed 10 pistols, 19 magazines and 50
rounds of powerful ammunition hidden in his golf bags and luggage.</P>
      <P>Police said they found it incredible that Tseng could make it
through the system of security checks at the US airport carrying such

security officials to learn more about how he was able to evade
airport security and board the plane.</P>
      <P>Tseng said during an initial arraignment that he was commissioned

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh said on Wednesday that Hong Kong's future regarding
democracy and human rights remains to be seen, despite the fact that
Beijing has not interfered a great deal in local affairs since the
return of the former British colony to mainland China's rule in July
1997.</P>
      <P>Chang issued the warning in a speech at a seminar on ways to
enhance bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The head of the Cabinet-level MAC, Taiwan's highest government
agency in charge of the island's policy toward mainland China, said
the long-term development of democracy and human rights in Hong Kong
remains worrisome, pointing to the small number of seats reserved for
directly elected representatives in the first post-handover
legislative election slated for May.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Republic of China government hopes Hong Kong will
be permitted to retain its free economic system and high level of
autonomy, allowing the local people to continue enjoying basic civic
rights. But concern over the current political situation in Hong Kong
has prompted the ROC government to maintain a low profile and
service-oriented presence there, he noted.</P>
      <P>In an effort to illustrate Taiwan's desire for increased
exchanges with Hong Kong, Chang repeated a call urging the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region government and the mainland authorities
to install a special task force and set up institutionalized
communication channels to deal with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added that the ROC government would also welcome
the establishment of a Hong Kong representative office in Taiwan to
better serve people traveling between the two sides.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and Hong Kong have always maintained close links in
almost every field, Chang stressed the importance of both governments

      <P>The army will from now on conduct its
missile test firing in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County rather than
at its previous testing range in the northern Taipei suburb of
Tamsui, Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman Kung Fan-ting
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kung said Pingtung County's Chioupeng base will be used for
testing for the first time on Thursday with the test firing of two
Hawk missiles.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the test firing of the low altitude air defense
missiles is part of annual routine drills, and he urged the public
not to speculate over the matter.</P>
      <P>As the test firing comes at a sensitive time, with the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait preparing to revive their long-stalled talks,
the MND is handling the issue in a very low-key manner and is being
open with its explanations of related details to the media.</P>
      <P>Kung pointed out a number of factors which have rendered the old
Tamsui missile testing range unsuitable, including the fact that
civilian air and sea traffic has increased in recent years, making it
harder to keep the test area clear during firing exercises.</P>
      <P>In addition, land development for a new town in Tamsui has
prompted the MND to shift its test firing range to the Pingtung base,
which is in a more sparsely populated area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE FIRM ORDERED TO REINSTATE SACKED WORKERS TO END DOCK WAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 22 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian Federal Court has ordered
Patrick Stevedores Ltd. to reinstate all 2,000 union workers it fired
and to stop using non-union labor in its major ports across Australia
so that the current waterfront battle can be ended.</P>
      <P>The court meted out the order Tuesday.</P>
      <P>But Patrick, which is at the center of the dock war, immediately
appealed against the court ruling, with the company's chairman, Chris
Corrigan, calling the court order "unworkable" and saying that he now
faces two groups of workers -- the reinstated union workers and the
non-union workers.</P>
      <P>"These are the preliminary views of a single judge," Corrigan
said. "I believe His Honor (Justice Tony North) is wrong."</P>
      <P>After hearing the Federal Court decision, the Federal Government
under Prime Minister John Howard rejected the court judgment, saying
the government will continue its hard-line approach to waterfront
reform.</P>
      <P>Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith said he is determined to
bust the monopoly of the waterfront by the Maritime Union of
Australia (MUA), the powerful union group behind the campaign against
Patrick and the Howard government.</P>
      <P>"The wharfies had won round one in front of Justice Tony North
and ultimately lost it at the end of the day," Reith told reporters.</P>
      <P>The MUA and its union members hailed the Federal Court decision
Tuesday and they were jubilant with the initial victory in their
fight against both Patrick and the Howard government.</P>
      <P>But the jobs of the 1,400 full-time workers and 600 part-time
laborers were still in doubt Wednesday despite the court order
because Patrick is attempting to outflank the decision.</P>
      <P>The weapon Patrick is using is that its four subsidiaries, which
now technically employ the sacked workers, are unlikely to function
-- even if Patrick offers them ships to load.</P>
      <P>The four subsidiaries have become insolvent and will not get a
cash flow from Patrick, which has shifted all its assets to the Lang
Corp., its parent company.</P>
      <P>The MUA workers said they will return to work at Patrick's
terminals without pay for two weeks so the insolvent subsidiaries can
get a cash flow going again.</P>
      <P>Industry analysts said they believe the waterfront war will
continue either at major terminals, which have become battlegrounds
in the past two weeks, or in the courts.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 22 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is the most expensive among 13
industrialized countries for both local and international phone
calls, according to a new study by an independent analyst, NUS
International.</P>
      <P>While other countries have reduced their local and international
call rates, Australia is one of the five countries that have
maintained local phone call rates at peak levels, according to the
survey, which covers the period between Feb. 1, 1997 and Feb. 1,
1998.</P>
      <P>The cost of a three-minute local call in Australia was A$0.23
(US$0.15) in February 1998, unchanged from the same period in 1997.
The rate for a three-minute international call was A$3.08 in
Australia in February 1998, down 4 percent from a year earlier. Both
were the highest rates among the 13 countries.</P>
      <P>Belgium reduced its local call rate to A$0.20 in February 1998, a
drop of 2.4 percent from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Britain has maintained its local rate at the same level as that
of Belgium.</P>
      <P>Trailing Britain in the local call category are Germany, Sweden,
France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and the United
States.</P>
      <P>Canada was the only country in the survey providing free local
phone calls.</P>
      <P>In the international phone category, Australia took the lead as
the most expensive country for international phone calls.</P>
      <P>Japan came second in international phone call rates, with A$2.94
per three minutes in February 1998, down nearly 26 percent from the
1997 level.</P>
      <P>Germany was third, followed by the United States, Italy, Belgium,
New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden, Canada and France.</P>
      <P>In the international phone call category, Britain was the
cheapest, with only A$1.01 per three minutes.</P>
      <P>The main reason behind the high cost of local and international
phone calls in Australia is government protection for the state-owned
Telstra.</P>
      <P>Optus, a privately owned telecommunications firm, is trying to
break through Telstra's monopoly and plans to offer cheaper local
phone calls.</P>
      <P>But industry sources said they believe even though Optus is
expected to provide cheaper calls, the reduction will be limited,
given the current level of government protection for Telstra.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOO: CROSS-STRAIT CONTACT SHOULD BE RESUMED</HEADLINE>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), on Wednesday called for a resumption of
contact between the SEF and its Beijing-based counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after attending a meeting of the ruling
Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the departure Wednesday of a mission to the Chinese
mainland led by SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng, Koo said
he hopes the trip will bring a new atmosphere to cross-strait
relations. He added that he believes Jan will be able to accomplish
that goal.</P>
      <P>According to Koo, in the process of ever-expanding contacts
between SEF and ARATS, there should be many opportunities for
exchanges of visits between the two sides. He indicated that he may
also lead a mission to visit the mainland in the future.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman said that through such visits both sides may
exchange views freely, allowing cross-strait negotiations to make an
early return to the institutionalized track.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) under the Executive
Yuan issued a statement on Wednesday expressing hope that Jan's visit
can serve as "an important step forward" in improving cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The statement noted that the chances for a resumption of the
long-stalled dialogue with Beijing are good. However, it also pointed
out that in order to reach the goal of full normalization of
exchanges and broad-based negotiations, joint efforts from both sides
of the strait are still needed.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the Republic of China has continuously
upheld the principles of peace, rationality, equity and reciprocity
in seeking mutually respectful and beneficial cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The MAC also expressed hope that relations across the Taiwan
Strait will continue to march toward normal development, using the
greatest areas of converging opinion as starting points. In this way,
the council's statement said, the mutual trust which has been
gradually eroded during the past two years of suspended contacts can
be re-established.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Hsu Ke-sheng said on Wednesday that the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) and the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
will join forces to help resolve the case of a Taiwan businessman
murdered in mainland China's Guangdong Province on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The SEF, Taiwan's semi-official organization authorized by the
Republic of China government to deal with mainland China in the
absence of official ties, said it has not received a report from the
victim's family and is seeking more information on the incident
through the relevant channels.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong newspaper reported on Wednesday that Lai Ming-yih, a
vice manager of a Taiwan-owned shoe factory in Dongwan, Guangdong
Province, was killed on Sunday by four men from Taiwan at a downtown
KTV parlor as a result of a quarrel over a waitress serving there.</P>
      <P>According to the newspaper, one of the four men, reportedly
members of Taiwan's Four Seas criminal gang, first opened fire at the
ceiling and Lai was later seriously stabbed with a broken bottle
during a fight with them.</P>
      <P>Lai was rushed to a nearby hospital where he later died, while
the four men fled the scene, according to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said all four were arrested on Tuesday, and cited
Guangdong public security officials who said the suspects might have
come to the mainland to avoid detention by Taiwan police authorities.</P>
      <P>CIB Director Yang Tzu-ching said the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should increase cooperative measures to crack down on similar
criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan and the mainland signed the Kinmen Agreement in
1990 to handle the repatriation of criminals wanted by either side,
Yang said the two sides still lack adequate channels for coordinated
crime-fighting efforts.</P>
      <P>If the four men are known criminals or alleged gangsters wanted
by Taiwan police, the CIB, with the help of the SEF and its mainland
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait,
will provide relevant information to mainland public security
authorities to ensure they are brought back to Taiwan to face
justice, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Lai's remains came back to Taiwan on Wednesday afternoon on board
a China Airlines flight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS URGED TO INVEST IN HAITI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official from the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce on Wednesday urged local textile
manufacturers to invest in Haiti as an effective means of cutting
operational costs.</P>
      <P>Wang Chung-yu, convener of the association's Central and Southern
American Affairs Committee, made the remarks in a seminar on trade
and investment in Haiti on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Taiwan businessmen can take advantage of the
Caribbean nation's superb geographical location, in proximity to both
North and South America, to make inroads into new markets in those
regions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$11.125 million worth of goods to Haiti last
year. The main items included woven and knitted wear as well as
plastic products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported only US$21,000 of goods from that nation in 1997,
mostly coral, women's blouses and men's T-shirts.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Vice Foreign Minister Francisco Ou
conceded that Haiti, dubbed the "Pearl of the Antilles, is
geographically distant from Taiwan. However, as it has no foreign
currency controls and lies near the major US city of Miami, Florida,
it holds plenty of potential for local businessmen.</P>
      <P>Ou said local textile and manufacturing industries are most
suited to investing in Haiti, adding that the ROC government can
provide assistance in that regard.</P>
      <P>Haitian President Rene Preval, who arrived here Tuesday for a
four-day visit, said in the meeting with local manufacturers that
participants at the recently concluded second Summit of the Americas
had decided to discuss the creation of a regional free trade area in
September.</P>
      <P>Preval predicted such a zone could be established by the year
2005, and said Taiwan businessmen can have great trade opportunities
if they invest now.</P>
      <P>Haiti is one of the 29 nations that maintain diplomatic relations
with the Republic of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WRECKAGE FROM FUSELAGE OF FORMOSA AIRLINES DISCOVERED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After more than one month of combing the
seabed for wreckage from an ill-fated Formosa Airlines flight which
crashed on March 18, a search team on Wednesday discovered part of
the plane's fuselage in waters off Hsinchu County in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A Formosa Airlines spokesman said that the deep-sea search team
from the United States located the wreckage early Wednesday some two
nautical miles off the Nanliao Fishing Harbor in Hsinchu County. He
indicated that the section of the fuselage is between 15 and 20
meters in length.</P>
      <P>The seriously twisted metal portion of the Saab-340 plane can be
clearly seen in video footage taken by the search team. The salvage
work will begin on Thursday and is not expected to be completed until
sometime Friday due to the size of the wreckage.</P>
      <P>Authorities hope the portion of fuselage will help explain the
cause of the crash because the aircraft's black box data recorder has
yet to be recovered. Formosa Airlines said that it will continue
efforts to locate the black box from the 36-seat airliner, which
crashed only minutes after its takeoff from Hsinchu Airport, killing
all 13 passengers and crew members onboard.</P>
      <P>So far the rescue team has reclaimed about 17 pieces of wreckage
of various sizes from the aircraft. Only small fragments of body
parts of the victims have been recovered. This has led to speculation
that the aircraft might have been hit in mid-air by an unidentified
object.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUR ALLIES LOBBY FOR ROC'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four ROC allies -- the Gambia, Grenada,
Nicaragua and Senegal -- have respectively asked the World Health
Organization (WHO) to grant observer status to the Republic of China
on Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reported on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The four allies have written to the WHO secretary-general
earlier this month, asking him to include a proposal to grant
observer status to the ROC on the agenda of the 51st annual WHO
conference scheduled for May 11-16 in Geneva," the ministry said in a
press release.</P>
      <P>The four countries pointed out in their letters that the ROC and
Brazil jointly took the initiative to push for the establishment of
the WHO in 1948. The ROC, however, was forced out of the
UN-affiliated organization in 1972, a year after it was expelled from
the United Nations to make way for mainland China.</P>
      <P>Despite its exclusion from the organization, the four allies
said, the ROC has continued to abide by all WHO regulations and
dedicate itself to international humanitarian relief and medical aid
over the past 26 years. The ROC has also played an important role in
upgrading the quality of medical services in Asia, the letters said.</P>
      <P>Noting that health care is not a political issue, the four ROC
allies stressed that such considerations ought not to play a role in
international health issues, nor should politics be used to exclude
members from the WHO. "In striving to attain the highest standard of
international health and to achieve the objectives set by the WHO,
every country has a role to play."</P>
      <P>The WHO currently has 192 member states. Top health officials of
all member countries are expected to attend the upcoming WHO annual
conference. The ROC has been denied access to the annual WHO congress
since 1972.</P>
      <P>The ROC expressed its intention to become a WHO observer for the
first time in 1997. Several of the ROC's diplomatic allies, including
Senegal, jointly introduced a motion asking the WHO congress to pass
a resolution inviting the ROC to attend its activities as an
observer. Because of Beijing's strong opposition, however, the
proposal was not included in last year's agenda.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it will continue to press
ahead with the WHO bid to exert the right of the ROC's 21.6 million
people to take part in international activities, and to uphold the
spirit, principles and universality of the WHO.</P>
      <P>The ministry also called a meeting on Wednesday afternoon to
discuss the strategy for promoting Taiwan's WHO bid. It also issued a
series of promotional papers pleading for sensitivity by the WHO for
the ROC's position.</P>
      <P>One of the ministry-prepared position papers said the WHO has
admitted as members such nonmember states of the UN as Switzerland,
Tonga, Nauru, Tuvalu and Kiribati. It has also welcomed as observers
the Holy See, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the
Palestine Liberation Organization and the Sovereignty Military Order
of Malta.</P>
      <P>"Is there any rationale for denying the people of Taiwan, the
ROC, basic human rights which are extended to the rest of the world,
and any justification for preventing them from exercising their
responsibilities as members of the global village?" the position
paper asked.</P>

according to reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ministers are scheduled to meet in Versailles, France, later

      <P>A Philippine coast guard patrol has
arrested five of ten suspected pirates holed up inside the engine
room of a cargo ship from which they had ransacked some one million
pesos-worth of spare parts and equipment, the coast guard's Manila
headquarters reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lieutenant Commander Tuazon said his men cornered the suspects
aboard the 4,000 ton M/V Madrigal Harmony anchored in Manila's South
Harbor, some 1.5 km offshore.</P>
      <P>Tuazon said the suspects were in the act of gathering the rest of
their loot when they were nabbed. Five other suspects hiding inside
the ship's engine room were surrounded by coast guard patrolmen.</P>
      <P>Tuazon said the suspects secretly boarded the vessel over the
weekend and dismantled engine parts and accessories. Most of the loot
was taken away aboard a motor boat.</P>
      <P>The ship, which has been undergoing repair since September 7,

"Taipei, China" designation used by the Republic of China delegation
at Asian Development Bank (ADB) events at the upcoming annual meeting
of that organization.</P>
      <P>Perng, who will lead a delegation to attend the April 30-May 2
meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, made the remarks after attending a
seminar in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The ROC, one of the founding members of the ADB, was forced to
change its title at ADB events to "Taipei, China" in 1986, in order
to facilitate the admission of mainland China into the organization.</P>
      <P>However, with the handover of ADB member Hong Kong to Beijing's
control last year, the Hong Kong delegation will attend this year's
and future meetings under the name "Hong Kong, China."</P>
      <P>The ROC participants have said the similarity of that name with
their own designation of "Taipei, China" is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent the ROC's status from being equated to that
of Hong Kong, it has been reported that the delegation headed by
Perng will strive have the ROC's formal name reinstated for ADB

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese National Federation of Industries
(CNFI) on Wednesday opposed vehemently to a proposed plan to cut the
working hours of labors to 40 hours per week.</P>
      <P>CNFI officials said that the government has to wait for the
time when the gross national product has reached US$20,000 before
considering to adjust the working hours of civil servants and
laborers.</P>
      <P>The civil servants and laborers, starting from Jan. 1, this
year, enjoy five-day work week every other two weeks.</P>
      <P>The officials said that with labor shortage
problems and limited amount of available foreign laborers, the
management could not afford to provide a shorter working hour plan.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the CNFI survey had found that if the
revised Basic Labor Law would cut the working hours from the current
48 hours to 40 hours, it will mean that the annual leaves of the
civil servants will increase from the current 96 days to 114 days,
while the annual leaves of the labor would increase to 115 days from
the current 71 days.</P>
      <P>Such a dramatic change would be a blow to large enterprises, not to
mention small- and medium-sized enterprises, they said.</P>
      <P>Even a report by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said that if a laborer's working hours cut to 40
hours per week from the current 48, it would incur a cost increase
to the management of 15 percent on per laborer. The revised working
hours would deal an even severe blow to over 80 percent of small- and
medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>CNFI officials said that Taiwan could learn from the experience
of Japan, which has taken 10 years to be able to implement five-day
week in 1992.</P>
      <P>They said that five-day week will not come in one leap, and that
a longer adjustment period is needed to give the management and the
labor time to adjust in reasonable stages.</P>
      <P>They also refuted the rhetoric by the Council of Labor Affairs
which said that Singapore could implement 44-hour per week and Japan
could implement 40-hour per week to show that the management in
Taiwan has been "unkind" to the laborers.</P>
      <P>They noted that Taiwan has put a brake on importing more
foreign laborers after only 300,000 foreign laborers. They are
concerned that with serious shortage of foreign laborers in basic
industry, the proposal to cut working hours would be tantamount
to putting fuel on fires.</P>
      <P>They had suggested that in reviewing to cut working hours per
week, the government should also review its foreign laborer policy.</P>

      <P>The Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI) on Wednesday vehemently opposed a plan to cut the
standard workweek for laborers to 40 hours.</P>
      <P>CNFI officials said that the government must wait until the per
capita gross national product has reached US$20,000 before it can
consider adjusting the working hours of civil servants and laborers.</P>
      <P>Starting from Jan. 1 this year, public employees and laborers
enjoy a five-day workweek on alternating weeks.</P>
      <P>The officials said that with Taiwan's labor shortage problems and
the limited amount of available foreign laborers, management cannot
afford to allow fewer working hours.</P>
      <P>They cited a report by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) which concluded that if working hours for laborers
were cut to 40 hours a week from the current 48, a 15 percent
increase in production costs per worker would be incurred by
management. Accordingly, the shorter workweek would deal a severe
blow to over 80 percent of small- and medium-sized enterprises, the
report said.</P>
      <P>CNFI officials said that Taiwan could learn from the experience
of Japan, which took 10 years to implement five-day week, a
process that culminated in 1992.</P>
      <P>They said a five-day workweek should not be introduced in a
single leap. Rather, a longer period is needed to give both
management and labor reasonable time to adjust in stages.</P>
      <P>The officials also refuted statements by the Council of Labor
Affairs, which alleged that if Singapore could function with a
44-hour workweek, and if Japan can allow its workers to spend only 40
hours on the job each week, then workers in Taiwan are being abused
by management.</P>
      <P>They noted that Taiwan has placed a ceiling of 300,000 on the
number of foreign laborers it allows, claiming that, given serious
labor shortages in basic industries, the proposal to cut working
hours would be adding fuel to the fire.</P>
      <P>They suggested that in reviewing the proposal to reduce the
standard workweek, the government should also review its policy on
the import of foreign laborers.</P>

      <P>The 10th ROC-Paraguay Economic Cooperation
Meeting will be held in Taipei on Thursday, according to the Ministry
of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The two-day meeting will be jointly presided over by ROC
Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and Paraguayan Minister of Trade
and Industry Atilio Fernandez.</P>
      <P>Discussions will center on bilateral cooperation in trade and
investment and between small- and medium-sized businesses of the two
countries as well as on agricultural cooperation and efforts in
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection.</P>
      <P>Economics officials said the fact that a huge haul of Taiwan-made

park in Oriental City, Paraguay, becomes operational by the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>They also said that at the meeting they will urge Paraguayan
authorities to tighten security in the industrial zone as part of

    <HEADLINE>FOUR INDUSTRIAL POWERS TO PROPOSE NEW TRADE TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trade ministers of the United States,
the European Union, Canada and Japan are expected to agree during
their forthcoming meeting to start a new round of multilateral trade
talks, according to reports from the World Trade Organization (WTO)
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ministers are scheduled to meet in Versailles later this
month.</P>
      <P>Faced with possible threat of protectionism in the wake of the
economic turmoil in Asia, the world's major industrial powers will
propose new negotiations to begin in May, when the WTO's second
ministerial meeting will be held here in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Under the 1994 agreement outlined during the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade talks, negotiations to deregulate agricultural
trading -- including tariffs on rice and services such as shipping
and legal practices -- are slated to begin in the year 2000, the WTO
report said.</P>
      <P>Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Mitsuo
Horiuchi will propose a new round of negotiations covering at least
four areas, including investment and tariffs on industrial products,
in addition to the two on agricultural trading and services, the WTO
report said.</P>
      <P>The EU is expected to urge worldwide trade partners to widen
discussions during the new round of talks to include issues such as
employment, competition and the environment. Canada is expected to
echo the EU proposal, the WTO report added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo, April 22 (CNA)
(By Chang Fang-min and Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A meeting to discuss the issue of World War
II-era sex slaves from Asian nations who were forced into service by
the Japanese Imperial Army ended on Wednesday with a resolution
requesting the government to address the lingering matter through
legislation in the Diet.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government was requested to admit the crime, make a
formal apology to the women, provide compensation as soon as
possible, reveal the historical truth in its educational textbooks,
and pass necessary laws to implement those measures.</P>
      <P>The decision was signed by Legislators Shih Ming-teh and Kao
Hui-yu from the Republic of China, Wang Ching-fung, adviser to the
Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, a group of lawmakers from South
Korea and the Philippines, and representatives from eight civic
organizations from South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>A copy of the resolution was presented to four officials from the
Japanese Foreign Ministry who promised to deliver it to appropriate
authorities.</P>
      <P>Shih, who has frequently voiced his disappointment over Tokyo's
refusal to directly address the issue, pointed out at a press
conference after the meeting that Taiwan has no demands from Japan
other than that justice should be done. He appealed to the Japanese
people and media to express their concern over the problem.</P>
      <P>Kao suggested that there should be a two-pronged solution to the
lingering issue involving international lawsuits on one hand, and the
passage of relevant laws in the Japanese Diet on the other.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has confirmed that there are 45 so-called
comfort women still living in Taiwan who were forced into
prostitution by the Japanese army during World War II. In South Korea
there are 152 known survivors of the ordeal, and 169 in the
Philippines. There are hundreds of victims in other Asian countries,
not to mention the thousands of women who have since died.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The trend that has seen more consumers in
Japan purchasing metallic furniture for home decoration offers a
great opportunity for Taiwan businesses in that sector to strengthen
market presence there, the China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been one of Japan's largest sources of imported
furniture, although the products going to that country are mostly
constructed of rattan and other woods, according to the council.</P>
      <P>However, CETRA said the more traditional wooden items have slowly
been replaced by modern-style furnishings constructed of metal over
the past few years. Accordingly, trade figures show surging orders

      <P>Mainland dissident Wang Dan said
in an interview that he hopes the day he can return to mainland China
will come soon.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in an interview with the Voice of America
before he left for New York from Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The broadcast interview provided the first opportunity for
millions of listeners in the mainland to heard his voice. He was
released from mainland prison last week on grounds of poor health
and sent directly to the Detroit for two days of medical evaluations.</P>
      <P>Wang said, "I feel heaviness in my heart even though I have
gained my freedom, because my real mission in life lies in China."</P>
      <P>Saying he feels "responsible for the democracy and freedom of the
people in China," Wang expressed hope of returning to the mainland as
soon as circumstances permits.</P>
      <P>"I hope that day will come soon, and only when that day comes
will I be happy," the 29-year-old dissident said.</P>
      <P>Wang Linyun, the mother of Wang Dan, said in an interview from
the mainland that she was happy for her son's release, but at the
same time felt sorrow because he had to go into exile.</P>
      <P>She said that Wang had agreed to leave the mainland because he
worried about the health of his parents and could not bear to see
them travel the long distance from Beijing to the prison where he was
confined in northeastern China to visit him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS RISING DISCONTENT WITH POLICY TOWARD M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Discontent with the government's cautious
policy toward rival mainland China has risen significantly in recent
months, according to opinion poll results released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 921 adults, conducted by the United Daily
News (UDN) on April 20-22, found that the number of respondents who
said they are dissatisfied with the government's mainland policy has
increased by 6 percent compared with the level recorded in a similar
survey taken in mid-February.</P>
      <P>As many as 41 percent of those interviewed said they were not
satisfied with the government's current mainland policy, while only
34 percent gave a thumbs-up to the government's stance.</P>
      <P>The percentage of naysayers was the highest ever registered in
UDN surveys on the topic. In contrast, the number of proponents
dropped 4 percent. Twenty-three percent said they have no opinion
about the issue.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show there are more supporters than
opponents for opening direct shipping services across the Taiwan
Strait, adjusting the "no haste, be patient" policy, offering
exchanges of military drill information and strengthening news
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the survey found that many local people still worry
about the possible adverse impact on Taiwan's national security of
such sensitive areas of contact with the mainland as direct
cross-strait shipping services and exchanges of military drill
information.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 46 percent said they are dissatisfied with the present
pace of cross-strait exchanges, compared to 38 percent who defend the
status quo. The majority of respondents, 72 percent, also said they
hope cross-strait exchanges will increase further, while 10 percent
prefer to see a cut in such exchanges and 5 percent want to see the
status quo maintained.</P>
      <P>On the upgrading of cross-strait interchanges, 62 percent said
they support opening of official contacts, while 19 percent oppose
the proposal.</P>
      <P>Some 60 percent of those surveyed also said the government should
ease its "no haste, be patient" investment policy toward mainland
China, but 19 percent prefer to maintain the current policy of
caution.</P>
      <P>On the future development of cross-strait relations, survey
results show that the local people remain split on the urgency of
opening direct shipping services. While 40 percent feel an urgent
need to open such services, a roughly equal number of respondents
said they do not think the issue needs to be addressed immediately.</P>
      <P>However, the number of respondents who favor an early opening of
direct shipping services rose to 51 percent from 43 percent recorded
in a similar poll conducted early last year. In contrast, the number
of opponents declined from 37 percent to 32 percent.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 47 percent support Premier Vincent
Siew's recent call for the establishment of a framework for
exchanging military drill information with the mainland, but 35
percent were not in favor of his making the overture and 16 percent
did not answer the question.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan should allow mainland reporters to work here
on a long-term basis, 56 percent said the dispatch of resident
correspondents should be opened on a reciprocal basis; 7 percent said
Taiwan could unilaterally take the initiative to open its door to
resident mainland journalists; while 24 percent categorically oppose
the notion.</P>
      <P>On mainland China's recent decision to issue passports to Taiwan
businesspeople, 42 percent said they would be unlikely to apply for a
mainland passport even if they had business interests there; 29
percent said they would; and 17 percent they might apply.</P>
      <P>As far as the US attitude toward the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is concerned, 62 percent said they feel the United States
usually leans toward the mainland, while 10 percent said they feel
the opposite and 9 percent said they think Washington upholds a
neutral position.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTEL TO CENTER ASIA-PACIFIC TECH OPERATIONS IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Intel Corp., the world's leading maker of
chips for personal computers (PCs), will continue to support Taiwan
as its technology hub in the Asia-Pacific region, a company spokesman
said in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>John Davies, newly appointed general manager of Intel's
Asia-Pacific operations who arrived in Taipei on Wednesday for a
short visit, said the region is poised to become the global center
for computer research and development.</P>
      <P>Davies, who is also an Intel vice president, said Taiwan has been
one of the most important operational bases in the Asia-Pacific area
for his company, which will continue to utilize the island as its
regional technology center.</P>
      <P>Current Intel operations in Taiwan include marketing and sourcing
as well as research and development of new products. The prime movers
of the Taiwan-based Intel R&amp;D efforts currently include a laboratory
for desktop PCs and portable information technology (IT) products,
and an application and manufacturing technology research task force.</P>
      <P>Davies also disclosed that Intel chairman Andy Grove will make a
four-day visit to Taiwan next month, when he will officiate at the
1998 Asia-Pacific High Technology Forum slated for May 11-12 in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Several hundred representatives from high-technology companies in
the region are expected to take part in the forum that will highlight
the latest research and development trends in computer-related
industries.</P>
      <P>In addition to delivering a keynote speech to the forum, Grove,
who founded Intel and turned it into a global computer chip kingdom,
will also take time to meet with CEOs of leading Asia-Pacific IT
companies during his stay in Taipei, according to Davies.</P>
      <P>Davies said the Asia-Pacific's 17 percent growth rate in the PC
market is the fastest in the world. Regional sales of PCs will exceed
11 million units this year, with the volume doubling to 22 million
units over five years, he predicted.</P>
      <P>Davies noted that the strenuous development of electronic
infrastructures and proliferation of web users have become prevailing
global trends, and that 60 percent of the world's motherboards and 40
percent of the PCs originate from the Asia-Pacific. "I cannot think
of any reason that would prevent the Asia-Pacific region from
becoming the worldwide PC development center," Davies said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of unemployed in Taiwan
registered at 223,000 in March, indicating that the local jobless
situation has taken a turn for the better, the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said the number of employed members of the
nation's overall workforce hit nearly 9.3 million in March, up about
173,000 from the same month last year. Among those, the number of
workers who are university graduates or post-graduates topped 1
million to reach 1.01 million.</P>
      <P>The officials said the jobless rate in March was cut by 0.45 
percent from the same period of last year, or by 0.47 percent with
adjustment for seasonal factors.</P>
      <P>The officials said unemployment eased in March because the
numbers of jobless created by the completion of seasonal or
short-term contracts and the closure or downsizing of businesses had
decreased.</P>
      <P>All age groups in the workforce also witnessed a decline in March
unemployment figures. Among them, the jobless rate dropped to 6.05
percent in the 15-24 age group. The jobless rate for the 25-49
age group registered at 2.02 percent, down 0.4 percent from March
1997.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The rate of international calls will be
cut starting May 1, according to Chen Yao, chairman of the Chung Hwa
Telecommunications Co.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Thursday when he fielded questions at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said rate cut will differ from region to region, noting that
the reduction will be greatest for calls to Singapore, Japan and
South Korea. Calls to those countries will see a cut of 20 percent
for regular hours and a cut of 16.7 percent for discount hours.</P>
      <P>Call rates to the United Kingdom, France and other European
nations will also be cut by 20 percent and 14.3 percent for regular
and discount hours, respectively.</P>
      <P>Connections to New Zealand and Australia will be cut by 3.4
percent during regular hours, but will remain unchanged during
discount hours, Chen said, adding that rates for those two nations
are already low.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Chung Hwa has cut the rate of international calls
twice in the past two years, and that Taiwan's rates were ranked 10th
worldwide in terms of economy, cheaper even than in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>But with the financial crisis in mid-1997 resulting in the
depreciation of several Asian currencies, Taiwan's call rates have
become higher in comparison. Chung Hwa has therefore decided to cut
the rate again, Chen added.</P>
      <P>He also said that Chung Hwa would take a three-month evaluation
period to determine whether to cut the rate for calls made by

    <HEADLINE>HK GOV'T TO REESTABLISH POLITICAL DEPARTMENT: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, April 23 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) plans to reestablish a colonial-era
department to collect information for it and to coordinate with the
intelligence systems of Beijing, said the Hong Kong-based Oriental
Daily News on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The reestablishment of the "Political Department" comes as no
surprise, the daily pointed out, noting that mainland China's
Ministry of State Security had earlier sent officials to Hong Kong to
discuss the matter. The HKSAR government is currently testing Hong
Kong residents' reaction to the measure in order to decide whether to
establish the department openly or make it operate more
surreptitiously.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Ministry of State Security has taken a direct
role in the matter because the Beijing authorities believe that Hong
Kong, as a gateway to mainland China, must do something to guard
against potential enemies, according to the daily.</P>
      <P>The idea of establishing a political department in the HKSAR has
progressed to the point, the daily indicated further, that a study on
the framework for the organization and its division of labor was
already underway.</P>
      <P>During Hong Kong's days under British rule, the police department
had a "Special Branch" that outsiders dubbed the "political
department." Although this branch was under the control of the police
department in name, in reality it was responsible directly to the
governor of Hong Kong and to British army intelligence.</P>
      <P>During the colonial period, the Special Branch had up to 5,000
employees and a wide sphere of operations, including exchanging
intelligence with the European and American intelligence agencies,
engaging in counter-terrorism measures, monitoring Taiwan's
activities in Hong Kong, evaluating the job-related ethics of the
high-ranking officials of the Hong Kong government, screening the
backgrounds of Hong Kong's policemen and protecting Hong Kong
government VIPs.</P>
      <P>After the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in December
1984, the British government decided to abolish the Special Branch.
It was formally disbanded at the end of June 1995, thus depriving the
Hong Kong government of intelligence collection.</P>
      <P>The HKSAR government is expected to reestablish the political
department after the model used in pre-handover Hong Kong, with the
chief executive of the HKSAR, Tung Chee Hwa, in direct control of the
agency, said the daily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMBIGUOUS PICTURE OF FREE SPEECH IN M'LAND CHINA: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly nine years after the Tiananmen
Square massacre, intellectuals, dissidents and human rights officials
paint an ambiguous picture of the state of free speech in mainland
China, said The Baltimore Sun Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The newspaper reported from Beijing that the world notices the
high-profile release of prominent dissidents such as Wang Dan, sent
into exile last weekend, but at the same time Beijing has been
quietly ordering fresh arrests of their lesser-known comrades.</P>
      <P>Monday, for instance, a Hong Kong-based human rights group
announced that a mainland court sentenced democracy activist Wang
Tingjin to two years in a labor camp for meeting secretly with a
US-based dissident in February.</P>
      <P>Some say that in the wake of Deng Xiaoping's death last year,
Beijing seems more willing to let people discuss such issues as human
rights and political reform. Others note that the authoritarian
regime continues to jail those who directly challenge it and that it
keeps a tight grip on the media.</P>
      <P>The Sun noted that such is the murky nature of political freedom
in mainland China that dissident Qin Yongmin can find solace in the
fact that the government allows him to write a newsletter publicizing
Beijing's continuing efforts to arrest and harass his fellow
dissidents.</P>
      <P>In university lecture halls and magazines recently, professors
and writers have also been testing government limits by speaking out
on the need for human rights and the need to develop a new system of
government accountable to the citizens. Similar talk in the past
resulted in harassment and jail.</P>
      <P>Economist Mao Yushi, who recently spoke about the need for
greater personal freedom to students at a Beijing university, called
this "a very important change."</P>
      <P>But other intellectuals remain skeptical, noting that the
apparent thaw seems largely confined to college campuses and think
tanks.</P>
      <P>The Baltimore newspaper told its readership that over the
decades, mainland China has experienced periods of openness only to
be followed by crackdowns. It cited the Tiananmen Square massacre in
1989, following Deng allowing people to hang posters on a Beijing
brick wall -- dubbed "Democracy Wall" -- criticizing Communist Party
policies in 1978, as an example.</P>
      <P>The release of Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan is seen
as a goodwill gesture two months before President Bill Clinton is to
arrive in Beijing for a summit -- the first visit by a US president
since the 1989 massacre. But Wang, like another dissident, Wei
Jingsheng, had to agree to live in exile in the United States.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the newspaper pointed out, anyone looking for the
most recent example of state media control need only look at the
newspapers. No word of Wang's release has appeared in the
Chinese-language press in Beijing, it said.</P>
      <P>Shang Dewen, a professor of economics at Beijing University, who
sent an essay to Jiang Zemin last summer about free elections and
political reform, said he wants to put his ideas into a book but has
been turned down by at least seven publishers, the report added,
quoting Shang as saying, "They told me it's ahead of the time."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEGOTIATOR CALLS FOR EXCHANGE OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Tseng Chun-liang, Yang Huei-chen &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting Taiwan official on Thursday
called for the exchange of visits by high-level negotiators from
Taiwan and mainland China and the resumption of dialogue between the
intermediary bodies serving the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The remarks were made by Jan Jyh-horng, director of the Research
and Planning Department of Taiwan's Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC). Jan, recently appointed to serve concurrently as a
deputy secretary-general of the semiofficial Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), and is leading an eight-member ROC delegation in a
meeting with officials from the SEF's Beijing counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>The rendezvous at Hotel Diaoyutai here marks the first SEF-ARATS
encounter in nearly three years.</P>
      <P>Jan, whose visit here is widely regarded as a litmus test of
whether the regular cross-strait dialogue may be set to resume, has
narrowed the focus of the visit to the search for a concrete
timetable for an imminent meeting between SEF Vice Chairman Shi
Hwei-yow and his ARATS counterpart Tang Shubei.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech, Jan pinpointed Taiwan's ideas about the
desired course of cross-strait relations, saying that all
achievements reached by the two sides should be treasured, and that
active implementation of joint agreements is the only way of
nurturing benign interaction.</P>
      <P>Jan stressed the importance of expanding exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait, which he said was part of an earlier consensus reached
by the SEF and the ARATS.</P>
      <P>More specifically, Jan said, Taiwan can organize groups of
college students, senior journalists and business investors to visit
mainland China, while Beijing can send media, educational, and
cultural missions to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jan also took time to spell out Taiwan's concerns over problems
arising from increasing contacts between the two sides. He said there
are presently more than 600 illegal mainland Chinese immigrants being
detained in Taiwan, among whom many have been waiting for
repatriation for up to two years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, mainland underworld figures have supplied
Taiwan narcotics traffickers with as much as 1,000 kilograms of
heroin and amphetamine annually, a problem which threatens to
seriously undermine Taiwan's social order.</P>
      <P>Such problems are definitely not conducive to better cross-strait
relations, Jan stressed.</P>
      <P>Li Yafei, who is leading the Beijing delegation at the
discussions, also narrowed the focus of ARATS' agenda, saying that
the two sides should fully exchange opinions on a possible visit to
Beijing by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>Jan and his group are scheduled to meet with ARATS Vice Chairman
Tang Shubei at another Beijing hotel in the afternoon. Their
itinerary for Friday morning has been kept open. The delegation is
scheduled to depart Friday afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ICE-BREAKING TALKS DRAW MUCH FOREIGN MEDIA ATTENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    April    23    (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite mainland China's
deliberate low-key approach toward the opening in Beijing of an
ice-breaking meeting with Taiwan on Thursday, major foreign news
media have given prominent coverage to the event.</P>
      <P>Radio stations in several countries, including the United States,
France, Singapore, Bratain, Australia, Canada and Japan, have
reported the event in their regular news programs over the past two
days.</P>
      <P>The Voice of America said in a morning news program that the
eight-member delegation to the current fence-mending meeting is the
first group of negotiators from the island to travel to the mainland
in nearly three years. The broadcast further said mainland China
hopes to discuss political issues at the meeting, but the Taiwan
delegation has insisted that nonpolitical practical matters be mulled
first.</P>
      <P>The British Broadcasting Corp. said a Taiwan delegation, headed
by Jan Jyh-horng, a deputy secretary-general of Taipei's
semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), arrived in Beijing
Wednesday for the first face-to-face talks between the two rivals in
three years.</P>
      <P>The Australian Broadcasting Corp. said mainland China received a
semiofficial mission from Taiwan on Wednesday, marking the first
direct cross-strait contact since mid-1995 when Beijing
unilaterally cut regular dialogue with Taiwan in anger over an ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States in June
that year. Beijing regarded Lee's visit as a veiled attempt to
promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>French, Canadian, Singaporean and Japanese national radio
stations also gave detailed reports on the event, saying it marks a
significant step forward in stalled relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>A CNA report from Beijing said correspondents of major Western
and Japanese news organizations stationed in the mainland capital
city, including Reuters, AFP and the Asahi Shimbun, have also shown
keen interest in covering the event, although they were denied access
to the meeting venue. Mainland authorities didn't grant them press
cards.</P>
      <P>Mainland China originally agreed to issue press cards to only a
limited number of Taiwan media. It offered them additional permits
only after a protest from a Taiwan journalists association.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong media have also dispatched a large legion of
reporters and photographers to cover the event.</P>
      <P>In contrast, mainland Chinese news organizations have turned a
cold shoulder to the event. Although a few reporters from the Xinhua
New Agency and China News Service were sighted on some occasions,
other major mainland media, such as the People's Daily and China
National Radio, didn't dispatch reporters to cover the event.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, neither Xinhua nor China Central Television Station
sent reporters to cover the opening session of the first meeting in
three years of negotiators from Taipei's SEF and Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Observers said mainland media's reserved attitude
reflects Beijing's official stance on the first direct encounter
between the two semiofficial intermediary bodies. "While attaching
importance to the event, Beijing would keep it low-profile," a local
observer noted.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are authorized by their respective governments
to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTORS PROTEST DETERIORATION OF SAFETY IN SOUTH AFRICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan investors based in South Africa
took their indignation over the murder of one of their own to the
streets on Thursday, protesting that country's worsening social
unrest and the Pretoria government's lack of attempts to improve the
situation, according to diplomatic sources in Durban.</P>
      <P>Owners of the 27 Taiwan-run companies in South Africa's
KwaZulu-Natal Province on Thursday mobilized some 3,000 people --
non-Chinese as well as Chinese -- to rally against the local
government for its inaction over the murder of Taiwan textile
merchant Wang Neng-shih, 47, on April 18.</P>
      <P>The rally, which featured Wang's coffin being borne through the
streets, struck a sympathetic chord with investors and businessmen
from other countries, some of whom even joined the protest.</P>
      <P>A CNN crew videotaped the scene, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investors' anxiety over the worsening of South Africa's
social order has reached a new peak with Wang's murder and has
prompted the businessmen to consider moving their operations out of
the country, probably to neighboring Swaziland or Botswana, the
sources added.</P>
      <P>One plant owner, surnamed Liu, said South Africa has become so
unsafe that he has to carry guns with him when going out. Even a gun,
however, is not necessarily sufficient protection, he added, noting
that bandits in South Africa sometimes carry heavy weapons, such as
AK-47s.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, there are currently 620 Taiwan-financed companies operating
in South Africa, involving some 30,000 people from the island.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan investments, worth about US$1.56 billion, provide
employment to 41,240 people, 85.8 percent or 35,384 of whom are local
black people.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan investments have been an important source of
foreign capital for South Africa and have helped create a significant
number of job opportunities in that country, Pretoria's reluctance to
sign an investment guarantee agreement with Taipei and the country's
worsening social order are poised to make rumors that Taiwan
investors will give up on South Africa once and for all come true,
the sources said.</P>

international coordinator of the Education Forum under the framework
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in January
1999.</P>
      <P>The APEC Education Forum, established in 1992, is aimed at

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual Wan An No. 21 air raid drill
was held on Thursday in Taipei, involving a total of 64,000 Taipei
City Government personnel.</P>
      <P>Strict traffic controls were imposed during the 40-minute drill
which began at 2:00 p.m. Vehicles were required to pull over and
pedestrians on the street were required to take shelter, while
domestic air flights were suspended.</P>
      <P>Similar exercises were held simultaneously in other areas of
northern Taiwan, including Taipei County and the cities and counties
of Keelung, Ilan, Taoyuan, and Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Taipei City Police Headquarters said the
people of Taiwan still need to remain on guard against the threat of
air raids from mainland China despite increasing exchanges between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Chinese communists have never renounced the use of force
against Taiwan, and mainland China's military strength has been
increasing, with continued purchases of advanced weaponry and
frequent war games involving all branches of the armed forces, the

    <HEADLINE>ARMY TEST-FIRES HAWK MISSILES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Army held a routine annual
test-firing of HAWK (Homing All the Way Killer) missiles at a
military base in southern Taiwan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The exercise, codenamed Wonderful Arrow No. 38, was held at the
military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology's
Jeou-peng base at Hengchun, in the island's southernmost county of
Pingtung. It was the first time that the military has opened the
heavily camouflaged, tightly guarded Jeou-peng base to local media.</P>
      <P>The exercise was designed to test the army's ability to counter
an air attack from communist China and began with the hypothetical
scenario that two Su-27 jetfighters from mainland China were mounting
an attack on eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Tang Yao-ming personally chose two
of the 18 missile companies taking part in the drill to each fire one
HAWK missile to intercept the invading warplanes.</P>
      <P>Both the selected army units quickly completed security checks
and fired their missiles to destroy drone planes 35 km off the
eastern Taiwan coast. Both missiles scored direct hits.</P>
      <P>Thursday's test-firing was the second stage of the Wonderful
Arrow No. 38 drill. The first phase, in which two HAWK missiles were
also fired, was conducted smoothly a few days ago at the same base.</P>
      <P>HAWK missiles are designed for medium- and low-altitude air
defense. The four HAWK missiles fired in this year's exercise were
all third-generation missiles with upgraded reliability and survival
rates to keep pace with modern electronic warfare methods. One of the
most important features of the third-generation HAWK missile is its
greatly improved radar system.</P>
      <P>The army finished replacing all its older-generation HAWK
missiles with the high-performance third-generation system late last
year. In the 1997 missile test-firing drill, four HAWK missiles were
fired, the first time the third-generation missiles had been fired
outside the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Brussels,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee &amp; P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union (EU) has decided to
impose anti-dumping taxes on fax machines from Taiwan and six other
Asian countries, EU sources said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made earlier in the day at the conference of
ministers -- the policymaking body of the organization -- by a vote
of nine to six.</P>
      <P>The six other affected countries are Japan, South Korea,
Malaysia, Singapore, mainland China and Thailand.</P>
      <P>The EU is expected to formally announce the decision before April
30, with the measures becoming effective on May 1 and lasting for a
period of five years.</P>
      <P>Under the punitive tariffs, Taiwan-originating fax machines will
be generally levied with a 36.6 percent tariff except those from
Kinpo Electronics Co. and Sampo Co., which will be subject to tariffs
of 6 percent and 35.5 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>After a preliminary investigation, the EU on Nov. 1 last year
began imposing temporary anti-dumping taxes on fax machines from
several Asian exporters, following complaints by the
Netherlands-based Phillips company.</P>
      <P>According to EU practices, the Executive Commission has to
complete its final investigation on the dumping allegations and make
a formal suggestion on whether to formally impose the punitive
tariffs within six months of its temporary tariffs going into effect.</P>
      <P>On March 13, the EU anti-dumping committee voted to abolish the
temporary tariffs, but this resolution was vetoed by EU ministers.</P>
      <P>Phillips and one of its subsidiaries in Austria have been the
major fax machine supplier to EU member countries.</P>
      <P>EU statistics show that the seven Asian countries sold a total
978,000 machines to the EU in 1996, increasing to 1.69 million units
in 1997.</P>

      <P>Viagra -- the world's first oral pill
for impotence and which has become one of the fastest selling drugs
in US medical history -- will be marketed in Australia in 1999.</P>
      <P>The drug is selling like hot cakes after only two weeks in the US
market. Doctors predict similar enthusiasm for the drug -- which
helps men sustain erections -- when it goes on sale early next year
in Australia.</P>
      <P>Sexual physician Chris McMahon of the Australian Center for
Sexual Health said there would be a groundswell of demand for the
drug among Australian men -- particularly those who had decided not
to use current treatments.</P>
      <P>"One of the first questions every man with impotence asks is:
When will a tablet be available?" he told the mass circulation
newspaper The Australian on Thursday.</P>
      <P>He said that in the United States, doctors have been deluged with
requests for Viagra -- which has obvious benefits over other drugs,
which have to be injected into the penis or inserted into the
urethra.</P>
      <P>He said the pill-popping simplicity of Viagra has apparently
captured the attention of American men -- both the impotent and
not-so-impotent -- who are looking for ways to enhance their sexual
virility.</P>
      <P>Australian medical analysts said many of those men seeking the
drug are not clinically impotent but are simply hoping the drug will
make them as virile as they were in their youth.</P>
      <P>The drug helps block an enzyme, phosphodiesterase 5, that makes
erections wilt.</P>
      <P>Trials in the United States and Australia have shown the drug
works for 70 percent of men, analysts said.</P>

      <P>Hackers have been able to break into a
high security us military computer system that controls military
satellites, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC).</P>
      <P>A CBC-TV report on Wednesday said the hackers are from a group
that calls itself MOD, or Masters of Downloading. "They called the

      <P>It noted this could be one of the most serious breaches of US

      <P>The group is made up of about 15 people who are from the United

software last October, the CBC said.</P>
      <P>It quoted a member of the group as saying, "I think international

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The prevalence of alcoholism among
Taiwan's tribesmen has increased significantly over the past few
years, while the average age of aborigines addicted to alcohol has
been declining, a medical scholar warned in Kaohsiung on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Professor Ko Ying-ching of Kaohsiung Medical College's public
health department cited a Mennonite Christian Hospital report as
saying that drinking problems among the island's aboriginal people
are no longer confined to the adult population.</P>
      <P>Several aboriginal youths around 15 years old have been treated
at the Hualien-based hospital for cirrhosis and hypertension,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>They were all found to be suffering from the diseases due to
excessive drinking, Ko said.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted four years ago among aborigines older than 16
showed a 66 percent rate of alcoholism among aboriginal males in
northern Taiwan and a 25 percent among aboriginal females in the same
area, Ko noted.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, according to the same survey, half of
tribesmen and some 28 percent of tribeswomen were found to be
addicted to alcohol, the scholar said, stressing that these figures
have risen since that time.</P>
      <P>Most of Taiwan's aboriginal residents are genetically predisposed
to alcoholism, the medical professor said, adding that under his
survey about 3 percent to 6 percent of aborigines who are alcoholics
suffer from insomnia and muscle spasms if they do not get regular
doses of alcohol.</P>
      <P>To effectively resolve the problem, Ko recommended establishing
special hospitals to treat alcoholism and training medical personnel
to help people stay on the wagon.</P>

    <DATELINE>New York, April 22 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc., a public-relations
agency owned by WPP Group PLC of Britain, said it expects its
business to grow strongly in mainland China and Taiwan over the next
three years, helping to offset any downturns in the rest of the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Hill &amp; Knowlton CEO Howard Paster was quoted in a Wall Street
Journal story on Wednesday as saying that the New York company
expects to have "low double-digit growth" in revenue from the region
in 1998.</P>
      <P>The company's clients are mostly multinational concerns operating
in the region. Currently, Asia-Pacific business, excluding Australia
and New Zealand, accounts for less than 10 percent of Hill &amp;
Knowlton's worldwide revenue. Paster said he expects that proportion
to remain "stable or go down a point or so," partly because the
company's expanding business in places such as Latin America and
Russia is expected to make a bigger contribution to total revenue.</P>
      <P>In Asia, meanwhile, Hill &amp; Knowlton sees "a lot of growth" in its
business coming from mainland China and Taiwan over the next three
years, as multinational companies continue to seek advice on how to
launch various product lines in those markets, according to Clifton
Kagawa, Hill &amp; Knowlton's Hong Kong-based chief executive for Asia.</P>
      <P>In the year ahead, Hill &amp; Knowlton expects the number of staff it

adding, "It shouldn't drop."</P>
      <P>One big hole on the personnel front, Kagawa said, is a lack of

    <HEADLINE>ILO: DEMOCRACY ESSENTIAL FOR ENSURING GREATER SOCIAL EQUITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Democracy is essential for preventing
the harmful distortion of market processed by government, and is also
essential for ensuring greater social equity in the development
process" Michel Hansenne, director-general of the International Labor
Organization (ILO), said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony of the three-day Tripartite Meeting on
Social Responses to the Financial Crisis in East and Southeast Asian
Countries, Hansenne said that in the worst-affected countries, such
as South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand, real GDP growth has turned
abruptly from over 7 percent per annum to zero or a negative figure.</P>
      <P>Pointing to massive lay-offs, sharp rises in unemployment and the
absence of meaningful social safety nets in the worst-affected
countries, Hansenne predicted that the financial crisis "will reverse
the impressive trends in poverty reduction achieved in recent years."</P>
      <P>"Full respect for basic labor standards and the fostering of a
strong and free labor movement" are key elements on the road to
recovery, the ILO leader stressed.</P>
      <P>"The ILO stands ready to assist the governments of our member
states in the region to face up to the vigorous structural reforms
required, to enhance the necessary dialogue on economic and social
policies between governments, and to put in place social safety nets
which not only soften the blow of the crisis but contribute to
preventing them from occurring," said Hansenne.</P>
      <P>The three-day meeting convened by the ILO will examine the social
dimension of the Asian financial crisis and review the reform
policies adopted in its wake.</P>
      <P>Participants from eight countries and regions -- mainland China,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Hong Kong Special
Administration Region, will formulate specific recommendations aimed
at mitigating the suffering of the poor and those thrown into
unemployment and at laying the foundation of more equitable -- and
sustainable -- patterns of development.</P>
      <P>Also participating in the meeting are senior representatives of
the Asian Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI RECEIVES HIGH MARKS IN ADB REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, April 23 (CNA)
(By Mark Chun-lin Ou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a
report released on Thursday that Taiwan, along with its push for
high-technology industries, is also aiming for stable relations, and
even direct business and transport links with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The report said the ADB believes that positive developments in
this direction will help improve the general business climate, adding
that the environment for implementing the objectives of the
Asia-Pacific Regional Operations Center plan will also be more
favorable.</P>
      <P>In its report entitled "Asian Development Outlook, 1998," the ADB
noted that Asia's financial crisis has left Taiwan largely untouched.
It said that historically, Taiwan's financial liberalization has been
gradual; some critics may even find them too slow, but such a
step-by-step policy has probably played a major role in protecting
its economy from the financial turmoil of l997.</P>
      <P>To sum up, the ADB said, from a long-term perspective, Taiwan is
continuing the transition from labor-intensive activities to
capital-intensive and high-technology activities.</P>
      <P>Although this transition may have posed complex problems of
competitiveness, skill bottlenecks, and internal and external
balance, an export-driven, high-technology future appears to be
attainable.</P>
      <P>The report forecast that Taiwan's real GDP growth will recover in
1999, after a slight decline to 5.8 percent in 1998.</P>
      <P>With aggregate demand increasing as a result of sustained
economic growth, depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar and continued
steady growth in service sector prices, the ADB expects Taiwan's
consumer price index to grow at 3.2 percent in 1998 and 2.2 percent
in 1999.</P>
      <P>The ADB report also pointed out that Taiwan saw one of the lowest
inflation rates among the newly industrialized economies, 0.9 percent
in 1997, down from 3.1 percent in 1996.</P>
      <P>The report basically gave Taiwan a positive assessment in its
1997 performance, saying that not only has Taiwan survived this
turbulent period, its economy grew at 6.8 percent during 1997,
slightly faster than in the previous two years.</P>
      <P>Although unemployment rose to 2.7 percent, a little higher than
in 1996, the current rate is still relatively low by international
standards, and future unemployment rates are not expected to be much
higher.</P>
      <P>While government investment increased by less than 2 percent, the
growth rate of private investment, by contrast, more than doubled in
1997 compared with 1996, to just under 13 percent.</P>
      <P>Exports grew by more than 5 percent in 1997, with exports of
heavy industrial products holding up particularly well. In sharp
contrast, agricultural and processed agricultural exports continued
their slowdown, shrinking respectively by as much as 19 and 34
percent.</P>
      <P>The value of imports, on the other hand, rebounded in 1997,
growing by about 10 percent after stagnating in 1996, with principal
imports being machinery, electrical equipment, and chemicals, which
together accounted for more than 45 percent of total imports in 1997.</P>
      <P>As in 1996, imports of consumer goods grew more, the report
observed, adding that this may reflect an increasing consumerist
orientation in a maturing economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US WILL CONTINUE TO STICK TO TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US government is showing intense
concern over cross-Taiwan Strait relations and will continue to stick
to the assurances provided for in the Taiwan Relations Act, Shi
Hwei-yow, secretary-general of the Republic of China's semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), has said.</P>
      <P>Shi made the comment in an interview in Taipei with The Straits
Times, which published the transcript of the interview in its
Thursday edition.</P>
      <P>When asked about Washington urging Taipei to resume talks with
Beijing, Shi replied: "The US government is definitely showing its
concern in a more intense manner now than ever before.</P>
      <P>"This is understandable, for stable cross-strait relations are
certainly in the American interest.</P>
      <P>"However, concern and pressure are two different things. Until
now, I do not think that this concern is being translated into
pressure.</P>
      <P>"From our formal channel of dialogue, we understand that the
official US position is to stick to the assurances provided for in
the Taiwan Relation Act."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the cross-strait situation, the ranking SEF
official pointed out that the prospects for sustained cross-strait
peace and stability "are still clouded with uncertainties."</P>
      <P>The immediate prospects for resumption of an orderly cross-strait
dialogue seem more certain, he said.</P>
      <P>For the latter, he added, "optimistic factors seem to slightly
outweigh the pessimistic ones."</P>
      <P>Asked what has prompted Beijing to adjust its posture on
cross-strait relations, Hsu said that "domestic political dynamics of
the three respective cross-strait players, namely the mainland,
Taiwan and the United States, as well as the interaction among them,
have contributed to this adjustment."</P>
      <P>He said that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin "knows that
he is no Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping, both of whom had bequeathed to
China a huge historical legacy."</P>
      <P>To leave "his own mark" in history, Jiang has to make some major
breakthrough, and Taiwan is the "most obvious choice," Shi noted.</P>
      <P>Besides, he commented, a cross-strait rapprochement "will weaken
the independence movements in Tibet and Xinjiang."</P>
      <P>Then, he added, "there is the American factor."</P>
      <P>Shi said that after the summit between Jiang and US President
Bill Clinton last October, Beijing tried to put pressure on Taiwan
through the United States.</P>
      <P>As Clinton's term of office is going to expire in two years'
time, "Beijing would like to make the most of his remaining term," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Likewise, he pointed out, by projecting an image that "Beijing is
making compromises in dealing with Taipei, it is trying to neutralize
the pro-Taiwan lobby in Washington."</P>
      <P>Shi said Beijing's current position is "political issues."</P>
      <P>Talks should first tackle the preparatory matters for the
political issues; before that, exchanges of ideas on economic and
cultural issues may take place in seminars, he added.</P>
      <P>"We prefer to move forward step by step: normalization of
SEF-ARATS exchanges; followed by the visit between Koo Chen-fu and
Wang Daohan, the heads of both the SEF and the Association of
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) respectively; and finally,
the second round of Koo-Wang talks," Shi said.</P>
      <P>"Our position is simple: Any issue that stands in the way of a
smooth cross-strait exchange, be it political or functional, could be
brought up for discussion. However, any talks cannot be divorced from
reality.</P>
      <P>"If we disregard day-to-day issues and indulge in abstract
matters, it will also lead to nowhere.</P>
      <P>"A problem-oriented approach is more practical. A good example is
the hoisting of flags by ships plying between the two sides. It is a
highly sensitive political issue, yet it is resolved satisfactorily,"
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRETORIA URGED TO SIGN INVESTMENT GUARANTEE AGREEMENT WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang on Thursday called on the South African government to sign
an investment guarantee agreement with Taipei at an early date.</P>
      <P>Wang's call comes amid concern over the worsening social order in
South Africa which has threatened the lives of thousands of Taiwan
businessmen and their families living there.</P>
      <P>The minister warned that if the South African government
continues to turn a deaf ear to the demand for an investment
guarantee agreement and if the Taiwan businessmen based in that
country want to relocate their operations to other countries, the
Economics Ministry will offer them the necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>He said Pretoria shouldn't forget that before severing diplomatic
relations with Taipei, it promised to maintain the highest-level
relations, second only to formal ties, with Taiwan, but pointed out
that it doesn't seem to be keeping its promise at the moment. South
Africa switched diplomatic recognition to mainland China at the
beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Wang said that his ministry has expressed its concern to the
South African government over the security of Taiwan businessmen
there and has demanded that Pretoria strengthen security measures to
provide Taiwan businessmen and overseas Chinese there with a safe
living environment.</P>
      <P>According to news reports, a group of some 3,000 Taiwan
businessmen in KawZulu-Natal Province are preparing to stage a
demonstration to protest the recent murder of a Taiwan businessman,
as well as the country's worsening social order.</P>
      <P>The death of Taiwan textile merchant Wang Neng-shih, 47, who was
murdered on April 18 by three unidentified gunmen in an industrial
park in the province, has sent another shock wave through the Chinese
community. Taiwan businessmen are now seriously considering moving
their operations out of the country, probably to neighboring
Swaziland or Botswana, following a series of attacks targeting
businessmen from the island.</P>
      <P>On March 14, Cheng Yuan-yuan and her South African fiance were
attacked by four men at their bar in Welkom, Orange Free State. Cheng
was shot dead at the scene, while her fiance was seriously injured.
Earlier in the month, Taiwan businessman Chen Lian-fu, his wife and
their children were taken hostage when five armed men broke into
their house. In February, artist Chia Lun-sheng was killed by robbers
at his residence in Johannesburg.</P>
      <P>There are currently 620 Taiwan-financed companies operating in
South Africa, involving some 30,000 people from the island. Taiwan
investments are worth about US$1.56 billion and have provided 41,240
job opportunities.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the US trade deficit with mainland
China continues to increase, concern is mounting that mainland China
will soon replace Japan as America's major trade headache.</P>
      <P>Such concerns are fed by an image of mainland China as another
Japan -- a country pursuing a mercantilist development strategy based
on closed markets, an undervalued currency, and a structural trade
surplus, according to Prof. Laura D'Andrea Tyson of economics and
business administration at the University of California at Berkeley.</P>
      <P>Contributing an article to the current issue of Business Week,
Tyson pointed out that mainland China is not following in Japan's
footsteps. The evidence reveals compelling economic differences.
First, although mainland China's system poses structural barriers to
foreign competition, as does Japan's, mainland China does not enjoy a
persistent current account surplus, a defining characteristic of a
mercantilist state. Rather, mainland China's current account balance
exhibits cyclical swings, alternating between years of deficit and
surplus.</P>
      <P>Second, Tyson said, in contrast to Japan, mainland China has
opened its door to foreign direct investment. Third, mainland China
and Japan have responded very differently to the Asian economic
crisis, which hit at a difficult time for both countries. Japan,
unable to change policy, is sinking into recession, while mainland
China is embarking on a painful path of restructuring its loss-ridden
banks and state-owned enterprises and is laying off millions of
underemployed workers.</P>
      <P>Tyson said mainland China's outward-looking policy courage stands
in stark relief to the inward-looking timidity of Japan. Mainland
China is rapidly emerging as the dominant economic power in
postcrisis Asia, and its participation in the World Trade
Organization, like its presence in the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, will bolster the strength of the multilateral
system, She added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SISY CHEN TO VIE FOR DPP CHAIRMANSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
spokeswoman Sisy Chen announced on Thursday that she will run for the
party's top post and abandon her bid to seek the party's nomination
for the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chen told a news conference that she will register as a candidate
for DPP chairman on Friday. "I'll simultaneously withdraw my bid for
the party's nomination for the parliamentary election to avert
speculation that my DPP chairmanship bid is nothing more than a
campaign gimmick to win the party's nomination for the legislative
race."</P>
      <P>Chen outlined her goals behind her decision to join the DPP
chairmanship race -- offering new thinking and new concepts, proving
that women can lead a major political party, demonstrating her
courage to pursue her dreams, and reviving the DPP's idealism.</P>
      <P>A confident, articulate Chen said the future DPP chairman will
have two lofty missions: to help maintain Taiwan's political
stability and to boost the island's economic development in the years
ahead.</P>
      <P>Asserting that the ruling Kuomintang is doomed to fall apart
because of power struggles among its middle-aged politicians, Chen
said the DPP, as Taiwan's largest opposition party, should assume the
responsibility of helping to preserve political stability. "So the
next DPP chairman must be a capable, charismatic leader to win
popular support and trust."</P>
      <P>Chen lamented that over the past 11 years, factional strength and
debate over candidates' moral stature and character have dominated
the DPP chairmanship election. "Nowadays, we live in a different
political climate and face different challenges. We need a capable
leader with vision and ideals."</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, the future DPP chairperson must have a clear
grasp of major economic issues. "All former DPP leaders were only
familiar with democracy, human rights and political topics," she
criticized.</P>
      <P>Chen vowed to be a unique political figure. "I have taken part in
opposition political activities for 20 years. I fully understand how
political power operates. It's regrettable that women still play a
limited role in Taiwan's politics. I feel compelled to join the DPP
chairmanship race to prove that women also have political wisdom and
know-how."</P>
      <P>Chen predicted frankly she will certainly lose the contest, but
added that she will make the battle more interesting. "My function in
the party is to be the leader of concept and opinion. Even if I lose
the race, my views will still be the winner."</P>
      <P>Two DPP male politicians -- top party adviser Lin Yi-hsiung and
Legislator Yen Chi-fu -- already registered for the chairmanship
contest. The registration will close on Friday.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time the DPP chairman is elected directly
by the party members, who are estimated to number slightly more than
80,000. Before the voting takes place on May 24, the DPP
headquarters will hold three rounds of televised debates for all
candidates.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate declined
further in the first quarter of this year to 2.42 percent, down 0.39
percentage points from the same period of last year, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) announced on

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT DENIES THAT NT$36.28 MILLION LOAN WAS POLITICAL DONATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lian Chan said on Thursday
that in the 1993 local election, he lent more than NT$30 million
to the Kuamintang candidate Wu Tse-yuan, former chief of Pingtung
County, because Wu did not have enough fund for his campaign.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after visiting the Bethany nursery in
Pingtung, Taiwan's southernmost county.</P>
      <P>The vice president told reporters that during 1993 when he was
serving as premier, the KMT was having difficulty fielding a
candidate for Pingtung County. He said that in order to allow Wu to
run in the election, he promised to lend him money, and that more
than NT$30 million was later remitted to Wu through a bank account
belonging to Wu Chin-jan, Wu's younger brother.</P>
      <P>"This is a simple matter," he said, urging the public not to
develop a distorted view of the issue.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the matter involved the question of a political
donation, Lien replied: "That is not the way to look at it."</P>
      <P>The issue was raised a day earlier when National Assemblyman Lee
Wen-chung held a press conference during which he presented two bank
documents as proof that Lien and Wu may have had an "improper
financial transaction."</P>
      <P>Lee went to the Control Yuan on Thursday to inform the
highest-level government watchdog body that Fang Yui, Lien's wife,
had remitted a total of NT$36.28 million to Wu Chin-jan. He was
received by Control Yuan member Lin Meng-kui, who said Lee wanted to
know whether the transaction was legal.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the matter, Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said on
Thursday that although political donations surpassing the legal
amount are illegal, there are no penalties involved, and that if the
money was a personal loan, then nothing unlawful took place.</P>
      <P>Based on the election law, personal political donations cannot
exceed NT$20,000, while donations from businesses cannot exceed
NT$300,000. In addition, tax laws governing this situation prohibit
any individual from receiving more than NT$1 million in a single
year.</P>
      <P>Pingtung Legislator Cheng Chao-ming of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party meanwhile asked the Finance Ministry to investigate
whether the ministry lost NT$7.47 million in taxes if the money was
indeed a grant.</P>
      <P>Huang said he will ask the Pingtung election committee to
investigate and make a report within a week on Wu's election funds
during the period at issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the former Pingtung County chief issued a statement
explaining the details of the transactions between Lien and himself.
He stressed that the money was a loan which he has been unable to
repay, thereby implicating his former superior and leaving himself
wracked with guilt.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan computer giant Acer on Thursday
announced an international joint venture partnership, saying that it
will sign a formal accord with the Germany-based Siemens Nixdorf in
June to acquire that company's personal computer division.</P>
      <P>Describing the joint venture as a mutually beneficial
labor-division alliance, Acer Chairman Stan Shih said Taiwan should
play a value-added supplier role in the highly competitive global
information industry market, pointing out that Acer is strong in PC
production, while Siemens Nixdorf has the advantage in product
programming, marketing, and after-sale service.</P>
      <P>Siemens Nixdorf President Gerhard Schulmeyer said Siemens's
decision to sell its PC division to Acer does not mean that the group
is set to withdraw from the international PC market, but rather, the
cooperative venture will allow it to provide customers with more
competitive products.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, Acer will acquire Siemens
Nixdorf's PC division, including its production, assembly, research
and development, purchasing, and resourcing facilities, which are
based in Augsburg, southern Germany.</P>
      <P>Acer will in future be in charge of manufacturing about 1.4
million desktop PCs for Siemens Nixdorf per year, with the focus on
the European market, while Siemens Nixdorf will control product
marketing and after-sale service.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsien-ming, general manager of Acer's information industry
department, said the joint venture will ensure that Acer will obtain
long-term orders from Siemens Nixdorf, and allow the company to own a
European stronghold for production and assembly.</P>
      <P>The addition of the Augsburg plant following the establishment of
similar production centers in mainland China, the Philippines,
Mexico, and the United States, means that Acer's plan to build a
global manufacturing network has almost been accomplished, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Local industry sources said the strategic alliance is expected to
greatly boost Acer's output, helping it take a big step toward its
goal of setting up a global management and sourcing network and
becoming one of the world's top five PC companies. Acer is currently
the world's seventh-largest computer firm, with an annual output of
more than six million PCs.</P>
      <P>Siemens Nixdorf is Europe's biggest PC company, selling 1.1
million PCs last year in the region.</P>

officer with mainland China, Koo Chen-fu, will be arranged by the end
of the year, according to consensus reached on Thursday at a meeting
between officials of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Tang Shubei, vice chairman of the
SEF's mainland counterpart the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), had a 30 minute meeting which focused on a
possible visit to Beijing by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>Jan, who arrived in Beijing on Wednesday afternoon for a
three-day ice-breaking visit, said after the meeting that Tang
accepted the SEF proposal, first made last November, that Koo should
make a visit to the mainland by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>He also said that Tang is hopeful that Koo's visit can be
"simplified," and that the ARATS vice chairman agreed to give up an
earlier condition that cross-strait talks on political issues should
be held prior to Koo's visit.</P>
      <P>Describing the meeting as making significant progress in the
cross-strait relations stalled for the past three years, Jan said at
a press briefing that he is hopeful that the two sides will be able
to hammer out the details of Koo's visit during further discussions.</P>
      <P>The SEF chairman's visit is expected to lead to a long-expected
meeting between Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan. Koo and Wang
first met in April, 1993 in Singapore, where they signed four
agreements laying a framework for resolving non-political issues
resulting from increasing cross-strait exchanges. However, a second
round of talks failed to materialize after mainland authorities
unilaterally suspended contacts to vent Beijing's anger over a trip
to the United States by ROC President Lee Teng-hui in June, 1995.</P>
      <P>In the absence of official ties between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, contacts are handled by the SEF and the ARATS, both of
which are semi-official bodies.</P>
      <P>Tang told reporters after the meeting that the ARATS welcomes the
proposal that Koo should lead a delegation on a visit to the
mainland, and said he hopes that Taiwan can present a timetable for
the trip so that the mainland side can make the necessary
preparations. He added that the mainland authorities have not set up
any obstacles to the visit.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Paraguayan Industry and Commerce Minister
Atilio Fernandez on Thursday urged Taiwan businesses to invest in his
country and promised to help those who are already operating there to
expand into the Southern Common Market.</P>
      <P>Fernandez made the remarks while attending the 10th ROC-Paraguay
Economic Cooperation Conference, which opened here on Thursday and is
being co-chaired by his ROC counterpart Wang Chih-kang.</P>
      <P>Fernandez said Taiwan businesses should consider investing in
Paraguay as the country is competitive in many fields.</P>
      <P>According to Fernandez, Paraguay has an abundant young workforce
and cheap electricity. As a member state located in the center of the
Southern Common Market, it can also serve as a gateway into
neighboring member countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.</P>
      <P>Fernandez promised to help the more than 70 Taiwan companies
currently operating in Paraguay to explore the Southern Common
Market, the population of which will increase to about 200 million
with the forthcoming entry of Chile and Bolivia.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors in Paraguay will enjoy the same investment
incentives as local people, and Paraguay will provide adequate
investment guarantees to foreign companies under the framework of the
World Trade Organization, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wang said bilateral trade and economic cooperation
has increased noticeably since the ninth ROC-Paraguay economic
cooperation meeting was held last year in Asuncion, the capital city
of the South American country.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed the hope that more Taiwan businesses will invest
in Paraguay, as a Taiwan-funded industrial park in Eastern City in
southern Paraguay is scheduled to be inaugurated in August, which he
said can serve as a base from which to break into the Southern Common
Market.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Ministry of Economic Affairs said the two
countries are expected to discuss joint efforts to crack down on
commercial piracy and bilateral cooperation in the small business and
agricultural sectors on Friday, the closing day of the meeting.</P>
      <P>Fernandez arrived in Taipei on Wednesday for a weeklong visit,
during which he is scheduled to visit ranking ROC government
officials including President Lee Teng-hui and Vice President Lien
Chan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG DAN COMMITTED TO DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT IN MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, April 23 (CNA)
(By J.J. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prominent mainland China dissident Wang
Dan said here on Thursday that he is committed to the democratic
development of his homeland, and that he plans to continue his
studies in the United States.</P>
      <P>Wang, who arrived in the United States last week, appeared in
high spirits and spoke openly in a press conference about his
optimism for the development of freedom and democracy in the
mainland, but declined to give a timetable for achieving that goal.</P>
      <P>However, the 29-year-old dissident said he believes progress in
democratic development on the Chinese mainland will come faster than
many observers have predicted.</P>
      <P>Citing the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union, he said the leaders in Beijing can no longer suppress the
Chinese people's aspirations for democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>Wang also said he considers his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square
events to have more demirits than merits, and he expressed "lifelong
remorse" for the hundreds of students demonstrators who were killed
indiscriminately in an army crackdown on the protest.</P>
      <P>He claimed he had been young and naive then, and that if he could
relive those events, he probably could handle the situation
differently so that no one would be killed in vain.</P>
      <P>But Wang stressed that the leadership in Beijing should
ultimately bear the blame, vowing to fight all his life for democracy
and human rights on the mainland, in order to atone for the guilt he
holds for those who were killed at Tiananmen Square.</P>
      <P>He described newly installed Premier Zhu Rongji as the "most
pragmatic, and determined" mainland leader he has seen, and urged Zhu
to promote political as well as economic reforms on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wang said pressure from the international community has helped
improve the human rights situation there. He urged people everywhere
not to forget those dissidents, especially Liu Nianchun, Liu Xiaobo,
Kao Yi and Li Hai, that continue to languish in prison, even though
he himself is now free.</P>
      <P>Wang urged US President Bill Clinton to continue voicing concern
for the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience on the
mainland, and to prod Beijing for their release when he visits there
in June.</P>
      <P>As to why he had changed his mind and agreed to go into exile in
the United States, Wang stressed that he was reluctant to leave the
mainland, but made the decision because he felt his studies were
lagging after long years in prison. He also indicated that his
high-profile put him under constant surveillance by security
officials, which meant that he could no longer contribute to the
democracy movement in the mainland.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang said he worried about his aging parents,
who had to travel a long distance from Beijing to visit him in
prison.</P>
      <P>Wang said he has mixed feelings at present. On one hand, he is
happy to breathe the air of freedom in the United States, and on the
other hand he is sad over being separated from his homeland, family
and friends.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is most happy to be a free intellectual, asserting
that intellectuals can play a major role in the development of the
mainland. He revealed that one of his biggest hopes is to publish a
magazine in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that he wants to pursue advanced studies in the
United States, but that he will not accept financial assistance from
any partisan group. Rather, Wang said he would support himself by
working part-time.</P>
      <P>Wang was sentenced to four years in prison for his role in the
Tiananmen Square protests. After his release, he was charged with
subversion last year and sentenced to 11-year imprisonment. He was
released last week on medical grounds and sent directly to Henry Ford
Hospital in Detroit for a physical checkup.</P>
      <P>Wang was released after two days in the hospital with a clean
bill of health and flew to New York.</P>

      <P>The government will continue its pragmatic
diplomatic policy of reaching out to the international community, Roy
Wu, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu's comments followed the remarks by Premier Vincent Siew that

      <P>Wu noted that the MOFA is actively watching for opportunities for

government officials to travel abroad.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the target areas for such contacts will not be
confined to any particular countries or region, but will be global in
scope.</P>
      <P>He said that as a sovereign state, the Republic of China must
maintain a presence within the international community, and that it
has always kept close communications with other nations.</P>
      <P>Wu said that plans for a trip by Premier Siew to some of the
ROC's diplomatic allies are currently in progress, and that the MOFA

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SEES RECORD NUMBER OF SPOONBILLS WINTERING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 330 black-faced spoonbills, an
endangered species of migratory bird, migrated to wetlands in
southern Taiwan to winter during the past season, the highest number
on record, the Chinese Wild Bird Federation (CWBF) reported on
Friday.</P>
      <P>A CWBF spokesman quoted the latest tallies of the BirdLife Asia
Council as showing that the population of black-faced spoonbills has
increased by some 100 to a total of about 650 worldwide during
1997-98.</P>
      <P>The number of the wading birds spending the winter in Taiwan's
wetlands was also found to have increased the most among the areas
comprising its habitat, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Beginning in late September each year, large numbers of
black-faced spoonbills arrive at the mouth of Tsengwen Creek in Chiku
Village, Tainan, and the coastal wetlands of Putai, Chiayi, southern
Taiwan, to winter, making those areas the primary habitat of the
species.</P>
      <P>According to the BirdLife Asia Council, other black-faced
spoonbills, believed to have migrated from scattered areas of North
Asia, including the Korean Peninsula, also flew to Japan, Hong Kong,
South Korea and Vietnam for their winter stay.</P>
      <P>To better understand the behavioral patterns and natural habitat
of the rare birds, a species endemic to Asia, the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture has cooperated with Japanese ornithological
societies in using transmitters to trace their movements.</P>
      <P>COA officials said they have been able to pinpoint the
whereabouts of the usually elusive birds with the help of the
transmitters attached to the their backs.</P>
      <P>At present, three black-faced spoonbills carrying the devices are
still in the southern Taiwan wetland and have not returned to their
northern home, according to the CWBF.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'NO HASTE, BE PATIENT' POLICY SHOULD STAND: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the huge trade surplus Taiwan has
enjoyed with the mainland over the past decade, the ROC government's
"no haste, be patient" policy toward investing there should stand,
the top official in charge of mainland policy said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yu, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the remarks when speaking at a seminar in
Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that current mainland policy was formulated in
accordance with the National Unification Guidelines, which charts the
course of Taiwan's unification with the mainland in stages.</P>
      <P>He said trade across the Taiwan Strait has reached US$140 billion
over the past decade, and that US$26.4 billion in goods were
exchanged last year alone, with Taiwan enjoying huge trade surplus.</P>
      <P>In addition, at least 20,000 Taiwan manufacturers have invested
more than US$11 billion on the mainland. Chang pointed out that if
each manufacturer were to station 10 employees there, that would
translate into 200,000 Taiwan residents living under the political
influence of the mainland Chinese system.</P>
      <P>He stressed that without economic security, there can be no
political security, and that without economic independence, there can
be no political freedom.</P>
      <P>As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are unable to sign an
investment guarantee agreement at the moment, the ROC government has
to adopt a diversification strategy that takes into consideration the
overall interests of Taiwan residents when working out its mainland
policy, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that this week's visit to the mainland by Jan
Jyh-horng, deputy secretary-general of the semiofficial Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), will help revive the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition New Party will hold a seminar on
mainland China policy Sunday.</P>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, the party's campaign manager for year-end
elections, noting that Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of US$16.6
billion with the mainland last year, said that huge imbalance was
created through the efforts by Taiwan businessmen, even though they
have had little government support.</P>
      <P>Jaw also criticized the industrial policy of the rival opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which opened a three-day meeting
on industrial policy Friday. He described the DPP outlook as "limited
in both vision and scope," saying the party focuses only on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jaw claimed that economic progress in Taiwan cannot be confined
to local development, saying the island should consider giving the
mainland a helping hand at a time when the newly installed Premier
Zhu Rongji has stressed economic reforms. He added that this approach
would be beneficial to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SPEAK OUT ON RELEASE OF MAINLAND DISSIDENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Senator Connie Mack (R-Fla.) and
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) objected Thursday to what they
claim is a US policy of striking deals with Beijing to obtain the
parole of famous dissidents such as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, while
overlooking the thousands still in prisons and forced labor camps.</P>
      <P>However, they said in a joint statement on the release of Wang
that, "We are pleased to see Wang Dan on the free soil of the United
States where he can join the chorus of voices calling for freedom,
democracy, and respect for human dignity within the People's Republic
of China."</P>
      <P>Wang and Wei have been repeatedly nominated for the Nobel Peace
Prize in recent years "because of their courageous commitment to
human rights and fundamental freedoms. Together, these two men
symbolize the defining core of China's contemporary pro-democracy
movement," according to the statement.</P>
      <P>But the two US Congress members stressed their release does not
warrant praise for Beijing, adding that, "Wang Dan was not freed, he
was expelled from his country; and he has not been cleared of the
charges against him, he is out of prison only for 'medical reasons.'"</P>
      <P>They described Wang Dan's release over the weekend as "the moral
equivalent of someone robbing a bank and expecting praise for
offering to return the stolen money in the form of a loan." Then they
asked, "Are we supposed to thank Beijing for expelling a man from his
home after he was wrongfully imprisoned in the first place?"</P>
      <P>The joint statement continued that Wang's release "represents
Beijing's attempts, with some American complicity, to deflect human
rights criticism as we approach President Clinton's planned trip to
Beijing. We cannot let this hollow act succeed."</P>
      <P>They said Wang is a great hero of freedom and democracy not only
for the people of mainland China, but for the world. As strong
advocates for his release, the pair said they are pleased to see him
out of prison. Both Mack and Pelosi said they are certain
congressional pressure on the administration had a great deal to do
with his release.</P>
      <P>But they concluded that: "We must remain vigilant in our
opposition to the enemies of freedom in the world. Wang Dan
symbolizes all who are oppressed in China, but his release does not
mean that the political climate has changed."</P>

      <P>Asian Development Bank (ADB) Vice
President Bong-Suh Lee declined comment Thursday on the Republic of

      <P>Officials from the ROC claim the name implies it is subordinated

and that Taiwan is a "strong pillar" of the Asian economy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference on release of the ADB's annual

Taiwan is an important member of the ADB, and that it has been least

      <P>But Lee shunned from discussion of all matters involving

      <P>The report also noted that the strength of the economy of
mainland China and its currency will become an anchor for regional

Taipei-based cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the statement in response to remarks by Tang Shubei,
vice chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), about the matter. Tang said he hopes
Taipei will not to set barriers to the Koo-Wang meeting.</P>
      <P>Whenever the time is proper, said Chang, a meeting between Koo
and Wang can go ahead. The top negotiators of the two sides of the
strait, however, must arrange for and confirm matters prior to the
meeting, he added.</P>
      <P>Koo is the chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
while Wang, his mainland counterpart, is head of ARATS. The SEF and
ARATS are the semi-official organizations authorized by Taipei and
Beijing, respectively, to handle bilateral exchanges in the absence
of government-to-government contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, the newly appointed deputy secretary-general of
the SEF, met with his mainland counterpart Li Yafei and ARATS Vice
Chairman Tang Shubei on Thursday. Later that evening, Koo presided
over a meeting of high-ranking SEF and MAC officials. Chang made his
remarks after the latter meeting when he met the press.</P>
      <P>In view of the understanding reached by the two quasi-official
cross-strait bodies that they will do their best to make the Koo-Wang
meeting a reality, Koo said to the press with a smile that since a
common understanding has been reached, more effort will be made to
push the matter forward. The timing of the meeting, he added, will be
discussed later.</P>
      <P>Chang said that as early as last year, Taipei indicated that a
meeting between Koo and Wang can be held "whenever it is proper" and
that Taipei has set no barriers to it. He said he hopes that Koo can
make a visit to the Chinese mainland by the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>Taipei has not ruled out a meeting between Koo and Wang that
takes place by means of the two attending some kind of seminar, noted
Chang, adding that although this method is possible, it would take
much more time than a single visit or panel discussion. He added that
he hopes a series of exchanges between the two sides will start as
soon as the deputy secretary-generals of both sides have completed
their discussions.</P>
      <P>Chang, in the meantime, stressed that a chairman-level meeting
between the two sides should be paved by the vice chairmen of the two
cross-strait negotiating bodies, indicating that Taipei believes a
meeting between Tang and his Taiwan counterpart, SEF Vice Chairman
and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow, is mandatory.</P>
      <P>Chang went a step further by saying that according to the rules
of systematic contacts between the two sides, regular exchanges
between the two vice chairmen is essential, citing the need to
communicate protocol matters easily.</P>
      <P>Shi echoed Chang's remarks, saying that it is necessary to hold
the Shi-Tang meeting first so that details of the Koo-Wang meeting
can be confirmed. The Beijing authorities have not ruled out Shi-Tang
meeting, he noted.</P>

      <P>A senior official with the de facto

Investigation Bureau (MJIB) on Friday, expressing gratitude for the
bureau's busting of a Motorola cellular phone parts counterfeiting
ring here on Thursday.</P>
      <P>David Harrison, head of the intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection division at the Taipei Office of the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT), said the breakup of the ring has once again manifested
Taiwan's determination to eradicate commercial piracy.</P>
      <P>Harrison said the United States is more than willing to cooperate
with Taiwan in fighting crime and improving IPR protection.</P>
      <P>Investigators with the MJIB's Taipei outpost busted a
counterfeiting ring in Taipei and arrested three key suspects
involved in counterfeiting cellular phone parts and trademarks of
several world-renowned companies, including Motorola of the United
States and Ericsson of Sweden.</P>
      <P>The investigators confiscated more than 200 cases of bogus
Motorola and Ericsson cellular phone parts at Chao-hsuan Industrial
Co., which allegedly had produced the fake goods for export to Italy,
Hong Kong and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Harrison asked the MJIB to provide data concerning plants in
those countries which allegedly would assemble the Taiwan-originated
bogus parts into cellular phones. Harrison said he will transfer the

      <P>The cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Friday praised the recent visit to Beijing by the deputy
secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Jan
Jyh-horng, as an example of "benign interaction" and said it will be
conducive to the resumption of the cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Chang King-yuh characterized Jan's April 22-24 visit
to mainland China, during which Jan and his Beijing counterparts
reached a consensus that SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu will visit Beijing
within the year, as "fairly good."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Vice Chairman and spokesman Sheu Ke-sheng lauded
the Beijing journey of Jan and an eight-member delegation, calling it
"an important step forward" toward closer interaction between the SEF
and its Beijing counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS). The meeting marked the end to a 34-month
hiatus in such cross-strait gatherings.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shubei Thursday

    <HEADLINE>US DENIES SUSPENDING ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  D.C.,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the latest round of arms
sales discussions in Washington between the United States and the
Republic of China drew to what was described as a successful
conclusion, a senior US official Thursday flatly denied reports that
Washington was suspending military sales to Taiwan in preparation for
US President Bill Clinton's visit to Beijing in June.</P>
      <P>Asked whether there was any possibility of the administration
halting arms sales to Taiwan, albeit temporarily, the senior State
Department official said simply, "No."</P>
      <P>The denial came after a Japanese newspaper, Sankei Shimbun,
quoted unnamed US sources as saying that the US government intended
to suspend sales of military hardware to Taiwan in anticipation of a
June summit meeting between Clinton and mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin. Earlier this week, the Defense News, a well-informed
weekly based in Springfield, VA, carried a similar report.</P>
      <P>It also followed recent assurances given by other administration
officials that the US policy on arms sales to Taiwan remains
unchanged. The United States had promised, though privately, that
there would not be a date by which it would end arms sales to Taiwan
and that Washington would not consult Beijing prior to such
transactions.</P>
      <P>The terse reassurance, given at a background briefing on
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to East Asia next week,
is likely to dispel some of the nervousness felt by many in Taipei
over the rapid warming of relations between Washington and Beijing
since Jiang's visit to the United States last November.</P>
      <P>As always, little has been revealed about the latest talks
between US and ROC military personnel on Taiwan's defense
requirements. Sources would only say that the talks went smoothly
earlier this week and that some conclusions had been reached. One
well-placed source also told CNA that part of the Defense News
article was incorrect.</P>
      <P>The source was referring to the claim, quoted in the article,
that approved sales to Taiwan could be delayed indefinitely with the
administration focused on the presidential visit. Even though the
1979 Taiwan Relations Act stipulates that the US government should
provide Taiwan with defensive weapons, Beijing has taken exception to
continued US arms sales to the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS COMMUNITY TURNS COLD SHOULDER TO DPP MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) opened a three-day seminar on Taiwan's economic and
industrial development policy and strategy on Friday.</P>
      <P>The seminar, aimed at helping the pro-independence party
shake off an anti-commerce image, brought together economists,
industry executives and DPP politicians to discuss economy- and
industry-related topics.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony, DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang
said the DPP doesn't have any anti-commerce complex as some people
have alleged. "On the contrary, the DPP has consistently deemed it
an important party mission to help sustain Taiwan's robust economy."</P>
      <P>Hsu said the DPP has sponsored the seminar to solicit opinions
of the academic and business communities about strategies and
tactics to cope with economic problems and challenges faced by
Taiwan. "We'll refer to their opinions in formulating our party's
economic platform," he stated.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the meeting, Hsu said he has visited a number
of business heavyweights in recent weeks to exchange views on major
economic topics.</P>
      <P>Hsu recalled Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Y. C. Wang had told
him that Taiwan doesn't need an industrial policy. "What the business
community wants is complete economic liberalization," Hsu quoted
Wang as asserting.</P>
      <P>At present, Hsu said, the government still imposes too many
restrictions on economic activities. "I hope the current seminar
will help the DPP forge an intraparty consensus on Taiwan's future
economic development direction."</P>
      <P>Hsu expressed regret over the business community's cool response
to the DPP seminar. Few senior business leaders showed up at
Friday's meeting as most local tycoons are members or supporters of
the ruling Kuomintang. Kao Ching-yuan, president of the Chinese
National Federation of Industries, originally agreed to attend the
opening session, but he failed to honor his promise.</P>
      <P>Hsu ridiculed Kao's absence, saying he didn't have the courage to
defy the KMT's stance. "This kind of attitude will only hinder the
development of Taiwan's party politics and will even harm local
enterpertises' interests," he claimed, adding: "I earnestly hope all
local business magnates will learn to avert party consideration and
give priority to national interests and their corporate policies."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, former DPP spokeswoman Sisy Chen
said the DPP must actively woo the support of local business
community for its economic policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the DPP's toughest challenge in the economic field
is to harmonize environmental concerns with industrial development.
"A core problem we face now is the conflict between the development
of highly polluting and energy-consuming petrochemical industry and
environmental protection," she noted.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the DPP must cultivate a heavyweight politican
who can fully represent and speak for salaried people. "By so doing,
the DPP will be able to win more popular support."</P>
      <P>Although the KMT has traditionally played a dominant role in the
local business community, Chen said she is convinced that this trend
will gradually fade in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>A number of DPP legislators also presented their views at the
seminar, calling for an end to unnecessary restrictions to private
investment in mainland China. "Except for those investment
activities that may threaten our national security, the government
should not restrict trade and investment across the Taiwan Strait,"
said Legislator Hung Chi-chang.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers also called for upgrading of Taiwan's
industries and continued economic liberalization and globalization.
Many scholars and experts presented papers at the seminar for
discussion.</P>
      <P>Friday's meeting focused on exploring Taiwan's future economic
development direction. The participants will discuss other topics,
inclduing industrial upgrading, land rezoning and development,
policy toward mainland investment, environmental protection and
industrial development and balanced regional development, in
the next two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HAITI PRESIDENT VISITS AGRICULTURAL SITES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung, April 24 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Friday led his
honored guests from Haiti on an agricultural tour of central Taiwan,
introducing them to the modern technologies and equipment that local
farmers use to gain high-quality farm production.</P>
      <P>Haiti President Rene Preval and his wife arrived in Taiwan
Tuesday for a four-day visit and were given a grand, red-carpet
welcome in downtown Taipei by Lee on the following day.</P>
      <P>The two presidents, accompanied by Presidential Secretary-General
Huang Kun-huei and Peng Chou-kui, chairman of the Council of
Agriculture, as well as by several other high-level agricultural
officials, made their first stop on the Friday trip at a vegetable
farm in Ta Yia township Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The farm, which covers more than 8,000 square meters, uses
hydroponics to raise vegetables in a nonpolluting way. Its owner,
Chang Chuen-tsang, received last year's "model farmer" award.</P>
      <P>Lee, who holds a Ph.D. in agricultural economics, explained
hydroponics and its practical applications to Preval during the
visit, after which they drove to a poultry farm in Shen Kang
township, also in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Chen Tun-fang, owner of the 51-year-old Ching Tan chicken farm,
reported to the two leaders that the farm hatches 200,000 chickens
for sale and 50,000 chickens for producing eggs every week.</P>
      <P>As chairman of a development foundation for the poultry industry,
Chen also appealed to Lee for help, asking that the government help
poultry farmers deal with the impact that the scheduled opening of
Taiwan's farm market to foreign exports is expected to have.</P>
      <P>As part of its bid for membership in the World Trade
Organization, Taiwan has agreed to import chicken from the United
States, something that the local industry sees as a threat to its
profits.</P>
      <P>Chen asked the government to take a gradual and orderly approach
to the imports, and to set up a warning system to reduce local
farmers' losses.</P>
      <P>He said his foundation is planning to raise NT$3 billion (US$90.9
million) for an "adjustment fund" to help maintain the stability of
local chicken prices after the US products enter the island's market.</P>
      <P>During their stay at the modern chicken farm, Lee and Preval also
visited the facilities and operation systems for breeding, sanitation
and environmental protection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIER PREDICTS CENTRAL BANK WILL LOWER RESERVE REQUIREMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) forecast on Friday that the Central Bank of China will be
adopting small, incremental adjustments to lower bank reserve
requirements.</P>
      <P>The adjustments are to be made in unison with the release of
postal savings money market funds to stabilize interest rates in the
face of tighter capital requirements during the second half of the
year due to the expenditure of several large-scale governmental
development projects.</P>
      <P>TIER also announced its predictions for this year's economic
prospects, revising a previous estimate of 6.25 percent economic
growth down to 6.01 percent.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Price Index is now expected to climb 2.98 percent,
lower than the previously announced rate of 3.08 percent. TIER cited
a small adjustment in wages, the Central Bank's cautious policy of
stabilizing commodity prices and the expectation that consumer goods
and service industry price increases will be limited as the key
factors behind the downward adjustment. The Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research (CHIER) has also adjusted its estimate for this
year's growth in the Consumer Price Index down to 2.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The target rate adopted by the Executive Yuan's Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) is 3 percent, while the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) set
the target rate at 3.01 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade is showing signs of regression because of
the Asian economic crisis, TIER said, noting that the island just
suffered its first single-quarter trade deficit in 17 years. The
first quarter economic growth rate is estimated to be lower than 5
percent, it said.</P>
      <P>Due to the continued prosperity of the domestic market this year,
consumer spending and private investments have been growing steadily.
Peaking compared to recent years are major investments totaling
NT$450 billion, a sevenfold increase from last year, illustrating the
stability and growth of the domestic economy, TIER said.</P>
      <P>TIER's forecast for this year's quarterly growth rates is as
follows: first quarter, 4.32 percent; second, 5.89 percent; third,
6.93 percent; and fourth, 7.08 percent.</P>
      <P>TIER's estimate for the growth rate for private investments is
18.03 percent, higher than both the DGBAS estimate of 16.67 percent
and the CEPD target of 14 percent. Accordingly, the institute said,
the consumer growth rate will increase moderately to 7.38 percent,
also higher than the DGBAS estimate.</P>
      <P>Regarding foreign trade, TIER estimated this year's export growth
to be 5.91 percent and import growth to be 6.89 percent.</P>
      <P>TIER said it believes that international oil prices will continue
to grow steadily throughout the year, and many imported agricultural
raw products will be priced low. With exchange rates in Asian
countries stabilized, the annual wholesale price index is estimated
will grow 4.73 percent, indicating that the predicted 6.74 percent
growth for the first half of 1998 will decline in the third and
fourth quarters.</P>
      <P>With regard to exchange rates, the first quarter has seen some
fluctuations due to factors such as a robust US dollar, public
speculation, developments in the Asian economic situation and
seasonal capital requirements, largely continuing the depreciation
trends of last year's fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar fell 5.8 percent in the first quarter of
this year, TIER noted, predicting that 1998's average exchange rate
will be NT$32.45 to US$1 in the face of the further stabilization of
Asian stock markets and the increased capital requirement (in NT$) in
the second half of the year.</P>
      <P>TIER had originally estimated this year's exchange rate at NT$32
against the greenback. CHIER has also adjusted its estimate, moving
it to NT$32.5.</P>
      <P>If the Japanese yen and Southeast Asian currencies stabilize, the
domestic market's interest rate fluctuations may also see a decrease
in foreign pressures. The estimated discount rate may thereby
continue at the current 5.25 percent, TIER said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-TECH SECTOR TO ACCOUNT FOR 40 PERCENT OF MANUFACTURING OUTPUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Output of technology-intensive industries
will account for 40 percent of the manufacturing sector by the turn
of the century, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) predicted on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Reporting at a meeting convened by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) on the government's plan to develop Taiwan into an
Asia-Pacific manufacturing center, IDB officials reported that
production in Taiwan's manufacturing sector is estimated to be US$300
billion in 2000, 40 percent of which will come from the high-tech
sector. Basic industries will make up 35 percent of the total, while
traditional industries will account for 25 percent, they added.</P>
      <P>Output from the manufacturing sector totaled US$92.5 billion in
1986, at which time the high-tech sector accounted for only 24
percent, IDB statistics show. Basic and traditional industries made
up for 36 percent and 24.5 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing sector's production had risen to more than
US$220 billion by 1997, with 38.8 percent coming from
technology-intensive industries. The ratio contributed by the basic
and traditional industry sectors dropped to 36.7 percent and 24.5
percent, respectively, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>However, the IDB officials warned of the possible impact on
Taiwan of mainland China's recent adjustment of its industrial
policy, which has shifted its focus from labor-intensive industries
to technology-intensive industries.</P>
      <P>Yeh Huey-ching, executive secretary of the MOEA's Committee of
Economic Research and Development, said the mainland's newly set
industrial policy may pose a threat to Taiwan, which has been
actively developing industries related to the electronics and
computer sectors.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan should pay close heed to the future
course of mainland China's economic development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although its foreign exchange reserves
have fallen for the second consecutive month, Taiwan still maintains
its position as holder of the world's third-largest foreign exchange
reserves, the Central Bank of China (CBC) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>CBC statistics show that Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
totaled US$83.615 billion as of the end of March, a reduction of
US$396 million from the previous month. The figure in February also
represented a decrease of US$19 million from January.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves have eroded by US$6.41 billion
over the past three months, from US$90.025 billion at the end of last
year to US$83.615 billion in March.</P>
      <P>Chou Ar-Ting, director of the CBC's Foreign Exchange Department,
attributed the fall to the depreciation of the Japanese yen and the
German mark against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>Chou said that Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves are lagging
behind those of Japan and mainland China. Japan's foreign exchange
reserves amounted to US$223.14 billion as of the end of February,
while mainland China posted a distant second with US$140.3 billion
during the same period.</P>
      <P>Chou predicted an increase in Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
in April, basing his forecast on signs that the greenback won't
maintain its current strong trend against other foreign currencies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING EXPECTED TO SIGN ASEAN'S NUCLEAR-FREE PACT: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is expected to be the
first nuclear power to embrace the nuclear-free concept of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a Bangkok-based
English newspaper revealed Friday.</P>
      <P>The Nation reported in a special article, titled "China Wins Over
ASEAN Partner," that after initial disagreements over the draft
treaty, amendments have been made by ASEAN that have narrowed the gap
between the association and Beijing.</P>
      <P>More discussions and negotiations on the treaty, however, are
required with the world's other nuclear powers, the daily said.</P>
      <P>The paper said that in the just-concluded fourth consultative
meeting between ASEAN and mainland China in Kuala Lumpur, Beijing
responded "constructively" regarding major political issues, such as
the South China Sea disputes, Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in
Southeast Asia (TAC), Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zone and
major powers' relations.</P>
      <P>"Strange as it may seem, the South China Sea dispute was not
discussed this time as one might have expected," it said, adding that
before the meeting, Vietnam levied harsh criticism against mainland
China for Beijing's plan to turn the disputed South China Sea islands
into tourist spots.</P>
      <P>After years of rejections, Beijing has become more willing to
discuss the TAC and mainland China's possible future inclusion in it.</P>
      <P>The grouping has finally agreed to the much-awaited protocol to
amend the TAC so as to allow non-Southeast Asian countries to
associate with the 1976 document, which outlines ways to strengthen
cooperation and use peaceful means to solve conflicts. The TAC is
currently limited to ASEAN members and Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>"The Kuala Lumpur ASEAN-China meeting has confirmed one home
truth: China is here to stay and it will remain proactive in engaging
the regional grouping," Kavi Chongkittavorn, the executive editor of
The Nation, wrote in the article.</P>
      <P>"Beijing wants and will become a very influential partner in the
overall schemes of things in the region," he concluded.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Beijing agreed to dispatch two high-powered
missions later this month and next month respectively to Southeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>Beijing also pledged to earmark US$750 billion for infrastructure
and other development projects for the next three years and invited
ASEAN countries to participate in these mega-projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>6 HOPEFULS REGISTER FOR DPP CHAIR RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The race for the chairmanship of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took dramatic twists
and turns on Friday, with four additional contestants registering as
candidates.</P>
      <P>As a result, a total of six hopefuls, inclduing two female
politicians, will vie for the chairmanship of Taiwan's largest
opposition party.</P>
      <P>Legislator-at-large Chang Chun-hung announced his decision to
run for the DPP's top post at an early morning news conference.
Chang said the upcoming chairmanship election is a "historic
occasion" that he would not absent himself from it.</P>
      <P>"This will be the first time that the DPP chairman will be
directly elected by all party members. I would not absent myself
from this 'democratic feast," Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former DPP secretary-general and a prominent member of
incumbent chairman Hsu Hsin-liang's dominant "Formosa" faction,
further said his chairmanship bid is not for power, but aimed at
helping stimulate Taiwan's rejuvenation.</P>
      <P>"Although many party elders have advised me not to enter the
race to avert possible harm to his political stature, I still
decides to run out of a strong sense of mission," Chang said, adding
if he is elected, he will lead the DPP to transform itself from an
opposition force to a ruling party.</P>
      <P>Chang, who once temporarily served as acting party chairman in
early 1996 after former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh resinged to
assume political responsibility for the DPP's poor performance in
nationwide presidential and National Assembly elections, is widely
believed to be the strongest competitor to Lin Yi-hsiung, the
party's top adviser who was the first to register for the
chairmanship race.</P>
      <P>Both Chang and Lin were former members of the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly. "I'm convinced that I and my former colleague will set a
model for future party chair elections. We'll make the race a
'gentlemen's competition.'"</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Lu Hsiu-lien also registered for the
DPP chairmanship election scheduled for May 24, but she said she
will not mount any campaign activities. "I have registered as a
candidate mainly to facilitate my support for Lin Yi-hsiung. I hope
Lin will be our party's next leader. I hope his high moral stature
will help revive the DPP's idealism," Lu noted.</P>
      <P>Former DPP spokeswoman Sisy Chen and Huang Fu, president of a
radical pro-Taiwan independence subgroup in the DPP, also completed
registrations as candidates on Friday, the last day for
registration.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yen Chin-fu, like Lin, registered his candidacy
shortly after the registration opened four days ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WATERFRONT DISPUTE SEEN NARROWING AUSTRALIA'S TRADE DEFICIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The current waterfront battle between
the Howard government, Patrick Stevedores Ltd. and the Maritime Union
of Australia (MUA) is expected to help Australia narrow the trade gap
because imported goods are being hit harder than exports at major
Australian ports, according to a report from economists at HSBC
Markets in Sydney.</P>
      <P>The Federal Court on Thursday ordered Patrick to reinstate its
sacked workers, but Patrick and the Howard government appealed the
legal battle at the High Court Friday, causing the waterfront problem
to remain unsolved despite Thursday's major victory for the union
workers.</P>
      <P>The economists said 11,000 containers are stuck on the wharves of
major terminals in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.</P>
      <P>Most of the imported goods are containerized, while most of the
Australian exports -- including iron ore, coal and mineral products
-- are shipped in bulk carriers that are unaffected by the waterfront
dispute, they said.</P>
      <P>Those affected are Australian exports of manufactured goods,
including motor vehicles and auto parts, aluminum and dairy products,
beef, seafood, and raw materials such as cotton, the economists said.</P>
      <P>And some of these exports have been diverted to the terminals of
P&amp;O Ports, the largest stevedoring firm unaffected in the waterfront
dispute, they noted.</P>
      <P>They said only 5 percent of Australian exports have been stranded
at major ports during the three-week dispute, in which members of the
MUA and sacked unionized workers and other union workers blocked
cargoes at Patrick's terminals.</P>
      <P>But 10 percent of Australia's imports are stranded at the same
major ports.</P>
      <P>The economists said the dispute is bad for Australia's image as a
trading nation, and that the only good news is that the country could
narrow the trade gap as a result of the waterfront battle.</P>
      <P>The MUA won a major victory Thursday against Patrick and the
Howard government when the presiding judge of the Federal Court
ordered Patrick to reinstate the 2,000 union workers it fired.</P>
      <P>But the battle is not over yet, because Patrick appealed to the
High Court of Australia Thursday night to delay the Federal Court
decision.</P>
      <P>The matter is now becoming uncertain, although some of the sacked
workers may return to work under different operators.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith said
the MUA victory did not mean that the government under Prime Minister
John Howard will change its reforms on the Australian waterfront
policy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALBRIGHT LOOKING TO CONTINUE STRATEGIC DIALOGUE WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  23  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will seek to expand a strategic dialogue with mainland China
when she arrives in Beijing later this month to pave the way for
President Bill Clinton's visit in June, a senior State Department
official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official said that apart from summit preparations, Albright's
visit will have another purpose to which he said there has not been
enough attention paid -- strategic dialogue. In other words, "we sit
down with China the way we do with other important relationships" and
discuss world issues, he said.</P>
      <P>The key point of the secretary of state's trip to Beijing from
April 29 to May 1, however, is to finalize the agenda of the second
Clinton-Jiang summit in eight months. The official, who could not be
named, said that priority issues would remain human rights,
non-proliferation and trade, although the US would also like to give
"considerable attention" to such issues as the environment and the
rule of law.</P>
      <P>On human rights, the official said that the US will continue to
press mainland China for improvements. "We have never stated that the
release of one or two dissidents checks the box and that that's the
end of the human rights concerns in China," he said in response to a
question that lesser-known political prisoners might be ignored now
that Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, two of the most famous Chinese
dissidents, have been released.</P>
      <P>"The main thing is to make progress across the board on human
rights issues, and we're going to be raising more than just a couple
of dissidents," the senior official added. However, he would not say
whether Albright will seek the release of any individuals.</P>
      <P>This will be Albright's second trip to mainland China as
secretary of state and is part of an eight-day tour of four East
Asian countries. She leaves on Sunday night for Japan and, after
mainland China, she will go on to South Korea and Mongolia, returning
to Washington on May 3.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at a State Department background briefing,
the official described the current relationship between the US and
mainland China as being "on the right trajectory."</P>
      <P>While Washington pursues a policy of active engagement with
mainland China, the official said, "there is every indication that
the Chinese are serious about wanting this engagement."</P>
      <P>As part of that engagement policy, Clinton is due to visit
Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Hong Kong from late June to early July.
An announcement on details of the visit is expected after the
secretary of state's return.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Anti Nuclear Action Coalition
said on Friday that it will hold an anti nuclear march at 1:00 p.m.
on April 26, 1998, to mark the 12th anniversary of the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster.</P>
      <P>The coalition, which is organized by more than 40 Taiwan
environmental and anti nuclear groups, pointed out at a press
conference that in addition to remembering the Chernobyl disaster,
the march is also aimed at opposing construction of a fourth nuclear
reactor in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The coalition noted that the Chernobyl disaster, which occurred
on April 25, 1986, resulted in heavy casualties and wide-ranging
nuclear pollution, and has been described as the biggest disaster on
earth. It added that Taiwan, which has an area of only 36,000 square
kilometers, and already has three nuclear plants, will suffer
unthinkable damage if there is a nuclear accident.</P>
      <P>The marchers are scheduled to gather at 1:00 p.m. at the main
gates of National Taiwan University, at the intersection of Roosevelt
Road and Hsinsheng South Road. The parade will travel along Roosevelt
Road, past the Taiwan Power Company building, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, and end in front of the Presidential Palace on
Katagalan Avenue, where a rally will be held.</P>
      <P>Prior to the parade, a memorial service will be held for the
victims of the Chernobyl disaster, while dances and skits will be
performed at the rally.</P>
      <P>According to the coalition, many countries have stopped building
nuclear reactors, but they still have enough electrical power.</P>
      <P>It added that Taiwan, with its high density of population and
small area, should not build more nuclear plants but should develop
other forms of power generation instead, such as solar and wind
energy. At the same time, the public should also learn to conserve
energy in order to allow their children to enjoy a better life and

      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) on Friday
denied that it has ever boasted of its ability to keep Taiwan out of
the financial turmoil which has swept Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The CBC said in a statement that it has simply claimed that "the
harm to Taiwan resulting from the financial shakeup is relatively
small" compared with some of the other countries in the region.</P>
      <P>The statement was issued in response to foreign wire service
reports that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) gave Taiwan a warning
that it should not boast of having already weathered the financial
storm.</P>
      <P>The CBC said that the effects of the upheaval have already been
felt in a variety of Taiwan's economic activities, citing the fact
that Taiwan's economic growth for 1998 has been adjusted downward to
between 6.2 and 6 percent by government and private economic research
agencies.</P>
      <P>At a time when boosting exports has become difficult, the
government has turned its attention on how to stimulate local demand

      <P>About 5 percent of female teenage students
admit to having been victims of date rape, according to the results
of a survey made public on Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey also revealed that 20 percent of the male teenage

would find out. In contrast, 50 percent of the males claimed that
they would never rape their dates or conduct any sexual misconduct.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that males tend to have a more lenient
attitude toward date rape, as 13 percent of them think that date rape
is forgivable if they have spent a lot money on their dates, while
only 5 percent of the females surveyed agreed with this.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, around 22 percent of male teenagers and
10 percent of female teenagers opined that date rape is forgivable if
the girl is already "out of control because of sexual excitement,"

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's days of large trade surpluses may
be nearing an end as Asia's financial crisis begins to restrain
exports and threatens to hold back economic growth, according to
reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Exports fell 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 1998 while
imports were flat, chalking up a rare trade deficit of US$70 million
against a surplus of US$1.8 billion in the first quarter of 1997, the
WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The government aims for 4 percent export growth this year, but
finance ministry officials have warned that this target may be hard
to meet, the report said.</P>
      <P>Private economists suggest the economic gloom in Japan and across
the region could torpedo Taiwan's trade balance into deficit this
year for the first time since 1975.</P>
      <P>Exports to Asia were the hardest hit, with exports to Southeast
Asia sliding 27.1 percent and those to Japan falling 23.7 percent in
the first quarter of 1998.</P>
      <P>In spite of the alarming numbers, both government and private
analysts remain sanguine about Taiwan's prospects. Relative strength
in the domestic economy and the favorable structure of exports will
help shield Taiwan from the worst of the fallout from the region's
financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>The economy may be affected later this year by uncertainties over
key elections, but the launch of public works such as a US$15 billion
high-speed rail project, combined with the island's high-technology
juggernaut, will help maintain growth, the report added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN HONORS CONTROL YUAN'S RIGHT OF INVESTIGATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Friday
expressed his willingness to make amends for the late filing of a
report on a loan to Wu Tse-yuan, former chief of Pingtung County, and
said he will accept any penalty resulting from the late filing.</P>
      <P>Lien also said through Liao Feng-teh, director of the vice
presidential office, that he will respect the right of the Control
Yuan to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Hsu Li-teh, senior advisor to the president,
Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, and Tien Ching-yi, head of the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT's) Pingtung County Committee, the vice president
visited Chun Ji township in Pingtung County and attended a seminar
with local residents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nantou County Legislator Tsai Huang-lang of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suggested on Friday
that the Legislative Yuan should set up a special group to examine
whether or not Lien's loan was illegal.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, it is impossible for the Control Yuan to
impeach Lien, who is the convener of the nominating committee for
members of the Control Yuan; and it is also impossible for Justice
Minister Liao Cheng-hao to investigate, because he is subordinate to
Lien.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Legislator Fong Ting-kuo from the opposition New
Party suggested that Lien should make a report on the matter to the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers, including Keelung City Legislator Hsu
Chao-ping and Yunlin County Legislator Liao Fuw-peen, argued very
hard in Lien's defense, urging the opposition party to treat the
matter "rationally" and not to "try to tarnish the image" of the vice
president.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy is estimated to grow by 6
percent in 1998, provided the growth rate of the consumer price index
(CPI) is kept under 3 percent per year, Central Bank of China (CBC)
Governor Fai-nan Perng said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The monetary policymaker's forecast came one day after the Asian

resign to the newly elected Legislative Yuan earlier next year
following the year-end legislative elections, a high-ranking
executive official said on Friday.</P>

last September, will lead his Cabinet in a mass resignation.</P>

      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, a deputy secretary-general
of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), concluded a
three-day ice-breaking visit to mainland China and returned to Taipei
on Friday night.</P>
      <P>Jan said at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport that he
believes the visit by the eight-member SEF delegation has given the
two sides a better understanding of each other's basic stance on the
future exchange of officials from the SEF and its mainland
counterpart the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>Jan said that in his meetings with ARATS officials, they also
discussed other issues including illegal mainland immigrants and the
smuggling of mainland goods into Taiwan. Although the ARATS gave no
clear answers to the issues, Jan said that this was just the
beginning.</P>
      <P>Jan's visit was the first high-level contact between the SEF and
the ARATS after a nearly three-year hiatus. The two semi-official
bodies are responsible for handling cross-strait contacts in the
absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SUSPENDS DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH GUINEA BISSAU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Foreign Affairs Ministry on Friday
announced the suspension of diplomatic relations between the Republic
of China and the African nation of Guinea Bissau.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a statement issued late Friday night that it
is regrettable that the West African country has conceded to pressure
from mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We have instructed our ambassador to Guinea Bissau, Weng
Ting-long, to lodge our strongest protest with the Guinea Bissau
government, and have decided to suspend our formal relations and all
cooperative programs with that country immediately," it said.</P>
      <P>The ministry also condemned Beijing for "intentionally hurting
the passions of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait by
playing a double-handed policy" -- strongly calling for the
resumption of cross-strait negotiations on one hand while luring the
ROC's diplomatic allies on the other.</P>
      <P>"The move by Beijing will surely undermine the harmonious
atmosphere between the two sides and result in a negative impact on
future interaction between them," the ministry statement warned.</P>
      <P>"We should have no illusions about Beijing, since it has never
ceased its attempts to blockade the ROC in the international
community," the statement said.</P>
      <P>The ministry pledged that it will continue with its policy of
expanding its foreign relations in order to ensure national survival.</P>
      <P>According to wire service reports, Guinea Bissau Foreign Affairs
Minister Fernando Delfim Da Silva signed a communique on forging
official ties with his mainland counterpart, Tang Jiaxuan, in Beijing
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>News of the new Guinea Bissau-mainland China ties came as a
complete surprise to Taipei as there had been no warning signals
beforehand.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu in a hastily convened press conference
late Friday night admitted that his ministry had "no advance
knowledge of the change."</P>
      <P>Hu said that he "has the feeling of having been cheated by Guinea
Bissau," especially since the wife of Guinea Bissau President Joao
Bernendo Vieira concluded a six-day visit to Taipei on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said he has reported the diplomatic setback

      <P>Eight Asian economies, including the
four "Asian tigers," have been placed among the top 10 of a World
Bank ranking for long-term economic growth.</P>
      <P>Latest World Bank statistics on the average economic growth of
every economy in the world over the past 30 years show that Taiwan
enjoyed an average 8.6 percent rise in economic development, placing
it fourth in the world.</P>
      <P>The African nation of Botswana came first, with 13 percent, ahead
of Oman in the Middle East, with 9.5 percent; and South Korea, with
8.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that mainland China, which posted 8.5 percent
average economic growth over the past 30 years, ranked fifth,

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF FLIGHTS AT SUNGSHAN AIRPORT TO BE CUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) said on Saturday it will unveil a detailed plan for cutting the
number of flights at Taipei's Sungshan Airport within three months in
an effort to improve aviation safety.</P>
      <P>CAA Acting Director-General Chang Chia-chu, who concurrently
serves as vice minister of transportation and communications, made
the announcement at the opening session of a flight safety strategic
meeting.</P>
      <P>Quoting CAA tallies, Chang said the number of flights at Taipei's
domestic airport has increased threefold since the government
implemented an open-skies policy in 1987.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of local residents, Chang said, the
government has allowed more carriers to fly domestic routes and to
increase the number of flights using the airport.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the airport is now over-used. It currently hosts an
average of 580 landings and takeoffs per day, or 38 flights per
hour," Chang said, adding that this flight density is even higher
than at Hong Kong and Tokyo airports.</P>
      <P>Because of the limited space at the airport, Chang said, control
measures often have to be imposed at the airport. "Against this
backdrop, flight delays have become all too common, and workloads for
flight controllers have increased tremendously."</P>
      <P>Following a string of air disasters here in the past few months,
Chang said, flight safety has become of paramount concern. "The CAA
has listed the reduction of flights at the Sungshan Airport as an
important step in our all-out aviation safety upgrading project," he
said, adding that a comprehensive reduction plan will be crafted in
three months.</P>
      <P>The aviation meeting was organized by a fight safety strategic
task force set up by the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) on April 1 to draft a package of measures to
restore public confidence in domestic flight safety in the wake of
two recent major air disasters which resulted in the death of 215
people.</P>
      <P>Saturday's meeting brought together local and foreign aviation
experts to review Taiwan's existing flight control measures and work
out strategies to improve its aviation safety system. Among the
foreign participants was a Chinese-American senior project director
at NASA, Dr. Hung Chao-kuei, who has been invited to serve as
convener of the MOTC's aviation safety task force.</P>
      <P>The task force is expected to unveil an aviation safety
reinforcement package on May 1.</P>
      <P>Saturday's meeting focused discussion on Taiwan's current system
of safety checks and procedures for handling flight mishaps or
disasters.</P>

(By Wu Shean-shen and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Dan, 29, a mainland Chinese
dissident newly released on medical parole, said Friday in New York
that he hopes to take part in the activities that will be held in
Hong Kong on June 4 to commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square
democracy movement. Neither Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), nor the HKSAR
Immigration Department would comment on this matter Friday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong Citizens' Patriotic Pro-Democracy Movement
Federation, which sponsors an observance each year of the student
demonstrations, said it believes the possibility of Wang's visit is
slim.</P>
      <P>Wang told the press in New York Friday that he is eager to join
the forthcoming memorial occasion in Hong Kong. He added, however,
that whether or not he is present, he hopes "to discuss the matter
with Tung."</P>
      <P>Reporters asked Tung about Wang's possible trip both when he
entered and left an office building, but both times the Hong Kong
leader only smiled and evaded the sensitive question.</P>
      <P>The immigration department of the HKSAR government meanwhile said
that it was unwilling to comment on the entrance of a specific
figure.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong federation said it is considering inviting Wang to
attend the occasion, even though it doubts he would be allowed to
come.</P>
      <P>According to the rules of the HKSAR immigration department,
mainland China's passport holders who wish to enter Hong Kong from
foreign countries for official business must apply for visas at an
embassy or consulate of mainland China, while those who wish to make
a transit stop in Hong Kong on the way to the Chinese mainland or
elsewhere can have a seven day visa-free stay.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG DAN HAILS TAIWAN'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, April 24 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prominent mainland China dissident Wang
Dan in an interview on Friday hailed Taiwan's democratic development,
saying it has inspired mainland Chinese and serves as a good example
for the mainland's pro-democracy movement.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Wang, who arrived in the US last
week following his release from a mainland prison on medical grounds,
expressed the hope that the people of Taiwan can continue to voice
concern as well as extend support to the pro-democracy movement. The
future of Taiwan is closely connected with the progress of democracy
on the mainland, he claimed.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old dissident explained that only when the mainland
is no longer under one-party authoritarian rule and only when it
begins to implement democracy can Taiwan emerge from the shadow of
the military threat from the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang said that a just-concluded ice-breaking mainland visit by
Jan Jyh-horng, a deputy secretary-general of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), marked a significant step forward in
cross-strait relations stalled for nearly three years. Jan and Tang
Shubei, vice chairman of SEF's mainland counterpart the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), also agreed that SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu should pay a visit to the mainland by the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>"It's a good thing that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
willing to sit down and talk," Wang said, adding that although the
two sides have their differences, for the welfare of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, they should endeavor to find an
acceptable compromise. He stressed that Taiwan and the mainland
should avoid any form of military confrontation.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he has a good impression of Taiwan, but added that
all his knowledge of the island is based on conversations with Taiwan
businessmen and reporters he met in mainland China. He expressed the
hope that some day he will have an opportunity to visit Taiwan to
"experience the island's democratic achievements."</P>
      <P>Should he visit Taiwan, what he most wants to learn about is the
process of the island's democratic development and the problems that
Taiwan democracy currently faces, Wang said. Meanwhile, he said he
would like to contact people from different parties and from
different sectors of society to absorb the "Taiwan experience" in
democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed optimism over the prospects for the mainland
pro-democracy movement. He stressed that the mainland authorities
cannot reverse the trend of democratic reforms, especially when they
have undertaken economic reforms. He called on the people of the
mainland to fight for their freedom and rights and also urged
mainland Chinese Premier Zhu-Rongji to promote political reforms
along with the economic reforms, noting that the two are inseparable.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang said that pressure from the international
community has helped improve the human rights situation there. He
agreed that Washington should engage with Beijing, which will in turn
give it the opportunity to pressure and influence the mainland
authorities.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that the US government should know the
improvement of human rights record doesn't lie in the release of
political prisoners; rather it lies in the inauguration and
implementation of legal systems that provide adequate protection for
human rights.</P>
      <P>The dissident, one of the student leaders in the 1989
pro-democracy movement which ended in a bloody military crackdown in
Tiananmen Square, said that compared with 1989, government control on
people and society has relaxed somewhat, but he warned that this
relaxation is a result of pressure on the mainland authorities and
that they might tighten their control at any time should they feel
the need.</P>
      <P>On the future of overseas pro-democracy groups, Wang confirmed
the contributions these groups have made to the democracy movement on
the mainland, citing the fact that they always play a vital part in
prompting the release of political prisoners.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he doesn't think the overseas pro-democracy groups
have lost their goals, adding that the mainland activists still count
on their overseas compatriots to help them push for democratic
development on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The exiled activist said that what he can do now for the
democratic development of his homeland is to urge the mainland
authorities to release more political prisoners. He also said he
plans to continue his studies in history in the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By Wen-hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ho Shin Gigamedia Center Inc. (Gigamedia),
an affiliate of Taiwan's giant Koo's Group, signed a strategic
partnership agreement on Friday with Microsoft Corp. to develop
quality cable-based broadband network services here.</P>
      <P>Microsoft will provide technical assistance, and both companies
will jointly develop advanced set-top boxes which will set a national
standard for others to follow.</P>
      <P>Present at the signing ceremony were President Hsiao Hsiang-ping,
Vice President Chang Jui-chan, and Chairman Koo Chi-yun of Gigamedia,
while Microsoft was represented by Asian Region Deputy Director
Pieter Knook, Microsoft ICU Global Affairs Director Stephen Wu, and
Microsoft Taiwan President Fan Cheng-chu.</P>
      <P>Although not present at the signing, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates
expressed in a pre-recorded videotape his belief that the partnership
between Microsoft and Gigamedia will provide clients with faster,
more reliable cable-based broadband network services than traditional
dial-up networks. With a hundredfold increase in access speeds, Gates
believes this kind of high-speed broadband network service will bring
more convenience, more efficiency, and more fulfillment to people's
daily lives.</P>
      <P>For his part, Koo said that Koo's Group has been actively
involved in the cable industry for a decade, and that this new
partnership with Microsoft will provide the Taiwan public with faster
quality network services. Content-wise, he said, value-added network
services will be added to Koo's Group subsidiaries in the financial,
tourism, and real estate industries in the future.</P>
      <P>Koo stressed the importance of a country's implementation of
information technology in the twenty-first century. With the
high-speed information superhighway being developed by Koo's Group,
he said, Taiwan will become more competitive in the information age,
and the public will also be able to enjoy new standards of living
with the introduction of distance-learning, distance-medical care,
and other educational and entertainment opportunities.</P>
      <P>According to Koo, Microsoft will provide its network technology
laboratories in Redmond, Wash. to help Gigamedia set up its network
structure. Microsoft will also provide its expertise in areas such as
newly developed network application programs, server software,
technology platforms, and network operating systems to assist
Gigamedia with the installation of its cable-based broadband
networks.</P>
      <P>The joint venture between the two giants also has plans to
develop advanced set-top boxes in the future. Hsiao stressed that
set-top boxes will become an important peripheral product, especially
with the impending arrival of digital television sets. With a set-top
box, a regular television set can become a PC TV or a Web TV. Through
their partnership, he said, Gigamedia and Microsoft hope to develop
international and domestic standards that support Microsoft's
operating platforms.</P>

Transportantion and Communications (MOTC) to seek measures for
upgrading Taiwan's aviation safety.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that Taiwan's economic prosperity has
stimulated the demand for air traffic. Both domestic and
international flights have increased substantially over the past
decades. "However, a recent spate of air disasters here has
indicated that our flight safety management and control systems are
far from perferct."</P>
      <P>Noting that aviation safety requires constant concern and
incessant work, Liu said obtaining a flight safety certificate from
the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) couldn't ensure that
Taiwan's civil aviation services would be mishap- or
disaster-free all the time. "We must continue devoting full energies
to safety work in order to restore public confidence in our civil
aviation services."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, MOTC Minister Lin Feng-cheng said
the ministry will join forces with other relevant government
agencies and local carriers to imporve domestic flight safety. "We
hope our aviation safety will be able to meet the top world standard
within a year."</P>
      <P>The three-day meeting brought together more than 100 local and
foreign civil aviation experts, administraters and airline executives
to review Taiwan's existing flight control measures and mull
strategies to improve its overall safety management and crontol
systems.</P>
      <P>Among the foreign experts was Dr. Hung Chao-kuei, a
Chinese-American senior project director at NASA, who has also been
invited to serve as convener of an MOTC flight safety reinforcement
task force inaugurated on April 1.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ministry will refer to all the opinions presented at
the meeting in drafting steps to reinforce aviaition safety.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Acting Director-General Chang Chia-chu of the MOTC's
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said at the meeting the CAA
will unveil a detailed plan for cutting the number of flights at
Taipei's Sungshan Airport within three months in an effort to improve
aviation safety.</P>
      <P>Quoting CAA tallies, Chang, also an MOTC vice minister, said the
number of flights at Taipei's domestic airport has increased
threefold since the government implemented an open-skies policy in
1987.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of local residents, Chang said, the
government has allowed more carriers to fly domestic routes and to
increase the number of flights using the airport.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the airport is now over-used. It currently hosts an
average of 580 landings and takeoffs per day, or 38 flights per
hour," Chang said, adding that this flight density is even higher
than at Hong Kong and Tokyo airports.</P>
      <P>Because of the limited space at the airport, Chang said, control
measures often have to be imposed at the airport. "Against this
backdrop, flight delays have become all too common, and workloads for
flight controllers have increased tremendously."</P>
      <P>Following a string of air disasters here in the past few months,
Chang said, flight safety has become of paramount concern. "The CAA
has listed the reduction of flights at the Sungshan Airport as an
important step in our all-out aviation safety upgrading project," he
said, adding that a comprehensive reduction plan will be crafted in
three months.</P>
      <P>The MOTC's flight safety task force is expected to unveil an
aviation safety reinforcement package on May 1.</P>
      <P>Saturday's meeting focused discussion on Taiwan's current system
of safety checks and procedures for handling flight mishaps or
disasters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG DAN HAILS TAIWAN'S DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, April 24 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prominent mainland China dissident Wang
Dan in an interview on Friday hailed Taiwan's democratic development,
saying it has inspired mainland Chinese and serves as a good example
for the mainland's pro-democracy movement.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Wang, who arrived in the US last
week following his release from a mainland prison on medical grounds,
expressed the hope that the people of Taiwan can continue to voice
concern as well as extend support to the pro-democracy movement. The
future of Taiwan is closely connected with the progress of democracy
on the mainland, he claimed.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old dissident explained that only when the mainland
is no longer under one-party authoritarian rule and only when it
begins to implement democracy can Taiwan emerge from the shadow of
the military threat from the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang said that a just-concluded ice-breaking mainland visit by
Jan Jyh-horng, a deputy secretary-general of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), marked a significant step forward in
cross-strait relations stalled for nearly three years. Jan and Tang
Shubei, vice chairman of SEF's mainland counterpart the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), also agreed that SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu should pay a visit to the mainland by the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>"It's a good thing that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
willing to sit down and talk," Wang said, adding that although the
two sides have their differences, for the welfare of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, they should endeavor to find an
acceptable compromise. He stressed that Taiwan and the mainland
should avoid any form of military confrontation.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he has a good impression of Taiwan, but added that
all his knowledge of the island is based on conversations with Taiwan
businessmen and reporters he met in mainland China. He expressed the
hope that some day he will have an opportunity to visit Taiwan to
"experience the island's democratic achievements."</P>
      <P>Should he visit Taiwan, what he most wants to learn about is the
process of the island's democratic development and the problems that
Taiwan democracy currently faces, Wang said. Meanwhile, he said he
would like to contact people from different parties and from
different sectors of society to absorb the "Taiwan experience" in
democratic reforms.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang expressed optimism over the prospects for the mainland
pro-democracy movement. He stressed that the mainland authorities
cannot reverse the trend of democratic reforms, especially when they
have undertaken economic reforms. He called on the people of the
mainland to fight for their freedom and rights and also urged
mainland Chinese Premier Zhu-Rongji to promote political reforms
along with the economic reforms, noting that the two are inseparable.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang said that pressure from the international
community has helped improve the human rights situation there. He
agreed that Washington should engage with Beijing, which will in turn
give it the opportunity to pressure and influence the mainland
authorities.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that the US government should know the
improvement of human rights record doesn't lie in the release of
political prisoners; rather it lies in the inauguration and
implementation of legal systems that provide adequate protection for
human rights.</P>
      <P>The dissident, one of the student leaders in the 1989
pro-democracy movement which ended in a bloody military crackdown in
Tiananmen Square, said that compared with 1989, government control on
people and society has relaxed somewhat, but he warned that this
relaxation is a result of pressure on the mainland authorities and
that they might tighten their control at any time should they feel
the need.</P>
      <P>On the future of overseas pro-democracy groups, Wang confirmed
the contributions these groups have made to the democracy movement on
the mainland, citing the fact that they always play a vital part in
prompting the release of political prisoners.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he doesn't think the overseas pro-democracy groups
have lost their goals, adding that the mainland activists still count
on their overseas compatriots to help them push for democratic
development on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The exiled activist said that what he can do now for the
democratic development of his homeland is to urge the mainland
authorities to release more political prisoners. He also said he
plans to continue his studies in history in the United States.</P>
      <P>The young man who has vowed to put up a lifelong fight for
democracy and human rights on the mainland said that if the mainland
authorities allow him to do, he will one day return there. He said
he doesn't expect that day to come too soon, but is confident that
he won't have to wait too long.</P>
      <P>Wang was sentenced to four years in prison for his role in the
Tiananmen Square protests. He served that sentence, but was charged
with subversion last year and sentenced to 11 years. He was released
last week on medical grounds and sent directly to the Henry Ford
Hospital in Detroit for a physical checkup.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The average size of mainland-bound
investment projects approved between January and March posted a
nearly 37 percent cut from the year-earlier level, signaling the
success of the "no haste, be patient" economic policy toward
investment in mainland China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Statistics made public by the MOEA's Investment Commission show
that a total of 156 proposed investment projects in the mainland were
approved during the first quarter of this year with an accumulated
value reaching US$347.23 million. Compared with the same period of
last year, the number of approved projects doubled, while the total
value increased 26.17 percent.</P>
      <P>The average value of approved projects in the first quarter of
this year stood at US$2.22 million, much lower than the US$3.52
million registered during the same period of last year, a cut of
36.93 percent. This reduction indicates that the new investments are
centered on small- and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>An MOEA official said that the statistics regarding investment
from Taiwan compiled by the mainland's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation also testify to the fact that the size of the
proposed investment projects by Taiwan businessmen has shrunk.</P>
      <P>The mainland figures show that between January and September of
1997, the actual investment value contributed by Taiwan businessmen
rose 0.49 percent from the same period of the previous year. The
number of newly-approved projects proposed by Taiwan businessmen
during the nine-month period, however, fell 9.1 percent, while the
combined value showed a whopping 54 percent drop.</P>
      <P>According to the "no haste, be patient" policy announced in the
second half of 1996, investment projects in the mainland are not
allowed to surpass US$50 million in value.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHORING UP TIES WITH ALLIES TOP DIPLOMATIC WORK: SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Saturday
he will personally chair a meeting in the near future to chart a new
diplomatic work plan.</P>
      <P>Siew, who left for Malaysia Saturday afternoon for a private
visit, made the statement in response to the establishment
of diplomatic ties between mainland China and one of Taiwan's
former allies, Guinea Bissau, on Friday.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the Republic of China on Taiwan faces a
diplomatic plight, Siew said he will chair a meeting to pool
resources of relevant government agencies to further expand the
country's external relations.</P>
      <P>Siew said the government will give top priority to consolidating
official ties with the ROC's current diplomatic allies, which number
less than 30 following the switch of diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing by three African allies so far this year -- South
Africa, the Central African Republic and Guinea Bissau.</P>
      <P>"We'll also continue to promote substantive relations with
countries with which we do not maintain formal diplomatic
relations, as well as to press ahead with our bid to join major
international organizations," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Given its economic strength and suscessful political
democratization, Siew said the ROC deserves a decent place in the
international community. He also urged all fellow countrymen to join
forces with the government to expand Taiwan's diplomatic frontiers
and upgrade its status in the world community.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said he sees
no reasons to change the ROC's current pragmatic diplomatic
policy and strategy.</P>
      <P>"For our national survival and development, we must reach out to
the world," a confident Hu stressed, adding that the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs will do its utmost to shore up the country's
full-fledged diplomatic ties with its allies while expanding
exchanges and cooperation with countries which recognize
rival mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hu said the ROC should not link its diplomatic work to
mainland China's attitude. "We must do whatever we should do, even
though such actions may offend or anger Beijing."</P>
      <P>Asserting Guinea Bissau's switch of diplomatic allegiance is
only a temporary setback, Hu said that the ROC will not be daunted
by it. "A temporary setback doesn't mean a long-term failure. We are
confident that we'll be able to open a new diplomatic frontier."</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ROC has plans to forge formal diplomatic ties
with other countries in the near future, Hu said: "Let's see."</P>

      <P>The Global Alliance for Preserving
the History of World War II in Asia on Friday demanded a formal
apology from the Japanese government and the immediate dismissal of
Kunihiko Saito, Japan's ambassador to the United States, over his
remarks about the incident known as the "Rape of Nanking."</P>
      <P>Iris Chang, author of "The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten
Holocaust of World War II," said she was stunned by Saito's
statements and challenged him to debate her on national television.</P>
      <P>The book's publisher, Basic Books, also said in a press release
that the book is the first comprehensive account written in English
of the December 1937 massacre, in which the Japanese soldiers
invading Nanking killed over 260,000 Chinese civilians and raped an
estimated 20,000-80,000 women.</P>
      <P>According to international and Japanese media reports, Saito
stated at a press conference on April 21 that the book's description
of atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperial Army in Nanking is
inaccurate and biased.</P>
      <P>Saito also called the contents of the book one-sided.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ambassador warned US congressmen not to back any
resolution concerning the sexual slavery of Asian women by the

126, which calls on the Japanese government to offer a formal apology
and pay compensation to its World War II victims, is currently being
cosponsored by more than 60 representatives from both sides of the
aisle.</P>
      <P>The Global Alliance said that Saito's comments were not only a
repetition of grave misbehavior by Japanese high officials concerning
their attitude toward history but also the first time a top diplomat
has issued a warning against the parliamentarians of the country that

      <P>Taiwan's computer giant Acer and the German
electronics multinational Siemens have reached agreement that Acer
will take over the personal computer (PC) plant belonging to
Siemens-Nixdorf Information System (SNI) in Augsburg, southern
Germany.</P>
      <P>The news was reported by all the leading German media outlets.
SNI has a work force of 2,000 with an annual production capacity of
1.4 million PCs. Acer will take over SNI production lines as well as
its R&amp;D department. SNI will maintain its marketing and planning
departments, and the SNI-produced PCs will still be marketed under
the SNI brand name. The two parties are expected to sign the
acquisition contract in mid 1998.</P>
      <P>Acer is now the world's third-largest PC and notebook producer.
With the acquisition of the SNI plant, Acer will move up to second
place, behind only Compaq. Acer is especially strong in Southeast
Asian and Latin American markets, although the company is definitely
a world player in computer manufacturing and marketing.</P>
      <P>The corporation set up by Stan Shih in 1976 with only five

more than 400 international patents.</P>
      <P>In early 1997, Acer purchased the notebook sector of Texas

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO FOCUS ON RESUMING CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An influential US congressman on
Friday called on Taiwan to focus on resuming dialogue with mainland
China and to avoid provocative actions. He also added to the recent
debate over US arms sales to Taiwan by saying that the island's
military does not need an upgrade.</P>
      <P>Answering a question on how to maintain stability in the Taiwan
Strait, Douglas Bereuter (R-Neb), chairman of the House Subcommittee
on Asia and the Pacific, cautioned against exaggerating the problems
in the area.</P>
      <P>"There is no significant need for an upgrade in Taiwanese
military equipment," he added. Although mainland China's military is
undergoing some modernization, he said the purpose is to give
mainland China the capacity to deal with a "potential Taiwan
conflict" and that Beijing is "far from having that capacity."</P>
      <P>However, he did not say whether he thinks the US, as Taiwan's
major arms supplier, should not sell particular types of weapons to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The congressman said that a more important focus for Taiwan
should be to continue its dialogue with mainland China and avoid
provocative actions.</P>
      <P>"We have a prescription for China but we also have a prescription
for Taiwan," he said, referring to the US position that while the
mainland's use of force against Taiwan would not be acceptable,
Taipei would be ill-advised to seek independence, something which
Beijing has said would incur a military invasion.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at the Heritage Foundation in Washington,
Bereuter disclosed that his subcommittee will hold a hearing next
month on the US-ROC-PRC relationship.</P>
      <P>As the administration prepares for President Bill Clinton's
summit meeting with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in June,
he said: "We think it's appropriate to examine the issues, to give
some encouragement to continued progress before the presidential
visit."</P>
      <P>He also acknowledged that there is "a lot of uneasiness" in
Taiwan about the possibility that the US administration, to the
detriment of Taiwan's interests, might make some concessions to
Beijing in order to improve relations.</P>
      <P>The congressman said, however: "I see no indication and I hear
contrary expressions by the administration on that concern."</P>
      <P>The hearing will be held amid concerns on Capitol Hill that the
administration is moving too fast in its engagement with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Critics of the Clinton administration say that too many
concessions have been made by the US while Beijing still has a long
way to go on issues such as human rights, non-proliferation and
bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, five senators tabled a resolution calling on
President Clinton to demand the immediate release of all political
prisoners in mainland China when he meets with his counterpart in

      <P>The Malaysia trip followed his visits to the Philippines and

Malaysia.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Malaysia, Siew is expected to meet with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim and other Malaysian government officials as well as
buisness leaders to exchange views on bilateral trade, economic
relations, measures to cope with the Asia financial crisis, possible
ROC assistance to Malaysia to tide over their current financial

    <HEADLINE>ROC REPRESENTATIVE IN US VISITS SOUTH CAROLINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After nearly 50 years of hard work, the
republic of China on Taiwan, now a democratic and prosperous nation,
continues to believe in China's reunification but will only consider
it under circumstances that ensure freedom, equality and the rule of
law, the ROC's leading official in the United States said Friday.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, who heads the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office (TECRO) in the United States, made the remarks
in Columbia, South Carolina. He was there at the invitation of the
World Affairs Association to deliver a speech titled "The Development
and Changes of the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Chen expressed in his speech that Taiwan is not against the
development of relations between mainland China and the United States
but that it strongly hopes Washington will maintain a parallel
relations approach and refrain from sacrificing Taiwan's benefits for
others' gains.</P>
      <P>He later visited Columbia's leading newspaper to discuss Taiwan's
perspective on relations between Washington and Beijing and on the
Asian financial crisis with the publisher and editors.</P>
      <P>Chen said that President Lee Teng-hui and Premier Vincent Siew
have recently expressed Taipei's willingness to work together with
Beijing to help Southeast Asian countries come up with solutions to
the financial crisis.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan was able to weather the financial storm
without suffering major setbacks because of strong fundamentals, such
as its huge foreign exchange reserves, low inflation, low
unemployment, high savings rates, low foreign debt, democratization
and freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>Chen denied adamantly that the depreciation of the New Taiwan
dollar was an attempt to destabilize Hong Kong. The ROC's central
bank had tried to stabilize the local currency's foreign exchange
rate before strong market forces finally led it to decide to allow
the local unit to follow the market, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan is not a member of the International Monetary
Fund, he said, it must consider the fact that in the event of a
financial crisis, that organization will not be on hand to bail it
out.</P>
      <P>In actuality, Chen continued, Beijing's decision to devalue the
yuan by 40 percent in 1994 led many foreign investors to leave
Southeast Asia and was a major cause of the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Chen also visited the chancellor of the University of South
Carolina Friday to exchange opinions on topics such as academic
exchanges and cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to meet South Carolina's governor on Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA SLAMS DOOR ON DIRECT-SALES FIRMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Lu-Sheng Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"For now at least in China, Avon is
banned from calling, Amway has lost its way, Mary Kay has been KO'd
and the parties are over for Tupperware," the Los Angeles Times
announced on its front page Friday.</P>
      <P>The four giant US direct-sales companies, which have enjoyed
phenomenal growth across mainland China, were ordered this week to
stop operating under a broad new directive banning "pyramid selling."</P>
      <P>Beijing's order that all direct-sales companies wind up their
operations by Oct. 31 -- a declaration that US officials had
protested in advance of its issue -- came the day before US Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky arrived in Beijing for another
round of trade talks.</P>
      <P>According to Rone Tempest, the L.A. Times' Beijing bureau chief,
Barshefsky's trade team responded to this ban and spent much of
Thursday consulting with US executives and pressing Beijing officials
to find a solution that will not harm the companies, which have been
officially licensed and have invested millions of dollars in
developing sales networks there.</P>
      <P>The direct-sales conflict is the latest stress point to emerge as
mainland China attempts its massive conversion from a command to a
market economy, the daily said.</P>
      <P>Although such grass-roots marketing plans featuring low-cost
products are a perfect match for mainland China's developing economy,
they thrive in an atmosphere that also lends itself easily to fraud
-- as has happened in the similarly evolving economies of Russia and
Albania, it noted.</P>
      <P>News of the ban jolted some share prices on Wall Street. An Amway
representative said the company's stock value dropped US$150 million
in two days and attributed this to the mainland Chinese ban on direct
sales. Avon shares, which were at US$83.88 on April 15, had fallen to
US$79.25 by Tuesday but have since rebounded to US$82.63.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TECHNIQUE MAY ALLOW TRANSPLANT OF PIG ORGANS INTO HUMANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  25  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian scientists have discovered
ways to transplant pig organs into people without acute rejection
problems.</P>
      <P>The mass circulation newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald reported
Saturday that a Melbourne-based research team using a new technique
has successfully carried out heart transplants between normal and
genetically engineered mice.</P>
      <P>This should allow the breeding of transgenic donor pigs with the
universal type O blood group -- meaning that pig organs could be
transplanted into humans within a few years.</P>
      <P>"All of our small animal models now suggest that this is the way
to go," said Dr. Mauro Sandrin, a senior researcher at the Austin
Research Institute in Melbourne.</P>
      <P>"Our mouse model is directly analog to putting a pig's heart into
a human," he said.</P>
      <P>Demand for human donor organs now far exceeds supply, and many
would-be recipients are dying while waiting for surgery, forcing
medical doctors to look to other species to bridge the gap, he said.</P>
      <P>Pigs are the most suitable, but so far such transplants have not
been possible because a "hyperacute rejection" can turn the
transplanted organ into a blackened, lifeless lump within minutes, he
said.</P>
      <P>Sandrin said he and his team discovered that this severe reaction
occurs because the human immune system is primed with antibodies that
immediately attack a key sugar, known as GAL, found on the surface of
pig cells.</P>
      <P>GAL is not found in humans and some other primates, but occurs in
pigs, sheep and mice, he said.</P>
      <P>The research team bred special experimental mice with an added
human gene that virtually eliminated the GAL and effectively changed
the mouse's blood group to type O.</P>
      <P>The researchers then transplanted hearts from the
transgenic animals into normal mice, which remained alive for more
than 100 days and suffered no hyperacute rejection, Sandrin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STEVEDORE FIRM CLOSES SEVEN AUSTRALIAN WHARVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 25 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent victory of the Maritime Union
of Australia (MUA) seems to have been short-lived, as the parent
company of Patrick Stevedores Ltd. on Friday announced it will close
seven terminals at its five ports.</P>
      <P>Lang Corp. advised the Australian Stock Exchange that it was
suspending indefinitely operations in Adelaide, Port Kembla and
Newcastle in New South Wales, Bell Bay and Burnie ports in Tasmania,
Geraldton Port in Western Australia and Port Alma in Queensland.</P>
      <P>Lang blamed the MUA picketing of Patrick terminals for its
decision to shut down the port operations.</P>
      <P>The waterfront dispute was started by Patrick when it
dismissed all 2,000 of its dock workers after the workers refused
Patrick's request that they improve efficiency in the handling of
container cargoes.</P>
      <P>The sacking enraged the MUA, which mobilized thousands of its
members to stage a series of protests which blocked access to
Patrick's terminals in major Australian ports.</P>
      <P>The MUA also received support from several domestic union groups
and international labor organizations.</P>
      <P>The Federal Court this week ordered Patrick to reinstate all its
sacked workers, but the company appealed to the High Court, which
extended a freeze on the Federal Court order pending a further appeal
by the stevedoring firm.</P>
      <P>The High Court decision means the MUA now has the problem of
providing a rescue package for the sacked unionized workers.</P>
      <P>The feasibility of any rescue was further jeopardized by Lang's
notification that the insolvent companies (four Patrick subsidiaries)
had been technically in breach of loan covenants since the
appointment of the administrators -- the device used by Patrick to
jettison its union workforce.</P>
      <P>Lang's statement to the Australian Stock Exchange said the
companies' banks had "reserved their position" in terms of dealing
with the administrators of Patrick Stevedores' terminal operations.</P>
      <P>Waterfront analysts said it will make any rescue package very
difficult to implement, pointing out that although the sacked workers
may have won the battle, they might still lose the war.</P>

      <P>After more than one month of searching,
the digital flight data recorder of a domestic plane has been
retrieved off Hsinchu in northern Taiwan, an official of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) confirmed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>CAA Deputy Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said he was informed
by the salvage team that the flight data recorder of the Formosa
Airline plane was retrieved Sunday morning, near the site where large
pieces of the plane's fuselage were detected several days ago.</P>
      <P>Chang said slight damage to the casing of the "black box" will
not affect the reading of information contained inside.</P>
      <P>Searchers are still looking for the plane's cockpit voice
recorder, which they expect to retrieve later Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that because the retrieved device had been submerged
on the sea floor for so long, it will have to undergo a desalination
process before it can be sent overseas for analysis.</P>
      <P>The black box will be sent to the National Transportation Safety
Board of the United States on Tuesday at the latest to help
determinate the cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>The Saab-340 plane, carrying eight passengers and five crew,
crashed off Nanliao, Hsinchu, shortly after taking off from Hsinchu
airport en route to Taiwan's southern city of Kaohsiung on March 18,
killing all aboard.</P>
      <P>A search team found large pieces of the plane last week, but have
been unable to salvage the wreckage due to rough seas.</P>

      <P>Visiting Republic of China Premier
Vincent Siew met with Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed on
Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>The two leaders exchanged views on wide ranging issues of mutual
concern, including the strengthening of bilateral relations and ways
to cope with the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Siew, who arrived here along with his delegation Saturday, has
kept his three-day visit low-profile amid protests from Beijing over
the trip.</P>
      <P>He did not show up for a scheduled tour of one of Malaysia's
developmental megaprojects, the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).</P>
      <P>He was accompanied by Malaysian property and hotel tycoon Lee Kim
Yew and officials of the Prime Minister Office to meet with Mahathir,
after dodging a phalanx of Taiwan and Malaysian reporters waiting
outside at his hotel.</P>
      <P>Siew deliberately kept the meeting with Mahathir hush-hush to
avoid offending Beijing. He is also expected to meet with Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and other senior officials during his
visit here.</P>
      <P>Siew, who once served as the ROC consul general in Kuala Lumpur,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Malaysia is one of the major trading
partners of the Republic of China, but difficulties to economic
exchanges between the two nations remain, economic officials said
here Sunday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks as Premier Vincent Siew and his
members of his delegation, including Foreign Minister Jason Hu,
Finance Minister Paul Chiu, and several business leaders, left for
Malaysia on Saturday for a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
show that bilateral trade between the two nations amounted to nearly
US$7.3 billion in 1997. Of that total, Taiwan imported US$4.23
billion in products from Malaysia, while exporting goods worth
US$3.04 billion to the Southeast Asian nation.</P>
      <P>That accounted for a two-way trade surplus of US$1.19 billion for
Malaysia last year and made Taiwan its fourth largest trade partner,
next only to Japan, Singapore and the United States.</P>
      <P>Malaysia is the seventh largest trade partner of Taiwan,
following the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Germany, Singapore and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has US$8 billion worth of total investments in Malaysia,
highlighting the close trade ties between the two nations.</P>
      <P>To protect the interests of Taiwan businessmen there, Taipei and
Kuala Lumpur signed an investment guarantee agreement in 1993, and
inked an agreement to avoid double taxation in 1996.</P>
      <P>But ROC economics officials said there are still major hurdles to
smooth trade relations between the two nations.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that revised regulations passed by Malaysia in
1996 allow foreign financial institutions to own no more than a 20
percent stake in local banks. That makes it more difficult for Taiwan
businessmen to obtain loans in Malaysia and affects their willingness
to invest in that country.</P>
      <P>Also, the Malaysia government has yet to sign an agreement with
Taiwan for the temporary admission of goods, they said.</P>
      <P>In addition, although Kuala Lumpur has granted 72-hour visa-free
treatment to ROC nationals, manufacturers here are seeking a
simplified process for obtaining work visas and visa extensions by
Taiwan technicians going to Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also complained that Malaysia imposes tariff and
nontariff hurdles to Taiwan products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  25  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The lumbering economy of mainland China
has slowed to its lowest growth rate in nearly eight years, a
Canadian newspaper reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>It is beset by rising unemployment, woeful inefficiency among
state-owned enterprises, growing stockpiles of unwanted products and
the continuing impact of financial troubles in other parts of Asia,
the Globe and Mail said.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily quoted Qiu Xiaohua, chief
economist at the State Statistical Bureau, as confirming that the
country's once-skyrocketing economic growth fell to 7.2 percent
during the first three months of 1998, the 16th consecutive quarterly
downturn.</P>
      <P>This falls considerably short of the government's target of 8
percent, which most economists feel is the minimum increase the
mainland needs to cope with millions of new employees entering the
work force every year, the report said.</P>
      <P>It quoted a Western diplomat as saying, "If I were a Chinese
leader, I'd be worried about the 7.2 percent growth figure."</P>
      <P>The reason, according to the Mail, is that the Chinese mainland
is already in the midst of its highest unemployment in many years.
Other worrisome figures cast clouds over Qiu's optimism that it will
eventually realize its 8 percent growth target this year, the daily
added.</P>
      <P>These include industrial losses which rose nearly 22 percent
during the first two months of 1998 over the same period of last
year, a stunning 82.8 percent plunge in profits during January and
February, and the first-quarter rise of 14.2 percent in the value of
industrial goods gathering dust in mainland Chinese warehouses. The
last amounted to nearly US$70 billion, or almost 7 percent of the
mainland's gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>It quoted Qiu as explaining that the products do not have markets
because many companies lack the speed necessary to react to changes
in the marketplace. The problem prompts many economists to discount
Beijing's growth figures by as much as 2 percent to 3 percent, in
order to account for products that merely move from the factory to
the warehouse, it noted.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a Hong Kong analyst as estimating, "When you
take out the inventory buildup, China's growth is about 5 percent.
That's worse than Southeast Asian countries."</P>
      <P>Still, the mainland economy is far from going bust, the Mail
pointed out. One reason is -- if you trust Beijing's figures --
export growth is down but still healthy, and foreign investment
continues to pour into the country. Another factor is the mainland's
massive foreign exchange reserves, now about US$143 billion, the
third highest in the world, the report said.</P>
      <P>What concerns Beijing leaders is the gradual decline in what was
recently the world's fastest-growing economy during a time of painful
restructuring, it said. If meaningful new jobs cannot be found for
the estimated 10 million workers expected to be laid off in the
coming year, the country could face serious social unrest, it
observed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY TO SEND DELEGATION TO MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party plans to take a
more aggressive stance toward mainland policy, NP official Chen
Kuei-miao said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the NP will send a delegation to visit
Beijing in early June to discuss means of protecting the interests of
Taiwan residents doing business on the mainland. He made the remarks
at the first of a series of seminars on cross-strait policy at the
Taipei International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>The seminars are aimed at canvassing the opinions of the
industrial, academic and government sector in Taiwan for reference in
mapping out the NP's mainland policy.</P>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, NP campaign manager for year-end elections,
claimed the ROC government has overlooked numerous difficulties faced
by local businessmen operating on the mainland, who he said have
helped to earn precious foreign reserves for Taiwan and have fought
to raise the island's international profile.</P>
      <P>Jaw said that the NP will pay close attention to the needs of
Taiwan businessmen, and will identify the party with their interests.</P>
      <P>Chen also said the NP will attempt to shed the popular view that
it is preoccupied with the goal of national unification by taking a
more aggressive stance in its mainland policy.</P>
      <P>He criticized the government's "no haste, be patient" policy
toward investment on the Chinese mainland, and said the NP will send
a fact-finding delegation to Beijing by early June. It will discuss
Taiwan business operations on the mainland and a range of bilateral
economic issues.</P>
      <P>Among other things, the delegation will ask Beijing officials to
map out more substantial measures to protect Taiwan investors doing
business on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chou Yang-shan, convener of NP's election and development
committee, said the NP will also organize an observation team in the
near future to study the reform of state-owned enterprises on the
mainland for reference in drafting the NP's cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>In addition to NP officials, Schive Chi, vice chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, Lin Nung-chung,
director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center,
as well as other economics officials and local businessmen, attended
the seminar.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADHERENTS RAVE OVER BENEFITS OF URINE CONSUMPTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 40 percent of patients interviewed
have seen their conditions improve after undergoing treatment that
involves drinking urine, the National Health Research Institute
(NHRI) said in announcing the results of a study Sunday.</P>
      <P>The NHRI said that although some patients afflicted with
periodontal disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and retrogressive
arthritis have experienced reduced symptoms after drinking urine,
more studies are needed to establish the efficacy of the treatment.</P>
      <P>The practice of drinking urine to cure or alleviate these
maladies first become popular in Japan, and has recently found an
increasing number of followers in Taiwan. It is estimated that
200,000 people in Taiwan have tried the method either to combat the
effects of aging or to help fight all kinds of chronic diseases.</P>
      <P>NHRI researchers surveyed 290 members of a group who had tried
the urine treatment in order to learn more about their motives and
assess the effectiveness of the method.</P>
      <P>Some 43 percent of those surveyed said they tried the method to
cure a variety of aliments, while 25 percent said they hoped to
improve their overall physical fitness.</P>
      <P>Some 6.9 percent had consumed their own urine in hopes of staying
young, while 8.3 percent said they had done so out of curiosity or
because it is in vogue.</P>
      <P>Over half of those surveyed said they have drunken their own
urine for a period of between one and three years.</P>
      <P>Researcher Lai chi-ming said that from those surveyed, the
benefits from drinking urine seem to substantiate the usefulness of
the practice.</P>
      <P>Lai said that among 294 persons surveyed, 194 suffered from a
specific illness. Based on his interviews, the method was claimed to
have cured 17 of them. Some 122 reported that their conditions
improved, while 26 practitioners of the treatment reported no
apparent change. In addition, 29 of the subjects said their
conditions had improved but felt that had nothing to do with their
drinking urine.</P>
      <P>Lai said the treatment involves drinking the first urine sample
collected in the morning. It apparently works best for persons
afflicted with periodontal diseases, including gingivitis, or
inflammation of the gums, followed by those patients with diabetes
and chronic hepatitis.</P>
      <P>However, he said diabetes patients might find a more "tasteful"
means of controlling blood sugar levels by turning to a lighter light
diet and avoiding red meat and fried foods.</P>
      <P>Lai was also baffled by some of the benefits attributed to urine
consumption, such as stoppage of bleeding gums, quick improvement of
bad breath and a reduction in the amount of medication needed to
control high blood pressure.</P>
      <P>Some practitioners of the method who suffer mild cases of
arthritis reported that their conditions had improved, but persons
with more serious forms of the condition showed no obvious effects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DIPLOMATIC WAR CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academics and scholars attending a seminar
Sunday urged Taipei and Beijing to cease their diplomatic war and
called on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to include the issue on
the agenda of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a symposium sponsored by the Chinese Culture Council
(CCC) on cross-strait ties, Chiu Chao-lin, a researcher of
international relations with Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest
academic research institute, said people on Taiwan should pay heed to
trends in international society, as global developments exercise much
influence on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Recent moves by the United States indicate Washington will not
sit idle and allow cross-strait ties to develop naturally, and it
remains to be seen whether Taiwan and mainland China will be able to
eventually meet at the negotiating table for unification talks, she
pointed out.</P>
      <P>In a bid to reduce the fierce pressure from the mainland to
isolate Taiwan in the international community, Chiu urged the
government not to change foreign ministers too frequently so that the
person occupying the post may be fully devoted to the job. The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added, should keep a low key even if
President Lee Teng-hui is invited by other countries to visit.</P>
      <P>Academics attending the seminar, which followed the suspension of
diplomatic ties between the Republic of China and Guinea-Bissau on
Friday, unanimously opined that Taiwan and mainland China should stop
their "diplomatic battle."</P>
      <P>Pan Hsi-tang, professor of mainland Chinese affairs at Tamkang
University, said the renewal of diplomatic relations between
Guinea-Bissau and mainland China on Thursday is additional proof that
diplomatic wrangling between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has
not eased with improvement in bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Although the government's determination to carry out "pragmatic
diplomacy" policy is correct, Pan said, it should adjust its
strategies and measures.</P>
      <P>As the mainland is working hard to force Taiwan into political
negotiations by restricting its presence in the international
community, Pan said, the government's pragmatic diplomacy should be
more "intensified" and "selective." He added that the issue of the
two sides' international presence should be put high on the agenda of
cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University Prof. Chang Lin-cheng also stated that
the two sides should stop the diplomatic war, urging the government
to forswear the mentality of confrontation in its dealings with the
mainland on the diplomatic front.</P>
      <P>International relations and cross-strait ties should be built on
a mutually beneficial basis and neither side should treat the other
side as a "conspirator."</P>
      <P>Echoing Pan's view, CCC Chairman C.H. Ma said he agrees that
Taiwan and the mainland must stop their diplomatic wrangle, as the
"zero-sum game" will hurt both sides, thus igniting the independence
movement in Taiwan and reducing the chances of China's unification.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSJACKER SURRENDERS TO POLICE AFTER 3-HOUR STANDOFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A man hijacked a bus on Monday morning and
kept police at a standoff in downtown Taipei for more than three
hours before surrendering.</P>
      <P>It is believed to be the first case of a bus hijacking in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The man in his 20s, identified as Chen Nung-ping, commandeered
the Route No. 243 bus belonging to the Taipei Transportation Co. at
7:45 a.m. in Yungho, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Chen, wielding three knives, forced the bus driver to divert his
course to the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) building on
Chunghsiao East Road in downtown Taipei, saying he wanted to talk to
CIB Deputy Director Ho You-yi.</P>
      <P>A contingent of police patrol cars escorted the hijacked bus to
the front of the government tax office at Chunghsiao East Road, near
the CIB.</P>
      <P>After arriving at the building, Chen released the bus driver and
several passengers. He forced the remaining passengers to stay seated
in the rear section of the bus, before eventually releasing them at
10:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>Police sent an elite squad to surround the bus and tried to calm
the hijacker, who was pacing around the interior of the bus mumbling
to himself.</P>
      <P>Chen, claiming to be a follower of the opposition New Party,
demanded to talk with party heavyweights Jaw Shau-kong, Wang Chien
Hsuan or Hau Lung-ping.</P>
      <P>Chen finally surrendered at 11:04 a.m. after meeting with Hau and
Jaw.</P>
      <P>An initial interrogation by police indicated that Chen may suffer
from paranoid delusions. He suspected that he and his best friend,
surnamed Hsieh, were being followed by persons intent upon harming
them.</P>
      <P>The released passengers said Chen had told them that he was not a
lunatic and repeatedly apologized for his actions.</P>
      <P>But according to Hsieh, Chen suffers from mental illness and had
tried to start a fire at Hsieh's home with a container of gasoline
Monday morning just prior to the hijacking incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIEW MUM ON PRESIDENT LEE'S VISIT TO MALAYSIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kuala  Lumpur,  April  27 (CNA)
(By C.P. Hung &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent
Siew on Monday would not comment on reports that President Lee
Teng-hui will visit Malaysia in June or July this year.</P>
      <P>Siew, who is on the third and final day of his current Malaysian
trip, said a visit by the head of state to a nonallied nation is
highly sensitive affair, and it would be improper to speculate on
relevant matters.</P>
      <P>Siew, who led a Taiwan delegation to Malaysia on Saturday for a
private, recreational visit, meanwhile called his journey "fruitful
and successful."</P>
      <P>The premier, who has kept his visit low-profile to avoid
offending Beijing, met with Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamed, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and other senior
ministers in Kuala Lumpur over a lunch Sunday which lasted nearly
four hours.</P>
      <P>During the gathering, Siew exchanged views with the Malaysian
officials over a wide range of issues, including ways to bolster
bilateral ties and jointly deal with the Southeast Asian economic
crisis.</P>
      <P>On Sunday evening, Siew and his entourage were honored by ROC
Representative in Malaysia Paul J.K. Tso, at a dinner which was also
attended by ROC Finance Minister Paul Chiu, Foreign Minister Jason
Hu, a group of chief executives from private and state-owned
enterprises in Taiwan, and several Malaysian officials.</P>
      <P>The dinner took place amid a rare thunderstorm in drought-plagued
Malaysia. A lighthearted Siew likened his visit to the rain shower,
saying both of them are "timely and welcomed."</P>
      <P>Siew said he has found that bilateral ties between Taiwan and
Malaysia are now much closer than some thirty years ago, when he was
the ROC consul general in Kuala Lumpur.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan and Malaysia as "true friends in trying times,"
Siew said Taiwan is always confident in Malaysia, even though the
country is experiencing economic difficulties. With its robust
institutionalized system and basic economic infrastructure, however,
Malaysia is expected to overcome the temporary hard times and stand
tall again quite soon, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>Siew is scheduled to tee off Monday morning at Malaysia's top
golf course, the Mines Golf Country Club, which is the venue of the
1999 World Golf Tournament.</P>
      <P>Siew, his wife and the Taiwan delegation are scheduled to return
to Taipei late Monday afternoon, concluding their three-day
unofficial visit.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said on
Monday that the Republic of China is willing to help neighboring
countries tackle the financial crisis and that the current visit by
Premier Vincent Siew to Malaysia is reflective of such intent.</P>
      <P>Attributing Taiwan's stability amid the regionwide financial
morass to its solid economic foundation and transparent financial
policy, Liu said the ROC is willing to provide assistance and share
its experience with crisis-hit countries to help them through the
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks while addressing the opening ceremony of the
third Asian-Pacific Youth Leaders Conference at the Grand Hotel in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The vice premier, on behalf of Siew and the people of the ROC,
also welcomed more than 60 youth representatives from countries in
the Asia-Pacific to take part in the event.</P>
      <P>C.C. Lee, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level National Youth
Commission, which sponsored the conference, said cooperation between
the youth in the Asia-Pacific will secure the region's continued
development and prosperity, and that the purpose of the gathering is
aimed at providing an opportunity for exchanges by young leaders from
across the area.</P>
      <P>Youth affairs officials from Indonesia, New Zealand, the
Philippines and Vietnam are among the delegates in town for a
roundtable meeting to discuss issues related to youth policy and

    <HEADLINE>EXPORTS TO PICK UP BY END OF 2ND QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports should pick up at the end
of the second quarter and economic growth is expected to top 6
percent this year, Yeh Ming-feng, director of the Economic Research
Department under the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks as the CEPD released a report on the
nation's overall economic situation for March.</P>
      <P>The report showed that the leading economic index continued to
drop by another 0.6 percent in March. Although the drop was modest,
it is the third consecutive month that the index has shown a
decrease.</P>
      <P>Moreover, domestic manufacturers have been more conservative in
their outlook for the next quarter, indicating that economic growth
will slow in the short term, the report said.</P>
      <P>But Yeh asserted that although Taiwan registered a rare trade
deficit in the quarter of US$70 million, weakened exports will not
be a long-term trend.</P>
      <P>One noteworthy fact is that Taiwan suffered a first-quarter trade
deficit of more than US$400 million with Southeast Asian nations,
down 27 percent from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Yeh attributed that situation to the financial turmoil that has
swept through Southeast Asia, saying the region has suffered from
capital crunch that affects the capacity of importers there to buy
Taiwan products.</P>
      <P>But he also noted that Southeast Asian countries have narrowed
the trade gaps following the depreciation of their currencies in
recent months, and that their capacity to import more goods will
improve.</P>
      <P>Yeh estimated that by the end of the second quarter, Taiwan's
exports and overall economic situation will begin to turn for the
better.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy continued to flash a
"green light" in March, a sign of stable growth on a five-color
composite measurement system, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>It was the 17th consecutive month that the local economy has
received a safe green rating on the CEPD-designed scale.</P>
      <P>March's overall economic performance received a score of 26
points, down one point from the February level.</P>
      <P>In March, leading indicators dropped 0.6 percent, a fall of three
consecutive months, hinting that the domestic economy may remain
stable over the next three to five months without gaining significant
momentum, according to officials from the CEPD's Economic Research
Department.</P>
      <P>Under the CEPD's five-color assessment system, a red light means
the economy is overheated; a yellow-red light indicates the economy
is heating up; a green light reflects steady growth; a yellow-blue
rating signals an economic slowdown; and a blue light represents an
economic recession.</P>
      <P>Ratings are determined according to nine major economic
indicators: export value, new export orders, industrial production,
manufacturing inventories, total employment outside the agricultural
sector, money supply, stock prices, the check default rate and bank
lending to the private sector. The minimum score for a healthy
green rating is 23 points.</P>
      <P>During the month of March, nearly all the nine indicators showed
little change, with a few posting only slight drops from the
month-earlier level, the officials noted.</P>

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
said it will send the black box from a crashed domestic plane to the
National Transportation Safety Board of the United States on Tuesday
for analysis.</P>
      <P>CAA officials indicated Monday that the result of the analysis
will be known in a week at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The Saab-340 plane crashed March 18 off the coast of Nanliao,
shortly after taking off from Hsinchu airport on its way to Kaohsiung
in southern Taiwan, killing all 13 persons aboard.</P>
      <P>After over one month of searching, divers found large portions of
the plane's fuselage last week, and were able to retrieve its digital
flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder on Sunday and Monday,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu District Prosecutor Chen Po-hou, who is in charge of the
investigation into the cause of the crash, said that from initial
examinations of the wreckage collected so far, the possibility that
some type of explosion had occurred is high.</P>
      <P>Chun declined to speculate over whether the accident could have
been caused by mechanical failure or other factors, saying that any
conclusion will have to wait until information contained in the black
box has been analyzed.</P>
      <P>The accident came as one in a series of air disasters, notably
the China Airlines crash on Feb. 16 that left 202 persons dead and a
helicopter crash on March 2. The incidents prompted a national uproar
for improvements in flight safety and forced the resignation of
Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsay Jaw-yang and CAA

      <P>Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said on Monday that
Taiwan's offer to aid crisis-hit Southeast Asian countries is a
mutually beneficial move which will also win international respect.</P>
      <P>Although some people have questioned why the money will not be
used to improve conditions at home, Chiang said the government's
initiative to assist Southeast Asian countries through their economic
difficulties in conjunction with the private sector will benefit
Taiwan as well, and earn it respect from the international community.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the United States and Japan as examples, Chiang said
both nations have provided considerable assistance in Taiwan's
economic development.</P>
      <P>The United States has been the largest overseas market for Taiwan
exports for many years, while Japan sends a team of 80 experts to
Taiwan for technology transfers and receives 200 Taiwan technicians
for vocational training each year, Chiang pointed out. He added that
Japan also has greatly benefited from Taiwan's rapid economic
development, as 30 percent of local imports come from that country.</P>
      <P>Increased investment abroad will in turn boost outbound
shipments, Chiang stressed, adding that Taiwan's deliveries to
Southeast Asia have increased from 5 percent to 15 percent of its
total exports, standing at approximately US$17 billion in value
annually, trailing only those to the United States and Europe.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks at a workshop called by the CEPD to train
police administrative and customs personnel in line with the

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the rapid development of the credit
card industry in recent years, the occurrence of related crimes has
become more prevalent and increasingly sophisticated.</P>
      <P>According to statistics announced by the Bureau of Monetary
Affairs (BMA) under the Ministry of Finance, 13.76 million credit
cards had been issued in Taiwan as of the end of February. The number
of cards in circulation was 7.88 million, an increase of 36.09
percent from the same month of last year. Total transactions in
February reached NT$37.346 billion, with approximately 111,000
businesses across Taiwan accepting credit card transactions.</P>
      <P>Credit card-related crimes have increased as well, according to
the BMA. Recent investigations have revealed a significant number of
cases where dishonest brokers help clients apply for credit cards,
and later use the clients' personal data to forge other applications.
The fraudulent cards would then be used to conduct transactions with
accomplice stores.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that in response to the rising frequency of these
practices, it has notified the Bankers Association of the ROC to
quickly come up with a counter-strategy and to relay the information
to credit card issuers and collection agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the BMA cautioned cardholders to guard their
personal data against foul play by not arbitrarily giving out such
information and by staying in touch with their credit card issuing

    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  27  (CNA)
(By J.J. Huang and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Dan, one of mainland China's
leading dissidents of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy
movement who was recently released by the Beijing authorities, met
with Wei Jingsheng, another prominent mainland Chinese dissident, at
the Columbia University in New York on Sunday. This was the first
meeting between the two after their exile, and they pledged to
collaborate on pushing the democracy movement in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wei, who returned to the United States on Saturday evening after
concluding a visit to Europe, met with his old friend Wang the next
morning. During their three-hour talk, they exchanged views and tried
to map out a concrete plan for the promotion of the democracy
movement in mainland China. They declined to disclose details of
their plan to the press prior to its implementation.</P>
      <P>Although Wei was once invited to deliver a speech at the
"democratic saloon" founded by Wang in Beijing University, the last
meeting between the two took place at a Beijing prison where both men
were "illegally detained" along with Lieu Nienchun, another of
mainland China's leading dissidents.</P>
      <P>Despite the passing of so many years, Wei said, Wang has not
changed at all, adding that he still personifies the characteristics
of the Chinese intellectual and that his sense of responsibility for
mainland China's democracy movement remains undimmed.</P>
      <P>However, he said he does not see eye to eye with Wang's view that
he (Wang himself) was responsible for the failure of the student
demonstration at Tiananmen Square in 1989, placing the blame instead
squarely on the Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>The most important thing at present, remarked Wei, is to learn a
lesson from the failure and never to let it happen again.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST TAIWAN RESIDENTS SUPPORT DIALOGUE WITH BEIJING: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A great majority of Taiwan people think
the government should continue to engage in some kind of dialogue
with mainland China for better relations across the Taiwan Strait,
according to a public opinion poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Burke Marketing Research Ltd. at the
request of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), also
found that Beijing's reneging on a previous consensus that each side
may hold its own interpretation of the "one China" concept is
unacceptable for most Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>In the past, some ambiguity was tacitly allowed over the meaning
of "one China." The ROC envisions a single Chinese entity as a "goal"
rather than a present-day reality. It views that entity in abstract
terms -- a historical, geographical and cultural China. In other
words, a unified China cannot exist under present conditions, but
that goal can be achieved in the future.</P>
      <P>The poll of 1,067 adults living on the island showed that 73
percent of respondents were strongly supportive for the government to
conduct a dialogue or negotiations with the Beijing authorities, and
that 65 percent disagreed with Beijing's backtracking over the
consensus on the "one China" concept.</P>
      <P>More than 40 percent of the group also opined that if the
cross-strait dialogue does not resume shortly, as all recent signals
indicate is likely, the consequences will be adverse to prospects for
future exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>About 40 percent of those polled said they would like to see the
status quo in cross-strait relations be maintained. Whether Taiwan
should declare independence or unite with the Chinese mainland
depends on future developments; 21 percent said the status quo should
be maintained for some time before moves are made toward unification;
19 percent either supported Taiwan's independence or said the status
quo should be maintained for some time before Taiwan declares
independence outright.</P>
      <P>It is worth of note that the percentage of those who support the
idea of "maintaining status quo for now, and then moving toward
independence" has increased significantly since the previous poll
conducted in November last year, to a record high.</P>
      <P>The percentage of those who support "an early declaration of
independence," however, dropped to a new low, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as much as 80 percent of those surveyed opposed
Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula and felt the model being
used to administer Hong Kong would not be workable for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by telephone on April 4-5, obtained valid
answers from 1,067 adults aged between 20 and 69.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will increase its financial
aid to Vietnam and Thailand in the next few years, starting from
1998, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said last week.</P>
      <P>He told reporters in Hanoi during his recent visit there that the
amount of aid will be increased to A$236 million (more than US$157
million) between July 1998 and June 2002, up from the A$200 million
(US$133 million) delivered over the last four years.</P>
      <P>"I don't think there is as much support in Australia (for aid to
Vietnam) now as there might have been 10 or 20 years ago. But the
government does what it thinks is in the national interest," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the increase in Australian aid to Thailand was
announced by Prime Minister John Howard during a visit there last
weekend to commemorate ANZAC Day, which commemorates the deaths of
Australian and New Zealand soldiers during World War II. He did not
mention any figures.</P>
      <P>Prior to the Asian financial crisis, Australia had planned to
cease its aid to Thailand by the year 2000, he said, adding that
Canberra will now continue to provide financial aid to Thailand as a
result of the crisis.</P>
      <P>The financial aid will be spent on health, education and
infrastructure in both Vietnam and Thailand, Downer said.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian companies operating in
mainland China should be wary of unauthorized tax breaks granted by
local authorities to foreigners, according to a mainland China tax
expert.</P>
      <P>Tony Baxter, a tax partner at the Coopers and Lybrand firm in
Sydney, said some Australian companies have been forced to pay back
taxes after their tax-exempt status was retrospectively revoked by
the central government in Beijing in a recent crackdown on
unauthorized tax concessions granted by local provincial authorities.</P>
      <P>He said: "Many Australian companies investing in China currently
enjoy tax-exempt status but some tax concessions may not be valid."</P>
      <P>"It is well known that some local government authorities in China
offer tax concessions or exemptions and levy tax without proper
authorization," he said, adding: "Beijing has the substantive tax
powers in China and recently sent a sharp reminder to the provinces
and local tax bureaus of this fact."</P>
      <P>He said that in March this year mainland China's national tax
council restated its position as the sole central legislator and
administrator in tax matters, apart from some minor taxes.</P>
      <P>He urged Australian companies with Chinese investments or joint
venture firms to check the authority behind any tax concessions or
exemptions they are currently relying on.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADERS TO IMPORT US PORK OFFAL BY AIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic traders have decided to cash in
on the high price of hog offal in local markets by importing certain
products from the United States by air once it is allowed to enter
Taiwan from June 1, Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>To facilitate Taiwan's bid to enter the World Trade Organization
(WTO), the island agreed during WTO talks with the US to allow entry
of 5,000 tons of pork bellies and 7,500 tons of pork offal, as well
as 10,000 tons of chicken and 5,000 tons of beef offal, even before
the island is admitted into the WTO.</P>
      <P>With the continued slump in pork prices following the eruption of
foot-and-mouth disease in March 1997 in Taiwan, traders have shown
little interest in the 5,000 tons of imported pork bellies from the
US, but are eyeing with interest the pork offal, prices for which
have remained high due to local demand for the delicacies.</P>
      <P>The COA officials offered as an example the fact that a pair of
domestic pork kidneys have a current retail value of between NT$200
and NT$300 in local markets, but pointed out that the price is likely
to be driven down by 40 or 50 percent following the onslaught of US
offal.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the price of pork offal, including
livers, stomachs, hearts, heads, and ears will be cut sharply once
the US imports begin to arrive.</P>
      <P>Local traders were originally hoping to ship frozen offal in
refrigerated containers, but as some pork offal items such as
hearts and kidneys quickly lose their flavor after freezing, traders
are now planning to ship these products by air, which only requires
them to be chilled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MIL. TRANSFERS TO MAINLAND CHINA COULD HARM AMERICAN INTERESTS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 26 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The massive modernization program upon
which the People's Liberation Army has embarked is likely to produce
a "peer competitor" to the United States early in the next century,
yet the US administration persists in approving advanced-tech
transfers to mainland China, warned Oliver North, a nationally
syndicated American columnist.</P>
      <P>While visiting mainland China in June, US President Bill Clinton
plans to sign a major Washington-Beijing agreement on satellite
launches and cooperation in space.</P>
      <P>Though the story has received far less notice than Clinton's
sexual escapades, "it is a whole lot more important to the fate of
our children" than what the interns were doing in the Oval Office,
North wrote Sunday in The Washington Times.</P>
      <P>According to an April 13 New York Times front-page article, two
of America's leading aerospace companies -- Loral Space &amp;
Communications and Hughes Electronics -- are suspected of having
provided "space expertise that significantly advanced Beijing's
ballistic missile program."</P>
      <P>The military significance of this technology transfer was of
sufficient gravity that a criminal investigation was opened and a
grand jury impaneled to consider indictments in the matter. But
before formal charges could be filed, Clinton quietly authorized the
export to mainland China of technology similar to that which guides a
long-range nuclear missile to its target by one of the companies
under investigation, noted the columnist.</P>
      <P>The chilling effect of Clinton's action was clearly understood at
the time it was taken. Defense and State Department officials argued
against the export license because the technology is so sensitive.
Professionals at the Department of Justice also objected that
authorizing the Loral tech-transfer would make it practically
impossible to prosecute the earlier case.</P>
      <P>Despite opposition from his military, intelligence and Justice
Department experts, Clinton authorized the technology transfer. "The
Clinton administration's indifference to the arming of China is
simply stupefying," North said.</P>
      <P>He added that the advanced-tech transfers to Beijing included the
sale of machine tools used to manufacture advanced military aircraft;
jet engines suitable for use in fighter aircraft and cruise missiles;
highly sophisticated, advanced telecommunications equipment; and
supercomputers that have wound up in the mainland Chinese
military-industrial complex, including its nuclear weapons program.</P>
      <P>The administration says it's OK to sell the mainland Chinese
these critical technologies because of Beijing's "commitment to
nonproliferation." But on April 15, Pakistan -- one of Beijing's
principal technology trading partners -- announced that it
successfully launched a missile with a range of 900 miles.

      <P>"Will anyone have the nerve to ask if some of the technology
supplied by Loral to Beijing somehow found its way to Islamabad?"
asked the columnist.</P>
      <P>Some in Congress are finally paying attention. House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), and Rep. Tillie Fowler
(R-Fla.) of the House National Security Committee have asked Attorney
General Janet Reno to investigate whether these sales have been
influenced by illegal mainland Chinese efforts to divert funds to the
Clinton-Gore re-election campaign.</P>
      <P>But North said they should also ask more about the relationship
between Clinton and major Clinton-Gore donor Michael Armstrong,
former chief executive officer of Hughes Electronics. And has the
$2.5 million contributed to Democratic candidates and causes by Loral
and Hughes influenced the outcome of these tech-transfer cases in
favor of Beijing?</P>
      <P>Did the fact that Loral's CEO Bernard Schwartz was the largest
personal contributor to the Democratic National Committee last year
have anything to do with the president's decision to vitiate legal
proceedings against his company?</P>
      <P>The columnist concluded that "They may not be sexy, but
ultimately, the answers to these questions are going to be far more
important to the American people than what Monica Lewinsky did or did
not do in the Oval Office."</P>

    <HEADLINE>US DEFENSE WEEKLY COMMENTS ON ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of State and
National Security Council have discussed a de facto moratorium on
major new arms sales to Taiwan prior to President Bill Clinton's
upcoming June summit with mainland Chinese leader Jiang Zemin in
Beijing, according to the latest issue of US Defense News weekly.</P>
      <P>In a two-day bilateral arms discussion here last week, Taiwan's
requests for submarines and air defense missiles were once again
rejected, ostensibly because the US argued that Taipei lacks a
compelling national security need for the weaponry.</P>
      <P>In a commentary entitled "No Deal on Taiwan," the Defense News
urged Clinton and his foreign policy team to resist the temptation to
accommodate Beijing at the expense of Taiwan's legitimate security
needs.</P>
      <P>It said since the Washington summit last fall between Clinton and
Jiang, Beijing has intensified calls for a ban on arms sales to
Taipei, arguing that US weapons to Taiwan constitute a form of
proliferation no different or more dangerous than Beijing's sale of
advanced weapons to Iran.</P>
      <P>Curiously, this reasoning is gaining resonance in the State
Department and National Security Council, where a de facto moratorium
on major new arms sales to Taipei has been discussed prior to
Clinton's second summit with Jiang, said the weekly.</P>
      <P>The weekly argued that instead of ill-conceived deals or
wink-and-nod diplomacy that rewards Beijing and punishes Taipei,
Clinton needs to remind the people of Taiwan, mainland China and the
United States that US interests are in preventing war and promoting
peaceful reunification.</P>
      <P>For Beijing leaders, it means no more live-fire military
exercises perilously close to Taiwan, or worse, attempts to blockade
or otherwise threaten Taiwan. For Taiwan, it means no declarations of
sovereignty to provoke Beijing.</P>
      <P>The commentary said that for the White House, it means continuing
to encourage both sides to resolve their differences directly and
peacefully without dragging Washington into playing the role of
interlocutor. Washington also must maintain its commitment under the
1979 Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with weaponry needed to
deter mainland Chinese aggression.</P>
      <P>A Clinton clarity campaign on the issue of the US' China policy
is long overdue and there's no better place to start than at the
upcoming Clinton-Jiang summit, the article concludes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA FAILS TO COLLECT ALL WEAPONS FROM PRIVATE HANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has failed to collect all the
1.5 million weapons across the country at a cost of US$333 million
because nearly 60 percent of the semiautomatic and automatic guns
remain in the private hands following the world's largest single
massacre in 1995.</P>
      <P>A 28-year-old Australian stunned the world by killing 35 people
at a scenic spot of Port Arthur, Tasmania, in that year. The massacre
prompted Prime Minister John Howard to buy back all the 1.5 million
semiautomatic and automatic weapons from private hands, that resulted
in strong protests from gun associations and farmers.</P>
      <P>During the amnesty period from July 1996 to September 1997, only
643,000, or less than 43 percent of the total 1.5 million firearms,
were collected by the government at a cost of US$200 million.</P>
      <P>In New South Wales, only 155,285 guns were handed to the
government, failing the target of 450,000.</P>
      <P>Other states and territories in Australia also failed to achieve
the target in the collection of firearms.</P>
      <P>South Australia recorded the best hand-in rate of 60 percent;
followed by Victoria, 51.8 percent; Northern Territory, 49.6 percent;
Queensland, 33.4 percent; New South Wales, 34.5 percent; and
Tasmania, 32.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Only Western Australia saw the collection of more firearms than
had been estimated at 47,218 against the targeted 43,000 and the
Australian Capital Territory at 4,910 against a target of 4,500,
according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</P>
      <P>The ban on semiautomatic and automatic weapons caused
Australia's firearms imports to fall sharply.</P>
      <P>Between July 1997 and March 1998, a total of 20,493 rifles and
shotguns valued at US$6 million were imported, down 32 percent from
the same period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>After the massacre, the Australian government allowed people to
own only shotguns and rifles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN -- ASIA'S IMPROBABLE NEW STRONGMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  April  26  (CNA)
(By Lawrence Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Taiwan is the most dynamic and
prosperous yet relatively unknown economy in the world," according to
a story which appeared in the Sunday business edition of The Los
Angeles Times written by senior economics editor James Flanigan.</P>
      <P>Flanigan described Taiwan's economy as a surprising achievement.
He indicated that Taiwanese businesses have at least US$37 billion
and perhaps as much as US$70 billion invested in the financially
troubled countries of Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan isn't waiting for the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to help those countries. Taiwan cannot belong to the IMF
because mainland China objects to any suggestion of Taiwan's being a
sovereign nation. So Taiwan banks, with the encouragement of their
central bank, are supporting Taiwanese company affiliates in
Southeast Asia with loans in this tense period. Thus they are helping
start the recovery process by financing production for export.</P>
      <P>Flanigan also traced Taiwan's development, describing Taiwan is
an island country of 21.5 million descendants of Chinese immigrants
who settled here over the last four centuries -- including the
Chinese Nationalists who "retreated" to Taiwan in 1949 after the
communists occupied the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Beijing regime from time to time has made the Taipei
government public enemy number one. Yet Taiwan is one of mainland
China's chief benefactors, with direct investment in plants and
equipment totaling at least US$35 billion and probably more than
US$60 billion -- the varying estimates being caused by unreported
investments in factories and real estate projects on the mainland.
Taiwan also buys more than US$20 billion-worth of mainland China's
exports every year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's textile manufacturers have long used the mainland to
produce garments and shoes. Now Taiwan's high-tech industries are
beginning to use the mainland to manufacture integrated circuit
boards and other components. Taiwan's computer giant Acer is even
planning to develop software in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy of US$284 billion in annual output of goods and
services depends on foreign trade for more than 75 percent of its
activity.</P>
      <P>And the Asian crisis is hurting. Taiwan's exports to South Korea
are down 50 percent, and exports to Japan are down more than 40
percent. Yet Taiwan's economy will grow 6 percent this year, slower
than last year's 8 percent, but still quite healthy.</P>
      <P>Why so robust? Because more than a third of Taiwan's output these
days is in high-tech goods that keep finding markets in North and
South America, mainland China and Europe.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's high-tech industry is unparalleled in Asia, greater than
that of any other country, including Japan. Pursuing high-tech
investment, Taiwan's government started work 16 years ago on Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in the north of the island, where
semiconductor and computer component firms can operate at low cost.</P>
      <P>The park now has almost 300 companies, many of them started by
Taiwan expatriates who returned from corporate jobs in the US for the
chance to run their own companies. The companies in Hsinchu represent
more than US$10 billion in aggregate investment, 90 percent of it
Taiwanese and raised in the country's stock exchange and unlisted
markets, which have launched more than one million small- and
medium-sized companies.</P>
      <P>However, perhaps the greatest factor in Taiwan's development has
been education.</P>
      <P>"About 15 years ago, when our appliance and textile industries
were moving production overseas, we saw that we would have to move to
high-tech industries, and for that we needed to stress education,"
says Finance Minister Paul Chiu.</P>
      <P>Taiwan spends 15 percent of its national budget on education at
the university level, and county governments spend more than 50
percent on primary and secondary education. more than 250,000 Taiwan
residents graduate from college every year, and tens of thousands go
to the US to pursue graduate studies.</P>

on Monday that the Investigation Bureau has targeted certain private
individuals and companies in a move to crack down on illegal stock
trading activities.</P>
      <P>Liao said that the crackdown campaign has already been launched,
adding that recent investigations show that illegal behind-the-scenes
manipulation of stock prices, which used to be the province of
large-scale organized criminal gangs, now involves individual
shareholders and even some listed companies.</P>
      <P>The justice minister added that he recently held a meeting with
businessmen based in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park, home to 178 listed companies, in an effort to thrash
out effective measures to stem illegal stock trading.</P>
      <P>The justice minister declined to reveal which individuals or
companies have been targeted by prosecution authorities, citing the
need to protect the investigation from outside interference.</P>
      <P>However, local newspapers reported on Monday that the
Investigation Bureau has been actively investigating the Core Pacific
Group and the Taiwan Pineapple Corporation for the two companies'
alleged roles in a variety of illegal stock trading activities.</P>
      <P>The reports also said that "Master" Hsu Hung-ming, and "Master"
Lee Cheng-lu, self-appointed stock market analysts who have built up
loyal followings through their popular cable television shows and who
have been accused of trading on the stock market using illegal means,
have also been targeted by the prosecution authorities.</P>

      <P>With subsidization from the "Fund for
China's Development," the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has invited
80 mainland Chinese experts and scholars to give lectures or conduct
research in Taiwan since 1994, a latest official report shows.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which set up the fund four years ago to help promote the
cross-strait cultural exchanges, was reporting on the fund's current
status.</P>
      <P>The report shows during the 1994-1998 period, 50 Taiwan scholars
have also visited mainland China with help from the development fund,
while 48 graduates from around the island have received aid allowing
them to conduct research there.</P>
      <P>In addition to the personnel exchanges, the fund, which is aimed
at promoting the development of Chinese societies, has also been used
to finance various publications and studies on cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that in addition to the official exchanges, private
activities in the cultural sector have also received support from the
fund.</P>
      <P>From January 1994 to February of this year, 205 proposals from

    <HEADLINE>ALGERIA PUSHES WTO MEMBERSHIP BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Algeria has finally held its first formal
meeting to push its bid for World Trade Organization (WTO)
membership, some 11 years after forming a working party to handle
accession, according to reports of the Geneva-based world trade body
Monday.</P>
      <P>Algeria's working party met for the first time at the WTO's
Geneva headquarters last week.</P>
      <P>The group was originally formed in 1987, but negotiators did not
hand over a "memorandum" to the WTO outlining the country's trade
policies until 1996.</P>
      <P>Algerian Trade Minister Bakhti Belaib, arguing the case for
Algeria's membership at the meeting, outlined the package of economic
reforms adopted by his government.</P>
      <P>But he also requested that entry be on developing country terms,
the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, Algeria has lowered inflation, improved its budgetary
balance and lifted constraints on external trade. Import restrictions
have been abolished, some monopolies disbanded and privatized, and a
competition law enforced.</P>
      <P>However, Algeria -- where violence over the past six years,
mainly by armed Islamic gangs, has claimed an estimated 80,000 lives
-- has also been at the mercy of falling energy prices. Algeria's
main export is crude oil.</P>
      <P>Economic growth has averaged 0.4 percent a year while population
growth has soared. Moreover, Algeria imports fully two-thirds of its
food needs.</P>
      <P>Algeria's application has won support from other Arab countries,
notably Tunisia, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar.</P>
      <P>The US delegation noted that negotiations in the WTO should have
a positive impact on Algeria's trade regime.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO SOLVE PROBLEM OF LACK OF SAND, STONE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Monday that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is planning to
import sand and initiate digging on land provided by the Taiwan Sugar
Corp. to solve the island's need for sand and stone.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan in answer to
questions from legislators from both the ruling Kuomintang and
opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers -- including Hsinchu County Legislator Cheng
Yung-chin, Pingtung County Legislator Lin Kuo-lung, Tainan County
Legislator Shih Tai-sheng, Hsinchu City Legislator Ko Chien-min, and
Taipei City Legislators Yeh Chu-lan and Hsiao Yu-cheng -- expressed
concern over illegal mining of riverbed material.</P>
      <P>They suggested that the government urgently address the problem
of the lack of sufficient sand and stone to meet the needs of future
construction projects, including the high speed rail system.</P>
      <P>After the MOEA noticed illegal digging had bared the foundations
of some bridges and had thus threatened public safety, the ministry
put further limits on digging in riverbeds, Wang replied, adding that
it had also initiated plans to dig on land and to import more sand to
meet domestic demand.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan imports about 100,000 tons of sand per year.</P>
      <P>Hsiao pointed that although the Chinese mainland had agreed to
supply Taiwan with more than 120 million tons of sand and stone a
year, the island's port facilities are not up to the job and the
problem remains unsolved. She also asked how many areas are available
in Taiwan for the collecting of stone and sand.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has identified more than 10 places on the island
suitable for digging, including land in southern Taiwan provided by
Taiwan Sugar. The projects, however, are still being evaluated for
their potential environmental impact and discussed with local
residents.</P>
      <P>Both Cheng and Ko suggested that Taiwan construct port facilities
that can handle sand imports as soon as possible to solve the problem
and that the MOEA should supervise this.</P>
      <P>In his reply, Wang said that in order to meet the needs for sand
and environmental preservation simultaneously, the MOEA will invite
the Council of Agriculture, Environmental Protection Administration
and other related government agencies to study the measures.</P>
      <P>He added that the MOEA also plans to expand port facilities to
allow for more imports of sand.</P>

attempted homicide and endangering aviation security, with the
prosecutor calling for a seven-year prison term.</P>
      <P>The offender, identified as 41-year-old Lin Chin-wen from Taipei

No. 9565 from Taipei, northern Taiwan, to Chaiyi in the south of the

carried 16 passengers and four crew.</P>
      <P>Before he could ignite the liquid, however, he was subdued by a
flight attendant and several passengers. Lin, who is partially
disabled, was arrested after the airplane made an emergency landing

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs said on Monday that due to the
continuing Asian financial turmoil, exports of Taiwan products to the
Chinese mainland declined during January and February.</P>
      <P>The BOFT estimated that the two-way trade across the Taiwan
Strait during the first two months of this year totaled US$3.05
billion, a decrease of 4 percent in comparison to the same period
last year.</P>
      <P>Of the total, exports of Taiwan products to the mainland amounted
to US$2.45 billion, a drop of 6.4 percent compared with the
corresponding period of last year, while imports from the mainland
reached US$596 million, an increase of 6.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The BOFT attributed the decrease of Taiwan products to the other
side of the strait to low-price competition from Southeast Asian
products, as well as declining demand in the mainland market.</P>
      <P>The main export items to the mainland from Taiwan during the
two-month period were electronic and electrical appliances and
accessories, machinery equipment and accessories, plastics and
plastic products, man-made fiber, and steel products. These items
were worth US$1.33 billion and accounted for 54.6 percent of the
island's total exports to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$143 million in steel to the mainland in
January and February, a decrease of 3.9 percent in comparison with
the same period last year, and US$342 million in machinery equipment
and accessories, an increase of 51.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, plastics and plastic products lost ground, plunging
47.1 percent, followed by textile products at 33.7 percent,
electrical appliances and accessories at 21.9 percent, and raw hides

    <HEADLINE>NO COMMENT ON REPORT TAIWAN COVERED BY US-JAPAN GUIDELINES: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
refused to comment on a Japanese news report that the Taiwan Strait
is to be listed as being covered by the Guidelines for Japan-US
Defense Cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Yomiuri Shimbun reported on Monday that the Japanese
government has decided to give a geographic definition of the "areas
surrounding Japan" covered in the revised Guidelines for Japan-US
Defense Cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Japanese daily said that Tokyo will submit legislation
related to the US-Japan defense guidelines that specifies the areas
covered to be "the Far East" and "areas surrounding the Far East,"
which would include the Taiwan Strait, the Korean Peninsula and the
disputed Spratly Islands.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said that according to the US-Japan Defense
Guidelines, Washington and Tokyo would take joint action to respond
to situations in areas surrounding Japan that have an important
influence on Japan's peace and security.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the guidelines, however, fail to give a clear
geographic references or limits as part of efforts not to provoke
neighboring countries, especially mainland China.</P>
      <P>Though the Japanese government reportedly has decided to define
the scope of "areas surrounding Japan" in its legislation, the
legislation has not been submitted to or passed by the Japanese Diet,
he noted, adding that the MOFA is not in a position at present to
comment on the news report.</P>
      <P>The Yomiuri Shimbun said that Tokyo and Washington expanded the
scope of the guidelines' application when revising the Japan-US
defense pact last year. The guidelines require the United States and
Japan to take joint action when potential aggression or an emergency
situation occurs in "areas surrounding Japan."</P>
      <P>Tokyo is thus allowed to give logistical support to Washington in
regional crises, including the use of Japanese minesweepers in
international waters.</P>
      <P>But in order not to provoke opposition to the expansion in the
military cooperation, the two sides have avoided mention in the
guidelines of any specific areas or where armed aggression might come
from; instead, the scope is described only by the vague phrase
"situations in areas surrounding Japan."</P>
      <P>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has carefully asserted
that it is hard to provide a purely geographical definition of the
phrase describing the guidelines' scope.</P>
      <P>But critics in the ruling and opposition parties have warned that
the US military could exploit the vague wording for an unlimited
expansion of support by Japan's Self Defense Forces, the daily said.</P>
      <P>The Yomiuri Shimbun, quoting government sources, said that the
Japanese government thus decided to define "areas surrounding Japan"
in legislation related to the new guidelines, which will be submitted
to the Japanese Diet for review on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government's position is that the guidelines would
cover action taken by US forces to deal with contingencies as far
away as "the Far East and its periphery," the daily said, pointing
out that this covers part of the Russian island of Sakhalin, the
entire Korean Peninsula and the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The periphery also includes Hong Kong, the Philippines,
Micronesia and the Spratly Islands, located in the South China Sea.
The Malacca Strait, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Middle East and the
Indian Ocean remain outside the area, the daily said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA REQUESTS WORKWEEK REDUCTION FROM 48 HOURS TO 44 HOURS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has
agreed to shorten the maximum required workweek from the current 48
hours to 44 hours as part of efforts to upgrade the welfare of
workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A CLA official confirmed on Monday that the council has
undertaken the amendment of the Labor Standards Law in order to
reduce the maximum to 44 hours.</P>
      <P>The official said that though labor unions have demanded a
40-hour workweek, the CLA insists on step-by-step reductions. A
sudden cut to 40 hours would have too much impact on enterprises and
on national productivity, he added.</P>
      <P>If the amendment passes the Legislative Yuan, an estimated 60
percent of the enterprises around the island will have to reduce the
workweek they require of their employees. If the workweek were cut to
40 hours, up to 90 percent of business or industry operators would be
affected.</P>
      <P>The official said that currently 46.2 percent of employees in
Taiwan have a 48-hour workweek, while 30.6 percent of workers are on
the job 44 hours per week. Compared with 1995, the amount of those
with a 48-hour workweek posted a 2.7 percent decrease, while the
latter figure fell by 1.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Around 53 percent of workers would benefit from a 44-hour
workweek. If the limit were moved down to 40 hours, up to 90 percent
of workers would have more leisure time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's workers averaged 2,324 hours of work in 1996, lower than
1991's 2,363 hours. The island's 1996 level is about 95 percent of
those of South Korea and Singapore and almost the same as Hong
Kong's.</P>
      <P>Taiwan workers, however, are on the job many more hours than
their counterparts in other advanced economies. Taiwan's yearly
working hours are 20 percent higher than in Japan and 30 percent
higher than in the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIEW RETURNS FROM TRIP TO MALAYSIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Monday that
he believes his visit to Malaysia has been helpful in promoting
substantial relations between Taiwan and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Siew, who made the remark Monday night in a press conference held
following his return to Taipei from the 3-day "private trip," said
that during his visit there, he met with Malaysian political and
business heavyweights as well as Taiwan businessmen, and that this
helped him gain a better understanding of the economic situation in
Malaysia and in other Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the financial crisis in Southeast Asia has
subsided but is not over completely. He said Malaysia's economic
fundamentals give the country hope of attracting more foreign
investment that will help the country recover from its financial and
economic troubles.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that Taiwan and Malaysia have maintained close trade
and economic relations, as Taiwan is Malaysia's fourth largest
trading partner and second largest investor. Taipei and Kuala Lumpur
both hope that such close ties can be further upgraded, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Siew said that at a seminar with Taiwan businessmen
based in Malaysia, the participants recommended the Southeast Asian
country as a good investment place with a highly efficient
government, expressing the hope that Taiwan businessmen won't halt
their investment there due to the financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The premier made it clear that Taipei encourages Taiwan
businessmen to invest in Southeast Asia, adding that if Taiwan
businessmen neglect good investment opportunities abroad, they are
running counter to the trend of the internationalization of
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that Taiwan could not be totally unscathed by the
financial crisis that swept Southeast Asia, pointing out that the
effect of the turmoil has been felt in Taiwan's exports to the
region.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China should create mutually beneficial and
interdependent relations with other countries in the area, he said.</P>
      <P>There's no political motive behind Taipei proposing the exchange
of visits of officials from the ROC and Southeast Asian countries, he
stressed, nor behind its proposals for regional financial
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Siew, who assumed the post of premier last September, reiterated
in the press conference the importance of "pragmatic diplomacy,"
saying that the ROC needs to increase its presence in the
international community in order to continue to exist and develop.</P>
      <P>Siew vowed to make more overseas visits as part of efforts to
upgrade the country's international profile despite possible
obstruction from Beijing, adding, "If we don't fight for our own
status, it is impossible that any other country in the international
community would offer us any assistance."</P>
      <P>This was Siew's third overseas trip this year, following visits
to the Philippines and Indonesia.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh on Tuesday urged Beijing to respond to Taipei's
overtures for a concerted move with Southeast Asian countries to help
stabilize the financial situation in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chang made the request at a seminar sponsored by the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research, a leading think tank in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, in line with a
resolution made by a crisis task force under the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, should convene a financial meeting with
Southeast Asian states as soon as possible to discuss the issuance of
bonds to help countries in the region through the current
difficulties.</P>
      <P>The MAC head, who is in charge of charting Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, urged Beijing to forswear its politically motivated
way of thinking, saying cross-strait efforts to fight the financial
crisis will lay a foundation for future cooperation between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>As to whether Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland
China and chairman of the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation
which is authorized by the government to handle exchanges with the
mainland in the absence of formal contacts, will be able to make a
much anticipated trip to the mainland in autumn, Chang said the date
for such a visit remains to be decided by the two sides.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui expressed
confidence Tuesday that relations between the Republic of China and
Paraguay can be further strengthened.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remark when he received a Paraguay delegation which
took part in a ROC-Paraguay economic meeting at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>He said the two countries can enhance their substantive relations
by means of increased cooperation and exchanges in the governmental
and private sectors, especially through the implementation of joint
economic and trade projects.</P>
      <P>The 10th ROC-Paraguay Economic Cooperation Conference was held in
Taipei last week. ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and
Paraguayan Industry and Commerce Minister Atilio Fernandez
co-presided over the two-day event.</P>
      <P>Fernandez said his weeklong visit here has given him a strong
realization that although Taiwan lacks natural resources, it has
achieved stunning results in political and economic development by
utilizing its rich pool of educated and skilled human assets.</P>
      <P>Conversely, Fernandez said, Paraguay possesses abundant natural
resources, but needs to improve its personnel training and attract
more foreign investment.</P>
      <P>He echoed Lee's words in saying trade and economic cooperation
projects between Taiwan and Paraguay are concrete means of ensuring
deep and long-lasting ties.</P>
      <P>The Paraguay delegation will leave Taipei on Wednesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said Monday evening
the Republic of China intends to forge regional and multilateral
financial relations with Malaysia and the rest of Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Speaking on his return from a visit to Malaysia, Siew stressed
that it is safe to participate in cooperative financial efforts in
the Southeast Asian region, and that Taiwan hopes to show the spirit
of helping others under this framework.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed that Taiwan is open to the possibilities regarding
high-tech cooperation with Malaysia. Financially, Taiwan encourages
regional and multilateral cooperation, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew also defended the effectiveness of the government's "go
south" policy. According to Siew, in the past few years, between
8,000 and 10,000 businesses from Taiwan have invested more than US$38
billion in the Southeast Asian region. From this perspective, it
cannot be said that the "go south" policy is ineffective, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew explained that the private sector is responsible for its own
risk assessments and investment initiatives, but said the government
is there to provide assistance in times of need. For example, he
said, should problems with residence visas and taxes arise, the
government would talk to its Malaysian counterpart and help resolve
the matters.</P>
      <P>Siew led a delegation of industry representatives along with
Minister of Foreign Affairs Jason Hu and Minister of Finance Paul
Chiu to Malaysia for a low-profile three-day visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO SET UP AVIATION SAFETY COMMISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan plans to set up an aviation safety
committee modeled on the US National Transportation Safety Board to
conduct fair and independent investigations into the causes of air
accidents, Oung Cheng-yi, chairman-designate of the proposed
committee, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>But Oung said a shortage of qualified personnel will make it
difficult for the committee, to be formed under the Executive Yuan,
to carry out a thorough investigation of two recent air crashes, one
involving China Airlines which left 202 persons dead in February and
one involving Formosa Airlines which killed 13 in March.</P>
      <P>Oung made the remarks as the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) sent the black box of the Formosa Airlines plane to the United
States for analysis. The results are expected by Friday at the
earliest.</P>
      <P>Oung said in a seminar on the upgrading of flight safety that
after the official inauguration of the committee next month, members
will have to spend at least three months learning procedural
techniques before beginning to draft a set of principles to guide
future investigations into air accidents.</P>
      <P>He said the committee will seek cooperation with similar bodies
in other nations, solicit foreign experts to assist in training and
establish a standard procedure for handling air accidents.</P>
      <P>Oung noted that although Taiwan has better civil aviation
facilities as well as more qualified maintenance and technical
personnel than do most underdeveloped countries, Taiwan's airliners
have comparatively higher accident rates.</P>
      <P>Oung attributed the bad record of aviation safety to a lack of
serious-mindedness in the national work ethic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE NAVY SHIPS TO MAKE FIRST VISIT TO AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  28 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mainland Chinese navy is scheduled
to make its first ever visit to Australia from May 4 to 9, signaling
improved defense relations between Beijing and Canberra.</P>
      <P>Gary Klintworth, visiting fellow at the Department of
International Relations at the Australian National University, said
one of the three mainland vessels making the port call will be a
recently launched multipurpose replenishment ship, weighing 37,000
tons when fully loaded. The same vessel went to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii,
and the US West Coast in March 1997.</P>
      <P>The other two are among mainland China's most modern warships, a
pair of 4,800-ton Luhu-class guided missile destroyers launched in
1996.</P>
      <P>The three ships will visit Sydney and will be open for public
display.</P>
      <P>Klintworth said the ships will be the first military vessels to
come to Australia from the Chinese mainland since Canberra switched
its diplomatic ties to Beijing from Taipei in 1972.</P>
      <P>Klintworth said the mainland Chinese navy is steadily expanding
its horizons, sailing further and for longer periods of time than at
any time in recent history.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing strategists have made do with a navy that is
numerically large but technologically dated.</P>
      <P>"Furthermore, the number of warships and submarines possessed by
China has been in decline in recent years. The fact is that China has
fewer modern surface warships than Japan, Taiwan or Australia. It has
only a handful of operational submarines and nothing to match the
number or quality of Australia's Collins-class submarines when they
become operational," he said.</P>
      <P>"Besides, China warships, including those coming to Australia,
have already been thoroughly inspected by regional naval intelligence
specialists, including the Taiwanese, and all of them agree that the
Chinese navy is not a potent threat to the regional arms balance," he
added.</P>
      <P>Klintworth said: "The Chinese navy's visit to Sydney is a symbol
of the new defense relationship that now exists between China and
Australia. It augurs well for increased stability and security in the
Asia-Pacific region."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DELEGATION CONCERNED ABOUT WATERFRONT DISPUTE IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation from the Republic of China
attending an energy and mineral conference in Canberra has raised
concern over the waterfront dispute in Australia, saying it could
disrupt Taiwan's trade with this country.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA Tuesday morning, Dr. Chen Chao-yih,
secretary-general of the Energy Commission of the ROC Economics
Ministry, said the Taiwan delegation, led by Vice Economics Minister
Yin Chi-ming, had raised the issue of the waterfront dispute in major
Australian ports Monday at the 5th Australia-Taiwan Energy and
Minerals Consultations meeting.</P>
      <P>"We raised the question because Taiwan is a major importer of
energy and mineral products from Australia. We are concerned that the
dispute could disrupt delivery of our exports of manufactured
products, especially our imports from Australia," he said.</P>
      <P>He said the Australian delegates offered assurances that their
government would try its best to resolve the current waterfront
battle between the federal government, Patrick Stevedores Ltd. and
the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA).</P>
      <P>The dispute was triggered by Patrick's sacking of all 2,000 of
its unionized workers about two weeks ago. The MUA, supported by the
Australian Council of Trade Unions, and other union groups, staged a
series of protests, blocking both export and import cargo movements
in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and ports in
Tasmania.</P>
      <P>The waterfront war is still on now.</P>
      <P>Chen said Australia is the largest supplier of coal to Taiwan,
shipping about 15 million tons last year, with the figure expected to
increase in the future, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the imports are made by Taiwan Power Company, China Steel
Corp. and other private power firms in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Australia is also a major supplier of iron ore to Taiwan along
with other mineral products.</P>
      <P>The waterfront dispute could worsen if a new battle erupts
between unionized workers and another bigger stevedoring firm -- P&amp;O
Ports, which handles about 55 percent of containerized cargo in major
ports across Australia.</P>
      <P>Patrick is the second largest stevedoring firm with its handling
capacity of about 40 percent.</P>
      <P>P&amp;O is expected to renegotiate its work practices with its
unionized workers in a bid to improve the handling volume of the
containerized cargo. If the workers fail to improve their
productivity, which is now at an average rate of 18.5 TEUs (twenty
foot equivalent units) per hour, well below the world's standard of
25 TEUs per hour, a new labor-management battle could erupt. That
conflict would be even bigger than the current war between Patrick
and the MUA, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC delegation was not only concerned about
Taiwan's imports of energy and mineral products from Australia, but
also worried about Taiwan's exports of manufactured goods, including
computers and components, and sundry items, to Australia.</P>
      <P>Last year, two-way trade between Australia and Taiwan totaled
about US$4.2 billion and the figure is expected to increase steadily
in coming years, trade officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN PM GREETED BY CASTRO AT HAVANA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fidel Castro, Cuba's long-time dictator,
greeted Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien at a new Havana airport
Sunday evening as the Canadian leader began a two-day visit.</P>
      <P>The visit was the first by a Canadian prime minister in more than
20 years.</P>
      <P>Chretien flew into Havana's new international airport, which was
built with Canadian financial assistance. The two leaders were
supposed to deliver opening remarks about the airport, but Castro
seemed to go off script.</P>
      <P>In a speech televised live in Canada and the United States,
Castro criticized the United States trade embargo against Cuba,
comparing it to an act of war and a "hegemonic" genocide against his
people. He accused the United States of trying to impose its will on
the Cubans.</P>
      <P>A Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) journalist watching the
airport scene said Chretien turned his head away from his host while
Castro blasted America. The TV screen was focusing on Castro.</P>
      <P>When Chretien spoke, he steered clear of controversy in his
comments, except for a vague mention of human rights and increased
democracy in Latin America.</P>
      <P>Chretien's speech largely focused on bilateral relations, which
began in the 19th century and were formalized in 1945.</P>
      <P>"Mr. President, through good times and bad, our two countries
have always chosen dialogue over confrontation, engagement over
isolation, exchange over estrangement. And we have always done this
in an atmosphere of mutual respect for each other's independence and
sovereignty," Chretien said.</P>
      <P>Following his speech, he was invited to cut the ribbon for the
airport. He gave a piece of the ribbon to Castro, keeping one for
himself.</P>
      <P>The visit angered some American politicians, who considered it a
show of support for the communist state. But back home, a CBC call-in
program showed most Canadians support the Chretien move, mainly
because of dislike for America's high-handed policy and a feeling
that engagement is better than confrontation.</P>
      <P>Chretien's "respect for Cuban independence" has had an immediate
benefit for his country: He was expected to announce a deal Monday
that will see Cuba agreeing to pay a Canadian insurance company
millions of dollars in compensation.</P>
      <P>Six Canadian insurance companies had their assets seized and
their accounts frozen after Castro took power in 1959. Since then,
the Canadian government has been fighting to get that money back.</P>
      <P>Cuba now has agreed to paid back C$12 million in compensation to
one of the companies.</P>
      <P>Chretien's trip was being billed as a working visit with trade
high on the agenda. Canada is a leading investor in Cuba with
extensive interests in mining and oil production, as well as in the
tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The Canadian prime minister will spend less than 48 hours on the
Caribbean island. He is expected to meet at least three times with
the Cuban president, including a "working dinner" on Monday. Castro
is known for making lengthy speeches on such occasions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GROWTH RATE OF POPULATION IN TAIWAN KEPT BELOW 1 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trends of getting married later in
life and having smaller families have kept the growth rate of
Taiwan's population below one percent for the last 14 years, a family
planning official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Ming-cheng, director of the Taiwan Province Family Planning
Institute, made the remarks when fielding legislators' questions in
the Taiwan Provincial Assembly.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the average age of marriage for both men and
women has become higher in recent years, rising to an average of 28
for women and 31 for men.</P>
      <P>In addition, each family now has an average of 1.7 children, with
the number of births in Taiwan over the past 14 years being about
320,000 and the number of natural deaths about 120,000. The growth
rate of the population has been kept under 1 percent.</P>
      <P>In view of the situation, Chang said a new family planning policy
is needed, which will promote earlier marriages, sexual awareness and
reasonable numbers of children.</P>
      <P>Assemblywoman Yang Chung-ying of the ruling Kuomintang noted that
many Taiwan men go to mainland China and Southeast Asia in search of
brides, and asked for statistics on the ratio of men and women in the
Taiwan area.</P>
      <P>Yang also questioned if the practice of marrying abroad will
affect the quality of the local society.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the ratio of men and women in Taiwan was
108-to-100 among births, but the ratio evens out at 100-to-100 among
50-year-olds. In the over-50 age group, women outnumber men. But in
the over-60 age group, there are more men than women.</P>
      <P>Thus, Chang said, the overall ratio of men to women in Taiwan is
105-to-100. He added that, as foreign brides from the mainland and
Southeast are often members of the lower or lower-middle class, there
are fears their increased numbers could affect local society in the
long run.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OBSERVATORY TO SHED LIGHT ON MYSTERIES OF NEUTRINOS, UNIVERSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  27  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An underground observatory able to trap
minute particles from outer space will be unveiled in Ontario on
Wednesday, the Canadian Press (CP) reported.</P>
      <P>Tiny balls of light snagged in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory,
buried deep within a nickel mine, may finally answer whether
neutrinos make up most of the mysterious dark matter of the universe,
the CP said.</P>
      <P>Neutrinos, along with electrons and quarks, are considered the
building blocks of nature. Zillions of them produced in the core of
the sun shoot through everything and everyone on Earth each second.</P>
      <P>But neutrinos are so tiny they can pass through virtually
anything. "One neutrino in a person's lifetime may stop in their body
and they won't even notice -- they're completely outside people's
normal experience," the CP quoted Art McDonald, a Queen's University
physics professor heading the US$50 million observatory.</P>
      <P>Building a detector sensitive enough to count the particles took
more than five years and involved scientists and engineers from the
United States and Britain.</P>
      <P>"It's a fascinating project and the whole technical difficulty of
doing it and building it is an amazing story in itself," commented
Michael Smith, president of the Canadian Science Writers Association
in Toronto.</P>
      <P>The story so intrigued renowned physicist Stephen Hawking that he
requested a private tour of the observatory painstakingly assembled
inside a 10-story cavity more 2,000 meters below the Earth's surface.</P>
      <P>Hawking, 56, a Cambridge University professor, gained
international acclaim a few years ago when his book "A Brief History
of Time" hit the bestseller lists.</P>
      <P>About 200 scientists from around the world are expected to join
another 25 working at the site for the observatory's opening
Wednesday. The event will also be carried live in an Internet
webcast.</P>
      <P>Canada has some real natural advantages in the joint project
because of the availability of a mine deep enough to block the cosmic
rays that can mask the faint neutrino signals.</P>
      <P>Canada's ready supply of heavy water used in its nuclear reactor
industry gave it another leg up on other sites. The Sudbury project
is the first deep-Earth observatory to use heavy water to detect
neutrinos.</P>
      <P>Scientists say the new approach will allow them to count more of
the elusive particles and, for the first time, the various types.</P>
      <P>During the next two months, 1,000 tons of heavy water on loan
from the Ontario Hydro power company will be carried in small tanks
down a mine elevator and poured into the main observatory sphere. The
sphere, reassembled piece by piece underground, will be floated in
another container filled with purified water.</P>
      <P>About once an hour, scientists expect a neutrino passing through
the heavy water will collide with an atom and emit a tiny flash of
light. These sparks will be caught and analyzed by 10,000
computerized light detectors surrounding the sphere.</P>
      <P>At that rate, McDonald expects it will take about two years to
get enough information to shed some light on the mystery of dark
matter.</P>
      <P>If the data can prove neutrinos have mass, the sheer number of
them could explain the age-old puzzle of why the universe does not
collapse upon itself, according to Smith.</P>
      <P>It may also tell scientists whether neutrinos have enough impact
to slow or stop the expansion of the universe that began with the Big
Bang.</P>
      <P>And that could help scientists predict how many billions of years
it will take for the universe to end.</P>
      <P>"I tell people I'm studying how the sun works, the future
evolution of the universe and the most microscopic parts of the
universe -- all at the same time," McDonald said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AREAS NEAR BEIJING SAID SITES OF ILLEGAL LABOR CAMPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  28 (CNA)
(By Huang Kuan-chun and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Beijing Municipal Public Security
Bureau has set up illegal labor reform camps to detain some of those
without a registered local residence who roam Beijing, look for
part-time work there or even just visit the city, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
charged on Monday.</P>
      <P>Zhang Jincheng, a dissident who claims to have just escaped from
an illegal labor camp outside Beijing, was quoted by the information
center as saying that he was tailed and arrested by Beijing's public
security servicemen after he paid a visit to Xu Wenli, a dissident in
Beijing, and Wei Xiaotao, the younger brother of prominent dissident
Wei Jingsheng, on April 14.</P>
      <P>He said that before being sent to a vacation resort construction
site in Changping County, suburban Beijing, he had been beaten and
questioned by six public security servicemen for an entire day.</P>
      <P>That construction site is an illegal labor reform camp, according
to Zhang. More than a hundred people are detained there, most of whom
were visiting Beijing, seeking a job, or just loafing about, but none
of whom were registered in a local domicile, he said. They were put
into the construction site to do heavy labor without any payment,
having been arrested but then never allowed to go through other legal
procedures, he charged.</P>
      <P>There are many such camps in Changping County, Zhang said, citing
a quarry, sand-sifting sites and chemical fertilizer plants. He said
the public security police told him that after six months of forced
labor, he would be sent back to his home in Anhui Province.</P>
      <P>Zhang, however, said he escaped from the camp on April 24 because
of its intolerable working conditions.</P>
      <P>Zhang, 32, had been working as a member of the teaching staff of
a Communist Party school in Anhui and was preparing a thesis about
democratic systems. He visited dissidents around mainland China as
part of his thesis research, he said.</P>
      <P>Depriving people of freedom and putting them in labor camps
without legal due process is obviously against the constitution of
mainland China and a serious violation of civil rights, the

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEADER ATTRACTS AUSSIE MEDIA ATTENTION OVER AUSTRALIAN TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of Taiwan's
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has attracted
Australian media attention over his visit to Australia.</P>
      <P>The Australian and The Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday ran
separate interviews with Hsu, who arrived in Sydney on Monday and
will go to Canberra Tuesday night at the invitation of the Australian
Commerce and Industry Office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his interview with The Australian, Hsu urged Australia to be
more proactive in its dealings with the politically isolated state,
claiming mainland China is now in a "more realistic" mood about the
international community's view of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Australia adheres to a "one-China policy" more strictly
than the United States.</P>
      <P>"This is understandable, but the point is that besides the
one-China policy, a lot of other things can be developed in our
relationship," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji is a very
pragmatic man.</P>
      <P>"We believe Zhu is in favor of talks. He wants to see an
improvement in cross-strait relations," he told The Australian.</P>
      <P>In another interview, Hsu told the Sydney Morning Herald that
since Taiwan is already independent in practice there is no need to
declare independence. "We won't do that," he said. The DPP, unlike
the ruling Kuomintang, is associated with pro-independence sentiment.</P>
      <P>The daily said Hsu's remarks will be reassuring to Asia's big
powers.</P>
      <P>He also addressed relations between Taipei and Washington.</P>
      <P>He said that "of course" the United States will continue to
adhere to the Taiwan Relations Act. Should Taiwan "provoke" mainland
China with a declaration of independence, however, "then things would
be different," he said, declaring that Washington has "no obligation"
to defend the island in such a case.</P>
      <P>Hsu is expected to be a major player in the Republic of China's
2000 presidential election, in which the Kuomintang may face the
first serious challenge to its control of the presidency in its 53
years of unbroken rule of the island, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>All four major Chinese language newspapers in Sydney also ran
front-page banner headlines to announce Hsu and his 11-member

      <P>In the fifth annual meeting of the ROC-Australia Joint Energy and
Minerals Trade, Investment and Cooperation Consultations, ROC Vice
Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming said Australian enterprises can use
Taiwan as their base to expand their exports in the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>Yiin, the leader of the 15-member ROC delegation to the
conference, told his audience, which included Australian government
officials and business leaders, that Taiwan has established regional
operations centers for manufacturing, sea and air transportation,
finance, telecommunications, and media.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is located in "an advantageous strategic position
among the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, and this makes it an
ideal location to serve as a cargo and passenger transshipment
center."</P>
      <P>Yiin said Australia and Taiwan are complimentary, with Taiwan
having a marketing network and sufficient cash while Australia is
rich in natural resources.</P>
      <P>He urged Australia to further broaden the scope of cooperation
between Taipei and Canberra so that both can promote mutual
prosperity.</P>
      <P>"I am confident that we will create even brighter economic
prospects through further cooperation in the future," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Australia has been Taiwan's No. 1 coal supplier, selling
about 15 million tonnes of coal in 1997 alone, which accounted for 42
percent of Taiwan's total import of the mineral.</P>
      <P>Australia also exported 8.31 million tonnes of iron ore, 800,000
tonnes of titanium concentrates, 165,000 tonnes of aluminum, 28,000
tonnes of zinc and 30,000 tonnes of lead to Taiwan during the same
period.</P>
      <P>The total mineral exports from Australia to Taiwan were worth
US$727 million in 1997, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>"All these figures indicate the close relations that exist
between our two countries in energy and mineral product trade," he
said.</P>
      <P>He told the Australian delegation that the ROC government is now
paying much more attention to the emission of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>The ROC is searching for new areas of cooperation with Australia
in reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, he said.</P>
      <P>Australia is now Taiwan's seventh largest foreign supplier. Trade
between the two rose 8.7 percent to US$5.09 billion in 1997 from
US$4.68 billion in 1996.</P>
      <P>The two-day conference will discuss Taiwan's needs for energy and
mineral products from Australia and give Australia a chance to
introduce its energy and mineral supplies.</P>
      <P>As more steel plants, naphtha crackers and privately-owned power
plants come on line in Taiwan, Yiin said, the island's imports of
coal, liquefied natural gas and other energy and mineral products
from Australia will increase.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO RULES AGAINST INDONESIA IN CAR CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Trade Organization (WTO) has
issued a final ruling that Indonesia's "national car" program
violates global trade rules, according to reports of the Geneva-based
world trade body Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ruling was handed to Indonesia and the parties that have
claimed victory in the case, the United States, the European Union
and Japan. The verdict upholds the trio's allegations that Indonesia
broke rules governing non-discrimination, subsidies and investment
measures by granting tax privileges to its "national car."</P>
      <P>"There are no surprise," the WTO report quoted a trade official
whose country is involved in the dispute as saying, pointing out that
an interim ruling issued in March by the WTO panel examining the file
had found Jakarta at fault on those grounds.</P>
      <P>Indonesia can appeal the decision to the WTO Appellate Body. But
the WTO report said it was not sure if this would happen, given
Jakarta's pledge to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in
accepting a US$43 billion bail-out package that it would respect a
WTO ruling.</P>
      <P>As part of its obligations to the IMF, Indonesia promised to
dismantle its national car project.</P>
      <P>The program allowed kits produced by troubled Kia Motors of South
Korea to be imported free of duty and the assembled Timor Saloons to
be sold without the luxury tax attached, making them cheaper than
other foreign car imports.</P>
      <P>The firm with sole rights to import the Kia kits, PT Timor
Nasional, is owned by Indonesian President Suharto's youngest son.</P>
      <P>The final report on the ruling will be submitted to all WTO
members in about two weeks. Panel reports are adopted by the WTO's
Dispute Settlement Body within 60 days unless one party decides to
appeal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS SEE SIGNS OF DEPRECIATION OF RENMINBI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of scholars and experts in the
Republic of China said on Tuesday that the deterioration of the
economic situation in mainland China has become clearer and that the
country's currency, the renminbi, is showing early signs of
depreciation.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks at a seminar on economic development in
mainland China in 1998 which was held at the Chung-Hua Institute for
Economic Research.</P>
      <P>Ing Nai-ping, a professor in the Banking Department of National
Chengchi University, pointed out that based on a report by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), up to the end of March this year
the renminbi has depreciated by 0.1-0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>He attributed the recession to the poor performance of the
mainland's first-quarter foreign trade. During January to March this
year, exports grew about 13 percent, a drastic drop from the 25
percent recorded for the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>The IMF has even predicted that the mainland will suffer zero
growth in its trade surplus for this year. In addition, the
first-quarter economic growth reached only 7.2 percent, factors which
are far from conducive to the maintenance of the renminbi's value.</P>
      <P>According to Ing, the renminbi has appreciated more than 20
percent against the currencies of Southeast Asian countries in
relative terms, and he noted that if the mainland intends to
safeguard its economic growth, then depreciation of the renminbi of
between 10 and 15 percent will be unavoidable.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-lang, advisor to the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, pointed out that the renminbi will play an important role
in the outcome of the Asian financial turmoil. He said he believes
that the negative factors, including the possibility of a trade
deficit for this year, will lead to depreciation of the renminbi
sooner or later.</P>
      <P>His view was shared by Professor Hsu Chen-ming of the Economics
Department of National Taiwan University, who said that the mainland
authorities can easily control the exchange rate if they want to,
since mainland China does not have a fully open economy. However, if
the mainland cannot resist the force of a huge trade deficit and a
steep reduction of foreign capital inflow, then it can use
depreciation to save itself, he added.</P>
      <P>However, since the Beijing leadership has on many occasions
reiterated its decision to maintain the current foreign exchange
rates, it will face strong international pressure if it fails to
stick with this decision, Hsu said, predicting that the renminbi will
maintain its stability at least until July, when US President Bill
Clinton is expected to visit Beijing.</P>

      <P>The head of the Republic of China's

Monday to attend the 1998 annual committee meeting of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB).</P>
      <P>The three-day meeting opened on Wednesday in the building that

      <P>During his stay in Geneva, Peng will join with financial and

Asian financial crises erupting in mid-1997.</P>
      <P>The Manila-based ADB is the only official international
organization in which the Republic of China enjoys a seat.</P>
      <P>According to sources within the 12-member ROC delegation, during
the upcoming meeting the ROC will submit a program aimed at helping
the Asian countries that are suffering from the effects of the
financial assault.</P>
      <P>Under the ROC-initiated proposal, the ADB would offer guarantees
enabling the economically troubled Southeast Asian countries to
release government bonds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY TO LAUNCH NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION AGAINST PREMIER SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Party announced on Tuesday that it
is seeking to launch a motion of no-confidence against Premier
Vincent Siew to protest a government system virtually paralyzed by
corruption and inefficiency.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference with major New Party figures, Hau
Lung-pin, caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, said the New Party is
planning to make the move not only because of the implications of
illegality brought about by the exposure of Vice President Lien
Chan's alleged electioneering loan to former Pingtung County
Magistrate Wu Tze-yuan, but also because the New Party holds Siew
responsible for the people's discontent over the performance of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) since the holding of the National Development
Conference in December 1996.</P>
      <P>Lien's alleged illegal financial links with Wu, Hau said,
unveiled that KMT officials, from the top to the grassroots levels,
have ignored the government's legal framework, paralyzing the
nation's justice system and arousing grave public concern over the
KMT's ability to run the country.</P>
      <P>Hau slammed Siew's leadership role in the series of
constitutional reforms at the National Assembly last year, and said
the New Party is determined to seek support from the major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in its efforts to sack Siew's
administration in order to help bring the government system back
within the framework of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chou Yang-shan, also convener of the New Party's
National Campaign and Development Committee, said the KMT-led
constitutional reforms last year have seriously compromised the
integrity of the government sector.</P>
      <P>The current government system is a "deteriorated mixture" which
has created an all-powerful president and a powerless premier, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Although the nationwide legislative election is only a few months
away, Chou said he does not believe that the planned no-confidence
vote against Siew will provoke political instability, as the present
political situation is already entrenched in chaos.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Huahn-dji, DPP caucus whip at the Legislative Yuan,
said the DPP is also "dissatisfied" with the "Lee-Lien team," and
that the party does not rule out the possibility of calling for a
no-confidence vote against Siew's administration.</P>
      <P>Su said the DPP is cautiously assessing the timing for raising a
no-confidence motion, adding that the DPP and the New Party share
a similar stance toward the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TOUTS EU MODEL FOR CHINESE UNIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former ROC Control Yuan President Chen
Li-an on Tuesday recommended the European Union (EU) formula for an
ultimate unification of Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen, who ran for the ROC presidency in March 1996 but was
defeated by President Lee Teng-hui, suggested that leaders of the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should perceive cross-strait relations as
part of a much wider overall picture, and follow the EU formula as a
framework on which the unification process could be based.</P>
      <P>Chen, who arrived in Beijing on April 24, is currently on a
weeklong visit, primarily in order to meet with a renowned Tibetan
"living Buddha" to discuss Buddhism.</P>
      <P>The crux of the prolonged cross-strait impasse lies in each
side's psychological denial of the other, Chen noted, adding that as
the two sides are in strong conflict with each other psychologically,
they remain in actual conflict with each other.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the two sides to set aside this hostile mentality and
try to seek a niche in which cooperation can take place. "Work
towards unification by replacing confrontation with cooperation," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>He said he fully supports the idea of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait jointly tackling the Southeast Asian economic crisis, and has
harbored this concept ever since the regional upheaval began last
year.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes that the two sides should cooperate on this
issue, but only when the time is right.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he declined to confirm or deny allegations that he
intends to run for a legislative seat in elections slated for the end
of this year, saying that only the present is important, and that it
is not worthwhile to speculate on events which may or may not occur
in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EL SALVADORAN PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL VISITS TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Francisco Guillermo Flores, visiting
presidential hopeful of El Salvador's ruling party, on Tuesday met
with ROC Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang for discussions on
ways to bolster bilateral economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Wang said the visit by Flores, who is considered the central
American country's most-favored presidential candidate, is giving a
shot in the arm to the already close relations between Taiwan and El
Salvador.</P>
      <P>In June 1994, Taiwan's Lien Chan, then premier, attended the
inauguration of El Salvadoran President Armando Calderon on behalf of
President Lee Teng-hui, which was followed in September 1997 by a
visit by the president himself.</P>
      <P>During Lee's trip, the two governments forged an economic
cooperation agreement and agreed to sign another free-trade
cooperation accord.</P>
      <P>A month later, Wang led an investment fact-finding mission to El
Salvador to investigate the feasibility of developing an export
processing zone in that country.</P>
      <P>El Salvador's Vice President Enrique Borgos visited Taipei in
late January this year to seek ways of further strengthening trade
and economic exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) dispatched an
inspection group to El Salvador in February, and the company later
decided to relocate its lucrative sugar-refining and orchid
cultivation operations to that country.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and El Salvador amounted to US$60.19
million in 1997, with Taiwan enjoying a disproportionate surplus of
US$59.59 million, according to statistics compiled by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Currently, 18 Taiwan companies operate manufacturing plants in El
Salvador with investments totaling US$36 million. Most of the
investment focuses on textile and garment manufacturing.</P>
      <P>Three new Taiwan investment projects, including a
paper-processing plant and a motorbike assembly plant, are currently
underway, and they are expected to go online after June this year,
said Wang.</P>
      <P>Assessing El Salvador's investment climate, the MOEA officials
found it to be a two-way street -- its advantages, including a
diligent and skilled workforce and relatively sounder infrastructure
than neighboring countries, are almost balanced by its shortcomings,
which include worrisome public order, sporadic labor strikes, and
expensive, import dependent industrial raw materials.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China and the Republic of
Paraguay on Tuesday issued a joint statement agreeing to enhance the
protection of intellectual property rights (IPR).</P>
      <P>The joint statement was signed by Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang and visiting Paraguayan Minister of Trade and Industry
Atilio Fernandez.</P>
      <P>In order to implement the agreement, both sides have appointed
special groups to take charge of information exchanges as well as
crackdowns on IPR infringement.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that a huge haul of Taiwan-made counterfeit
"Nintendo" video game products which was seized by Paraguayan customs
authorities last year has drawn complaints from the United States.</P>
      <P>He said that in order to protect IPR, the issue was discussed at
the ongoing 10th ROC-Paraguayan Conference on Economic Cooperation,
at which both sides agreed to enhance information exchanges and to
conduct joint efforts to crack down on counterfeiting.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday afternoon, Wang conferred an award first-class in the
form of a medal on Fernandez, in recognition of his contributions to
the promotion of ROC-Paraguayan economic and trade cooperation.</P>
      <P>After the presentation ceremony, Fernandez expressed his
appreciation for the assistance the Republic of China has extended to
Paraguay, and pledged to continue his efforts to promote trade and
economic development between the two countries. He also expressed the
hope that more Taiwan businessmen will invest in Paraguay.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan spent an average of
NT$6,663 (US$202) per head on liquor and tobacco last year, according
to statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The statistics specify that Taiwan's per capita consumption of
tobacco reached 92 packets in 1997, up four from a year ago, with an
average cost of NT$2,634 (US$79.8).</P>
      <P>Alcohol consumption per head amounted to 37.7 liters, up 1.4
liters, with per capita expenditure reaching NT$4,029 (US$122.09).</P>
      <P>The DGBAS statistics revealed that since Taiwan began to open its
liquor and tobacco markets in 1987, sales of locally manufactured
products have gradually declined. The trend can be illustrated by the
fact that their market share in 1997 dropped from 76.1 percent to
67.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Last year, 374,000 boxes of locally produced cigarettes were sold
on the island, down 13.7 percent, while 10.8 million dozen bottles of
Taiwan alcoholic beverages were purchased, down 11 percent, the DGBAS
figures show.</P>
      <P>Around NT$10.8 billion (US$327.27 million)-worth of cigarettes
were imported to Taiwan in 1997, up 20.9 percent from the previous
year. Germany, Japan, Britain and the United States were the key
exporting countries.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS statistics also indicate that NT$17 billion (US$515.2
million)-worth of liquor was imported last year, up 27.1 percent.
Most of this amount was attributed to wine imports from France, which
was listed as the island's largest source of the product.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Taiwan business groups on Tuesday
decided to cash in some US$100 million on a Bangkok Bank
capitalization increment project, officially pitching into the
financial operations of the largest commercial bank in Southeast
Asia, according to sources from China Development Corp. (CDC).</P>
      <P>CDC Chairman Liu Tai-ying, who is also incumbent chairman of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Business Management Committee, disclosed that
CDC will put up US$100 million to acquire a 10 percent stake, or 44
million shares, of an extra 440 million shares to be created by
Bangkok Bank in its drive for increased capitalization.</P>
      <P>Of the US$100 million, said Liu, US$20 million will be put up by
the Tainan-based President Group, while another US$20 million will be
financed by Tuntex Group, a Taiwan business conglomerate which
maintains a large number of investment operations in Thailand.</P>
      <P>The remaining US$60 million will be offered to other private
investors in Taiwan to cash in on, although CDC does not exclude the
possibility of absorbing the whole amount, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>A Singaporean corporation also agreed to contribute US$100
million to acquire one-tenth of the Bangkok Bank shares to be created
by the effort to raise additional capital.</P>
      <P>In addition to business conglomerates in Taiwan, Japan and
Singapore, other leading companies in Europe and the United States
have also expressed keen interest in becoming shareholders of Bangkok
Bank, Liu added.</P>
      <P>The bank is currently Thailand's largest, and the largest in
Southeast Asia. It maintains 499 affiliate operations in Thailand and
22 branch offices in 13 countries and areas around the world.</P>
      <P>The Southeast Asian financial meltdown which began to batter the
region in July last year has forced the gigantic bank to resort to a
drive to increase its capital options to help tide it over the

    <TEXT>
      <P>W.Y. Pan, president of the China Petroleum
Corp. (CPC), announced on Tuesday that his company hopes to speed up
its privatization plan and will release 15 percent of its stocks
before the end of this year in the first stage of the plan.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan while answering
interpellations from lawmakers, including Yunlin County Legislator
Hsu Su-po of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Hsu suggested that the projected revenue from a planned release
of 18 percent of the CPC stocks should be excluded from the CPC's
fiscal 1999 budget since the company cannot carry out its first stage
release of 15 percent of its shares in fiscal 1998 as planned.</P>
      <P>In his reply, Pan said his company is trying to speed up its
privatization program, and is hopeful that the Economic Committee of
the Legislative Yuan will approve its budget.</P>
      <P>He noted that petrochemical products produced by CPC's rival
Formosan Plastics Corp. will enter the market, while liquefied
natural gas and aviation fuel will be opened to free import starting
in January next year, pointing out that if the privatization of CPC
is held up and the company has to compete as a state-run enterprise,
it will face difficulties in coping with the new market environment.</P>
      <P>Under the privatization plan, Pan said, the CPC will release at
least 50 percent of its stocks. He added that in addition to the 15
percent of shares in the first stage of the plan, the CPC will try to
seek strategic investors from abroad, offering an additional 12 to 18
percent of its stocks.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The governor of the Republic of China's
central bank on Tuesday demanded that the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) change the ROC's current membership designation back to its
original name.</P>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Governor Peng Huai-nan made the
demand in a meeting with ADB Chairman Mitsuo Sato, who expressed his
concern over the demand but gave his word that he will try to meet
the demand at the proper time.</P>
      <P>The ADB changed the ROC's official designation to "Taipei, China"
when mainland China was admitted to the financial body in 1986.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a founder member of the international organization,
rejected the change and has since attended ADB meetings under
protest. It reasons that the name change is particularly unacceptable
as Hong Kong will attend the upcoming ADB meeting as "Hong Kong,
China."</P>
      <P>This development can be equated with a downgrading of the ROC to
a status similar to that of Hong Kong, which since July 1, 1997, has
been a special administration region of mainland China, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Peng told Sato that the ROC's efforts to win back its formal ADB
name will not stop until its goal is achieved.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the CBC governor also disclosed that his
country is very willing to cooperate with the ADB and other ADB
members on the work of resolving the Asian financial crises.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC's sincerity in this regard can been
illustrated by the fact that Taiwan banks have been purchasing the
ADB-guaranteed government bonds Thailand has released to speed up its
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>The 1998 ADB meeting will open on Wednesday in Geneva,
Switzerland, and Peng arrived here at the head of a 12-member
delegation on Monday for the three-day conference, where they will
join discussions on the Asian financial turmoil which broke out in
mid-1997.</P>
      <P>The Manila-headquartered ADB is the only official international
organization in which the Republic of China holds a seat.</P>

scheduled to deliver a speech at Beijing University on May 5 as part
of the celebrations marking the 100th anniversary of the prestigious

      <P>Lee, the 1986 Nobel laureate in chemistry, will make the speech
in his capacity as president of the Academia Sinica, sources from the

      <P>Lee, 62, was elected head of the organization by a 50-member
Academia Sinica council in December 1993.</P>
      <P>This will be Lee's second visit to mainland China in three years.
He visited Fujian Province in 1995 on an academic exchange program.</P>
      <P>To celebrate its centennial, Beijing University has invited some

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN VOLUNTEERS TO REDUCE TUNA FISHING IN ATLANTIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, in line with an international
consensus for a gradual reduction in tuna fishing, has decided to cut
its quota on tuna for 1998 as part of the effort to conserve the
world's resources of this staple ocean product.</P>
      <P>Officials from the cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
said Taiwan has recently volunteered to reduce its 1998 quota of
albacore tuna by more than 2,600 metric tons to a maximum of 16,140
metric tons.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, South Africa, Brazil and Namibia are the four major
fishers of albacore in the South Atlantic, with Taiwan commanding the
majority of all albacore fishing in those waters.</P>
      <P>The International Commission of Conservation of Albacore Tuna
(ICCAT) recently met and acknowledged a Taiwan proposal of a
voluntary reduction on albacore fishing by 2,649 metric tons to a
tune of 16,140 metric tons for 1998, said officials from the COA
Fisheries Department.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan quota constitutes 73.36 percent of the total amount of
22,000 metric tons that the ICCAT agreed to be harvested by the four
major albacore fishers in the South Atlantic Ocean in 1998, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>The ICCAT is a group comprising 40-odd economies on the rim of
the Atlantic Ocean that was established in 1965 to further the cause
of the conservation of albacore in the South Atlantic.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, the ICCAT has urged a gradual reduction in the
fishing of albacore, suggesting that the harvesting of this specific
kind of tuna should not exceed 22,000 metric tons annually.</P>
      <P>The ICCAT said the stocks of albacore in the South Atlantic would
be maintained at an adequate level under the retrenchment initiative.
Under the effort, the annual quota on albacore could hopefully be
raised to 24,000 metric tons by 2005, said the officials.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, a major fisher of albacore in the South Atlantic, at one
time harvested up to 28,000 metric tons of the fish per year. Taiwan
fishing boats began to cut back on their catch in 1993 in response to
an ICCAT call for conservation efforts, gradually reducing its
fishing volume to 18,789 metric tons last year.</P>
      <P>Albacore is one of the many tuna species in oceans across the
globe. While Taiwan fishing boats are major fishers of albacore,
other types of tuna are favored elsewhere. Japanese fishing boats,
for example, are major anglers of big eye tuna and yellow fin tuna in
the South Atlantic, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Taiwan tuna fishing boats caught some 55,000 metric tons
of tuna worth NT$3 billion (US$90.9 million) in the Pacific, Indian
and South Atlantic oceans.</P>

quick repatriation.</P>
      <P>Lin Kunghui, 26, weakened by gastric cancer that has reached its
final stage, was carried on a stretcher by paramedics to the
helicopter prepared by the Hsinchu police Wednesday morning and was
flown to Matsu, from where he will be returned to mainland China by

      <P>Lin sneaked into Taiwan last year on a Fujian fishing boat after
paying some 20,000 mainland Chinese yuan (US$2,420) to a
human-smuggling ring.</P>
      <P>Lin, who is in great pain from his illness, told reporters that
he has "a little bit of regret" over his illegal entry into Taiwan.

      <P>US President Bill Clinton and mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin are not expected to sign a joint

forthcoming meeting in June, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, the head of the MAC,
the highest-level government agency charting Taiwan's policy toward
the mainland, said Clinton and Jiang are likely to issue a joint
statement during their June summit, but added that a joint communique
concerning the "three noes" issues -- no US arms sales to Taiwan, no
US support for Taiwan's independence movement and no support for
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations -- is highly unlikely.</P>
      <P>It is widely believed that mainland China will use the occasion
of the second Clinton-Jiang meeting to push the United States to sign
a formal accord on the above-mentioned "three noes" issues. Clinton
and Jiang met for the first time in October, 1997.</P>
      <P>Chang expressed the belief that the United States and mainland
China will not ink such an accord, as it would greatly jeopardize
Taiwan's interests and threaten the security of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>ROC government representative offices across the United States
have maintained close contacts with the US side, and will continue to

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS AND BEIJING'S RESPONSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Yuan, the governor of mainland
China's State Development Bank, told a seminar held by the Asian
Development Bank in Geneva Tuesday that up till now, Beijing has
"successfully fended off the Asian financial crisis."</P>
      <P>Chen cited many figures to back up his statement. Mainland
China's GDP has grown by 7.2 percent in the first quarter this year,
he said. Inflation continues to be kept at low level. The retail
price index has declined by 1.7 percent in the first quarter this
year, while the consumer price index has risen a slight 0.3 percent
over the same period. Foreign trade has continued to run a surplus of
US$10.5 billion in the first quarter this year.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's capital inflow has maintained growth momentum,
with contractual and actual foreign capital inflow registering a
growth of 6.8 percent and 2.2 percent in the first two months of this
year, respectively, according to Chen. Moreover, he said, the foreign
exchange reserve keeps rising and the exchange rate of the yuan has
remained stable.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Asian financial crisis that broke out in Thailand
last July and has swept Indonesia, South Korea and other countries
has also, to varying degrees, affected Hong Kong, Malaysia and the
Philippines. Hong Kong, whose currency has successfully withstood
pressure to devalue, is an exception in the area, where most other
currencies have experienced sharp declines in value, he said.</P>
      <P>In response to currency devaluation, the economies in the area
have followed one another in raising domestic interest rates, which
has in turn caused stock markets to plummet and economies to slide
into recession, he said.</P>
      <P>There are some good lessons to be drawn from the current
financial crisis, Chen said. "First, excessive intervention from
government must be avoided. Second, prudential regulation and
oversight should go ahead of financial liberalization. Third,
economic activities must be prevented from booming into bubble at any
cost. Fourth, a country should adjust its economic structure before
it is forced to do so."</P>
      <P>The State Development Bank head said that Beijing has responded
to the financial crisis in a responsible manner. On one hand,
mainland China has on many occasions made solemn promises not to
devalue its currency. On the other hand, Beijing has taken the
initiative in stimulating domestic demand, deepening reform and
continuing its opening policy, he said.</P>
      <P>To attain above targets, Chen said, Beijing intends to adopt the
following measures. First, domestic demand will be stimulated through
nurturing new economic powerhouses. Second, prudential regulation and
oversight over the financial system will be further strengthened.
Third, equilibrium in balance of payment and stability in the
exchange rate will be maintained. Fourth, the policy of opening up in
the economic field will continue to be upheld.</P>
      <P>He said he is confident that as long as countries in Asia take
serious measures to address economic weaknesses and adhere to reform,
they will soon be lifted out of their current difficulties and resume
rapid growth.</P>
      <P>Other speakers in the ADB seminar were E. Gerals Corrigan,
managing director of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.; Narongchai Akrasanee, an
economic expert from Thailand; P. Chidambaram, member of the Indian
Parliament; S. Ghon Rhee, resident scholar of the Asian Development
Bank; and Professor Hans Genberg of the Graduate Institute of
International Studies of Geneva.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As part of the agreements reached at a
summit last October between US President Bill Clinton and mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, a direct telecommunications link
between the two heads of state is expected to be in place before
their next meeting in June.</P>
      <P>Confirming that the line will be connected within the next two
months, a US official said Tuesday that "direct link" would be a more
suitable term than "hot line" because the latter has "the kind of
connotations that are not appropriate in this case."</P>
      <P>Nor will there be a bright red telephone set on either side of
the line, as sometimes depicted in movies. Rather, the link is there
just to provide a means of direct contact between the two heads of
state.</P>
      <P>"The United States and China have a very important relationship,"
the official said. "It is important that the two presidents have easy
access to each other and it doesn't have to happen only when there is
a crisis."</P>
      <P>Clinton is known to have called other world leaders, such as the
British prime minister and the Russian president, but the official
said that it is difficult to draw any parallel between these
connections.</P>
      <P>US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is due in Beijing on
Wednesday to prepare for Clinton's state visit.</P>

      <P>Canada's Minister of Heritage Sheila Copps
said Tuesday that Canadian culture must be protected in the face of
the growing new international media.</P>
      <P>Copps recently concluded two days of meetings with
representatives of major cultural organizations in hopes of working
out a strategy that will ensure a strong Canadian presence in the

      <P>Referring to the new media, she said regulation is not the
answer. The government's role should be to provide support for
culture, she added.</P>
      <P>John Tory, head of Rogers Media, a cable giant, said three things
are needed from the government.</P>
      <P>"The first is to make it easier for people to find financing to
produce a greater quantity of Canadian content," Tory said.</P>
      <P>"The second is to ensure ... that Canadians will be able to find
that Canadian content online and in computer stores," he pointed out.
He stressed that there's also a need for more people to produce
Canadian-content programs.</P>
      <P>It's habitual for the Canadian government to consult a wide range
of people when mapping out a policy. Copps was collecting industry

    <DATELINE>Singapore,   April  29  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's manufacturing output
continued growing for the second consecutive month this year, up by
8.5 percent in March.</P>
      <P>The year-on-year growth was due partly to last year's low base
and growth of 31.8 percent in the chemicals sector, the Singapore
Economic Development Board (EDB) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The March tally lifted growth for the first quarter to an average
of 6.1 percent, with growth in February at 16.5 percent and January's
level falling a revised 5.1 percent -- down further from a sharp
revision to 4.9 percent last month from an initial 3.9 percent drop.</P>
      <P>The engineering cluster also turned in double-digit growth
figures for March and the first quarter.</P>
      <P>But output of the electronics cluster -- the mainstay of the
manufacturing sector -- grew only 4.5 percent in March and 4.6
percent in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>This was because over-supply, weak demand and relocation of
producers affected the output of disk drives, pagers and consumer
electronics, the EDB said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the output of printers and assembled printed
circuit boards was higher.</P>
      <P>The chemicals sector powered ahead to expand 14.7 percent in the
first quarter. The strong growth in pharmaceuticals, petroleum and
petrochemicals was due mainly to increased production capacity
resulting from plant expansion and the entry of new firms, said the
board.</P>
      <P>Production of industrial and specialty chemicals shrank 2.3
percent in March after 5.3 percent growth in the previous month.</P>
      <P>All segments of the engineering cluster -- precision, process and
transport -- grew, contributing to the sector's 11.5 percent growth
in March and 13.3 percent for the first quarter, the EDB said.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In light of a sharp surge in traffic
accidents caused by drunk drivers, the transportation authorities are
planning to impose heavier penalties on those who are caught drinking
and driving more than twice in a year.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) said on Wednesday that the fine will double from the current
NT$12,000 (US$364) to NT$24,000 for such repeat offenders.</P>
      <P>The MOTC is also considering canceling the driver's licenses of
repeat offenders for good, instead of only suspending the permits for
six months.</P>
      <P>Another planned strategy aimed at stemming automobile accidents
resulting from drinking and driving is to extend the compulsory
lecture on traffic safety to one day from the current four hours, the
MOTC spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added that the MOTC is also planning to introduce a
zero-tolerance policy under which a driver whose breath is tested as
containing any alcohol at all will be given a traffic ticket.</P>
      <P>The number of alcohol-related traffic accidents in Taipei City is
four-and-a-half times higher now than before the five-day workweek
system was enacted at the beginning of this year, according to Taipei
transportation authorities, who had raised the cry to impose harsher
penalties on those who drive under the influence of alcohol.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Taipei Bureau of Transportation said that the
bureau has decided to extend the traffic safety lectures in the near
future because it is convinced that this can lead some offenders to
follow the rules in the future.</P>
      <P>According to latest MOTC statistics, alcohol was a factor in 10.9
percent of all traffic accidents last year, with 11 percent of
alcohol-related accidents resulting in fatalities and 13.1 percent
resulting in injuries.</P>
      <P>These figures show that drinking and driving is a major cause of
traffic accidents in Taiwan, the MOTC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US DEAL GIVES NEW LEASE ON LIFE TO FORMER AUSSIE SPACE TOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former leading Australian space town
gained a new lease on life when a leading US aerospace company signed
a 12-year agreement to use the former rocket range at Woomera in
South Australia for commercial satellite launchings.</P>
      <P>Australia's Industry Minister John Moore and George Mueller,
former head of NASA's manned space flight program and now chief
executive officer of the Kistler Aerospace Corp., signed the
agreement under which about 2,000 communications satellites will be
launched at Woomera in the next five years.</P>
      <P>The new deal between the US space company and the Australian
government will not only revive the town of Woomera but also create
hundreds of jobs for Australians.</P>
      <P>Woomera was a boomtown in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was being
used as the British government's rocket testing site.</P>
      <P>At a signing ceremony Tuesday, Prime Minister John Howard said
the agreement will launch Australia into the space age.</P>
      <P>"This project will help position Australia alongside the United
States, Russia and China as the top countries in space and
communications technology," he said.</P>
      <P>Aerospace industry specialists believe there will be a huge
growth market for such commercial communications space technology in
coming years for Australia.</P>
      <P>Howard said the tests are expected to begin by the end of this
year, with the first commercial launch next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TING SHOU-CHUNG ANNOUNCES BID TO RUN FOR TAIPEI MAYORSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Ting Shou-chung of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) on Wednesday announced his bid to run for the
mayorship of Taiwan's capital city of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ting, an incumbent KMT legislator who is serving his third term
in the Legislative Yuan, urged his party in a written statement to
hold intraparty primaries to choose candidates for the year-end
mayoral races in Taipei and in the southern metropolis of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>However, he said he will enter the race only when the KMT holds
primaries, which he said is the only way to produce candidates
through transparent, fair and open elections.</P>
      <P>Ting, 44, holds a Ph.D. in international politics and diplomacy
from the Fletcher School of Law &amp; Diplomacy at Tufts University,
Boston. He was appointed by the KMT to head the party's affiliated
Department of Youth Affairs for two years between early 1996 and late
1997.</P>
      <P>In his statement, Ting said he is increasingly worried, as
election time is drawing nearer and the KMT has shown no sign that it
is ready to decide on its candidates.</P>
      <P>He said that technically speaking, the mayoral race, particularly
in Taipei, will decide the fate of the ruling party and consequently
the 2000 presidential election. The current mayor of Taipei is Chen
Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) camp,
while the Kaohsiung mayorship is held by Wu Den-yih of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Ting's announcement, KMT spokesperson Huang
Li-ching said the party has a "rounded and comprehensive" plan for
the elections and added that the nomination of candidates will be
conducted through "a well-defined process."</P>
      <P>Huang said that Ting, an outstanding scholar-turned-politician,
has already been nominated as a KMT candidate to run for a seat in
the Legislative Yuan. She described Ting as a "piece of jade,"
referring to his personal integrity and high caliber.</P>
      <P>However, she did not elaborate on whether the KMT will hold
intraparty primaries to choose the mayoral candidates, while Taipei
Mayor Chen declined to comment on Ting's announcement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG DAN DELIGHTS IN WEST'S MANY FREEDOMS, CHOICES: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  April  28  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Just a week ago, mainland China's No. 1
dissident had zero choices but now he can choose among prestigious US
universities, a major Canadian daily reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail, in a dispatch from New York, said the wooing
of Wang Dan is just part of his "great leap from the gulag to the
great big candy store of the West."</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Orville Schell, dean of the University of
California, who flew into New York to urge Wang to attend Berkeley,
as saying, "It's very difficult. What is Berkeley? What is Harvard?
What is Yale? What is Democrat? What is Republican? What is
Oldsmobile? What is Buick? It's a sort of pluralism gone mad."</P>
      <P>Wang, who just completed his first full week of freedom in the
United States, marveled at his wealth of choices, said the Mail's
former Beijing bureau chief Jan Wong, who interviewed Wang at New
York's exclusive Harvard Club.</P>
      <P>She said Wang went underground after being labeled by Beijing as
the most wanted student leader in the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations.
He was captured a month later on his way to a meeting with a Taiwan
journalist, she added.</P>
      <P>After serving three-and-a-half years, he was released a few
months early, but was rearrested in 1995 and sentenced to 11 years.
Among his crimes: enrolling in a correspondence course at the
University of California at Berkeley. Wang said he was never afraid
because he knew he was right, Wong reported.</P>
      <P>"The government might have the instruments of dictatorship, like
jails, but I knew they couldn't change my thinking," he told the
Mail.</P>
      <P>He did cry, though, when his mother was jailed for 50 days for
speaking on his behalf, the Mail reported. He said he accepted
"medical parole" only because he couldn't bear his parents making the
grueling 10-hour journey on jammed Chinese trains each month to visit
him in prison, it noted.</P>
      <P>On April 17, prison officials told Wang he would be exiled in 18
hours. His parents, who happened to be on one of their visits, were
also notified. Then Wang was driven through the night to Beijing in
an 11-car procession.</P>
      <P>"Cruelly, he sat wedged between two prison guards, in a separate
car from his parents and his older sister, before boarding a flight
to Detroit. His father, who had nothing ready to give, slipped off
his watch and gave it to his son," Wong reported.</P>
      <P>Wang arrived in Detroit penniless. "I still haven't got a cent in
my pocket," he told Wong Monday. In Detroit, he was issued a one-year
tourist visa.</P>
      <P>When Wang embraced his parents for the last time, they urged him
to study hard. That will be his priority, he told Wong. He added that
he will always fight for democracy, in part because he feels "moral
guilt" over the hundreds, perhaps thousands, who died at Tiananmen
Square.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISSIDENT SAID DETAINED PRIOR TO BEIJING UNIVERSITY CENTENARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwan-chun and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Youcai, a mainland Chinese
dissident from Zhejiang Province, disappeared on Monday from his
Beijing hotel amid signs that he has been detained by the Beijing
public security police to prevent him from attending celebration
activities to mark the centenary of Beijing University, which falls
on May 4th.</P>
      <P>The information was announced in a Tuesday press release from the
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and the Democratic
Movement in China</P>
      <P>Wang, a former graduate student in the Physics Department of the
university, was dismissed by the university for his part in the
pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, but
received nevertheless an invitation to the centennial celebrations,
according to the press release.</P>
      <P>Wang left his home in Hangzhou City for Beijing on April 25, but
as soon as he arrived, he was tailed wherever he went by two local
public security service vehicles, according to his friend Cheng Fan,
who is also a Beijing University alumnus.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who had agreed to meet Wang on Tuesday to visit another
leader of the student pro-democracy movement, went to Wang's hotel
--Tianfu Restaurant--when he failed to appear as planned, where an
employee told him that someone checked out for Wang on Monday
evening, taking his luggage with him. He has not been seen since.</P>
      <P>Beijing University was the hothouse and center of the mainland
pro-democracy movement in 1989, the information center press release
said, adding that over a hundred students have been arrested since
the June 4th Tiananmen demonstration, among whom 21 have been listed
as criminals wanted by the Beijing authorities, and seven of whom are
students from Beijing University.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that more than 30,000 alumni will be attending
the centennial celebrations, and the information center postulated
that the Beijing authorities are so worried that the celebrations may
turn into political activities that they have arrested Wang as a form
of preemptive insurance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOUNTAINS OF CONTAINERS CHOKING AUSSIE PORTS AS DOCK DISPUTE REMAINS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mountains of containers are now choking
major ports across Australia as the waterfront dispute remains
unsolved and shipping industry sources predict delayed shipments will
continue with ships and cargo queuing at terminals, waiting to be
loaded and unloaded.</P>
      <P>They said at least 11,000 containerized cargoes are now choking
Australia's major ports, locking up an estimated US$330 million worth
of goods and extending delays at picket-free wharves to four days.</P>
      <P>Liner Shipping Services (LSS), which represents more than half of
Australia's shippers, has warned that the backlog will take weeks to
clear even in the event of a speedy resolution of the current dock
dispute between Patrick Stevedores, the Australian government and the
Maritime Union of Australia (MUA).</P>
      <P>Richard Hein, managing director of the dispute-free rival P&amp;O
Ports, the biggest stevedoring firm in Australia, said his company's
terminals are under heavy strain because of extra business
sub-contracted from Patrick Stevedores.</P>
      <P>Delays in Melbourne and Sydney are up to four days, while similar
delays in other major ports are between one and two days, he said.</P>
      <P>"I think everybody's extremely nervous at the moment about
ensuring they get their goods. I think a lot of them are quite
relieved when they know they're going to our terminals and not to
Patrick's," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>P&amp;O Ports now handles up to 30 percent more in volume terms and
has increased its share of stevedoring volume to 70-75 percent from
the previous 50-55 percent.</P>
      <P>Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. is one of the shipping companies
affected by the prolonged waterfront dispute in Australia.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA Wednesday, Frank Chang, Yang Ming's
representative in Sydney, said it will take about two months to clear
all the containers.</P>
      <P>"But, for the time being, the mountains of containers are choking
the ports, causing a long queue for both export and import cargoes to
be loaded or unloaded," he said.</P>
      <P>He said many shippers and shipping companies are getting worried
because they do not know when their cargoes will be loaded or
unloaded at major ports.</P>
      <P>"It's now very difficult for us to calculate the amount of cargo
to be loaded or unloaded thanks to such long queues. We don't know
when it's our turn for either loading or unloading of our cargo until
the last day," he said.</P>
      <P>Previously they knew the schedule of the cargo handling at major
ports several days in advance so that they could make precise
arrangements, he added.</P>
      <P>He said the long queues cause additional costs at the terminals
but that there are also other extra costs, including transportation,
because truck drivers now have to wait much longer at the ports
before loading or unloading their goods.</P>
      <P>"The waiting time was only about one hour before the waterfront
dispute, but now it could be as long as four to five hours," he said.
"This long wait costs money and increases additional costs for
shippers."</P>
      <P>He said Yang Ming, like other shipping companies plying routes
between Australia and other countries, has to bear the additional
cost of mooring their ships in Australian ports while waiting for the
delivery of goods for both export and import.</P>
      <P>"All these operating costs borne by shipping companies and
exporters and importers are difficult to estimate now," he said.</P>
      <P>Patrick said the 11,000 stranded containers include medical
equipment and supplies, manufactured goods, textiles, clothing and
footwear, fresh produce, electrical goods, and some personal
belongings.</P>
      <P>LSS CEO Llew Russell estimated the stockpile, mainly composed of
imports, is worth from US$270 million to US$330 million.</P>
      <P>He said the mounting costs of the blockade by the MUA at major
ports in the past two weeks has yet to be calculated.</P>
      <P>In addition to additional costs, changes of documentation for
both imported and exported goods have to be made because those
cargoes originally handled at the Patrick terminals have to be
shifted to P&amp;O docks.</P>
      <P>There are also other details to be worked out, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"We are facing considerable chaos in many operations as a result
of the waterfront problem in Australia," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>15 MAINLAND CHINESE STOWAWAYS ARRESTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Freeway police on Wednesday arrested 15
stowaways from mainland China at toll stations in Yuanlin, Houli and
Tounan townships in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Police said they received reports in the early hours that four
taxis carrying people behaving in a suspicious manner were driving
north towards Taipei on the freeway.</P>
      <P>The taxis were stopped at the toll booths and the occupants
questioned, leading to the discovery that the passengers had all been
recently smuggled onto the island from mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to the police, the illegals said they boarded a vessel
in Pingtan, Fujian Province, on Monday, at a cost of 29,000 renminbi
per head, arriving at the southern Taiwan port of Tungshi in Chiayi
County early on Wednesday morning, where they were picked up by taxis
which had been prearranged to drive them to Taipei.</P>
      <P>The police said they are investigating whether there is an
organized smuggling ring behind the case.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the mainland authorities in the coastal province
of Fujian show that provincial law enforcement personnel cracked a
total of 261 smuggling cases in 1997, leading to the arrest of 2,365
people, including so-called "snakeheads" and stowaways. "Snakehead"
is the name given to those who organize and engage in human
smuggling.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that most mainland stowaways tend to
land in Kinmen and Matsu, two of Taiwan's offshore territories near
Fujian.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is regarded by many mainland Chinese as a land of milk and
honey where work is easy to find and pay is high.</P>

      <P>In line with an agreement signed with
mainland China to jointly crack down on crime, Taiwan on Wednesday
repatriated one mainland Chinese and took delivery of two local men
wanted in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Red Cross Society officials met their mainland

27-year-old native of Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that his fraud case stemmed from a debt dispute
which has already been resolved, he added that after learning that he
was wanted in Taiwan, he took the initiative and reported to the
mainland authorities because he wanted to return to Taiwan to clear
his name. Lin also denied any involvement in fraud.</P>
      <P>Lin and Chang were later escorted onto a plane bound for Taiwan,

      <P>Ye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in Taiwan for his

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND VISIT SAID TO PAVE WAY FOR TAIPEI MAYOR'S MEETING WITH JIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Jui-tu, a Taipei City councilor with
the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said on
Wednesday that a recent visit to mainland China by a former Taipei
City government official was aimed at secretly arranging a mainland
visit for Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>In addition to exchanging opinions on bilateral cultural
exchanges, the main purpose of the recent mainland visit by Lo
Wen-chia, former director of the city government's Department of
Information, was to pave the way for Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian to
visit mainland China and meet mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
as well as seeking to build a channel for communication between the
two men in case Chen becomes president in future, Lin claimed at a
news conference.</P>
      <P>Citing information provided by a Taiwan businessmen's association
in mainland China, Lin said Lo departed from the United States for
Hong Kong on April 2 and then proceeded to Beijing the next day,
where he met with Yen Sheng-pang, a research fellow with the Taipei
Culture Foundation who accompanied him on a series of visits there.</P>
      <P>Lin alleged that Lo and Yen secretly met Wang Daohan and Tang
Shubei, chairman and vice chairman respectively of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), and top
negotiators with Taiwan, on April 12. The two men also visited Chen
Yunlin of the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs on April 18 for
discussions on Taiwan investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Lo was originally planning to meet Ding
Guangen, former head of the United Front Work Department and
currently a Politburo member, and Wang Zhaoguo, former director of
the Central Office for Taiwan Affairs and now United Front Work
Department head. However, Lo's low rank denied him a meeting with the
two mainland heavyweights.</P>
      <P>In addition to his allegations that Lo was acting as Chen's
secret envoy, Lin also claimed that Lo and Yen used money allocated
by the Taipei Culture Foundation, which is run by the city
government, to pay for their trip.</P>
      <P>While Chen had no comments to make regarding the allegations, Lin
Ching-chang, incumbent director of the city government's information
department, denied Lin Jui-tu's allegations and said the mayor was
unaware of Lo's recent activities.</P>
      <P>Calling Lo's mainland trip a "personal visit," he said the
information which Lin Jui-tu obtained was "untrue," and added that
Chen had no knowledge of the matter until reading about it in local
newspapers.</P>
      <P>Lo, who went to the mainland in his capacity as a visiting
researcher with Stanford University in the United States, did not use
the foundation's money to pay for the trip, and Yen went there only
to conduct personal academic research, Lin claimed.</P>

      <P>A powered glider, or ultralight, was
forced to land in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County on Wednesday
morning due to engine failure, causing minor injuries to the two men
on board.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung-based Feihao Communications-owned craft was flying
over Chiuju Township when the engine failed, forcing it to land in a
parking lot, where it hit several vehicles.</P>
      <P>Feihao Communications was commissioned by Taiwan Area National
Expressway Engineering Bureau (TANEEB) under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to render a bird's-eye view
of the Second Highway in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pilot Hu Chin-chi and his passenger, computer artist Chen
Cheng-feng, received minor injuries but their conditions were later
described as satisfactory following medical attention. The ultralight
also sustained damage.</P>
      <P>In light of the accident, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) announced on Wednesday that ultralights are
considered to be aircraft, and that operating them without a license
is against the law and punishable by a NT$600,000 to NT$3 million
fine.</P>
      <P>Additional CAA regulations regarding ultralights stipulate that
the craft may not tow objects or throw objects overboard during
flight, and that they are not to be used for aerial photography or
filming.</P>
      <P>The CAA said that because the certification and site regulations
for ultralights are as stringent as those governing helicopters and
other types of aircraft, no company has ever received permission to
establish ultralight flight services.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Chang Chia-chu said the CAA is currently
investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash-landing.
Expressing mystification as to why TANEEB would commission a company
to carry out aerial photography using illegal means, he said that any

      <P>Chang made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan answering

      <P>Commenting on a suggestion by Beijing for a seminar on

negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chang also revealed that the MAC is planning a trip to the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan teenagers have become taller and
fatter in the past decade, according to a large-scale survey
presented by the Department of Health (DOH) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsu-kong, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
said teenagers today are on average four to six centimeters taller
and 2.5 kilograms heavier than they were 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Chen said changing lifestyles brought on by increased wealth in
Taiwan households see people eating better and exercising less,
resulting in a growing number of overweight people.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 2.1 million adults over age 19, or one in
seven Taiwan adults, are overweight. It is noteworthy that the
demographic groups most affected by the problem are middle-aged and
elderly women.</P>
      <P>One in eight Taiwan adults, or 1.8 million persons, have high
blood pressure and high fatty content in the blood. One in five, or
2.9 million persons, have high protein levels in their urine, and one
in 25, or 580,000 adults, have diabetes.</P>
      <P>This is the third and the largest survey to date examining the
nutritional situation in Taiwan. The DOH sampled 10,080 people
islandwide to obtain the results.</P>
      <P>Although the ratio of overweight persons in Taiwan still does not
equal that found in the United States, the number of overweight local
people has increased alarmingly, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also expressed concern over the rising incidence of diabetes,
high blood pressure and gout.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the public is much more conscious of the
importance of eating a balanced diet, the consumption of proteins and
fats has apparently been too high.</P>
      <P>Although calcium intakes have increased, reflecting a heightened

has yet to reach recommended daily allowances. The problem of calcium
deficiency is most serious among women below age 25.</P>
      <P>The consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol has increased

weight as they age, should do more exercise.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTMENTS ON MAINLAND DECLINE IN VALUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said
Wednesday that the investment projects of Taiwan businessmen on the
Chinese mainland are increasing in number but decreasing in terms of
value.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan answering
interpellations by Changhua County Legislator Hsieh Tsung-min from
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party who wanted to know about
the investment situation of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that, based on information gained from friends in
Japan, investments by Japanese businessmen on the mainland have
drastically reduced by about one-third. He suggested that this
development should serve to alert for Taiwan businessmen who are
eager to invest on the mainland.</P>
      <P>In his reply, Lin explained that the cumulative investments from
Taiwan businessmen on the mainland at present total nearly US$13
billion, and that the overall investment situation appears to be one
of more projects but decreasing sums of money. He said this shows
that most of the Taiwan investment projects there belong to small and
medium-scale enterprises.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that, in fact, there are signs that fewer foreign
investors are being attracted to the Chinese mainland. However, he
noted that there have been very few withdrawals of investments on the
mainland by Taiwan businessmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN 'COMFORT WOMEN' TO FILE SUIT IN JAPANESE COURT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A private women's group said Wednesday it
has decided to file suit against the Japanese government to demand
compensation for 45 women living in Taiwan who were forced into
prostitution by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation said it had been encouraged
by the recent victory of three so-called comfort women from South
Korea in a local Japanese local court. Accordingly, the foundation
said it has decided to bring demands for compensation by a group of
women from Taiwan to a Japanese court within one or two months. It
added that a Japanese lawyers association has promised to offer
assistance during the legal process.</P>
      <P>The Yamaguchi District Court in western Japan on Monday ordered
the Japanese government to pay 300,000 yen each to three of 10 South
Korean plaintiffs, who had demanded a total 564 million yen and an
official apology. But the court rejected the demand for an official
apology in the historic ruling that nevertheless forces the
government to pay compensation.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Wang Ching-feng, counselor with the Taipei Women's Rescue
Foundation, said the Japanese government's refusal to offer official
compensation to the 300-plus surviving comfort women living in
various Asian countries had prompted former sex slaves from South
Korea and the Philippines to file lawsuits in Japanese courts to
demand justice be served.</P>
      <P>Wang said the foundation has decided to follow suit and believes
it has a good chance of winning the case. Meanwhile, she revealed
that three more women have come to the foundation for help, bringing
the number of former comfort women living in Taiwan to 45. All three
women are in their 70s or 80s, Wang added.</P>
      <P>An estimated 200,000 young women, mostly from Korea, but also
from mainland China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Indonesia, were
forced to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese army during World War
II.</P>
      <P>In August 1996, the Japanese government set up a private "Asian
Women's Foundation" that provides the equivalent of NT$500,000 in
compensation to each surviving comfort woman who dares to step
forward and reveal her past. Most of the wartime sex slaves, however,
have refused to accept the compensation, saying that the money should
come directly from the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>The ROC government last year offered financial aid to help
improve the living conditions of the surviving comfort women, a move
prompted by nearly 10 years of concerted efforts by the Taipei
Women's Rescue Foundation as well as other groups. The Ministry of
Foreign Affairs paid NT$500,000 (US$15,873) to each of the 42 women
who have already applied for the funds.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly issued report has shown that
Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan are the top three places in Asia
suitable for foreign businessmen to reside.</P>
      <P>They were followed in descending order by Japan, Hong Kong,
Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, the Chinese mainland, Vietnam
and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The report, based on a survey conducted by a political and
economic risk consultant firm, pointed out that Taiwan has jumped
from its previous 7th place to 3rd place mainly because foreign
businessmen are satisfied with Taiwan's educational system and
comfortable about their personal safety.</P>
      <P>According to the report, several high-profile murder cases
occurring in Taiwan last year have raised concerns about rising crime
on the island. However, since the beginning of this year the law and
order situation has improved, causing foreign businessmen to regain
confidence about residing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some 400 overseas businessmen living in various regions around
Asia were interviewed in the survey. They were asked to comment on
the level of satisfaction regarding their living environment. The
survey was based on such categories as housing, schools and medical
systems, as well as leisure facilities.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong was ranked fifth in the survey, slipping from last
year's fourth place finish. Although foreign businessmen generally
consider Hong Kong's living conditions to be above average, they
expressed dissatisfaction with expensive rent costs, overcrowding and
environmental pollution.</P>

      <P>A group of economics officials from the
Republic of China arrived in Melbourne on Monday for a two-day
fact-finding tour to examine the privatization of electricity
stations in Victoria.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-yih, secretary-general of the Energy Commission of the

Trade, Investment Cooperation Consultations in Canberra on April 27.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming, the leader of the ROC

    <HEADLINE>DPP, KMT HOLD SIMILAR POSITIONS ON CRITICAL ISSUES: HSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen &amp; Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The visiting chairman of Taiwan's main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday that the
DPP's position on the issues of mainland relations and Taiwan
independence are not entirely opposed to those of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang stressed that his party will not
insist on holding a plebiscite on the Taiwan independence issue
unless the status quo across the Taiwan Strait changes due to
a military threat from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks while attending a roundtable seminar with
scholars and experts from political and economics circles at National
Australian University. The DPP's stances on cross-strait ties, Taiwan
independence and the Asian financial turmoil were the focus of
discussion at the gathering.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the KMT and the DPP share the same belief that
Taiwan is an independent sovereign state. But he added that the
difference between the parties is that the KMT insists on the
existence of "two Chinas," while the DPP believes in "one China, one
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The pro-independence party leader stressed that when the DPP
takes the reins of power, it will not announce the independence of
Taiwan to provoke mainland China, adding that maintaining the status
quo across the Taiwan Strait is the best way to maintain peace in the
strait, he said.</P>
      <P>On the "one country, two systems" scheme proposed by Beijing as a
paradigm for national reunification, Hsu said that the concept is
totally unacceptable to Taiwan. Saying Taiwan is not Hong Kong, Hsu
pointed out that Taiwan has been separated from the mainland for over
100 years and has developed "an identity as a new country."</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibility of the two sides improving their
relations by way of forming a commonwealth or federation, Hsu said
that such a proposition is not feasible at the current stage, but
added it may be workable in 50 or 100 years.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that maintaining the status quo and promoting
dialogue with the mainland is the best way to reduce tension across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TALKS SHOULD BE HELD BEFORE WINTER: KOO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The dialogue between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should resume before the winter of this year, Koo
Chen-fu, Taipei's top negotiator with Beijing, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), made the remarks on the 5th anniversary of his historic
meeting with mainland Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Koo said that the time has come for him to meet once again with
Wang, chairman of Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait, following SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng's
trip to Beijing last week to make preparations for resumption of the
long-stalled talks.</P>
      <P>Koo said that the talks should take place before the winter and
that the content of such talks need not be confined to technical
discussions.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that in every previous cross-strait consultation,
the two sides have never been far away from touching upon political
issues. He cited as examples past discussions on fishery disputes and
the repatriation of hijackers.</P>
      <P>Koo reiterated that he would not shy away from any issue, noting
that Premier Vincent Siew has also said that the SEF and the ARATS
can discuss any issue related to peaceful development across the
Taiwan Strait and the eventual unification of China under the
principle of democracy.</P>
      <P>On ARATS' suggestion that Koo and Wang meet in seminar forum, Koo
said he personally would not oppose to the idea, but added that a
seminar would demand preparations lasting six months or longer to set
the agenda, venue and guest list.</P>
      <P>He also said that if the mainland China could arrange for him to
meet with President Jiang Zemin or Premier Zhu Rongji, he would be
delighted to do so. But he said such an arrangement could not be part
of the cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang held an ice-breaking rendezvous in Singapore on
April 22-29, 1993. During the landmark meeting, the two sides laid a
framework for regular dialogues and contacts between the two
intermediary bodies.</P>
      <P>That initiative became stalled when the mainland side suspended
further contact following a visit to the United States by ROC
President Lee Teng-hui in June 1995, which Beijing viewed as a veiled
attempt to seek Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GENETIC DIETS SEEN AS NEXT WEAPON AGAINST FAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, April 29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Genetic diets may become the next weapon
to fight against fat, according to a senior nutritionist from New
Zealand.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Dieticians Association conference in Sydney this
week, Prof. Jim Mann, head of the Department of Human Nutrition at
the University of Otago, said that in the 21st century, the "balanced
diet" may be individually tailored to a person's genes.</P>
      <P>He said genes affect the way our bodies react to fat and
determine the sort of diet we should follow.</P>
      <P>The genetic link could also help explain why some ethnic groups
achieve lower rates of heart disease with a diet which does not
benefit other ethnic groups, he said.</P>
      <P>Mann predicted that genetic tests to devise the tailored diets
may be available "within five to 10 years whereby we can identify
people by means of their genetic make-up."</P>
      <P>He said genes determine the action of enzymes, which in turn
determine individual metabolisms.</P>
      <P>Daily exercise is also important in controlling body weight, Mann
noted.</P>
      <P>The nutritionist cited a study by Prof. Robert Kushner from the
School of Medicine at the University of Chicago as an example.</P>
      <P>He said Kushner believes doing 30 minutes of exercise daily is
not enough to control body weight. He suggested that to keep weight
off, people need 80 minutes of moderate exercise or 35 minutes of
vigorous physical activity daily.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Activity at a textile factory in northern
Taiwan returned to normal early Thursday following an outbreak of
pandemonium involving a group of workers from Thailand, police said.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi, president of the Hualon-Teijran factory in Toufen,
Hsinchu, said the row started after clashes between disgruntled
laborers and the security guards at the plant. Several off-duty
workers had asked for permission to go to a karaoke club at around 11
p.m., in defiance of regulations prohibiting them from leaving the
premises after 10:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>Over a hundred Thai laborers then converged outside the dormitory
at the plant complex, and began throwing bricks, bottles, furniture
and other items.</P>
      <P>As the Thais continued the noisy protest, the area was thrown
into pandemonium. Scores of Toufen police mobilized to the scene took
no action for fear of fueling the workers' already-tense emotions.</P>
      <P>Police cordoned off roads leading to the plant and asked
ambulances to stand by in case of an emergency.</P>
      <P>General manager Wang said there had been no problems between
labor and management at the plant, nor had there been any
communication barriers with the Thai workers.</P>
      <P>He said that the situation at local karaoke establishments is
unpredictable, and that the factory's workers are discouraged from
going to such places out of concern for their safety.</P>
      <P>Police said the Hualon factory in Toufen employs over 1,000 Thai
laborers, and there no record of negligence or improper conduct on
the part of the plant's management.</P>
      <P>They also noted that the Hualon facility has a reputation of
being a model factory for foreign labor management, saying the
incident appears to be an isolated case.</P>
      <P>After emergency talks with the Thai laborers, tensions eventually
subsided and the protest broke up at around 1:30 am.</P>
      <P>Hualon management vowed Thursday to continue discussions with the

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIA INTERESTED IN COOPERATING ON NUKE WASTE DISPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiations with Russia on the storage in
that country of low-grade radioactive waste disposal from Taiwan are
going smoothly, with an agreement expected shortly, Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Chang Chang-pang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) is
working closely with the Russian Academy of Sciences on the plan. If
an agreement is forged, Taipower would ship low-grade radioactive
waste, including contaminated resin and temperature-resistant
materials, to Russia for permanent storage.</P>
      <P>The two sides reached a preliminary understanding whereby
Taipower will initially ship 5,000 barrels of the waste material to
Russia. If the operation proceeds smoothly, the volume can be
increased in subsequent shipments.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, Chang noted, the first shipment is expected to
be made as early as next year.</P>
      <P>Taipower President Kuo Junne-huey, however, denied Thursday that
the negotiations with Russia were "going smoothly." He said that, as
in ongoing talks with mainland China on a nuclear storage deal, are a
great number of "political obstacles" need to be tackled before any
accord is struck.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Taipower sources, the corporation's plan
to use a receptacle in North Korea for Taiwan's nuclear waste has
been shelved as a result of strong protests from South Korea. But
they said the company has not yet totally given up hope of future
cooperation with the North Koreans.</P>
      <P>Taipower sealed a contract with Pyongyang on Jan. 11, 1997, to
ship 60,000 barrels of low-grade radioactive waste to North Korea
over a two-year period for permanent storage.</P>
      <P>Pyongyang first contacted Taipower in 1996, offering a parcel of
land near a North Korean seaport to Taipower for use as a receptacle.</P>
      <P>The North Korean offer was viewed favorably by Taipower for the
reasonable price, not-too-distant location and the convenience of not
needing to pass through a third country for the shipments.</P>
      <P>That arrangement, however, sparked a storm of protests from
Seoul, which hinted that attempts to go ahead with the shipments
could trigger a conflict on the high seas. South Korea also claimed
the United States had been "hoodwinked" into not trying to block the
Taipower-Pyongyang deal.</P>
      <P>According to knowledgeable sources, US authorities consequently
began to exert pressure on Taiwan's diplomatic arms, asking Taipei to
cease the related efforts--causing the Taipower-Pyongyang contract to
be shelved indefinitely.</P>
      <P>After North Korea threatened to file a complaint with the
International Court saying Taipower had reneged on the deal, Taipower
officials said the company will seek to compensate Pyongyang in
"other ways."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipower has never given up the possibility of
cooperating with mainland China or the Marshall Islands on a storage
deal, although relevant talks have hit snags over a wide variety of
problems, the sources disclosed.</P>
      <P>Once Taipower is completely privatized, they said, it will stand
a better chance of engaging in direct talks with local authorities in
charge of the five existing nuclear waste dumps across mainland China
for a cross-border storage plan.</P>
      <P>At home, Taipower is also trying to persuade residents in
offshore Hsiaowuchiu and Hsiaolanyu to allow those areas to be used
as receptacle sites.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, if Hsiaowuchiu is indeed developed into a
storage location, the islet, located near mainland China's Fujian
Province, will be capable of accommodating nuclear waste from Taiwan
for 100 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND OUTPERFORMS TAIWAN ON EXPORTS TO EUROPE, US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a relative depreciation of the New
Taiwan dollar against the renminbi, Taiwan has not seen a
corresponding rise in competitiveness with exports from mainland
China, according to an ROC government report.</P>
      <P>A study on the impact of the Asian financial meltdown upon the
trade performance of countries in the region was released Wednesday
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA). It indicates that
mainland exports to Europe rose by 35 percent in the first three
months of this year as compared with the same period of 1997, while a
14 percent growth was seen in shipments to the United States.</P>
      <P>During the January-March period, Taiwan's exports to these areas
posted only modest rises of 3.9 percent and 2.2 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said the performance should serve as a warning to
Taiwan's export sector.</P>
      <P>The MOEA report also indicated that mainland China has been
seeing falling export figures since the second half of last year,
when the financial storm began to batter the Asian area.</P>
      <P>Mainland exports began to shrink in early 1997, dropping from
26.2 percent growth in the first half of that year to a combined 17.1
percent in the third and fourth quarters. The downward trend
continued with a lackluster 12.8 percent rise in the first quarter of
1998, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The significant declines were attributed to reduced trade with
other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Feeling the economic pinch, most nations in the region
experienced scaled-back growth figures, downgraded financial ratings
and devalued currencies, which in turn resulted in severely reduced
import levels.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China emerged as the only Asian economy to
escape the problem of currency depreciation, it was nonetheless
caught up in the regional financial crisis as cheaper exports from
neighboring countries took a large share of its foreign trade.</P>
      <P>The MOEA officials said the mainland's reduced export volume has
slowed the pace of its manufacturing sector, an essential factor
which might lead Beijing to lower its economic growth forecasts.</P>

Asian financial crisis relatively unscathed. At the same time, he
said, the ROC is very willing to assist South Korea and countries in
Southeast Asia in the midst of trying times.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the ROC is continuing to prosper
economically on Taiwan, and its progress in democratic governance has
been affirmed around the world. The people on Taiwan not only lead
prosperous lives, he said, they also enjoy an abundance of democracy
and freedom.</P>
      <P>Carlucci first visited Taiwan in May 1990 at the invitation of
the ROC government and attended President Lee's inauguration
ceremony. He said he is deeply impressed by the progress witnessed
here on his return visit and expressed highest regards for Lee's

      <P>The United States will observe its
promises on the issue of Taiwan, visiting US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright told mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan in a meeting on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Albright made the remark in response to Tang's statements during
the meeting that the Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive
question in the relationship between the United States and mainland
China and that he hopes all the commitments US leaders made in the
three joint communiques and joint declarations between Beijing and
Washington will be honored.</P>
      <P>Albright's current trip to mainland China is aimed at paving the
road for US President Bill Clinton's late-June visit there.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Albright, Tang remarked that for the sake
of the long term interests of both the United States and mainland
China, Beijing hopes that relations between the two can be viewed and
handled with a strategic vision. He urged both sides to seek common
points and to narrow the gap between them in the spirit of seeking
common ground while reserving differences on the basis of equality
and mutual respect. He went further and touched the Taiwan issue,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN M'LAND HIT BY FALLOUT OF ASIAN FINANCIAL STORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen with investments in the
mainland are reeling from the fallout of the Asian financial storm
that began its sweep through Asia in mid-1997, according to the China
External Trade Development Council (CETRA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials said that Taiwan businessmen in such
labor-intensive industries as garment making and shoemaking have seen
their orders cut by up to 30 percent.</P>
      <P>The officials said that to learn what impact the Asian financial
storm has had on Taiwan businessmen in the mainland, they recently
visited Beijing, Tianjin, Dalian, Shanghai, Guangzhou Shenzhen and
other major footholds of Taiwan investment to conduct a fact-finding
survey.</P>
      <P>They found that Taiwan businessmen investing in labor-intensive
industries have suffered various degrees of order losses due to steep
competition from South Korea and Southeast Asian nations.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwan businessmen in the knitting and
garment industries have had their export orders to Japan cut by 30
percent due to competition from South Korea, and that orders for
leather goods and handbags are down 20 percent due to competition
from Southeast Asian nations.</P>
      <P>Shoemaking and peripheral product manufacturing for the
downstream information industry are also reeling from the financial
woes in the Southeast Asian region, showing drastic declines and
losses of orders.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials said that European and American buyers have
emerged as the biggest winners in the latest wave of financial
troubles. Taiwan businessmen have not only suffered drastic declines
in orders but also been forced to cut their prices.</P>
      <P>The officials urged Taiwan businessmen not to put all their eggs
in one basket, saying they should try to cut their risks by
diversifying their investments and keeping their roots in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US AND JAPAN AMEND LOGISTICS AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pentagon announced Tuesday that
the United States and Japan have signed an amendment to a bilateral
agreement on reciprocal provision of logistics support between the
Japan Self-Defense Forces and the US military.</P>
      <P>The Defense Department said in a statement that the amendment
would build upon the existing Acquisition and Cross-Servicing
Agreement (ACSA) to include reciprocal provision of logistics support
"during situations in areas surrounding Japan that have an important
influence on Japan's peace and security".</P>
      <P>The ACSA, originally signed in April 1996, established terms and
conditions for exchange of logistics support for bilateral training
and exercises, United Nations peacekeeping operations, and
international humanitarian relief operations.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon said that the amendment, which was signed by US
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Japan's Foreign Minister
Keizo Obuchi on Tuesday in Tokyo, is also "designed to contribute to
smooth and effective operation of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation
and Security, and United Nations efforts to promote international
peace."</P>
      <P>It also described the ACSA amendment as an important element in
implementing the new Guidelines for US-Japan Defense Cooperation
published last September.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, apparently conscious of Beijing's suspicions
about military cooperation between the United States and Japan, the
Pentagon seeks to downplay the development.</P>
      <P>"While the scope of US-Japan logistics cooperation will expand to
allow US forces and the Japan Self-Defense Forces to support each
other during a contingency," it said, "the new amendment will not
alter the type of support already allowed under the current ACSA."</P>
      <P>"The ACSA provides a framework for exchange of supplies and
services but does not require provision of such support, or authorize
new military roles or missions for US or Japanese forces," it added.</P>
      <P>The agreement applies to the exchange of such items as food,
transportation and petroleum. The provision of weapon systems or
ammunition are expressly prohibited under the agreement.</P>
      <P>There has been speculation that "the surrounding areas" mentioned
in both the guidelines and the newly amended agreement include the
Taiwan Strait. Neither Washington nor Tokyo, however, would be drawn
in on questions over possible responses to another crisis in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Beijing has spoken out against foreign intervention in the
Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO MAKE RENEWED BID TO ENTER WHO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The medical establishment here has
appealed for the public to go on-line to drum up support from
international community for Taiwan's bid to re-enter the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Taiwan Medical Professional Alliance (TMPA) officials asked local
people to convey their sentiments through the Internet so that the
world can hear the voice of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The TMPA and representatives from the Dentist Association and
Medical Examiners Association spoke Wednesday in a press conference
to seek a national consensus on global health care and humanitarian
medical relief.</P>
      <P>The officials provided e-mail addresses of the heads of state in
the United States, Canada, Japan, France and the United Kingdom for
those who are concerned with the issue.</P>
      <P>The medical professionals stressed that there should be no
national boundaries for medical care, saying Taiwan's exclusion from
the WHO has prevented it from participating to that organization's
formulation of overall health policy, the development of
sophisticated diagnostic technology and the assessment and
implementation of disease control systems.</P>
      <P>They noted that Taiwan also has no access to health information
and technology that are distributed among WHO members, saying such
treatment runs contrary to the spirit of universality in upgrading
health standards around the world.</P>
      <P>TMPA Secretary-General Chang Wu-hsiu said health issues have
nothing to do with political affairs. He added that it was unbearable
to hear the representative from mainland China at last May's WHO
congress in Geneva claim that the health of Taiwan people is being
watched over by Peking.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that Taiwan's bid to enter the WHO has nothing to
do with prestige, asserting that the substantial damage from
exclusion by that body is significant. He cited as an example the
fact that a public health hazard involving contaminated radioactive
steel rods surfaced in Taiwan only in 1992, although the
international community had formed a plan for handling such problems
as early as 1984.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-hsiang, a researcher at Academia Sinica, the highest
research institute in Taiwan, noted that Taiwan lacks access to
international coordination involving communicable disease and
health, asking who would help in the event a major epidemic were to
break out here.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Ho said, Taiwan is prevented from sharing its
successful experience in family planning and efforts to fight
hepatitis B.</P>
      <P>Deng Chao-feng, TMPA president and an expert on clinical
toxicology, said Taiwan's bid to the WHO cannot be achieved with a
single leap. He said the TMPA will keep that goal as a long-term
objective by trying to gain admission to the WHO as a nongovernmental
organization.</P>
      <P>Deng also noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is trying to
make another attempt to solicit Republic of China diplomatic allies
to speak for Taiwan's admission as an WHO observer during the
organization's annual assembly in Geneva on May 11-20.</P>
      <P>The ROC lost its membership in the WHO, a specialized agency of
the United Nations, after its UN seat was handed to mainland China in
1972.</P>
      <P>Senegal, one of the ROC's allies, proposed at the WHO assembly
last May that Taiwan be invited to attend the assembly as an
observer. However, the request to list the item on the agenda was
defeated because of opposition from Beijing.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  D.C.,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is not included on this
year's "Special 301" blacklist, which is expected to be formally
announced by the Office of the United States Trade Representative
(USTR) on May 1, sources close to the White House executive agency
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although the final list must be approved by US Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky, who is currently in Paris, it was
learned that Taiwan will not reappear on the Special 301 list for
1998, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong, meanwhile, will be placed on the "watch list" for
alleged failure to adequately crack down on commercial piracy.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, based on provisions of Article 306 of the US
Omnibus Trade Act, will be under close scrutiny regarding its
implementation of an intellectual property rights (IPR) protection
agreement signed between Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, US-based pharmaceutical company PBM suggested
the USTR put Taiwan on the priority watch list for what it called an
"unfair pricing system" on imported medicines and medical equipment.
Nintendo US and the International IPR Alliance also demanded Taiwan's
inclusion on the watch list for IPR infringements.</P>
      <P>To investigate the complaints, a USTR delegation headed by senior
adviser David Burns visited Taipei in early April.</P>
      <P>During the visit, the US officials gained a better understanding
on IPR protection efforts and related developments in Taiwan. The
USTR office has also secured promises by Taipei on implementation of
an export monitoring system to stem commercial piracy and other IPR
infringements.</P>
      <P>In November 1996, Taiwan was removed from a "special mention"
list of countries where IPR protection is a concern, in recognition
of improvements in its IPR protection efforts.</P>
      <P>That was the first time that Taiwan has been absent from all
categories of the Special 301 listings since the United States began
annual reviews of IPR protective measures by its trading partners in
1989 under provisions of Article 301 of its Omnibus Trade Act.</P>

      <P>After the meeting, mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Tang Guoqiang told the press details about the talk between Qian and
Albright. He quoted Qian as saying that the "Taiwan issue" is the
most sensitive question in the Beijing-Washington relationship, and
that engagements between the two sides will proceed smoothly if the
issue is handled properly. Qian expressed the hope of the Beijing
authorities, said Tang, that Washington will adhere to the bases of
the three joint communiques and joint statements signed by the two
sides concerning the "Taiwan issue."</P>
      <P>Albright responded that Washington has a consistent policy on
Taiwan, fully respects Beijing's stance on the "Taiwan issue," and
adheres to a "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Prior to the talks on Wednesday between Albright and her mainland

agreement on the establishment of a direct secure telephone link

      <P>Singapore will be fully graduated from
the European Union's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) scheme
Friday, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) announced
Thursday.</P>
      <P>All exports of Singapore origin entering the European Union (EU)
on or after May 1, 1998 will be levied duties based on the
most-favored-nation tariff rates, it said.</P>
      <P>However, as a member of ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations), Singapore can continue to enjoy GSP benefits under the
regional cumulation mechanism, which is applicable to regional
economic groupings as provided for in the European Commission
Regulations. Products manufactured in Singapore could be used as
inputs in finished products of another ASEAN beneficiary country
eligible for the GSP Scheme.</P>
      <P>The impact of full graduation from the EU GSP scheme on
Singapore's exports is considered to be marginal, the TDB said. In
1997, Singapore's GSP-eligible non-oil exports to the EU represented
only 2.9 percent or about S$740.4 million (US$465.7 million) of the
nation's total exports to the EU.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Singapore's total exports to the EU amounted to S$26

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei has decided to make official a
trial program that improved visa treatment for foreign business
people by allowing them to apply for resident visas, as part of the
effort to attract more business elite from overseas to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced on Thursday that
employees of foreign corporations which maintain no direct offices or
investment operations in Taiwan will be allowed to apply for resident
visas instead of visitor visas, permitting them to stay on the island
for longer than two months per visit.</P>
      <P>Formerly, only those business people from foreign companies that
maintained investment operations or affiliated offices in Taiwan were
eligible to apply for resident visas.</P>
      <P>In an effort to attract more foreign business elite to Taiwan,
particularly to boost Taiwan's ambitious Asia-Pacific Regional
Operations Center plan, the MOFA began a trial program last year to
grant resident visas to foreign applicants who represent business
concerns that do not maintain offices or other related operations in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the trial period, 1,751 foreign business people
successfully obtained resident visas, which allow them to stay as
long as their contracts are valid.</P>
      <P>The success of the trial program prompted the MOFA to make it
official, effective May 1.</P>
      <P>Foreigners who enter Taiwan on a visitor visa are eligible to
remain for two months per visit, while those who are granted resident
visas can technically stay as long as they want, depending on their
contracts that have been approved by the Ministry of Economic

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Salt Industrial Corp. (TSIC)
has unveiled plans to forestall possible water shortages at the
Tainan Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>The plans call for a "three-in-one" project that will not only
provide fresh water but will also allow the generation of electricity
and the production of salt.</P>
      <P>According to the TSIC, a state-run enterprise, the project will
include the construction of a seawater desalination plant in Tainan
County's Chiku Township, a steam-generated power plant, water
processing facilities for the industrial park, and seawater
channeling facilities.</P>
      <P>The project will require investments totaling NT$5.76 billion
(US$175 million), with construction taking approximately
two-and-a-half years to complete, according to the TSIC. The
completed desalination plant will be able to supply 24,000 tons of
fresh water daily.</P>
      <P>The TSIC pointed out that the project addresses both
environmental concerns and efficient resource usage. The steam
produced during desalination will be used to generate electricity,
while the salt-saturated byproduct of the process will be directed
into the Chiku Salt Plant for salt production. In this way, the
company said, available resources can be fully utilized.</P>
      <P>Pipelines will carry the desalinated water from Chiku to the
industrial park and the Binnan Industrial District. The desalination
plant can also provide fresh water for public use if the necessary
conduit facilities exist, the TSIC said.</P>

      <P>Winston Lord, former Assistant
Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said Wednesday
that he does not see any evidence of change in US policy toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lord also praised the current US policy toward Taiwan and said
that it should be continued. "I think our policy is basically correct
over the last couple of decades," he said, adding that it is
"well-entrenched" and will be pursued in the future.</P>
      <P>Since Washington switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in
1979, the United States has pursued a policy of maintaining a close
but unofficial relationship with the Republic of China. Under the
Taiwan Relations Act, enacted that same year to govern the new
relationship, Washington has provided weapons for Taiwan's
self-defense.</P>
      <P>As the ties between the United States and mainland China have

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO STUDY ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH SE ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
and the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) under
the Executive Yuan on Thursday decided to set aside a special fund
for a research project to study ways to enhance economic and trade
cooperation with Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The decision was made at a meeting between MOEA and CEPD
officials following a directive from Premier Vincent Siew, who has
suggested using economy and trade as the main axis to promote
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>The large-scale research project, to be implemented at the
beginning of the new fiscal year which begins in July, will last for
about three years. In the first year, the MOEA and CEPD will each
appropriate NT$10 million to finance the project.</P>
      <P>The preliminary discussion also resulted in the designation of a
series of topics for research, such as the compilation of a basic
database for Southeast Asian countries, the investment climate in the
Southeast Asian region, the activities of banks and other financial
institutions, and the operations of Taiwan businessmen in Southeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>The research project will probably be carried out by institutes
such as the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research, the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research and other related organizations.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the MOEA's Investment
Commission, Taiwan investment in Thailand during the first quarter of
this year totaled US$9.78 million, a three-fold increase over the
US$2.42 million recorded in the corresponding period of last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, investment in Malaysia was up 6.6-fold, from
US$970,000 during January-March last year to US$7.36 million for the
same period of this year.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan investment in Vietnam, the Philippines and
Indonesia during the first quarter of this year amounted to only
US$11.5 million, a drastic reduction of 85.7 percent in comparison
with the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>The above statistics show that in the wake of the Asian financial
turmoil, investment activities by Taiwan businessmen in Southeast
Asian countries have been quite divergent.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOEA and the CEPD want to find out when will be
the most favorable time for Taiwan businessmen to invest in Southeast
Asia, and whether the government's go-south policy should be
continued.</P>

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade in the first
quarter of 1998 posted a deficit of US$70 million, the first
quarterly deficit in 17 years, the cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairman Chiang Pin-kung reported in an Executive Yuan
meeting that the effect of the Asian financial turmoil has been felt
in Taiwan's exports, leading Taiwan to record a rare trade deficit of
US$70 million between January and March this year, compared with a
surplus of US$1.8 billion during the same period of 1997.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that in March alone, Taiwan's exports decreased 0.5
percent, while imports edged up 0.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that most countries have adjusted their economic
growth for 1998 downward. The target global economic growth has been
moved down to 2.4 percent from 2.9 percent, while the worldwide trade
growth has also been cut to 7.1 percent from 8.2 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>After hearing the report, Premier Vincent Siew said that with the
decline in export growth, relevant government agencies should adopt
measures to stimulate local demand, including accelerating of
large-scale public construction projects and encouraging private
investment as part of efforts to raise economic growth.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  30 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's inflation is showing signs
of edging up in 1998-99 due to the weakened Australian currency and
Federal Treasurer Peter Costello played down hopes of an interest
rate cut despite fresh evidence that price pressures remain subdued.</P>
      <P>Costello said consumer prices fell an average 0.2 percent in the
year to March, while underlying inflation is running at just 1.5
percent -- well below the target of 2 percent to 3 percent set by the
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).</P>
      <P>Continued low inflation "means opportunities for home buyers, for
young families who are taking advantage of ... historically low
interest rates, and it also means that for retired people the prices
are not moving against them, not eating up their savings," he said.</P>
      <P>Costello, however, hinted that the price pressure had already
reached a trough -- at 1.4 percent in the December quarter --
confirming the government's belief that inflation will edge up in
1998-99 largely under the influence of a weakened Australian dollar,
which has caused imports to be more expensive.</P>
      <P>Costello predicted the central bank will hold the current
official interest rate at 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Between July 1996 and July 1997, the RBA cut its official rate
five times, lowering it to 5 percent from 7.5 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S'PORE UNLIKELY TO SLIP INTO RECESSION: IMF OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore is unlikely to slip into
recession this year even though its economy faces significant risks,
a senior International Monetary Fund (IMF) official said in Singapore
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, this year's economic growth could be even lower than the
3.5 percent forecast by the IMF in its World Economic Outlook report
only a few weeks ago, warned Flemming Larsen, deputy director of the
IMF's research department.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the possibility of a further contraction in
Singapore's growth rate is due to "tremendous uncertainty about how
the situation will unfold in the region."</P>
      <P>Falling demand, output and trade in the Asian countries most
affected by the regional financial crisis will hurt Singapore, he
said.</P>
      <P>"A contraction in the Singapore economy is highly unlikely this
year, even though there are significant downside risks due to
Singapore's position as a trading nation," he said, adding that "a
brief cooling-off period may not be bad" for the economy.</P>
      <P>Singapore's problems are "temporary," Larsen said at a briefing
session on the IMF's World Economic Outlook report Wednesday. Larsen
heads the team of economists who prepared the report.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Asian economic turmoil had more than
halved net capital inflows into the region from their peak in 1996
and that the problems will set back by several years the five
worst-affected nations: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South
Korea and Thailand.</P>
      <P>"We are talking about a shock (reduction in net capital flows) of
about US$100 billion. That is clearly a massive shock for five small
to medium-sized countries," he said.</P>
      <P>He said 1998 will still be a difficult year for Asian countries
hit by the crisis, even though there are hopeful signs from Thailand
and South Korea.</P>
      <P>"There is light at the end of the tunnel," he said.</P>
      <P>"Next year will see some improvement, and if the pace of reforms
is maintained, most of the economies could be back on track by 2000,"
Larsen said.</P>
      <P>Some of Asia's previously buoyant economies could grow by 5.6
percent or 7 percent in future, but the high growth rates of the past
are unlikely to be repeated, he said.</P>
      <P>Larsen said the IMF had initially underestimated the depth of the
upheaval but now recognizes it has been having a huge impact on
economies across the region.</P>
      <P>Japan's new financial stimulus package will limit downside risks
for the domestic economy but it may not be sufficient for an economic
turnaround, he said, asserting that Japan needs to speed up financial
sector reforms and continue the deregulation and liberalization of
its economy.</P>
      <P>If the Japanese economy recovers and the yen strengthens, this
may also help the soaring US economy achieve a soft landing, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A series of revised measures regulating
ROC males who wish to leave the country before completing their
two-year compulsory military service is expected to take effect in
late June, an official with the Ministry of the Interior said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chung Tai-li, director of the Conscription Department under the
Interior Ministry, said the Interior and National Defense ministries
have been working on the new measures to facilitate short-term
overseas stays for ROC would-be draftees in order to allow them more
opportunities to increase their knowledge and explore their
international prospects.</P>
      <P>The revised measures are expected to pass the Executive Yuan in
mid-May and will be implemented in late June, he noted, adding that
the measures will soften current restrictions on a range of issues
for would-be conscripts, including departure numbers, the length of
short-term overseas stays, and visa issuing and extension terms.</P>
      <P>Chung made the remarks while answering questions during an
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In response to a proposal by New Party Legislator Hau Lung-pin
that the government should also allow conscripts to study abroad,
Chung replied that this would have a strong impact on the current
education and military service systems and that improvements should
be implemented step by step, adding that the Conscription Department
will review the new regulations three years after their
implementation.</P>
      <P>A Grand Jury meeting last year branded as unconstitutional a
clause in the current conscription law which bans would-be draftees
from going abroad, and declared that the clause will become null and
void on June 26.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'KUNDUN' TO BE FINALLY RELEASED IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  April  30 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Kundun" -- a movie about the story of
the Dalai Lama -- is finally set to be released in Australia despite
a series of hurdles, including a warning by the mainland Chinese
embassy, industry sources said.</P>
      <P>Disney, the producer of the picture, had its major Australian
film distributors refuse to release the controversial movie for
nationwide showing in Australia because of fears of offending
mainland China, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Another factor behind the delay is that UGC, Disney's sales
agent, had asked a high price for the release of "Kundun" in
Australia, they said.</P>
      <P>But UGC has reduced its price and won an agreement from the
Melbourne-based independent distributor NewVision for the public
showing of the movie in Australia.</P>
      <P>UGC and NewVision have signed a deal in which the movie is
scheduled to be released in Australia in June, several months after
its release in other countries.</P>
      <P>The delay is partly due to a strong warning from the mainland
Chinese embassy in Canberra, which earlier threatened to take
retaliatory action against Roadshow, which normally handles Disney
films in Australia, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Roadshow, an Australian company that is in an Asian
cinema-building joint venture with Hong Kong company Golden Harvest,
refused to release the movie, claiming the price UGC was asking for
it was too high.</P>
      <P>Industry sources, however, attributed Roadshow's action to
Beijing's warning.</P>
      <P>The news of the imminent release of the movie follows protests by
the Australia Tibet Council (ATC), which alleged political censorship
over the non-appearance of the movie in Australia.</P>
      <P>NewVision managing director Frank Cox described the deal to
release the movie as "a big coup."</P>
      <P>ATC President Alex Butler on Wednesday welcomed the film deal,
saying, "We're delighted it's finally going to get shown in Australia
and delighted New Vision has got it because they have a very positive
attitude -- we admire their independence."</P>

(By Ou Chun-lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan may not be renowned for its glass,
but an exhibition in London's Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) which
opened on Wednesday is showing visitors that contemporary Chinese
artists in Taiwan are trying to put themselves on the cultural map in
this field.</P>
      <P>The V&amp;A held a reception to mark the opening of the exhibition,
entitled New Glass Art from China. Fifteen contemporary glass
sculptures by Loretta Yang of Taiwan's New Workshop will be on
display for the next six months.</P>
      <P>The reception also marked the museum's decision to put two of
Yang's sculptures on permanent display -- an exquisite green and
yellow pumpkin box made with the pate-de-verre technique, and a pure
white piece called Flight of Buddha, made using the same technique.</P>
      <P>For Yang, a former Taiwan movie star who was awarded the best
actress award in Taiwan's golden horse festival for two consecutive
years and also won the best actress prize in the Asian Pacific film
festival, the exhibition was what she called another milestone in her
struggle to find new territory in which to express herself after
deciding to quit the movie industry at the peak of her career.</P>
      <P>Yang, along with her film director husband Chang Yi and five
other friends, set up Taiwan's first professional glass arts studio
in 1987, with absolutely no idea they would one day revolutionize the
glass industry on the island.</P>
      <P>Her sculptures are distinctive, often featuring her favorite
images of Buddha and other ancient Chinese motifs as found on ancient
Chinese bronzes.</P>
      <P>Yang's work has been exhibited in Asia, America and Europe, and
in the words of critic Andrew Bolton, have succeeded in changing the
traditional perception of glassmaking in China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the arrival of American chicken on
Taiwan supermarket shelves imminent, local poultry businesses are
speeding up moves to defend their market share and profits.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Poultry Association of the Republic of China
said on Thursday that one of their strategies is to build a
certification system to label high-quality chicken meat and live
domestic chickens with a logo saying that the products have been
certified by the association.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said they are also sparing no efforts in promoting
these labeled products in markets islandwide, because they believe
the certified chicken will enjoy a stronger competitive edge than
imported chicken.</P>
      <P>On June 1, American chicken will start entering the Taiwan
market, which must open for imports as a part of the island's bid for
World Trade Organization entry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to an immediate market opening for 10,000 tons of
chicken from the US per year at a tariff rate of 25 percent in
bilateral trade consultations in February, and this is being seen as
a worrisome threat to the monopoly enjoyed by the domestic poultry
industry.</P>
      <P>Huang Tsi-yiang, chairman of the Poultry Association, said that
despite the fact that the imported chicken is expected to disturb the
currently stable chicken prices, the association is convinced that
local consumers will still buy local chicken at a higher price,
rather than choosing the imported product.</P>
      <P>He reasoned that local chickens, especially the free-range
variety, are commonly believed to produce sweeter and tastier meat
than their foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>Moreover, with imports to be strictly controlled by the
government, the US chickens will mostly be channeled into the
processed food sector, which will lessen the impact on the general
market sector, he said.</P>

      <P>The sit-in, which ended at around 6:30 p.m., was described by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative to Japan Chuang Ming-yao
on Thursday expressed delight over the Japanese Diet's decision to
reinstate 72-hour visa-free privileges for ROC passport holders,
attributing the move to efforts by the ROC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and all his predecessors.</P>
      <P>Chuang also expressed appreciation for the help given by Sadanori
Yamanaka, president of the non-partisan Alliance for Japan-ROC
Friendship in Japan's Diet, or parliament, and praised Yamanaka's key
role in the Diet's passage of the amendment bill earlier the same day
to reinstate the above-mentioned treatment for ROC visitors.</P>
      <P>The ROC's progress in democratization and economic development
may also be a reason behind the Diet's decision to re-implement the
privileges for Taiwan visitors, Chuang said, pointing out that the
amendment was passed unanimously by all 450 dietmen at the House of
Representatives who took part in the session.</P>
      <P>The new regulations, which are expected to be promulgated within
two or three weeks and become effective in mid-June, will recognize
passports issued by the Republic of China as valid documents and will
allow Japanese visa issuing authorities to place their stamps
directly in the passports, rather than the practice employed
previously of placing stamps on separate "entry certificates."</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office in Japan has been working toward
the resumption of the 72-hour visa-free treatment for Taiwan visitors
for the past seven years, ever since Tokyo withdrew the privilege in
1990. The new measure is widely regarded as a big breakthrough in
bilateral ties after the two countries suspended diplomatic relations
in 1972.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu also welcomed the move,
describing it as a practical measure that will facilitate visits by

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang Jong-kung, director-general of the
Department of Overseas Affairs under the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), on
Thursday termed the containment methods used by Beijing to isolate
the Republic of China diplomatically as "unwise," saying that the
policy has enhanced the rationality of the existence of a Taiwan
independence movement.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a seminar sponsored by the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) to mark the 5th anniversary of the historic
Koo-Wang talks in Singapore. The talks between Koo Chen-fu, SEF
chairman, and Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), represented the first
high-level cross-strait contact in more than 40 years.</P>
      <P>The KMT official pointed out that Beijing's containment, and its
continued criticism of the ROC's pragmatic diplomacy, has resulted in
public repugnance, has hurt the feelings of the people on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, and has strengthened the reasons for the
existence of the Taiwan independence movement.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, there is space for peaceful cross-strait
unification, but in order to enlarge this space, it is absolutely
necessary to renounce the threat of military force or diplomatic
isolation.</P>
      <P>Chang also noted that although there are political differences
which are expected to exist for a long period of time, the two sides
should have an equal right to function in the international
community. He suggested that mainland China should carefully consider
new channels and models for future cooperation in order to allow
cross-strait exchanges to move forward.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen Wan-chin, director-general of the Department of
Mainland Affairs of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
said it is difficult for him to be optimistic about a resumption of
cross-strait talks, since Beijing still has not dropped its old way
of thinking and wants only "political negotiation."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the opposition New Party meanwhile
suggested that it is better to talk than not to talk, and said he
believes Beijing also wants to talk because it is worried that Taiwan
will change, and will distance itself more and more from the
mainland, eventually becoming an anti-Chinese communist pawn of the
Western world.</P>

small businesses, most of which are OEM contractors for world-class
brand-name products.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the semiconductor and plastics industries as
examples, Hsu said Taiwan OEM manufacturers, working with their US
contracting companies, have formed a strong front to compete against
Japanese and South Korean businesses in global markets.</P>
      <P>Hsu went on to say that Taiwan should ease investment
restrictions to allow the services sector, including the financial
and warehousing industries, to explore the promising mainland market,
where they can create their own brands and marketing networks.</P>
      <P>They would also be able to join forces with US firms to seize a
larger share of the international market, he added.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan businesses currently pour at least US$20 billion-worth
of investment into mainland China every year, Taiwan's financial
industry will quickly develop if Taiwan-based banks are allowed to
operate negotiating services in Hong Kong, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's transport and distribution industries could
also be easily upgraded should direct trade, postal and transport
links be permitted across the Taiwan Strait, thus greatly increasing
the chances of Taiwan developing as an economic integrator among
Asian economies, he concluded.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks while answering questions from local
reporters. The DPP chairman is here for a weeklong visit at the
invitation of the Taipei-based Australian Commerce and Industry
office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROVINCIAL GOVERNOR SOONG  SIDES WITH THOMAS JEFFERSON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong
said on Thursday that he agrees with former US President Thomas
Jefferson in that local government's wishes should be respected.
Although the federal government is important, certain rights must be
reserved for state government.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks during an interview broadcast in two parts
on Wednesday and Thursday by the ICRT radio station.</P>
      <P>Answering a question on whether he felt betrayed when the
government decided to reform the provincial government without
consulting him, Soong said: "I really had a kind of a bad feeling
about why they made that kind of decision. But I do not want to
recite what has been done, because let us put aside our differences
and look forward to how to patch up and also to doing things for the
future."</P>
      <P>Soong, who threatened to resign a little over a year ago because
of government reforms of the provincial government, said that there
are two things which he really wants to protest.</P>
      <P>"One, I do not support the idea of abolishing the provincial
government. I feel the local government understands better the wishes
of the people.</P>
      <P>"Second is the procedure. As the governor of Taiwan, I should be
consulted beforehand. When we drafted a new constitutional amendment
-- I was and still am a Standing Committee member of the Kuomintang
and I am also the publicly elected governor of Taiwan -- that bad
decision was made without prior consultation with the governor. So I
think that as a democratic country, the governor at least should have
the right to participate in the decision-making," he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on what's next in his political career, Soong said:
"My term (will expire) by the end of this year. I still have a few
months to go. I want to finish up, but I feel the most important
thing is to do certain things for the people."</P>
      <P>He said he will probably make a decision later this year, either
to seek another office, or to engage in some other public affairs
activity, or to retire to write his memoirs.</P>
