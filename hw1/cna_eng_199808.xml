    <HEADLINE>CHINESE IN NEW YORK CONDEMN ANTI-CHINESE ATROCITIES IN INDONESIA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A large-scale unified action of several
dozen Chinese organizations in New York took place on Friday, in
protest over the atrocities committed against ethnic Chinese women by
rioters in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the groups announced that a federation of Chinese New
York residents has been formed to condemn the anti-Chinese racism,
and is organizing a big protest slated for August to take place in
front of the Indonesian General Consulate in New York and at the
headquarters of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The protest is aimed at demanding that the Indonesian government
take efficient measures to investigate the widespread and systemic
rape and murder of ethnic Chinese in the Southeast Asian country,
punish those responsible, and grant compensation to the families of
the victims, a member of the federation said.</P>
      <P>The federation also urged Chinese people living in the United
States to write to their congressmen to request a public hearing on
the racially motivated violence.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that nearly 200 ethnic Chinese women and
girls were gang-raped, tortured and murdered, some of whom were
attacked in front of their families, in May riots in Indonesia over
the severe economic recession there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGED TO PROVIDE MAINLAND CHINA RISK INDEX FOR TAIWAN VISITORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) has, since its establishment in 1991, helped resolve
193 cases involving Taiwan business people's personal safety in
mainland China, a SEF spokesman said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Among these cases, 31 were fatal, the spokesman said, adding that
26 were murdered and the remaining five were accident victims.</P>
      <P>Forty-three of the cases involved Taiwan investors who were
attacked, robbed or extorted; 29 cases were related to kidnapping; 51
cases involved Taiwan business people being put under "house arrest";
and 29 cases involved Taiwan businessmen reported missing.</P>
      <P>The most recent case involved Wang Fu-ching, a Taiwan investor in
the southern mainland city of Shenzhen, who was beaten to death on
July 27, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The SEF tally, however, did not include the tragic death of
Kaohsiung City Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan in northeastern mainland
China on July 29, because Lin was not a businessperson. Lin died when
she was given suspected overdoses of sedatives after being kidnapped
in the northeastern mainland port city of Dalian on July 27.</P>
      <P>The SEF spokesman said if cases involving non-business Taiwan
people falling victim to mainland criminal activities were included,
the number would be much greater.</P>
      <P>With mainland China's social order deteriorating,
opposition Legislator Hsiao Yu-cheng urged the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, to
establish a regular warning system for the reference of would-be
mainland-bound businesspeople and ordinary travelers.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said the MAC should formulate a special rating system to
gauge the extent of danger or risk of various mainland cities and
regions based on their general crime rates and the number of cases
involving Taiwan victims.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said the SEF can ask its mainland counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), to
provide it with information or data concerning social order and crime
rates in various mainland districts.</P>
      <P>"The MAC should use the data to compile a risk rating index for
the reference of local people intending to travel to China," Hsiao
said.</P>
      <P>She also urged the government to push mainland authorities to
investigate the case of Lin Ti-chuan's death and bring to justice all
those involved in the case.</P>
      <P>Hsiao further said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should sign
an agreement on join anti-crime operations to better protect the
physical safety and property of the people on both sides of the
strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples
Organization (UNPO) has decided to honor the founder of Taiwan's
largest charity organization, an UNPO official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Parris Chang, who is chairman of UNPO's Steering Committee and
also a legislator of the Republic of China's opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said the organization will present the award
for human rights to Master Cheng Yen when the Steering Committee
meets in Taipei on September 24-27.</P>
      <P>Chang said that master Chang Yen was nominated by the DPP earlier
this year, and beat seven other candidates to win the honor.</P>
      <P>He said that this is the second year that the UNPO has bestowed
the award. The first winner of the award was Ramos Jose Horta, an
activist for East Timor independence, who was also the winner of
Nobel Peace Prize in 1996.</P>
      <P>Chang lauded Master Chen Yen's Buddhist Compassionate Relief
Tzu-chi Foundation, which has expanded its charity work across
national borders and has provided large amounts of help to those in
need in recent years.</P>
      <P>He said UNPO's decision shows that efforts from Taiwan's private
sector are being recognized by the international community.</P>
      <P>UNPO, founded in 1991 and based in the Hague, Netherlands, aims
to provide a platform for those nations, minorities and peoples who
are not represented in established international forums such as the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>UNPO's 50 members, which include the Chechen Republic, East

      <P>The Asia Pacific Public Affairs Forum

people, including Brisbane Mayor Jim Soorley, Kaohsiung Mayor Wu

      <P>The theme of the seminar will be "Australia's One Nation Party
and Its Impact on Global Civil Society."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Saturday, University of
Queensland Associate Professor C.L. Chiou said: "The rise of Pauline
Hanson's One Nation party has not only altered the Australian
political landscape, it has also caused great concern in Asia."</P>
      <P>He said many Asians are asking: "Is Hansonism going to become the
mainstream political agenda in Australia? Is the white Australia
policy making a comeback? What is going to happen to Asia-Australia
relations, especially in areas of trade, tourism and cultural and
educational exchanges?"</P>
      <P>He said the seminar is seeking to answer these questions so that
people in Taiwan and other Asian countries will have a better
understanding of the rise of One Nation and will be able to cope with
its impact in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has launched a nationwide manhunt
for six people wanted in connection with the murder of Taiwan
councilor Lin Ti-chuan in the mainland China city of Haicheng,
Liaoning Province, according to Hong Kong-based newspapers.</P>
      <P>Photos of the six suspects, including prime suspect Li Guangzhi,
have been distributed to ports, airports, traffic checkpoints, and
security bureaus across the country, the pro-Beijing dailies Wen Wei 
Pao and Ta Kung Pao reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 public security personnel have been deployed to
set up roadblocks around Liaoning, and a task force code named "729"
-- a reference to the date when the case came to light -- headed by
Haicheng City Mayor Zhang Dianchun, has been formed to probe the case
and bring those responsible to justice.</P>
      <P>Li is a business associate of Lin's Taiwan boyfriend Wei
Tien-kang. He reportedly lured the couple to Dalian on Sunday with an
offer of a business deal, before kidnapping them on Monday and taking
them to Haicheng, about 200 kilometers to the north.</P>
      <P>Wei, who managed to escape and alarm the authorities on
Wednesday, said Li demanded a ransom of US$200,000, but the
newspapers said that in reality, Li was probably trying to collect a
US$700,000 debt from Wei.</P>
      <P>Lin was taken to the Haicheng City Central Hospital on Wednesday
by a young man who claimed to be her husband. The man disappeared
after Lin was pronounced dead from kidney failure caused by an
overdose of the sedatives which Wei said was used by their abductors
to subdue them.</P>
      <P>Wei, the owner of a Taiwan-based firm which imports mineral ore
from mainland China, is now under public security protection at a
local guest house, while Taiwan police have opened an investigation
into his role in the case, according to the local TTV television

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is redoubling efforts to attract more
foreign students from Taiwan and Hong Kong, as well as from countries
such as mainland China, India and Vietnam to reverse declining
enrollment numbers -- largely the result of a region-wide financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>Between 1986 and 1996, Australia has attracted students from
throughout the world, although Asia has been a key focus. Over the
past decade, the number of foreign students studying in Australia has
increased steadily.</P>
      <P>Last year, however, the growth rate fell to about 5 percent, the
country's first year-on-year growth rate decline in more than a
decade. About 150,000 foreign students studied in Australia last
year, according to Australian Educational International (AEI), a
government agency that promotes education.</P>
      <P>AEI officials attribute the lower growth rate to the Asian
financial crisis, which first hit Thailand and then spread to the
Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.</P>
      <P>They predicted the number of foreign students in 1998 would
remain marginally higher than that of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The reason for the fall is the substantial depreciation of the
currencies of these countries against the Australian dollar, making
an Australian education too expensive for some students.</P>
      <P>Most overseas students studying in Australia last year came from
South Korea, followed by Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, India and mainland China.

      <P>Most of Taiwan manufacturers believed that
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will help cut
import costs and have substantial benefits, according to a survey
unveiled Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI), found that 70.6 percent of the polled said that
the entry will help cut import costs.</P>
      <P>Only 5.9 percent said that the entry will be detrimental, showing
that most of the polled believed that Taiwan's entry into the WTO
will be beneficial to manufacturers who rely on imported raw
materials.</P>
      <P>On whether Taiwan's entry will pose pressure to domestic
industries, 27.1 percent of Taiwan manufacturers polled said that the
pressure of competition will be tremendous, while 45.9 percent said
that the pressure will be modest. Some 27.1 percent said they feel no
pressure.</P>
      <P>This shows that most of Taiwan's manufacturers have made
adjustment during the past years to prepare for the cutting of
tariffs and the opening of market in Taiwan's bid to enter the world
trade organization.</P>
      <P>Those who believed that the pressure will be modest or not
exist belong to machinery and instrument manufacturing sectors,
while those that said the pressure will be high are mostly in food
and soft drink sectors.</P>
      <P>CNFI conducted the survey between July 9 and July 16. It has

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwan-chun and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven mainland Chinese dissidents from
Zhejiang province co-signed a letter to mainland China's Supreme
People's Court on Friday requesting that a former Beijing mayor be
re-tried after being convicted of corruption and dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>Former Beijing Major Chen Xitong, who was also a local Communist
party boss, was sentenced to 16 years in prison by the Beijing
Municipal Higher People's Court on Friday. Chen was found guilty of
accepting a 550,000-yuan bribe.</P>
      <P>As the dissidents pointed out in their letter, however, mainland
Chinese law stipulates that accepting a bribe of more than 100,000
yuan is a capital offense. The dissidents claimed that because of
political considerations, Chen received a lighter sentence than would
have been given to a lower-ranking official.</P>
      <P>His offense is more serious than those of most executed
criminals, the dissidents said in a news release faxed to New York by
the Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China.</P>
      <P>Chen served first as mayor and then as city party boss from 1983
to 1995 and presided over the city during the crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</P>
      <P>Based on the principle that on one is above law, remarked the
dissidents, Chen should be sentenced to death. The dissidents
requested the Supreme Court overturn the verdict of the Beijing
Municipal Higher People's Court and that Chen be re-tried. They also
called for the re-trial to be broadcast live on television.</P>
      <P>The information center noted that the Zhejiang dissidents'
request was the third one in the past three days calling for Chen to
receive the death sentence. The center said this indicates not only
the public's anger toward corruption but also their loathing toward
those considered responsible for the Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>

be at least 20 years old by Dec. 3 is eligible to cast a ballot.</P>
      <P>Chao, the architect of the primaries, dismissed criticism that
members of other political parties could sabotage the elections and
influence election results. Primary candidates should know how to
drum up enough support to neutralize any such attempts, he said.</P>
      <P>Among the party supporters who turned out to vote on Saturday was
Kao Koong-lian, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs
Commission and a senior Kuomintang member. He told surprised
reporters that he would like to help the New Party choose its
legislative candidates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S LARGEST OPPOSITION PARTY CHANGES GUARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) changed guard on Saturday, with veteran political
dissident Lin Yi-hsiung taking the helm of Taiwan's largest
opposition party.</P>
      <P>Lin, 56, took the party's reins from Hsu Hsin-liang in a
green-tinged ceremony held at DPP headquarters in downtown Taipei.
Green is the DPP's favorite color.</P>
      <P>In his inaugural speech, Lin expressed a strong ambition that the
DPP become Taiwan's ruling party in the not-too-distant future.</P>
      <P>Lin, a vocal independence supporter, also stressed that only
residents on the island can determine Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>"Local people may have different political views and stances, but
they all agree that neither the United States nor the Chinese
communist government is entitled to determine our destiny," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that only the people of Taiwan know which kind of
country they need, Lin said Taiwan's future can only be determined by
its people.</P>
      <P>The soft-spoken DPP chairman acknowledged that Taiwan's
development is facing enormous difficulties and challenges because of
the recent international situation and mainland China's military
threat.</P>
      <P>"Addressing these challenges is a tall order for Taiwan's
politicians and ordinary people as well," Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the face of the adversity, Lin said Taiwan should become even
more cautious and prudent in handling issues related to its future.</P>
      <P>He further said if all Taiwan residents fail to stand firm and
united, not only will mainland China constantly intimidate or
suppress the island but, "The international community will also
disregard us."</P>
      <P>"History has proved it that only when the people of a country
show a strong will and determination to defend their country can they
avoid aggression or invasion by other nations," he warned.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say it is the DPP's consistent stance that all
local residents, no matter when they came to the island, can jointly
create an independent country that will be able to enjoy an high
standing in the international community and contribute to the
civilization and well-being of all mankind.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said the DPP will not force local people who
have different political views and stances to accept its platform.</P>
      <P>As for the DPP's current political tasks, Lin said the DPP should
exercise extreme caution and express a strong determination to defend
Taiwan's sovereignty and security in developing relations with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lin said the DPP should also feel an a sense of urgency
in becoming the ruling party to realize its ideals and policies in
domestic administration.</P>
      <P>Lin further said reforming local society and making Taiwan a
lovable country is the DPP's only goal should it become the ruling
party. "I'm convinced that if many of the DPP's policies and reform
plans can be implemented smoothly, more people on the island will
identify with Taiwan rather than China."</P>
      <P>The ceremony was overshadowed by sadness as one of the party's
rising stars, Kaohsiung City Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan, was kidnapped
and murdered in mainland China earlier this week. She was originally
tapped to serve as master of ceremonies. All the participants
observed a minute of silence in memory of the councilor before the
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Outgoing DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang got a surprise fist from a
radical independence supporter, Lee You-cheng, when Hsu stepped out
of his car to attend the ceremony. Lee said he slapped Hsu to protest
Hsu's call for broad engagement with Beijing. Lee was arrested by
police.</P>
      <P>The unexpected episode did not seem to bother Hsu. Hsu said he
has encountered many such ordeals and adversities in his long
political career.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   1   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) expressed deep regret on Saturday over Beijing's
rejection of its plan to send staff members to mainland China to help
the family of a Taiwan councilor kidnapped and murdered on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>"We are extremely dissatisfied with Beijing's snub of our plan,"
said SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng. "Beijing should
assume all the responsibility for its unfriendly move, which has hurt
the feelings of local people and may affect exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Jan made the remarks after receiving a phone call from Liu
Gangqi, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Liu, who was in the northeastern mainland city of Haicheng to
help handle the aftermath of Kaohsiung City Councilwoman Lin
Ti-chuan's tragic death, told Jan that he sees no need for any SEF
staff member to come to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Jan said the SEF originally planned to send Tsai Chin-mei, deputy
director of the SEF's Travel Service Department, to accompany Lin's
parents to the mainland to offer counseling services or assistance.</P>
      <P>Although Tsai managed to accompany Lin's parents to Hong Kong,
she was forced to return to Taipei late Friday night because Beijing
would not give her an entry permit.</P>
      <P>Jan said the SEF sent seven letters by fax to the ARATS on Friday
asking for its assistance to arrange for Tsai's mainland trip. "The
ARATS didn't respond to our letters."</P>
      <P>Jan said the SEF also tried numerous times to contact Liu or
other ARATS staff members via telephone on Friday. "However, we
couldn't get in touch with Liu until this morning."</P>
      <P>Jan said the ARATS should not have rejected SEF's plan to help
the grieving Lin family. "Our plan was based on humanitarian grounds.
Beijing should not have rejected it out of political considerations,"
he insisted.</P>
      <P>Lin was kidnapped shortly after she arrived in the northeastern
mainland port city of Dalian on July 27. She died on July 29 of a
suspected drug overdose, injected by her kidnappers.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman C. F. Koo, who plans to travel to mainland China
this fall to meet his ARATS counterpart, said Saturday afternoon
that if Beijing fails to handle Lin's case with sincerity,
cross-strait exchanges will certainly be affected.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's largest opposition party also said its Legislative Yuan
caucus will take steps to push the ROC government to stop cultural,
athletic and other social exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The DPP made the announcements after Beijing failed to respond
to its three-point ultimatum delivered earlier in the day over the
kidnap-murder in mainland China of one of its rising political stars,
Kaohsiung City Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan.</P>
      <P>The DPP sent the ultimatum to Beijing's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) via the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foudnation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The DPP demanded that Beijing allow SEF staff members to travel
to the mainland to help the grieving Lin family handle the aftermath
of the councilwoman's tragic death.</P>
      <P>The party also demanded that Beijing quickly approve visa
applications by DPP members to travel to the mainland to help the Lin
family and that Beijing definitely promise to agree to the return
of Lin's body. In the past, Beijing only allowed the return of
cremated ashes of Taiwan people who died on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The DPP asked Beijing to respond to its demand by 5 p.m.
Saturday. The ARATS, however, didn't give any response until the
deadline.</P>
      <P>An angry DPP Legislator Chang Chun-hung, also a DPP heavyweight,
said the party will ask the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council,
who charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, to tighten
restrictions on mainland officials' applications for visits to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung, who just assumed office on Saturday
morning, condemned communist China's consistent suppression of human
rights and failure to protect personal safety of visitors from
Taiwan. Lin urged local people not to make pleasure trips to that
risky, dangerous country.</P>
      <P>The DPP formed a five-member task force to help handle the
aftermath of Lin Ti-chuan's death and other related affairs, with
Chang Chun-hung as the convener.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-hung urged
Beijing to agree to the SEF's plan to send staff members to the
mainland to help the Lin family handle related affairs.</P>
      <P>Jan said five SEF staff members, including Tsai Chin-mei, deputy
director of the SEF's Travel Service Department, are ready to travel
to the mainland. "They can leave for the mainland as soon as
receiving Beijing's entry permits," he added.</P>

Tsung-yin, and two employees from a local funeral home.</P>
      <P>They left the southern port city of Kaohsiung at 1:00 p.m. on

    <HEADLINE>VICE ECONOMICS MINISTER PREDICTS MODERATE ECONOMIC GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwan-chun and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Asia's financial crisis, Taiwan's
economy will grow 5.5 percent in 1998, ROC Vice Economic Affairs
Minister Chang Chang-pang said on Sunday at an investment seminar in
New York.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has also been affected by the regional financial
storm that broke out one year ago, Chang said Taiwan's economy
remains stable compared with those of neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>The vice economics minister made the remarks while addressing an
investment seminar to introduce Taiwan's efforts to promote high-tech
development. More than 200 academic, business and financial experts
from New York's Chinese community took part in the event.</P>
      <P>Attributing Taiwan's stable economic development to its low
levels of foreign debts, a trade surplus of more than US$80 million
and bullish private-sector investment, Chang said the ROC
government's economic liberalization and globalization policies have
also given local industries a boost.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently the world's 14-largest economy, and the
island's two-way trade totaled US$237 billion in 1997, more than
double the total of a decade ago, Chang said. The island is also an
important source of capital supply in the international community,
having invested US$15 million directly in other countries over the
past decade.</P>
      <P>Chang said trade figures indicate foreign investors are confident
in Taiwan's investment climate. Foreign investment in Taiwan hit a
record high of US$4.3 billion last year, a 73 percent increase over
1996. The amount of foreign capital that poured into Taiwan during
the first five months of this year totaled US$1.2 billion, 37.4
percent higher than the same period one year ago.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors are welcome to work hand in hand with the
Republic of China government to develop new hi-tech industries on the
island, as Taiwan needs greater diversification of its hi-tech
industries, he said.</P>
      <P>In recent years hi-tech industries have accounted for an
increasing percentage of the island's manufacturing sector, Chang
said. Last year the output of Taiwan's hi-tech industries totaled
NT$2.7 trillion (US$77 billion), accounting for 43 percent of the
overall production value of the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The vice economic affairs minister arrived in New York on
Wednesday at the head of 22-member delegation aimed at attracting
investment in Taiwan. He is scheduled to proceed to San Francisco on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Before leaving New York, Chang will host another investment
seminar in Manhattan on Monday. More than 150 local business
executives have applied to participate in the seminar.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEEDS TO IMPROVE INTERNATIONALIZATION EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has to step up internationalization
efforts to improve its global competitiveness, according to a report
released by the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The CEPD report said that Taiwan ranked 16th in global
competitiveness in 1998, according to the Swiss-based International
Institute for Management and Development (IMD), which began
publishing an annual World Competitiveness Yearbook 11 years ago.</P>
      <P>Eight categories comprising 244 criteria are used to measure a
country's competitiveness. They are domestic economic strength,
internationalization, government efficiency, banking services,
infrastructure development, technological strength, industrial
management, as well as manpower planning and living quality.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 11th in the IMD world competitiveness rankings in
1992 and 1993, slid to 22nd in 1994, rebounded to 14th in 1995, fell
again to 18th in 1996 and further dropped to 23rd in 1997.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's internationalization score continued to fall this year,
though the island made gains in other categories. Taiwan's
internationalization rating plunged to 32nd from the past three's
year's ratings of 24th, 26th and 28th, signaling the island has
declined in terms of internationalization compared with other
countries.</P>
      <P>Analyzing Taiwan's internationalization rating, which consists of
40 criteria, the CEPD said that Taiwan performed well in four areas
but had bad ratings in 15 areas of the total.</P>
      <P>The IMD gave Taiwan high marks on balance of current account,
export of goods and labor services as a percentage of GDP, total
foreign trade volume and stability of local currency against major
international currencies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fared poorly in balance of trade of labor services, raking
43rd; balance of trade of labor services as a percentage of GDP,
ranking 42nd; immigration law, ranking 42nd; diversification of
export markets, ranking 41st; tourism revenue, ranking 37th; public
departments and risk of multinational operations, ranking 35th;
growth of foreign investment, ranking 34th; accumulated amount of
foreign investment and protection of foreign investment, ranking
29th; and regional trade integration, ranking 26th.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CEPD pointed out that Taiwan's
internationalization rating was behind Singapore, which finished
second; Hong's Kong, third; Malaysia, 24th; and the Philippines,
28th. Taiwan ranked higher than South Korea, however, which finished
46th.</P>

the northeastern province of Liaoning.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, in addition to meeting any demands from the
victim's family, Beijing should permit Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) personnel to go to the mainland to help Lin's family.</P>
      <P>Chang, the first KMT mainland affairs department chief to visit
the mainland in 50 years, pointed out that over the past few years
the safety of Taiwan business people on the mainland has been
compromised. He urged Beijing to pay greater attention to the
problem.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the fate of four Taiwanese businessmen who are
facing trial on charges of espionage, Chang said he hopes Beijing
will take into account the feelings of Taiwan business people on the
mainland and the status of cross-strait relations, and permit the
four men to return to Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 mainland China has held annual seminars on
cross-strait relations. Chang is scheduled to return to Taipei on
Aug. 9 after attending this year's three-day meeting in Beijing.</P>

      <P>Vietnam has pledged to expand trade and
investment ties with World Trade Organization (WTO) members in its
bid to expand multilateral trade, according to reports from the
Geneva-based world trade body on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hanoi's application to join the WTO will form the basis for its
trade policy in the next decade, Truong Dinh Tuyen, Vietnam's trade
minister, was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Tuyen told the first session of the working party on Vietnam's
accession that the application was part of Hanoi's policy of
expanding trade and investment ties with WTO members. "We are very
conscious of the fact that joining the multilateral trade institution
brings both rights and obligations," he said.</P>
      <P>The two-day session in Geneva ushered in a new stage in Vietnam's
trade policies in various fields, especially those related to
commodities and investment, the WTO report said. A second session of
the working party focusing on the transparency of Vietnam's policies
will likely be held in Geneva in November.</P>
      <P>Vietnam has trade ties with 105 countries and territories, and
external trade has risen from US$4.42 billion in 1991 to US$19.5
billion in 1997.</P>

      <P>Representatives from women's rights groups
in Taiwan on Sunday arrived in Indonesia for a four-day visit aimed
at expressing their concern to the ethnic Chinese women who fell
victim to sexual abuse during rioting there in May.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's vice representative to Indonesia, Chang Yuan-lang, and
his wife greeted the nine-member delegation, headed by Wang
Ching-feng, a prominent women's rights activist and also a former
member of Control Yuan, at the airport.</P>
      <P>Before departing from Taipei, Wang said at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport that the group plans to meet with some of the
abused Indonesian Chinese, with the assistance of women's rights and
human rights groups in the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>The delegation hopes to get more facts about the atrocities
committed against the Chinese people during the chaotic period in
May, Wang said, adding that they will help the victims seek medical
treatment.</P>
      <P>During the group's four-day stay there, Wang said that they
expect to visit the nation's Women's Affairs Ministry, Social Welfare
Ministry and National Human Rights Committee to urge the Indonesian
government to provide women with adequate protection and guarantee
such events will never happen again.</P>
      <P>Saying the brutal killing of Chinese people and the raping of
Chinese women in Indonesia has aroused widespread anger on the
island, Wang stressed that it is time to take practical action to
respond to such horrific events.</P>
      <P>Wang, along with several women's rights groups as well as Voice
of Taipei Broadcasting Co., on Wednesday launched a fund-raising
campaign to help Chinese women in Indonesia. They also called on the
people of Taiwan to scrap their travel plans to Indonesia and to
write letters or send e-mail messages to relevant Indonesian agencies
to protest the May riots.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 1,200 ethnic Chinese were killed and
several hundred ethnic Chinese women were raped during May's riots,
which toppled former president Suharto.</P>
      <P>During the past three days, a total of NT$150,000 has been
received, of which NT$50,000 came from Foreign Minister Jason Hu on

    <HEADLINE>DPP POISED TO BOYCOTT EXCHANGES WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A task force of the leading opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said on Sunday it will submit a
four-point resolution to the party, asking it suspend cross-strait
exchanges to protest the kidnapping and murder of a DPP member in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chun-Hung, one of the five-member task force and
a DPP heavyweight, said the party strongly regretted that Beijing was
unwilling to allow the return of Lin Ti-chuan's body to Taiwan on
Monday, as her family had demanded. He added that the task force has
decided to refer the four-point resolution to the party's Central
Standing Committee at its next weekly meeting on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The resolution calls for a series of boycotts against mainland
China by stalling a wide range of cross-strait activities, including
the tightening of restrictions on visits by mainland Chinese
personnel to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A 32-year-old DPP Kaohsiung City councilwoman, Lin was kidnapped
and murdered last week in the northeastern province of Liaoning
during a private visit to mainland China. Lin's family went to the
mainland on Friday to bring back Lin's body.</P>
      <P>The DPP's caucus in the Legislative Yuan will also visit the
Mainland Affairs Council, Taiwan's highest agency in charge of
formulating policy toward the mainland, on Wednesday. On Thursday the
caucus will call on the Straits Exchanges Foundation to discuss the
situation, said Chang.</P>
      <P>In the short term, the DPP will request mainland authorities meet
the demands raised by the party and Lin's family, while the party's
long-term goal is to improve the safety and security of Taiwan
businessmen on the mainland, as well as their property, through
negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile another DPP Legislator, Lin Cho-shui, said Sunday on a
television program that his party has overwhelmingly demanded that
cultural, athletic and educational exchanges between Taiwan and
mainland China be suspended because of Beijing's lack of respect for
human rights, as demonstrated in their handling of the aftermath of
Lin Ti-chuan's death.</P>
      <P>Explaining the DPP's decision to call for a halt to nearly all
bilateral exchanges with mainland China, Lin Cho-shui said the DPP
believes such a forceful response is needed for Beijing to improve
its handling of the situation.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that mainland China has become one of the most
dangerous investment destinations for Taiwan businessmen overseas.
Citing government statistics, he said as many as 30 Taiwan
businessmen have been killed in the mainland. In Xiamen alone, there
have been more than 200 reported kidnappings of Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>The DPP's decision to suspend cross-strait exchanges, he said, is
not based solely on Lin Ti-chuan's death; the decision is based in
the large number of Taiwan businessmen whose human rights are
obviously ignored by mainalnd authorities.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the move would pressure Beijing to
improve its protection of and respect for Taiwan people in the
mainland. If the DPP did not call for the suspension of ties, how
could the party expect to help protect Taiwan business interests in
the mainland and the personal safety of Taiwan tourists, who make
more than 10 million trips there every year? he asked.</P>
      <P>A telephone poll regarding the DPP's decision to cut cross-strait
exchanges was conducted during the program. Of the more than 30,000
people questioned about the DPP's decision, about two-thirds said
they agreed with the move.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih on Sunday
accused Beijing of improperly handling affairs related to the death
of Lin Ti-chuan and said the matter has raised dissatisfaction among
people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin, a 32-year-old Kaohsiung City councilwoman and member of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was abducted July 27
in Dalian City in the northeastern mainland province of Liaoning. She
died of a drug overdose after receiving repeated drug injections from
her abductors.</P>
      <P>She had gone to the mainland with her boyfriend, 36-year-old Wei
Tien-kang of Kaohsiung. Wei was likewise kidnapped, but later escaped
and reported in the incident to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Beijing has refused a demand by Lin's family that no anatomy be
performed on the body, and Wu said Beijing's refusal has sown
dissatisfaction among the people of Taiwan. The decision has
negatively affected cross-strait relations, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, the DPP's Kaohsiung mayoral candidate, also
expressed his indignation over Beijing's insistence on an anatomy.
He urged the public to support Lin's family in their request that the
body be returned untouched.</P>
      <P>Reports from the mainland indicate Lin's family is still at odds
with mainland authorities over the issue.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait convened an emergency meeting Sunday to discuss whether an
anatomy will be performed. The meeting was presided over by ARATS'
deputy chief Tang Shubei, and a decision on the matter was expected
some time Sunday evening.</P>
      <P>According to a tentative schedule, Lin's body will leave Dalian
Monday at 10 a.m. and arrive at Kaohsiung's Siaokang Airport at 5:30
p.m.</P>
      <P>Wei has expressed a desire to accompany his girlfriend's body
back to Taiwan, but his request was turned down by mainland
authorities, who insist that Wei stay to help with the investigation.</P>
      <P>On Sunday Wei said he had taken Lin to the mainland for
sightseeing and that he does not know when will be allowed to return
to Taiwan. He expressed his regret over Lin's death to her family.
"It's all my fault," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of some 3,000 people on Sunday
formed a long chain in front of the Presidential Office in downtown
Taipei, all of them wearing in-line skates.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer of the event, the 3,000 in-line
skaters, who formed a spectacular winding line, one kilometer long,
in front of the Presidential Office for nearly 40 minutes, have
broken the Guinness Book of World Records for the number of people in
an in-line skate chain.</P>
      <P>Despite scorching hot weather, in-line skating enthusiasts, most
of whom are children and young people, began to swarm into the plaza
in front of the Presidential Office Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Around 9 a.m., President Lee Teng-hui showed up and spoke briefly
to the participants before striking a gong to kick off the event.
President Lee said that seeing those active skaters, he had the
feeling that it is good to be young.</P>
      <P>President Lee also encouraged them to make the most of their time
and talent, stressing that with determination and perseverance,
nothing is impossible.</P>
      <P>Many government officials and public figures, including Lai
Kuo-chou, President Lee's son-in-law and director-general of ruling
Kuomintang's Youth Affairs Department, and Su Chi, vice
secretary-general to the president, were among those in the chain.</P>
      <P>But the most prominent participant was the KMT's Taipei mayoral
candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, an in-line skating novice. Though nearly
falling over, Ma, wearing a helmet and protective gear, soon proved
his athletic prowess.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan also became part of the event by giving
awards to skaters at the closing ceremony. As the Presidential Palace
is also open to visitors on Sunday, the area was crowded with people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Family members of Lin Ti-chuan, the
Kaohsiung City Councilwoman and opposition Democratic Progressive
Party member murdered last week in the mainland, are preparing to
stage a hunger strike if the mainland authorities do not cancel a
planned autopsy and allow her body to be returned to Taiwan
untouched.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Councilor Huang Cho-hsing, who accompanied Lin's
family to mainland China, announced her family's intentions while
speaking by phone with Lin's office in Kaohsiung. Huang and Lin's
parents flew to the mainland on Friday after being informed of her
death on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As local mainland Chinese public security authorities still
insist on carrying out an autopsy to determine the exact cause of
Lin's death, Huang said Lin's parents, who strongly oppose the idea,
are preparing to stage a hunger strike.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Legislator Huang Chao-hui, who is the acting head of
Lin's office in Kaohsiung, said Lin's friends will also stage a
hunger strike in Kaohsiung if mainland China refuses to allow the
return of Lin's body.</P>
      <P>Huang, however, said the situation should not be difficult to
resolve, as the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) has
promised to negotiate with the Beijing-based Association for
Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) over the issue.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are the semi-official bodies authorized by Taipei
and Beijing, respectively, to deal with bilateral exchanges in the
absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Women's Development Department held a commemorative
service in Kaohsiung to pay tribute to the 32-year-old Lin. It also
issued a statement demanding mainland authorities quickly resolve the
case and allow Lin's body to return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While condemning the mainland authorities' arrogance in their
refusal to allow the return of Lin's body, the statement said the
department would not break off contacts with the mainland authorities
and would continue to monitor their handling of the case.</P>
      <P>Lin and her boyfriend, Wei Tien-kang, left for mainland China on
Sunday for a three-day, private visit. The couple were abducted by a
group of armed men and taken to Haicheng City in the northeastern
province of Liaoning on Monday. Wei escaped from his kidnappers on
Wednesday and reported the incident to local police.</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing said its trade partners are
demanding too high a price for the country's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), according to reports from the Geneva-based
world trade body on Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The main obstacle to China's entering the WTO is certain member
countries demanding too high a price for China to pay in its current
economic development," trade minister Shi Guangsheng was quoted as
telling visiting French farm minister Louis Le Pensec.</P>
      <P>Shi, who did not specify which WTO members were being referred
to, urged France and the European Union (EU) to help "bring the price
down to a reasonable level if they really want China in the WTO," the
report said.</P>
      <P>The United States and many other industrialized countries have
resisted mainland China's repeated demand that it be allowed to enter
the global trade body under the relaxed terms offered to developing
countries.</P>
      <P>Opponents of mainland China's entry under such terms argue that
mainland China's economy is too big and its exports too strong to be
admitted under conditions designed to help the world's poorest
nations boost their economies through trade.</P>
      <P>Another sticking point with US and EU negotiators has been
mainland China's insistence on maintaining high tariffs on products
such as cars, chemicals, films and liquor, the report said.</P>

      <P>A ranking Kuomintang official on Monday
urged the public to be rational in passing judgment on the
government's mainland policy, despite calls by members of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party for Taiwan to suspend
bilateral exchanges with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The recent murder of DPP member and Kaohsiung City Councilwoman
Lin Ti-chuan in the mainland has aroused widespread concern in
Taiwan, KMT Secretary-General John Chang acknowledged, but he said
national security must be a consideration in the government's
dealings with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the KMT bases its mainland policy on popular opinion,
he stressed.</P>
      <P>Although some DPP members have called for a suspension of
exchanges with mainland China, Chang noted that any such proposal
must first be approved by the party. The KMT will continue to monitor
the issue, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said the KMT will also demand mainland Chinese authorities
properly handle the case and bring the culprits to justice quickly.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks followed an announcement Sunday by a five-member
DPP task force that it will present a four-point resolution to the
party's Central Standing Committee at its weekly meeting on
Wednesday, calling for a series of cross-strait exchange suspensions
to protest mainland China's handling of affairs related to Lin's
death.</P>
      <P>Lin, 32, was kidnapped Monday by a group of armed men during a
private visit to the northeastern province of Liaoning. She died two
days later of a drug overdose, apparently the result of repeated
injections given by her kidnappers.</P>
      <P>Lin's family traveled to the mainland on Friday in hopes of
bringing her body back to Taiwan on Monday. Local officials, however,

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO HANDLE KIDNAP-MURDER CASE WITH PRUDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Monday urged
Beijing to exercise prudence in handling issues related to last
week's kidnap-murder of a Taiwan councilor in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Liu made the appeal after a briefing from Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yuh on Kaohsiung City Councilwoman
Lin Ti-chuan's kidnap-murder in the northeastern mainland city of
Haicheng on July 29.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing the mainland authorities handle the
aftermath of Lin's tragic death with prudence, care, and thought for
future relations across the Taiwan Strait," said Liu, who
concurrently serves as convener of the Cabinet's mainland policy
panel.</P>
      <P>Liu said mainland authorities should respect the desire and
opinions of the Lin family, as well as the feelings of all Taiwan
people, in dealing with the case.</P>
      <P>"We regret that Beijing rejected the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation's plan to send members of its staff to accompany
Lin's grieving parents to the mainland to handle the aftermath of the
incident," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Liu said he doesn't think the government should
immediately suspend cross-strait exchanges to protest Beijing's
snubbing of the SEF's plan, as the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) has urged. Lin was a DPP member.</P>
      <P>"We should remain calm and keep a close watch on Beijing's
handling of the situation. If Beijing fails to deal with the case
satisfactorily, we'll take countermeasures," Liu said, adding that
the government should take into consideration overall national
interests and the well-being of all Taiwan's residents when
formulating its mainland policy.</P>
      <P>The vice premier went on to say that Lin's tragic death has once
again manifested many practical problems existing in cross-strait
exchanges, particularly the personal safety and property rights of
Taiwan businesspeople and ordinary travelers in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We hope Beijing will not ignore these issues any longer and will
immediately resume cross-strait dialogue to work out effective
measures to better protect the personal safety and legitimate rights
of Taiwan investors and travelers," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Chairman Chang said he hopes SEF Chairman C.F.
Koo's plan to make a landmark visit to the mainland this fall will
proceed smoothly.</P>
      <P>"If Koo's travel plans can be realized, he will be able to
exchange views with his mainland counterpart (Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait Chairman Wang Daohan) on these
issues," said Chang.</P>
      <P>The SEF is authorized by the ROC government to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the DPP's call for an across-the-board suspension
of cross-strait exchanges in the wake of Liu's kidnap-murder,
government spokesman Chen Chien-jen said the government consistently
respects the opinions expressed by the country's different political
parties.</P>
      <P>However, he said it is inappropriate for the government to
comment on views or opinions expressed by individual persons or
political parties.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that if mainland China fails to handle the Lin
case properly, it will certainly have an adverse bearing on the
feelings of the people of Taiwan, and on cross-strait ties in
general.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) said on
Monday that there is still room for further cuts in petroleum prices
in August.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said the cost of imported crude oil was US$11.62
per barrel in July, down by nearly US$1 dollar from the previous
month.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in the wake of a continued slide in crude
prices on the international market, the CPC cut petroleum prices by
2.85 percent in July, costing the CPC NT$700 million (US$20.29
million) in lost revenue.</P>
      <P>The CPC imported 18.72 million barrels of crude in July at a cost
of more than US$217 million.</P>
      <P>The officials said that while the Legislative Yuan has yet to
review the budget for the CPC in the new fiscal year, the company
itself has tentatively set this year's surplus at NT$22.4 billion
(US$649.27 million), the same figure as last year.</P>
      <P>The CPC recorded a pre-tax surplus of NT$3.85 billion (US$111.68

      <P>More than 1,200 people have been killed
and millions more have lost their homes in the worst flooding of
mainland China's Yangtze River since 1954, according to a report in
Sunday's Los Angeles Times.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Monday
urged a former medical technician to come forward and seek medical
treatment for AIDS as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The technician, who is in his 20s, left Shin Kong Wu Ho Su

that while the hospital lost contact with the technician after March,
there are no records of him having been pricked by needles during his

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WOMEN ACTIVISTS EXPRESS CONCERN TO INDONESIAN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Jakarta,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of women's rights activists from
Taiwan met with Indonesian Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiyah on
Monday to express their concern about atrocities committed by
Indonesian rioters against ethnic Chinese women.</P>
      <P>The delegation presented a three-point statement to Alawiyah
urging the Indonesian government to attach importance to the abuse of
women and girls during the political turmoil which swept the
Southeast Asian country in May.</P>
      <P>The statement said the Indonesian government should do its utmost
to investigate the organized atrocities committed against ethnic
Chinese women and girls during the chaotic period.</P>
      <P>"The Indonesian government should bring to justice all those who
have organized, instigated or committed brutalities against Chinese
women and girls during the May rioting," the statement said, adding
that Indonesian authorities should provide adequate compensation for
the victims.</P>
      <P>The statement also demanded that the Indonesian government take
all steps necessary to maintain law and order in order to protect the
personal safety of its citizens and to prevent any recurrence of
similar atrocities or misfortune.</P>
      <P>The statement urged the Indonesian government to promote harmony
between the minority ethnic Chinese and the majority ethnic
Indonesian racial groups, and to throw its support, encouragement and
assistance behind non-government organizations dedicated to promoting
racial integration and cooperation.</P>
      <P>It further demanded that the Indonesian authorities abolish any
law or regulation which discriminates against minority racial groups
and to protect their basic human rights and freedoms.</P>
      <P>The delegation, which arrived in Jakarta on Sunday, was
accompanied at the meeting with the Indonesian minister by ROC Deputy
Representative to Indonesia Chang Yung-lang.</P>
      <P>Responding to her guests, Alawiyah said not a single ethnic
Chinese woman has yet come forward to report the ordeals she endured
during the May rioting to the special task force formed by the
Indonesian Women's Affairs Ministry.</P>
      <P>Alawiyah said that although some Indonesian private groups claim
that 168 ethnic Chinese women and girls were raped during the riots,
many Indonesian people do not believe that the number of victims is
so high.</P>
      <P>Alawiyah told the delegation that she issued a statement on June
8 condemning the abuse of ethnic Chinese women. "I stressed in the
statement that such violent actions against these women have violated
human rights and the Indonesian constitution," she said.</P>
      <P>Alawiyah went on to say she has asked the 12 women police
officers at Indonesia's National Police Bureau, as well as volunteers
with various private organizations, to help investigate and interview
alleged victims.</P>
      <P>"All telephone calls or faxes received so far by the special task
force relating to the atrocities have been given by third parties,
not by victims themselves," Alawiyah said.</P>
      <P>"There were reports that 96 sexual assault victims simultaneously
went to a large Indonesian hospital to receive medical treatment.
However, investigations by my ministry's special task force show that
there were only nine victims in the hospital. One of the victims had
already died and eight others were injured. Most of the injured
sustained only minor injuries and didn't seem to have been raped,"
Alawiyah explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that Indonesian President B.J. Habibie is
strongly concerned about the incidents, Alawiyah said the first lady
is heading a special investigative team composed of five Cabinet
ministers, to probe the case.</P>
      <P>"This investigative team is scheduled to come up with a report in
three months," Alawiyah said, adding that any person who is found
guilty of committing atrocities will be given a 13-to-20-year jail
term.</P>
      <P>Alawiyah also promised that the Women's Affairs Ministry will
give support and assistance to abused women intending to go abroad
for medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-feng, a member of the Taiwan delegation, said it is
not uncommon that no victim is willing to come forward to report her
ordeals. "Indonesian investigators should conduct thorough checks of
clues provided by third parties in order to locate victims and their
abusers or attackers," said Wang, a lawyer and a former Taiwan
Control Yuan member.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA OFFICIAL WARNS LOCAL INVESTORS OF UNPREDICTABLE RENMINBI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Republic of China's
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) warned Taiwan businesspeople on
Monday to be aware of the risks of a devalued renminbi, the currency
of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the Department of Statistics
under the MOEA, said that the recent depreciation of the Japanese yen
is putting the Beijing authorities under greater pressure to devalue
the renminbi, and advised Taiwan investors to take all measures
necessary to avoid being affected.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is not a well-developed free economic market,
Chang pointed out, which means any devaluation of the currency
involves political considerations, making it hard to predict trends.</P>
      <P>The battered yen has continued its plunge in recent days, with
its exchange rate hovering at around 144 to the US dollar, close to
the rate of 146 to the greenback recorded when US President Bill
Clinton made his recent visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's newspapers have said openly in recent days that
if the downward spiral of the yen does not end soon, it will force
the Beijing authorities to devalue its currency. The People's Bank of
China has been intervening in its foreign exchange market since last
week, indicating that the renminbi is facing rather heavy pressure to
devalue.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOEA will provide Taiwan businesspeople with
sufficient information about forward foreign exchange trading and
spot foreign exchange trading, as well as offer advice about holding
US dollars, which are viewed as hard currency, so that Taiwan traders
in mainland China might avoid any losses resulting from a weaker
exchange rate.</P>
      <P>The MOEA official stressed that the most important task at the
moment is stabilizing Asia's economy and financial market, adding
that the value of the renminbi should not be judged based solely on
its impact upon mainland China's exports, but rather on its effect on
the Asian and world economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu on Monday urged
Jakarta to consider the feelings of the people of the Republic of
China and properly investigate allegations that some 200 ethnic
Chinese women were raped during rioting in May.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks while receiving a group of more than 200
protesters, led by Legislator Lee Ching-hua of the opposition New
Party (NP), and Chen Wei-cheng, president of the Indonesian Overseas
Chinese Association.</P>
      <P>Before visiting the Foreign Ministry, the protesters -- some
carrying placards that read "We Demand Justice and Compensation for
the Victims" or "Indonesian Government Please Note: Raping and
Killing Toward the Weak Woman. This Is Very Shameful Way of the
Indonesian Nation" -- demonstrated outside the Indonesian Economic
and Trade Office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>They met with the office's vice chairman, Ahmed Bey Sofwan, as
well as other office officials. Sofwan expressed regret over the
atrocities and said that the Indonesian government is caring for and
protecting the victims, and an investigation into the incidents is
underway, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee, an NP lawmaker from Taipei, read a protest letter that
called on the government to punish the rapists, immediately apologize
for the atrocities, provide medical care and compensation to the
victims and offer assurances that similar incidents will not happen
in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was born in Indonesia and educated in Taiwan, appealed
to the Indonesian government to protect and respect human rights, and
to treat fairly all Chinese Indonesians in accordance with the
country's constitution.</P>
      <P>He also asked the ROC Foreign Ministry to relax visa regulations
limiting how long Indonesian passport holders can stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his reply, the foreign minister said he will soon invite
related government agencies to a special meeting on the matter.</P>
      <P>Responding to protesters' calls for Taiwan to stop investing in
Indonesia, Hu said the Indonesian government has ordered an
investigation into the sexual assaults and has vowed repeatedly
to punish those responsible for the attacks.</P>
      <P>Hu said that, in view of public opinion in Taiwan, he hopes the
Indonesian government will properly handle the matter. Obviously, he
added, both ROC government policy toward Indonesia and Taiwan

      <P>More than 2,000 employees of Taiwan's
provincial government on Monday appealed to Provincial Governor James
Soong to help them secure working rights as the deadline for
downsizing the provincial government looms near.</P>
      <P>The employees gathered in front of the Provincial Government
building, located in Nantou County, central Taiwan, at 11:30 a.m.
Monday. Some carried placards and banners with messages such as
"Fight for Our Rights, Governor, Please Support Us," "We Want To
Survive," and "Don't Let Us Be Separated From Our Families."</P>
      <P>According to the constitutional amendment passed by the National
Assembly last July, the provincial government should be downsized as
part of an effort to upgrade government efficiency. In addition, the
elections for provincial governor and provincial assembly should be
abolished.</P>
      <P>At 11:45 a.m. Soong came out of his office to accept the
petition. Soong told the demonstrators that today was the most
painful day he had encountered since being elected to his current
post in the provincial government four years ago. He added that he
felt very sorry his employees had to take to streets to fight for
their rights.</P>
      <P>Soong also pointed out that some two years ago, when the issue of
downsizing the provincial government was raised, he foresaw protests.
He said that, unfortunately, no one at the central government wanted
to listen to him at that time.</P>
      <P>In a quivering voice, Soong stressed that what the provincial
government employees want is dignity, care and equal treatment.</P>
      <P>The central government is responsible for making arrangements for
the employees, Soong said, adding that the employees should have a
say in what their future will be.</P>
      <P>In the petition, the demonstrators said that the deadline for
downsizing the provincial government is approaching, but the central
government has made no specific plans about how to provide for
employees of the provincial government.</P>
      <P>They said that due to feelings of uncertainty about their future,
they have been forced to organize the "Taiwan Provincial Government
Employees Self-Rescue Alliance," to fight for their working rights.</P>
      <P>Two appeals were proposed in the petition. One is that their
basic working rights should be secured. The central government should
not force them to retire or dismiss them with severance money.
Second, they demanded that their new jobs should be in the same
geographic areas where they are working now. They should not be
forced to depart from their families and work in a different area.</P>
      <P>In addition, the employees demanded to meet with Premier Vincent
Siew and to be invited to attend the meetings regarding the
downsizing of the provincial government. They also said that the
central government should hold public hearings to on how to provide
for provincial government employees, should hold workshops to let the
employees know what will be done and should praise the contribution
the provincial government employees have made to the society.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Monday called for
the preservation of traditional Chinese culture and for the
advancement of an even greater Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remark at the opening of the third general meeting
of the World Chinese Writers Association, which was held at the Grand
Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Chinese authors from 36 countries are taking part
in the five-day meeting, which includes a seminar on Chinese culture
and literature.</P>
      <P>The president presented a "Cultural Contribution Award" and a
"Life-long Accomplishment Award" to Wang You-theng, chairman of the
General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China, and to noted
writer Lin Hai-ying in recognition of their outstanding contributions
to the promotion of international cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that both Chinese culture and literature are not
only important assets to mankind but also a precious treasure of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The president also praised overseas Chinese writers for their
contributions to Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>He noted that Chinese people began to emigrate from the mainland
several hundred years ago. Many such emigrants have strived to
preserve traditional Chinese culture, creating many beautiful and
great Chinese literary works. They have introduced new concepts and
offered a wider vision, and their works have had a profound impact on
Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Because of its unique geographical position and history,
Taiwan has also played an important role in the promotion of
Chinese culture, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He explained that during the past half century, Taiwan has
achieved miraculous economic and political development.</P>
      <P>In the future, Lee said, Taiwan will engage in cultural
development, preserving traditional culture on the one hand and

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PATHOLOGIST TO JOIN MAINLAND COUNTERPARTS IN EXAMINATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing authorities are allowing a Taiwan
pathologist to join its experts in examining the body of Kaohsiung
City Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan, said the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yao-chang, dean of the coroners department at National
Taiwan University's medical school, will fly to Hong Kong on Tuesday
and from there proceed to Haicheng, which is located in the
northeastern mainland province of Liaoning.</P>
      <P>Chen said he expects to arrive in Haicheng at about 10 p.m.
Tuesday, which means Lin's body will not be examined until Wednesday
at the earliest.</P>
      <P>A National Assembly member appointed by the DPP, Chen said his
mission is to help determine the cause of Lin's death while
preserving her body.</P>
      <P>He said he does not know, however, whether he will be allowed to
bring back blood, urine and tissue samples for further analysis,
adding that he must receive permission to do so from the mainland
authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen and Yen Wan-chin, director-general of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) Department of China Affairs, had
asked to travel to Haicheng along with Lin's family on Aug. 1 but
were denied permission by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Beijing later recanted and agreed to allow Chen looking on
during the examination at the request of Lin's fmaily as a condition
to carry out the examination, but Yen is still denied entry.</P>
      <P>Beijing made the decision after reaching an agreement with Lin's
family that an "examination", rather than an autopsy, would be
conducted on the 32-year-old city councilor and DPP member.</P>
      <P>Liaoning authorities originally argued that mainland law requires
an autopsy be performed to determine the cause of any unnatural
death. Lin's parents, however, want the body returned to Taiwan
untouched.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Liaoning medical examiners may inspect the
corpse and obtain cell samples but may not dissect the body, said a
staff member of Lin's Kaohsiung office.</P>
      <P>Lin's body is expected to be returned to Taiwan on Aug. 7 or 8,
said the staff member.</P>
      <P>Lin was kidnapped, along with her Taiwanese boyfriend, in Dalian,
located in Liaoning province, on July 27 while visiting the mainland.
She died two days later of a drug overdose after receiving repeated
injections from her abductors.</P>
      <P>Her boyfriend, Wei Tien-kang, escaped from the kidnappers and
reported the incident to the local police.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
confirmed on Tuesday that the locally developed anti-tactical
ballistic missile (ATBM) system has undergone an electronic
simulative test late last month.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry denied local press reports that the new
missile defense system will be ready for deployment in two years.</P>
      <P>"The Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology-developed
ATBM system already underwent an initial test-firing late last year
and also completed an electronic simulative test in late July," said
MND spokesman Gen. Kung Fan-ding.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ATBM anti-missile system is adapted from the
CIST-developed Tien-kung II (Sky Bow II) surface-to-air missile,
Kung said the military-run CIST is still developing several related
technologies.</P>
      <P>"We'll evaluate whether to mass-produce the new defense system
after the CIST completes development of certain key technologies,"
Kung explained, adding it is premature at this moment to predict
that the military will be able to finalize test-firming and
deployment of ATBM in two years' time.</P>
      <P>In the face of communist China's mounting missile threat, Kung
said Taiwan must beef up its anti-ballistic missile defense
capabilities to ensure national security and protect its people's
personal safety and property rights.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Kung said, the military is focusing
efforts on developing an ATBM defense system and a long-range radar
system to upgrade its early warning and air defense capabilities.</P>

Monday, but could not do so because local police insisted that an

    <HEADLINE>DPP CALLS FOR QUICK RETURN OF LIN'S BODY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite an earlier call to suspend
cross-strait exchanges, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) seems
to have softened its stance following an agreement between the family
of Lin Ti-chuan, a DPP member killed in mainland China, and local
police authorities on a post-mortem examination of Lin's body.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chun-hung, organizer of a five-member DPP task
force, said Tuesday that recent tensions between the two sides caused
by Lin's death would ease if mainland China agreed to allow her body
to return to Taiwan soon. He also urged mainland China to quickly
arrest the culprits and bring them to trial.</P>
      <P>The task force originally planned to present a four-point
resolution to the DPP's Central Standing Committee at its regular
weekly meeting on Wednesday, urging the party to stall exchanges with
the mainland. But Chang said now that they have decided to suspend
the call, pending a final decision by mainland China on the
disposition of Lin's body.</P>
      <P>Denying that the DPP has politicized the affair, he said the task
force took such a hardline approach in hopes of resolving the
incident.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came after the Taiwan media reported that Lin's
parents and local mainland Chinese police authorities have reached an
agreement to examine Lin's body without performing a full autopsy
before it is returned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin's parents had demanded that authorities release Lin's body
untouched, but local police had insisted on first performing an
autopsy.</P>
      <P>Lin, 32, was abducted and killed by a group of armed men last
week during a private visit to the northeastern mainland province of
Liaoning.</P>
      <P>Stressing that what happened to Lin was not an isolated
occurrence, Chang said the personal safety and property of Taiwan
businessmen in mainland China should be better protected.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan will call on the Mainland
Affairs Council Wednesday to discuss with officials issues related to
the protection of Taiwan business and investment interests in the
mainland, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Chou Po-lun, a DPP whip in the legislature, said the DPP's aim is
to relax tensions between the two sides and solve the problem, not to
suspend exchanges with mainland China. But he added that Lin's case
has underscored the need for both sides to resume talks
on technical issues.</P>

      <P>The Aerospace Industrial Development Corp.
(AIDC) invited interested strategic investors to buy its shares in a
presentation Tuesday in preparation for its privatization.</P>
      <P>With 905.59 million shares, the AIDC hopes to release more than
50 percent of them so that it can complete its goal of privatization
by the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>The AIDC made a public announcement in late July, inviting those
in domestic and foreign aviation, air shipping, electronics, metal
and steel, and financial industries to take part in Tuesday's
presentation.</P>
      <P>A screening team is expected to select strategic investors in the
first half of next year.</P>
      <P>AIDC, whose predecessor is the Aero Industrial Development Center
of Chungshan Institute of Science Technology under the Ministry of
National Defense, has developed the AT3 trainer plane and the
Indigenous Defense Fighter in recent years.</P>
      <P>AIDC Chairman Tsai Chun-huei said one of the priorities in
screening strategic investors is to ensure that after the
privatization, the AIDC will continue to serve the military.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that it is expected that AIDC will encounter slow
business in 2000 and 2001, and that those strategic investors that
bring in business opportunities will be given priority consideration.</P>
      <P>Economics officials expressed the hope that foreign and domestic
strategic investors could buy AIDC shares to help introduce business
and technology to help tap international markets, adding that the

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT BABY TRADING RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
under the National Police Administration announced on Tuesday it has
busted a criminal ring trading infants across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>CIB officers said they already arrested a key suspect involved in
the illegal trade on Monday.</P>
      <P>The suspect was identified as Hung Chih-hui, 45, who worked as an
instructor at a private driving training center in Taipei. Hung was
suspected to have been a go-between in the cross-strait baby
smuggling operation.</P>
      <P>The CIB was tipped off earlier this year that Wutien
Gynecology-Obstetrics Clinic on Neichiang Street in western Taipei
had been involved in cross-strait infant trade.</P>
      <P>It also uncovered in early July that the clinic had issued a
false birth certificate for an infant boy born out of wedlock by a
Taiwan businessperson in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Police then arrested Wutien's chief doctor, Tien Ching-chun, 83,
for questioning. Tien denied he had ever engaged in cross-strait
infant trading. He fled to mainland China shortly after being
released on bail.</P>
      <P>Police confiscated birth data and documents concerning more than
100 infants "born" at the clinic between 1995 and 1998 for study.
Through DNA tests on the infants and their parents, police found that
30 of the 100-plus babies examined do not have biological ties with
their current "parents."</P>
      <P>The "parents" of 11 suspected problem babies have admitted that
they are not the birth parents. They said Wutien clinic had told then
that the babies were born by local unmarried women.</P>
      <P>But CIB sources said most of the babies available at the clinic
were either stolen, swindled or bought from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The sources said mainland human smuggling rings sold those babies
to their Taiwan counterparts for 10,000 renminbi (US$1,208) each. The
mainland criminal elements usually placed babies in cupboard cases
smuggled into Taiwan by fishing boats. The mainland criminals laced
sleeping pills in milk to make babies sleep to facilitate shipment.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Taiwan human smugglers would then send
the mainland babies to Wutien clinic for sale. The clinic allegedly
issued false birth certificates for those babies and sold them to
infertile couples or women who sought children. Each mainland baby
was sold for NT$300,000 (US$8,721), the sources said, adding that
Hung Chih-hui acted as a go-between in the trade.</P>
      <P>Police said they had monitored Hung's activities for some time
before arresting him on Monday. "We did find that Hung maintained
unusually close ties with Wutien clinic," said a CIB officer.</P>
      <P>Police also detained a 78-year-old woman doctor, Liu-Han
Hsia-chen, for questioning on Monday. Liu-Han admitted that she had
falsified 12 birth certificates, but she denied any knowledge of the
origins of those babies. She was released on bail late Monday
evening.</P>
      <P>CIB officers said they will further investigate the case in order
to bring to justice other possible accomplices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC NOT OPPOSED TO `TRACK TWO' DIALOGUE CHANNELS: FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Tuesday
that the Republic of China has never rejected a proposal to forge
"Track Two" informal Taipei-Washington-Beijing dialogue channels.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks while fielding questions at a meeting of the
Control Yuan's Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) believes that the
so-called "Track Two" informal dialogue channels with the United
States can provide a forum to help American media and academics
better understand the ROC's policy toward mainland China and the
current state of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"As long as the `Track Two' informal dialogue channels do not
affect the operations of the `Track One' formal dialogue channels, we
welcome any form of dialogue or consultations with both Washington
and Beijing," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>The "Track Two" proposal was initiated by former US Defense
Secretary William Perry during trips he made to mainland China and
Taiwan earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Perry said Taipei and Beijing should forge "Track Two" informal
dialogue channels with the United States to reduce tension and avoid
military confrontation in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hu told Control Yuan members that there are already several
channels for informal Taipei-Washington dialogue.</P>
      <P>"Several US think tanks have invited scholars and experts from
both sides of the Taiwan Strait to conduct closed-door bilateral or
three-way discussions on cross-strait or Asia-Pacific regional
issues," Hu said, adding that American officials and diplomats from
both sides of the Taiwan Strait stationed in the United States also
attended some of those seminars.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister went on to say that Taiwan has never
rejected the participation of mainland representatives in those
seminars.</P>
      <P>He further said that several Taiwan think tanks will join forces
with their American counterparts to sponsor large-scale symposia in
the United States in the near future to discuss US relations with
Taipei and Beijing, as well as cross-strait ties and other matters of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Hu said that although the "Track Two" informal dialogue channels
cannot replace formal dialogue channels, they can help opinion
leaders and shapers from Taipei, Beijing and Washington to forge
consensus and minimize misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>Such informal dialogue is also expected to influence policy
formation and opinions of the three sides in the long run, he noted.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Hu said, Taipei
and Washington have maintained close contact. "The officially
sanctioned or authorized dialogue channels between us have operated
smoothly," he added.</P>
      <P>As for cross-strait ties, Hu said Taiwan hopes that informal
Taipei-Washington-Beijing dialogue can help make mainland
authorities understand that both Taipei and Beijing belong to a
"divided China".</P>
      <P>"We hope Beijing will understand that before China is unified,
the ROC must take part in international activities to ensure
survival and development for the 21.8 million Taiwan people. Beijing
should stop its attempt to isolate and suppress Taiwan in the world
community," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The minister added that the ROC also hopes that regular dialogue
between the two officially authorized intermediary bodies -- Taipei's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- can be resumed as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended institutionalized SEF-ARATS
dialogue in mid-1995 to vent its anger at ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's landmark visit to the United States in June 1995. Beijing
regarded Lee's visit as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Responding to a proposal by a Control Yuan member that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait join forces to help ethnic Chinese women
raped or abused by Indonesian rioters during May's political turmoil
in that country, Hu said the overture requires further study by all
relevant government agencies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The impact of smuggling in mainland China
has reached an unprecedented scope, size and depth, affecting the
mainland's reform and modernization efforts, said the People's Daily
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>An article in the Communist Party mouthpiece reported that
smuggling by sea has become particularly rampant recently, as
watches, cigarettes and home appliances that constituted most
contraband have given to raw materials, such as oil and materials
used in the chemical engineering industry.</P>
      <P>Of the total amount of known smuggling in the mainland last year,
65 percent, or 5,575 million renminbi worth of goods, was detected by
mainland China's customs house.</P>
      <P>Making matters worse is the involvement of mainland corporations
in illegal smuggling, according to the story.</P>
      <P>The smuggling has cost the government billions of renminbi in
revenue, which has affected the mainland's economy.</P>
      <P>The illegal activity has undermined attempts to create open
markets, stifled fair competition, hurt the interests of legitimate
enterprises and negatively affected mainland markets and industries,
as well as state-run enterprises.</P>
      <P>The smuggling activities have poisoned the common practices of
the society and undermined the authority of the government, stressed

    <HEADLINE>MND SAYS IT WON'T  DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
reiterated Tuesday that it is Taiwan's firm policy not to do research
on, develop, or produce chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>An MND spokesman made the statement when asked by the press to
comment on an article in Tuesday's Asian Wall Street Journal by
Gerald Segal, director of studies at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies in London.</P>
      <P>The article, titled "Taiwan's Nuclear Card," said that, "In order
to forestall American efforts to push them into the arms of mainland
China, representatives of the Taipei government are embarking on a
subtle campaign to remind the world that Taiwanese military retains
the option of completing the development of a nuclear deterrent."</P>
      <P>"They evidently hope that a nuclear card will force the US to
reaffirm its commitment to protect Taiwan's security, in order to
avoid seeing the stand-off across the Taiwan Strait go nuclear," it
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's armed forces only conduct defensive training against
chemical, biological, and nuclear attacks, the spokesman said,
adding that there is no point in speculating on Taiwan's capability
to produce nuclear weapons. The MND has made similar statements
before.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that it is the responsibility of any nation to
defend its own national security, and that Taiwan has never asked the
United States for protection. "We only hope that the US government
will continue to sell us defensive weapons according to the Taiwan
Relations Act," he said, refuting an assertion in the article that "a
nuclear card will force the US to reaffirm its commitment to protect
Taiwan's security."</P>
      <P>In the article Segal quoted Australian analyst Andrew Mack as

and engineers have the technical ability to build nuclear weapons."
However, Segal said Taiwan's nuclear weapons program remains

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGED NOT TO POLITICIZE COUNCILWOMAN'S DEATH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking mainland Chinese negotiator with
Taiwan on Tuesday urged both sides to act calmly, rationally, and
practically in the wake of the murder last week in mainland China of
Lin Ti-chuan, a member of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Tang Shubei, vice chairman of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), promised that the
mainland authorities will arrest the criminals quickly, and allow
Lin's family to bring her body back to Taiwan as soon as possible. He
also called on the Taiwan side to cooperate in evidence gathering.</P>
      <P>Expressing "deep regret and shock" over the tragedy, Tang said
the ARATS has already dispatched Vice Secretary-General Liu Gangqi to
help Lin's family handle the relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>He said that the kidnap-murder was the result of a financial
dispute and an isolated case, urging the DPP not to use the incident
to affect bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the long-expected second meeting between ARATS
Chairman Wang Daohan and his Taiwan counterpart, Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Tang said Koo is
still welcome to visit the mainland this fall.</P>
      <P>However, he went on to say that if Taipei fails to respond
clearly to Beijing's proposal that the two sides start procedural
talks to pave the way for future political negotiations, there will
be no fixed agenda for the talks, and Koo and Wang will be free to
talk about whatever they choose.</P>
      <P>Chang Rong-kung, director of the ruling Kuomintang's Department
of Mainland Research, said in Beijing that Taiwan is not opposed to
holding political negotiations with mainland China. But he claimed
that Lin's murder has demonstrated yet again that talks on technical
issues arising from bilateral exchanges are far more important to
people's interests.</P>
      <P>Chang, the first ranking KMT official to visit mainland China
since 1949, is currently in Beijing to attend a seminar on
cross-strait relations. He made the remarks following a private
meeting to discuss general cross-strait affairs with Tang.</P>
      <P>The ARATS' refusal to allow SEF officials to accompany Lin's
family to the mainland has provoked strong discontent within the DPP,
Chang said, adding that this may affect the future development of
bilateral ties and will not benefit mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the planned Koo-Wang meeting, Chang said it would be
better if their deputies can meet first to make prior arrangements
regarding the talks.</P>
      <P>Chang also quoted Tang as saying that the SEF and the ARATS are
irreplaceable in cross-strait negotiations. The two semi-official
organizations are authorized by Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to
engage in bilateral exchanges in the absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang met for the first time in Singapore in 1993,
breaking an impasse of almost half a century between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, regular SEF-ARATS discussions were unilaterally
suspended by Beijing in 1995 after President Lee Teng-hui paid a
visit to the United States earlier that year, a move seen by Beijing
as a covert attempt to promote Taiwan independence.</P>

      <P>The overall crime rate in Singapore rose
4.7 percent in the first six months of this year over the same period
last year, the Singapore Police Department said Monday.</P>
      <P>There were 23,884 reported crimes in the first half of this year,
1,073 more than in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Releasing the statistics Monday, the Singapore police said there

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN ERROR MAY BE BEHIND WARSHIP FIRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fire that claimed the lives of seven
seamen aboard a naval ship on Monday might have been caused by human
error, a senior naval officer said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Initial investigations show that failure to properly close the
root valve of a boiler on destroyer No. DDG926, also known as the
Suei Yang, might have been the cause of the tragic incident," said
Naval Fleet Commander Lai Kuang-shu.</P>
      <P>"The failure was not a big mistake, but the fire raged too fast,"
an emotional Lai said, adding that he himself should be held
responsible for the incident.</P>
      <P>"Inexperience and inadequate training on the part of crew members
was the main reason for the tragedy, but I don't blame any crewman. I
myself should be blamed for this misfortune," a tearful Lai said.</P>
      <P>He expressed his heartfelt condolences and apologies to the
families of the victims, adding that the Ministry of National Defense
has formed a special task force to investigate the accident, and has
also assigned personnel to provide counseling and assistance for the
families of the dead.</P>
      <P>Six of the deceased were seamen second class, while the seventh
was a petty officer third class. They will all be buried in a
military cemetery, Lai said.</P>
      <P>He further said military medical personnel will do their utmost
to help rehabilitate five additional injured sailors.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred at around 2:00 p.m. on Monday when the
vessel was on a routine training mission off the coast of southern
Taiwan near the Tsoying naval base.</P>
      <P>The Suei Yang is one of Taiwan's Yang-class destroyers, which the
navy purchased from the United States more than four decades ago.</P>
      <P>Although most the Yang-class warships are on the verge of
retirement, the navy has still spent a lot of money to modernize the
weapons systems aboard the aging vessels. The Suei Yang boasts one of
the best weapons systems among the ships of its class.</P>
      <P>Naval authorities said that with the exception of its boiler
room, the Suei Yang did not sustain serious damage in Monday's fire.
The ship will resume service in about two months after the necessary
repairs and maintenance have been carried out.</P>

its economic connection with the rest of the world, according to a

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People residing in mountainous areas of
Taiwan were warned on Tuesday to take precautions against landslides
following the passage of typhoon Otto across the island.</P>
      <P>The light typhoon made landfall in the easthern county of Taitung
on Tuesday noon, bringing with it strong winds and heavy downpours.
Weathermen warned the storm was increasing in force and moving
northwest, although the eye of the typhoon left Taiwan at Taichung at
around 6:00 p.m.</P>
      <P>Meteorologists at the Central Weather Bureau said the island is
still in the radius of the typhoon, adding that the bureau will not
call off the land typhoon warning until midnight, when the storm is
expected to be entirely away from the island.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday evening, Typhoon Otto had killed one person and
injured another in Taitung County, and had caused nearly 20,000
households there to suffer blackouts, according to the Central
Natural Disasters Prevention and Relief Center.</P>
      <P>Shenmu Village in Nantou County was again beset by landslides
triggered by heavy rains brought by the storm, closing roads to the
mountain village and trapping residents and a number of tourists, the
center reported.</P>
      <P>The small village was devastated by mudslides and flooding in
August 1996, when Typhoon Herb struck Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The center warned that similar mudflows may occur in eastern
mountainous areas in Hualien, Taitung and Ilan counties.</P>
      <P>The center further said that air, train and maritime traffics
were all suspended in Taitung County because of the typhoon, while
flight services in Hualien and Pingtung, as well as to the offshore
Green Island and Lanyu, were suspended.</P>
      <P>Several roads have been washed out in Hualien and Taitung
counties, the center reported.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, reports from the Central Weather Bureau indicated that
in addition to the eastern area, heavy rain has also affected the

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has secretly drafted a new
"three-pronged" strategy against Taipei, according to a report
appearing in the latest issue of Open magazine, which hits newsstands
on Aug. 5.</P>
      <P>The report in the Hong Kong magazine, citing well-informed
sources in Beijing, notes that Beijing's Political Bureau drafted the
new strategy aimed at reunification with Taiwan in the wake of US
President Bill Clinton's tour of mainland China.</P>
      <P>The three prongs of the strategy include strategy toward the
United States, strategy toward political parties in Taiwan, and
strategy toward the people of Taiwan, the report says.</P>
      <P>In it's strategy toward the United States, President Jiang Zemin
will utilize his newly established relationship with Clinton to ask
him to put further pressure on Taiwan, including:</P>
      <P>-- Asking Clinton to influence American politicians to reduce
their hostility toward Beijing;</P>
      <P>-- Requesting Washington to bar US entry to activists who
advocate Taiwan independence;</P>
      <P>-- Asking the United States to further limit the activities of
Taiwan officials in the United States, including ministerial-level
officials, in addition to limiting visits by higher-level officials;</P>
      <P>-- Using influence to stop Taiwan from entering international
organizations, including the World Trade Organization;</P>
      <P>-- Requesting the United States to further limit its arms sales
to Taiwan; and</P>
      <P>-- Asking the US to influence other nations to follow the US
example by adopting the "three-noes" policy regarding Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In it's strategy against Taiwan, the sources pointed out that the
overthrowing of President Lee Teng-hui will become a priority task
for Beijing in the future.</P>
      <P>As for it's strategy toward the people of Taiwan, the sources
said, Beijing has decided to adopt a two-pronged offensive, using the
strategies "intimidate with force," and "beguile with money."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRIP TO MAINLAND CHINA BY ROC PRESIDENT MIGHT BE RAISED IN KOO-WANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Cheng-fu said on Tuesday that he might explore the possibility of
a trip to mainland China by ROC President Lee Teng-hui when he meets
his mainland counterpart this fall.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that an international event such as the annual
summit of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum would
be an ideal occasion for a preliminary get-acquainted meeting between
Lee and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Koo said the
possibility is slim because of Beijing's wariness of such an
encounter.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Koo told local reporters at a press conference, he
would like to exchange views on a possible visit to mainland China by
Lee when he meets with Chairman Wang Daohan of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) . Lee offered to make
such a trip in his inauguration speech.</P>
      <P>Other issues of mutual concern will certainly be on the meeting
agenda, including political topics and the possibility of formal
talks, Koo said, apparently in an attempt to persuade Beijing to
resume regular contacts between the SEF and the ARATS.</P>
      <P>Koo said political issues could be included on the agenda
of the second formal round of negotiations between him and Wang
sometime in the future.</P>
      <P>Taipei has previously said that political topics should not be
discussed until negotiations on technical aspects of cross-strait
relations have been carried out.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang held their historic first round of talks in
Singapore in 1993, and were scheduled to have a second round in 1995.
These talks were shelved indefinitely by Beijing after President Lee
Teng-hui's trip to the United States in June 1995.</P>
      <P>The chilly ties warmed up somewhat earlier this year when SEF
Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng visited Beijing, followed by a
visit to Taipei on July 26 by ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Li
Yafei.</P>
      <P>The visit to mainland China by Koo is in the pipeline for this
fall, although Beijing would rather describe Koo's rendezvous with
Wang a meeting, rather than a round of talks.</P>
      <P>A detailed itinerary for Koo's trip has not yet been worked out
because of the political wangling over the nature and agenda of the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Koo said the recent killings of a Taiwan councilwoman and a
Taiwan businessman in mainland China underline the importance of
resuming regular contacts between the SEF and the ARATS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIA, CAL FORGE MOU FOR CLOSER TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Airlines (SIA) and China Airlines
(CAL) on Tuesday forged a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
establishing a strategic business alliance to further consolidate
cooperation between the airlines.</P>
      <P>The MOU was first signed by CAL Chairman Chiang Hung-I in Taipei
Tuesday morning and was then flown aboard a CAL airplane to
Singapore, where SIA Deputy Chairman and CEO Cheong Choong Kong inked
it later in the day.</P>
      <P>Under the MOU, CIA will initially buy 5 percent to 10 percent of
CAL's shares, initiating a company stock exchange between the two
companies. Buying 10 percent of CAL's shares would cost SIA an
estimated US$117 million, said CAL spokesman Steve Yang.</P>
      <P>Also stipulated in the draft agreement are joint aircraft
purchases and a code-sharing program, under which CAL will be allowed
to sell SIA seats on Europe-bound flights while SIA will be able to
sell CAL seats on US-bound flights.</P>
      <P>SIA will also provide CAL with aviation safety and flight
management training, while CAL will provide catering, ground
maintenance and cargo services.</P>
      <P>A formal agreement on the MOU is expected to be signed in six
months, said Yang.</P>
      <P>The knotting of cooperative ties between SIA and CAL is seen an
eyebrow raiser in the international airline industry at a time when
most regional airlines are suffering from unprecedented sluggishness
as Asian economies remain in the doldrums.</P>
      <P>SIA, often named as one of the world's best airlines, posted a
pre-tax profit of S$1.17 billion in the last fiscal year, up 8.9
percent over its year-earlier level. CAL, which is known for
generating one of the highest profit levels of all Asian airlines,
has no plans to lower its fiscal 1998 profit-target of US$79 million,
despite its worst-ever airline crash last February.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING OFFICIAL REAFFIRMS WELCOME TO KOO'S PLANNED VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Chang Long and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's top Taiwan affairs
official reaffirmed on Wednesday that Taiwan's chief negotiator with
Beijing is welcome to visit the mainland this fall.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
Beijing's State Council, made the statement while meeting with Chang
Jung-kung, director of the Mainland Research Department of Taiwan's
ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"We welcome the planned visit to the mainland in autumn by C. F.
Koo, chairman of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF)," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen, who concurrently serves as director of the Office for
Taiwan Affairs under the Communist Party of China, further said the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should conduct political talks as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan has difficulties opening cross-strait negotiations on
political issues at the moment, the two sides should at least hold
talks on procedural issues, including possible meeting date and
venue, to pave the way for political talks," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he hopes last week's kidnapping and murder
in northeastern mainland China of Kaohsiung City Councilwoman Lin
Ti-chuan will not affect cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen said relevant mainland authorities are doing their utmost to
handle related affairs, including pursuing all those involved in the
crime.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chang said Taiwan hopes the top day-to-day affairs
managers of the two intermediary bodies on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can meet first to set the agenda for a planned meeting
between Koo and his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
during Koo's mainland trip.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, the long talked-about Koo-Wang meeting will be able
to achieve more constructive results," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang further said mainland China, while pushing for cross-strait
political talks, should not ignore the many practical issues that are
closely related to the rights and interests of people on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait and that require concerted efforts by both sides
to address immediately.</P>
      <P>"We hope SEF and ARATS can resume regular dialogue and
consultations on practical issues in the near future for the
well-being of people on both sides of the strait," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended institutionalized SEF-ARATS
dialogue shortly after ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark
visit to the United States in June 1995. Beijing viewed Lee's visit
as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that the KMT's mainland policy focuses on
pursuing peaceful and constructive cross-strait interaction. As for
China's unification, Chang said, the goal hinges on the
democratization of all of China.</P>
      <P>"The pace of unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
depends on progress in mainland China's democratization," Chang
stressed, adding the KMT is pleased to see that mainland China has
held self-government elections at grass-roots levels.</P>
      <P>Chang is currently is Beijing to attend a seminar on cross-strait
affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA GREEN LIGHTS CETRA'S PLANS TO BRANCH INTO THE MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang on
Wednesday gave his approval to the China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) branching out into mainland China.</P>
      <P>CETRA, a non-profit organization supervised by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA), has long been a major trade-promotion arm of
Taiwan, one that plays an important role in the island's foreign
trade.</P>
      <P>Wang's approval marks the MOEA's second major gesture of goodwill
toward mainland China since June of this year, when the ministry
agreed to allow 29 Taiwan businesses and industries to establish
liaison offices or offshoot operations in the mainland. Those
receiving permission are involved in such businesses and industries
as stocks, bonds and securities; construction; real estate; travel
and tourism; and import and export trade.</P>
      <P>Whether CETRA will be allowed to set up affiliates in the
mainland still hinges on the Mainland Affairs Council -- Taiwan's top
agency in charge of charting the island's policy toward the mainland
-- said Chintan Huang, deputy executive secretary of the MOEA's
Investment Commission. Although the MOEA has considered CETRA's bid
from an economic perspective, MAC will consider it from a political
one.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen, who reportedly have invested at least US$2.3
billion in mainland China over the past decade, have long yearned for
more direct and efficient government-initiated services, as those
offered by the Straits Exchange Foundation are often limited and
indirect, according to CETRA Chairman Lin Chen-kuo, who visited
mainland China and met with Taiwan investors a couple of months ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC POLITICAL PARTIES ADJUST TO NEW REALITIES (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>United States President Bill Clinton's
reiteration of the "three noes" policy on Taiwan is forcing the
Republic of China's major political parties to readjust their
approaches towards mainland China.</P>
      <P>In a commentary published on Wednesday, The Straits Times
newspaper of Singapore said the ruling Kuomintang, for one, has found
that it will have to accept political negotiation earlier than it
would have liked to, it said.</P>
      <P>Before the two summit meetings between Clinton and mainland
China's President Jiang Zemin, the KMT's strategy was to engage
mainland China in talks on functional issues while avoiding political
matters.</P>
      <P>The rationale for this was that success in settling practical
problems would pave the way for handling the more difficult political
issues.</P>
      <P>Beijing, however, preferred to settle "matters of principle"
first, its position being that as long as both sides agreed to the
"one China" principle, all practical issues could be solved easily.</P>
      <P>The KMT was forced to concede on this. In a National Unification
Council meeting held to take stock of the Beijing summit, Mainland
Affairs Council Chairman Chang King-yuh warned that Taiwan should be
"psychologically prepared for political negotiation."</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui agreed to "hold consultations based on the
reality of a divided China and sign a cross-strait peace agreement,
thereby ending the state of hostility and promoting harmony in
cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>This proposal to sign a peace agreement is similar to one made by
Jiang in his program for cross-strait ties announced in 1995.</P>
      <P>However, there is one significant difference.</P>
      <P>Jiang proposed that the peace treaty be signed under the "one
China" principle, while Lee's counter-proposal was that it be signed
"based on the reality of a divided China."</P>
      <P>The rhetoric of "one China" versus "one divided China" reflects
the diametrically opposing positions taken by mainland China and
Taiwan, the commentary noted. Yet, both sides agree that it could be
the starting point for political negotiations.</P>
      <P>The largest opposition party, the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), is also feeling the pressure to speed up
dialogue with the Chinese Communist Party, the commentary said.</P>
      <P>The DPP's policy had been one of "strengthening our own base
while moving westward," but after Clinton's mainland visit, the party
was forced to review its priorities.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chiou I-jen paid a four-day visit to the
mainland city of Xiamen on July 24. To quell internal opposition, he
did not go in his official capacity, and purposely avoided political
centers such as Beijing and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Chiou, who used to dub any Taiwan politician visiting the
mainland a "traitor," returned from the trip in quite an upbeat mood.</P>
      <P>He defended his trip, describing it as a brave move. He insisted
that, as the international environment is worsening for Taiwan, it
would be fatal if the island continued to reject exchanges with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang recently advocated the concept
of "one system, one country" as a means to break the present impasse,
the commentary said.</P>
      <P>According to this concept, Taiwan will wait until mainland China
undertakes political reforms to close the gap between the two sides.
Only then will they have more common ground to hold discussions on
"one country."</P>
      <P>This represented a major departure from the party's
pro-independence program, the commentary noted.</P>
      <P>Hsu also expressed his wish to visit Beijing if he could secure a
meeting with Premier Zhu Rongji.</P>
      <P>Given his stature in the opposition movement, the DPP
heavyweight's change of mind came as a surprise to many, the
commentary said.

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Party, Taiwan's third-largest
party, used to advocate "one China" on Taiwan's terms, the commentary
continued.</P>
      <P>It has since changed its tack, and now calls for "peaceful
negotiation to protect Taiwan and reject independence."</P>
      <P>Its spokesman for mainland affairs announced that the party plans
to set up a Beijing office to facilitate this change.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the above that all three major parties have been
adjusting their cross-strait policies carefully to take into account
the new reality, the commentary said.</P>
      <P>Worst affected were the country's pro-independence advocates,
because the "three noes" policy obliterates their political space
entirely, it commented.</P>
      <P>A strong sense of being cornered has forced them to adopt a more
drastic and militant approach, the commentary noted.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Independence Party, for example, has advocated holding
an immediate referendum on independence. While it is a tiny party,
its reaction has underlined another fact: intensified international
pressure could prove counterproductive, it commented.</P>
      <P>Past opinion polls have shown that there is a strong correlation
between external pressure and support for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The latest opinion poll conducted to gauge public reaction to the
Sino-US summit again confirmed this correlation, according to the
newspaper.</P>
      <P>It showed, for the first time, that support for "eventual
independence" (44 percent) exceeds support for "eventual unification"
(34 percent) by a significant margin.</P>
      <P>This finding is something the political parties cannot afford to
ignore, the commentary concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE COMMUNIST MILITARY FORGET THE LONG MARCH: PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since Beijing adopted its openness and
reform policies two decades ago, the Chinese communist military has
forgotten the traditional spirit of the revolutionaries who made
history as soldiers in Mao Zedong's Long March.</P>
      <P>Instead, they have devoted themselves to making money, setting up
a multi-billion dollar commercial empire, a New Delhi-based
English-language daily said in an editorial on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Now, an order from mainland China's President Jiang Zemin for the
military to relinquish this empire, as part of his moves to root out
corruption in the army, could be a stunning revelation of what is
happening to the descendants of the revolutionaries, The Hindu said
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"If the Chinese army is now running multi-billion dollar
commercial enterprises including five-star hotels, it is perhaps
because old visions fade, yielding to the new reality, part of which
is the creeping in of smuggling, corruption and the rest of the
capitalist ills which the Maoists were committed to ending," the
paper said.</P>
      <P>"With the objectives spelt out by the establishment failing to
inspire the army and thanks to the glitter of the gains from
corruption, the Chinese army has obviously become morally very
vulnerable, much to the dismay of Jiang Zemin," the paper said.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said that if the old revolutionaries, still
clinging to and cherishing their ideology, see what is going on with
detachment, they will perhaps realize that mainland China cannot
remain an island in a world where expediency influences behavior and
dictates policy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY MUST INTENSIFY TRAINING: PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday
expressed his concern about a fire on a naval warship earlier this
week that killed seven crew members and injured five others.</P>
      <P>At a weekly meeting of the ruling Kuomintang's Central Standing
Committee in his capacity as KMT chairman, Lee said that the mishap
underscores the need for the military to intensify manpower training.</P>
      <P>The president said he called a meeting of top military brass on
Tuesday to discuss the cause of the tragic incident.</P>
      <P>"An analysis of the initial investigation shows that the deadly
incident was related more to a manpower shortage and inadequate
training than to the age of the warship," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Quoting military sources, Lee said Monday's fire on the
Yang-class Sueiyang destroyer was caused by mishandling of a boiler
in the warship's rear boiler room.</P>
      <P>"The incident indicates that the military should reinforce troop
training and recruit more non-commissioned officers with specialized
skills to avoid the recurrence of a similar misfortune," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yi said the
government should set aside a larger budget for renovation of weapons
systems and other military equipment, in addition to strengthening
manpower training and combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong said the government should
pay more attention to the gap between policy making and execution,
referring to problems involving newly acquired warplanes, such as
F-16 and Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters being damaged by pigeons.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Navy Fleet Command announced on Wednesday that a
public funeral for the seven deceased Sueiyang crewmen will be held
at the Tsoying naval base in southern Taiwan on Sunday.</P>
      <P>A fleet command spokesman said all seven dead seamen will be
given posthumous citations and promotions. "Flags on all warships
berthed at the Tsoying naval base will be flown at half-mast on the
day of the funeral to show respect for the dead," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He also said the military has formed a special task force to
investigate into the exact cause of the accident. "The navy will also
conduct an across-the-board examination of engineering equipment on
all Yang-class destroyers now in service," the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Noting that naval authorities will offer psychological counseling
to all personnel serving aboard the more than 10 Yang-class warships
in service in the ROC navy, the spokesman said the fleet command
hopes all naval units will learn a lesson from the incident. "We hope
all units will strengthen security education and tighten discipline
to avoid the recurrence of a similar tragedy."</P>
      <P>The deadly incident happened at 2:05 p.m. on Monday in the rear
boiler room of the destroyer as the ship was carrying out a routine
training mission some 18 nautical miles off the Tsoying naval base in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Sueiyang is one of the Yang-class destroyers bought from the
United States more than four decades ago. Although most of the ships
are on the verge of retirement, the navy has spent a lot of money
modernizing the weapons systems aboard the aging vessels. The
Sueiyang boasts one of the best weapons systems among the vessels of
its class.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Otto left Taiwan in the early hours
of Wednesday, roaring westward into mainland China's Fujian Province,
the Central Weather Bureau reported.</P>
      <P>Bureau meteorologists called off land and sea typhoon warnings on
Wednesday, but said that accumulated rain brought by the typhoon to
central and southern mountainous areas has amounted to some 400
millimeters. They warned that any further downpours could trigger
flooding or mudslides in the worst-affected areas.</P>
      <P>Warm and cloudy summer weather has returned to the island in
Otto's wake, the weathermen said, forecasting that showers might
occur over the next few days.</P>
      <P>The typhoon, which made landfall in the eastern county of Taitung
on Tuesday, has been blamed for four deaths, five injuries and one
disappearance.</P>
      <P>A resident of southern Chiayi County was killed by falling stones
while driving on Tuesday. His wife and a child, who were also in the
car, were both injured, according to the Disaster Prevention and
Relief Center under the Ministry of Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>In central Nantou County, a head-on collision at the height of
the storm claimed three lives and seriously injured another, while a
Taitung resident and a Tainan resident were reported hurt by falling
objects.</P>
      <P>The center also said that an angler swept into the sea in Hualien
County was missing and believed dead. Rescue teams were still
searching for him.</P>
      <P>The center reported that a number of roads in Chiayi and Nantou
counties have been damaged by landslips resulting from heavy rain,
trapping residents of some mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday noon, about 230 residents of Nantou County's
Shenmu Village were still cut off, with their only traffic link yet
to be repaired, according to the center.</P>
      <P>The small village was devastated by landslides and flooding in
August 1996, when Typhoon Herb struck Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Four domestic airports in Taitung, Hualien, Green Island and
Orchid Island were closed for the duration of the typhoon, with all
flight services suspended. Rail links were also affected, but
services began returning to normal on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>More than 87,000 households suffered blackouts, with Taitung and
Hualien counties the most seriously affected, official statistics
show.</P>
      <P>Several roads in Hualien, Taitung, Kaohsiung and Pintung counties
were washed out, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, agricultural losses islandwide have been
estimated at NT$250 million (US$7.29 million), according to the
Taiwan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry.</P>
      <P>Hualien County has been worst-hit, with losses of NT$186 million

    <HEADLINE>MAC REFUTES ARATS CHARGES AGAINST SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh on Wednesday refuted accusations by mainland China
that Taiwan is seeking to use the recent murder of a Kaohsiung City
councilor in mainland China to disrupt cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Describing mainland China's charges as totally back-to-front,
Chang said it was the obligation of the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) to help Lin Ti-chuan's family handle the affairs relating to
her death.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should therefore not be blamed for "making trouble" over
the incident, especially when the mainland Chinese itself was to
blame by repeatedly refusing entry to the SEF personnel assigned to
help Lin's family, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin, 32, was kidnapped and murdered last week by a group of armed
men during a private visit to northeastern Liaoning Province. Lin's
family had asked the SEF to help them handle the situation, but SEF
officials were repeatedly refused entry by mainland officials.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-based Association for Relations across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS) sent a letter on Tuesday night to the Taipei-based
SEF, accusing it of trying to use Lin's death to "exacerbate
differences," and "derail the positive feelings among compatriots" on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ARATS also asked the SEF to cherish the progress
in bilateral ties resulting from recent cross-strait exchanges,
especially at a time when the two sides are preparing a visit to the
mainland by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator in
cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>The ARATS response, Chang said, is a reflection that the two
sides have very different understandings of Lin's case.</P>
      <P>The SEF, as a semi-official organization set up to serve the
Taiwan people in cross-strait dealings, has a responsibility to help
those who request its help, Chang explained. This is normal practice,
as the mainland would understand if it had a better understanding of
a democratic society, he noted.</P>
      <P>As to the question on whether the incident would affect the
planned trip to mainland China by Koo this fall, a soft-tongued but
firm Chang said he did not know the true purpose of the letter, but
added: "I prefer to believe that mainland China has no ulterior
motive."</P>
      <P>Lin's tragic death, and the recent murder in mainland China of
Taiwan businessman Wang Fu-ching, have underlined the importance of
continued dialogue and communication on issues of major concern to
the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Chang said, urging the
mainland not to create unnecessary barriers in this regard.</P>
      <P>Responding to the ARATS letter, SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow
called its charges "totally untrue." He called on the mainland
Chinese side to act responsibly and not to make wild accusations on
the issue.</P>
      <P>In the past, the SEF has always sent officials to help Taiwan
people who have lost family members in the mainland, citing the 1994
Qiandao Lake incident in Zhejiang Province in which 24 Taiwan
tourists were slaughtered by mainland robbers.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS have never reached agreement on entrusting each

    <HEADLINE>FAMILIES OF DEAD SEAMEN ANGRY WITH `HUMAN ERROR' THEORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The families of seven sailors killed in
Monday's fire aboard a naval destroyer protested on Wednesday the
military's attribution of the cause of the mishap to human error.</P>
      <P>The families expressed their dissatisfaction to Rear-Adm. Lei
Kuang-shu, commander of the ROC Navy's 124th Fleet, during a meeting
with Lei at the Tsoying naval base in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lei told a news conference on Tuesday that initial investigations
by military investigators show that human error might have been the
cause of the deadly boiler fire that broke out on Monday afternoon on
the Yang-class No. 926 Sueiyang destroyer, part of his fleet.</P>
      <P>Responding to the protest, Lei said he was not blaming any of the
deceased Sueiyang crew members, comprising six seamen second-class
and a petty officer third-class.</P>
      <P>"It is the ship's chief officers who should be blamed for their
failure to strictly require all crewmen to follow operational rules
and guidelines," Lei said, adding that he himself should also be held
responsible for the tragic incident.</P>
      <P>The families demanded that the military punish all the officers
responsible for the accident.</P>
      <P>Lei said the captain and chief engineer of the destroyer have
been referred to military prosecutors as part of an investigation
into their responsibility.</P>
      <P>Lei also promised that a special military task force set up to
probe the case will release an initial report on the cause of the
fire before Sunday.</P>
      <P>Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm. Wu Shih-wen and many other senior
naval officers paid respect to the dead crewmen at a
makeshift funeral hall at the Tsoying base Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Navy Fleet Command announced on Wednesday that a
public funeral for the seven deceased crewmen will be held at the
Tsoying naval base on Sunday.</P>
      <P>A fleet command spokesman said all seven dead seamen will be
given posthumous citations and promotions. "Flags on all warships
berthed at the Tsoying base will be flown at half-mast on the day of
the funeral to show respect for the dead," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He also said the navy will conduct an across-the-board
examination of engineering equipment on all Yang-class destroyers now
in service.</P>
      <P>Noting that naval authorities will offer psychological counseling
to all personnel serving aboard the more than 10 Yang-class warships
in service in the ROC navy, the spokesman said the fleet command
hopes all naval units will learn a lesson from the incident. "We hope
all units will strengthen security education and tighten discipline
to avoid the recurrence of a similar tragedy."</P>
      <P>In related news, President Lee Teng-hui said at a weekly meeting
of the ruling Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee in his capacity
as KMT chairman that the military should intensify personnel training
in the wake of the Sueiyang fire.</P>
      <P>Lei said at Tuesday's news conference that the accident happened
as a sailor was trying to replace an oil rod for the No. 4 boiler in
the Sueiyang's rear boiler room.</P>
      <P>"The sailor did not completely shut off the root valve, which
controls the oil volume of the boiler, before he pulled out the oil
rod. The mishandling caused oil to burst out of the boiler which then
caught fire and soon spread to the whole boiler room," Lei said,
adding that the seven sailors operating in the small boiler room were
killed instantly because of lack of oxygen.</P>
      <P>The Sueiyang is one of more than 10 Yang-class destroyers bought
from the United States 47 years ago. Although most of the ships are
on the verge of retirement, the navy has spent a lot of money
modernizing the weaponry systems on the aging vessels.</P>
      <P>Naval authorities said the Sueiyang did not sustain serious
damage in Monday's fire. "The ship will resume service in about two
months after the necessary repairs and maintenance have been carried
out," said a naval officer.</P>
      <P>The Sueiyang boasts one of the best weaponry systems among the
ships of the same class.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE  MINISTER CAUTIOUS ON SUGGESTION ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu on Wednesday was
cautious in his response to a suggestion that the ceiling for single
investors in a listed company be lifted.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the 15 percent ceiling be lifted came from
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Current regulations stipulate that an individual foreign investor
in a listed company should not own more than a 15 percent stake in
a listed company, while total foreign investment should not exceed 30
percent of a listed company.</P>
      <P>The CEPD suggested a lifting of the restriction on individual
investors, while retaining the ceiling on total foreign investment
until 2000.</P>
      <P>Chiu declined to make a direct response to the suggestions,
saying only that he has to respect the views of the Central Bank of
China on the free flow of foreign capital.</P>
      <P>According to the schedule, the Ministry of Finance will lift

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four workers were injured, two seriously, in
a gas explosion at the construction site of what will be the tallest
building in southern Taiwan, police said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The four were testing a gas pipe in the first basement of the
85-story Tuntex skyscraper in Kaohsiung City when the explosion
occurred at around 9 a.m.</P>
      <P>Wang Chuan-ping, 23, and Shih Tsai-cheng, 35, suffered serious
burns and inhaled toxic gases. Both are still in critical condition
at a local hospital.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-hung, 24, and Chen Ching-yi, 30, suffered minor burns
and remain under observation at the hospital.</P>
      <P>A foreman at the construction site said that the testing had been
going for about a week, and that the four workers took four steel gas
cylinders to the basement on Wednesday morning to conduct tests on
the gas pipes there.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation by police showed that the explosion,
which blew out two walls and scattered debris over a wide area, might
have been caused by one of the gas cylinders, which should have
contained nitrogen but had apparently been mistakenly filled with
flammable gas.</P>
      <P>Police said that the cylinder will be sent for further
examination.</P>
      <P>Construction of the Tuntex skyscraper is almost complete, and
only interior installation and decorating work remains to be carried
out. It is expected to be inaugurated early next year.</P>
      <P>At least six accidents have occurred at the skyscraper since
construction began, according to news reports.</P>
      <P>The United Evening News reported that several construction
workers have fallen to their deaths during the construction, while in
1996, a steel beam fell from 70-plus story and crashed through the
roof of a neighboring house.</P>
      <P>Fires have also broken out over the past two years, none of which
were serious thanks to the concrete structure of the building.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MAY SUSPEND IMPORTS OF INDONESIAN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan may suspend imports of Indonesian
workers if Indonesia fails to harshly punish those who raped or
abused ethnic Chinese women during the May rioting in that country, a
senior official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chan Hou-sheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA), made the statement while meeting with a group of
parliamentarians from the opposition New Party.</P>
      <P>The New Party parliamentarians, including Legislators Chu
Hui-liang and Chen Yi-hsin and National Assembly Deputies Chi Hsin
and Lee Hsin, said they lodged a protest to the Indonesian
representative office in Taipei last week.</P>
      <P>"However, the Indonesian office has so far failed to give any
positive response to our calls for punishment of Indonesian rioters
and compensation for abused Chinese women and girls," said NA Deputy
Chi.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chi said, the New Party hopes the CLA
will take some steps to force Indonesian authorities to
actively respond to its demand.</P>
      <P>Responding to the New Party's overture, Chan said the CLA will
consider suspending introduction of Indonesians for working in the
local manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>Chan said there are currently 15,961 Indonesian passport holders
legally working in Taiwan, accounting for 6 percent of total legal
foreign workers here.</P>
      <P>Among them, 10,500 Indonesians work in the manufacturing
sector; 263 in the fishing industry; 1,700 in the construction
industry; and 3,400 work as domestic helpers.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, most of those serving as domestic helpers
here are Chinese-Indonesians.</P>
      <P>Chan said if Indonesia fails to make proper response to Taiwan's
calls for better protection of ethnic Chinese people's legitimate
rights, punishment of Indonesians who committed atrocities against
ethnic Chinese women during the May riots, the CLA may first ban
local manufacturers from importing Indonesian workers for the time
being.</P>
      <P>"We may also consider cutting the import quota for Indonesian
workers," Chan said.</P>
      <P>Chan said the CLA has adopted a "measured" policy on imports of
foreign workers in order to protect job opportunities for local
people.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has not renounced its attempt to use force
against Taiwan, Chan said the CLA cannot lift the ban on imports of
mainland workers at the moment.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is sponsoring an Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum workshop on earthquake-related
sciences later this month, sources from the National Science Council
(NSC) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The APEC Workshop on Seismic Design and Retrofit of Structures,

    <HEADLINE>DPP HAILS SEF HANDLING OF LIN'S INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator with the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) hailed Wednesday the Straits Exchange Foundation's (SEF)
handling of the Lin Ti-chuan affair, saying mainland China was
extremely rude in accusing the SEF of using the incident to block
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>A DPP heavyweight and organizer of a five-member task force set
up by the party after a dispute erupted between mainland officials
and Lin's family over the disposition of her body, Chang Chun-hung
stressed that the SEF has done its best to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Lin, 32, a DPP member and Kaohsiung City councilwoman, was
kidnapped and murdered in the mainland last week.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a news conference following a meeting
with Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yuh. The
meeting came one day after the Beijing-based Association of Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) sent a letter to the SEF accusing it
of trying to use the incident to disrupt bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The legislator said his meeting with Chang was aimed not only at
discussing the Lin Ti-chuan affair but also at finding a way to break
the current impasse between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He
said the DPP hopes the MAC will review its policy toward mainland
China and that Lin's case would serve as an example of the strained
state of cross-strait dealings.</P>
      <P>According to the legislator, he and the MAC chairman also
exchanged opinions on a series of issues arising from cross-strait
exchanges, such as the signing of agreements on investment
guarantees, trade and judicial arbitration. Five points of consensus
were reached during their meeting, which lasted nearly two hours.</P>
      <P>First, Taiwan will ask mainland China to discuss issues related
to Taiwan businessmen's personal safety, investment guarantees, and
judicial and trade arbitration in the mainland;</P>
      <P>Second, Taiwan will continue to promote agreements reached in the
non-partisan National Development Conference held in Dec. 1996;</P>
      <P>Third, Taiwan will set up risk indexes regarding travel and doing
business in mainland China;</P>
      <P>Fourth, Taiwan will make public all details of incidents
involving with Taiwan people in the mainland;</P>
      <P>Fifth, the SEF should refute rationally all the accusations made
by the ARATS.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Secretary-General Chiu Yih-jen said the party will
not make noticeable changes in its mainland policy, because mainland
China has shown some degree of goodwill in its handling of the
dispute over Lin's body.</P>
      <P>Since the United States is increasing its engagement with
mainland China, Chiu said the DPP has already made necessary
adjustments in its policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>The leadership of the major opposition party supports
across-the-board dealings and dialogue with the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tuesday morning explosion at a plastics
factory in Taoyuan county, Northern Taiwan, has claimed the lives of
two students.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-fu, who suffered burns to 95 percent of his body, died
several hours after he was rushed to nearby Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital in Linkou. Chen Juei-hsin, who suffered burns to 98 percent
of his body, died Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>Four others were injured when the explosion broke out at the Chen
Feng Plastics Co. They suffered burns ranging from 4 percent to 27
percent of their bodies, but doctors described their conditions as
stable.</P>
      <P>Chang was a vocational high school student in Taoyuan, while Chen
had been admitted into a college in a recent exam. One of the injured
is a dropout, and the remaining three were working there under a
cooperation program between the vocational school they are attending
in Kaohsiung and the factory.</P>
      <P>One factory official told police that the fire occurred at around
10 a.m. Tuesday on the building's second floor. Despite the fact that
workers soon put out fire with fire extinguishers, the students who
were taking a break there at that time were severely injured.</P>
      <P>One of the injured said that the explosion was caused because
some of the students defied the non-smoking ban in the factory. A

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER PREDICTS SLOWDOWN IN TAIWAN'S GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang predicted
on Wednesday that Taiwan's economic growth will slow down this year,
and that comparing with some other Asian countries which are heading
toward recession, Taiwan's performance is still looking good.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while commenting on recent, drastic plunges
in international stock markets. He pointed out that Taiwan's economic
growth increased from 5.7 percent in 1996 to 6.8 percent in 1997,
with outstanding performances in exports, investments and industrial
production.</P>
      <P>As for this year, the economics minister said, growth of at least
5.5 percent is expected.</P>
      <P>Wall Street took its worst beating of the year Tuesday, as the
Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 299.43 points, or 3.40
percent, to close at 8,487.30. The plunge was felt throughout Asia
the next day. On Wednesday, Taiwan stocks fell 1.2 percent, or 93.41
points, to 7,499.73.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Wall Street's affect on the Taiwan market was
mainly psychological. He urged the public not to be influenced by
overseas markets, since Taiwan's economic growth is merely slowing,
not stopping.</P>
      <P>Yeh Huey-ching, executive secretary of the Committee of Economic
Research and Development under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said
the plunge in New York on Tuesday was perhaps just a "one-day market
price."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
under the Executive Yuan said on Wednesday that the United States'
economic grew at a slower rate during the second quarter. The
council, however, ruled out the possibility of a recession this year
in the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of women's rights activists
returned to Taipei on Wednesday after a four-day fact-finding trip
to Indonesia aimed at helping ethnic Chinese women raped or abused
by Indonesian rioters during the May rioting there.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-feng, a former Control Yuan member who headed the
delegation, said the trip was fruitful even though the group failed
to meet any Chinese victim or arrange for any of them to travel to
Taiwan to receive medical treatment.</P>
      <P>"The visit has enabled us to better understand the facts about
the atrocities committed by Indonesian rioters against ethnic
Chinese women and girls during May's political turmoil in that
country," said the lawyer-turned-women's rights activist.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting with the Indonesian women's affairs
minister and senior officials of Indonesia's National Human Rights
Commission, Wang said, the delegation managed to meet with the
leaders of a major Indonesian opposition party and several
non-government rescue and relief organizations.</P>
      <P>"Through talks with them, we have come to a better understanding
of the ordeals endured by ethnic Chinese women and girls during the
May riots," Wang said, adding that at least 150 ethnic Chinese women
and girls were sexually assaulted during that chaotic period.</P>
      <P>"More worrisome is that similar events are still occurring,"
Wang said, citing that the Jakarta office of Taiwan's largest
charity, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, handled
a case involving an ethnic Chinese woman raped by Indonesians in
July.</P>
      <P>Wang quoted the leader of an Indonesian rescue organization as
saying that some abused Chinese women have committed suicide or
been reported missing. "Some victims even found that they became
pregnant after being raped."</P>
      <P>Wang said there is sufficient evidence proving that the
atrocities committed against ethnic Chinese women were organized and
planned actions. As a result, many Chinese-Indonesians are unwilling
to return to Indonesia before the Indonesian government severely
punishes all those who instigated, encouraged or committed
the atrocities.</P>
      <P>Wang said Indonesian and ethnic Chinese women's rights activists
have suggested that local women's rights groups send volunteers
to Indonesia to help abused victims forget their bitter ordeals and
regain peace of mind.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GHOST POPULATION IN TAIPEI, KAOHSIUNG NOT CONSIDERED SERIOUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The so-called ghost population issue in
Taipei and Kaohsiung is not serious enough to affect the results of
year-end mayoral elections in those cities, the Ministry of Interior
(MOI) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The mayoral elections and elections for city councilors will be
held on Dec. 5. In addition, residents of the two cities, along with
residents of other parts of Taiwan, will elect national lawmakers on
the same day.</P>
      <P>According to election laws, people are required to have lived in
a city or an area continuously for at least four months before they
can vote as a resident of that city or area.</P>
      <P>That means if citizens outside Taipei and Kaohsiung want to vote
as residents of either of those cities, they will have to actually
move into the cities or at least change their registered residential
addresses to those of people who are residents of those cities -- as
the ghost population does -- on or before Aug. 4.</P>
      <P>Chen Wy-hsiung, director of MOI's Population Administration
Department, said that according to statistics, the population of
Taipei increased by 21,000 people, or 0.81 percent, from Jan. 1 to
Aug. 4, while the population of Kaohsiung increased by 15,811, or
1.09 percent.</P>
      <P>Both increases can be described as normal, Chen said, though he
added that in June and July the population increase in Taipei was
extraordinarily high.</P>
      <P>From June 1 to Aug. 4, Taipei recorded a population increase of
14,341, with 8,380 in June, 5,026 in July and 935 in August. As
Kuomintang Taipei mayoral candidate Ma Ying-jeou announced his
candidacy on May 30, the jump in Taipei's population might be a
result of Ma's entering the mayoral race.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, the population increase during July and the first
four day of August stood at 1,596, not particularly high. However,
the population increased in February by 7,082, which might have some
connection with grassroots-level elections in June.</P>
      <P>Chen said that even if there is so-called ghost population in
both cities, the number is not large enough to have any significant
influence on election results.</P>
      <P>He stressed that though the constitution guarantees people the
right to move around freely, members of ghost population violate
population administration laws. Once ghost population members are
identified, they will be punished and lose their voting rights.</P>
      <P>In related news, according to statistics compiled by the Bureau
of Civil Affairs under the Taipei Government, the population in
Taipei totaled 2,629,828 as of the end of Aug. 4 with the number of
citizens standing at 1,876,424.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that between June 1 and July 31, Taipei saw
its population increase by 16,064 with 10,689 of them being citizens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REPRESENTATIVE IN JAPAN CALLS FOR JAPANESE SUPPORT</HEADLINE>

(By Mike Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Representative in Japan Chuang Ming-yao
on Wednesday called on the Japanese people to support the entry of
Taiwan into the United Nations and other international organizations.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Sankei Shimbun, Chuang, representative
of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan,
said Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with 27 countries and
boasted the world's 18th-largest gross national product last year.</P>
      <P>The dignity of the Republic of China under a system of democracy,
liberty and human rights should be respected, and it is unfair to
keep this nation outside international institutions, including the
United Nations, Chuang said. He called for the support of the
Japanese people in this regard.</P>
      <P>Referring to the close relations between Taipei and Tokyo, Chuang
noted that Taiwan is Japan's fourth-largest trade partner with the
two countries' bilateral trade volume reaching US$40.7 billion last
year. Japan is also Taiwan's largest foreign investor, investing
US$850 million last year alone.</P>
      <P>Chuang spoke highly of the Japan-US security treaty, which he
said is a deterrent against any disturbance and will contribute to
the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Any incident occurring in the Taiwan Strait will be an
international matter, not an internal affair of mainland China, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP REAFFIRMS ITS MAINLAND CHINA POLICY IS UNCHANGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) reaffirmed on Wednesday that its policy toward mainland China
remains unchanged despite criticism that party policy is wavering.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, DPP secretary-general, stressed that the DPP policy
would not be changed in a single day, and that if the DPP allows
outsiders to harbor such a misunderstanding, the party should be held
responsible.</P>
      <P>Chiou, after returning from a visit to Xiamen in the mainland
late last month, said the DPP will conduct across-the-board contact
and engagement with the mainland from now on.</P>
      <P>Chiou said at the time that if Taiwan continues to refuse to
negotiate with the mainland, it will be deemed a "troublemaker" and
risk losing the support and sympathy of the international community.</P>
      <P>But after the kidnap and murder of DPP Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan
in the mainland, the DPP has toughened its stance.</P>
      <P>A DPP task force formed after Lin's death on July 29 criticized
the way mainland China handled the case and threatened to push the
government to suspend exchanges with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The task force strongly demanded that Beijing allow the
intermediary body Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to send officials
to the mainland, allow the DPP to send officials to the mainland to
help Lin's family and allow the body of Lin to return to Taiwan
without a full autopsy in line with the wishes of Lin's family.</P>
      <P>After Beijing agreed to allow DPP officials in and promised to
conduct minimal examination of Lin's body, the DPP reversed its
stance and ceased to talk about suspending cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chiou denied that this indicates the party is wavering on its
mainland policy, saying that the tough stance of the DPP has helped
Lin's family in handling their loss.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee reaffirmed that the value of
human rights should not be trampled upon, and that the DPP hopes that
the proper handling of the case will serve as an example for
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The committee also said that it will actively push for discussion
on such topics as investment guarantee agreements, trade arbitration
agreements, judicial assistance and joint crackdowns on crimes
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The committee suggested that the government set up a warning
system regarding travel and doing business in the mainland.</P>
      <P>It also asked the government to fully investigate reports of
Taiwan people being abused while in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The committee also urged the government to refute accusations by
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, the SEF
counterpart in the mainland, that Taiwan sought to use the Lin
Ti-chuan incident to disrupt cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA SIGNS HISTORIC LAND TREATY WITH NATIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's federal and provincial governments
signed a historic treaty with the Nisga'a natives in British Columbia
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Nisga'a people of British Columbia have been fighting for
more than 100 years for control of the Nass Valley.</P>
      <P>The agreement gives the Nisga'a 1,930 square kilometers of land
in the lower Nass Valley in northwestern British Columbia,
self-government powers akin to those of municipal governments and
C$300 million.</P>
      <P>The Nisga'a get resource rights over their lands, allowing them
access to forests and fish. They can set up their own courts,
although Canada's criminal code and constitution still apply.</P>
      <P>In return, the Nisga'a give up the right to future land claims
and their tax-exempt status.</P>
      <P>"The Nisga'a canoe returns to the Nass River, with a cargo of
hope and reconciliation." That was the word from a Nisga'a chief as
the treaty was inked at a ceremony attended by more than 1,500
people, most of them Nisga'a.</P>
      <P>Chief Joseph Gosnell said the treaty was a triumph for both the
Nisga'a people and the people of Canada. British Columbia Premier
Glen Clark and federal Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart were on
hand for the ceremony.</P>
      <P>There are dozens of outstanding land treaties across British
Columbia. Stewart said she hoped the Nisga'a deal will move other
negotiations onto a fast track. The treaty is a "signal to the other
first nations of British Columbia that treaty negotiations do work,"
Stewart said.</P>
      <P>Though the treaty has been signed, it is not all clear sailing
for the Nisga'a canoe. It will have to pass a referendum by the
Nisga'a, as well as by provincial and federal legislatures.</P>
      <P>Observers said the treaty could become a hot political issue.
Some Nisga'a call the treaty a sellout and said they will not ratify
it. Many non-natives believe the agreement is of such importance that
it should be tested in a province-wide referendum.</P>
      <P>Clark pre-empted his political enemies by telling those who
criticize the deal not to "deny our history" and not to be "blind to
the injustices of the past."</P>
      <P>Those opposing the deal would be rejecting 30 years of
negotiations and compromise from all sides, he said.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday urged
Beijing to properly handle the incident related to the death of a
Taiwan councilwoman in the mainland.</P>
      <P>In receiving a group of Hong Kong visitors, Lee called on Beijing
for fair, just and legal response to the death of Kaohsiung City
Councilwoman Lin Ti-chuan, who was kidnapped and killed in Dalian,
located in the northeastern mainland province of Liaoning, last week.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns raised by his visitors, Lee said the time is
not ripe for Taiwan to contemplate direct postal, shipping and trade
links with mainland China since Beijing still refuses to recognize
the Republic of China as a sovereignty and treat it accordingly.</P>
      <P>"Without safeguarding national security and interests, it is not
the time for people in Taiwan to mull the idea. They simply will not
accept it," he said.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing the fact that "China" is now divided and ruled by two
separate administrations, Lee urged Beijing to come to terms with
this political reality. He further said the "one country, two
systems" reunification formula put forth by Beijing is ambiguous,
paradoxical and non-democratic.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China, as a sovereign country, is different from
Hong Kong, and the "one country, two systems" formula prescribed by
Beijing for Hong Kong is absolutely unacceptable to Taiwan, said
Lee.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong group, led by Liberal Party leader Allen Lee
Peng-fei, includes legislators Emily Lau Wai-hing, Christine Loh
Kung-wai, Fred Lee Wing-tat and Chan Kam-lam, as well as several

    <HEADLINE>SIA TO TAKE EQUITY STAKE IN CAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  5   (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Airlines (SIA) and China
Airlines (CAL) have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to
form a strategic alliance, SIA announced Tuessday.</P>
      <P>The MOU also sets out general principles for SIA's purchase of
CAL shares within six months.</P>
      <P>SIA Deputy Chairman and CEO Cheong Choong Kong said that SIA was
thinking of a stake of "between 5 and 10 percent" in CAL.</P>
      <P>"We see China Airlines as a good investment," said Cheong. "It
demonstrates our faith in the long-term future of the aviation
industry in this region, notwithstanding the present economic
difficulties. In conjunction with equity participation, we shall be
exploring joint ventures in airline-related businesses with China
Airlines."</P>
      <P>The proposed alliance aims to benefit customers by providing a
seamless travel service between the two carriers, SIA said. Flight
schedules will be coordinated to allow for fast and convenient
connections, and code-sharing on certain routes will provide
travelers with a wider choice of travel options.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the benefits, Cheong said the proposed tie-up would
strengthen the competitive position of the two airlines.</P>
      <P>"The formation of strategic alliances is a trend in the
international aviation industry today, and the focus of our
development has been on building up our competitive resources through
the choice of a strategic partner with a high degree of
complementarity and a low degree of cultural difference," China
Airlines Chairman Chiang Hung-i said.</P>
      <P>"We are delighted that after several months of negotiations we
are able to enter into this historic cooperative relationship with
our ideal strategic alliance partner, Singapore Airlines," he added.</P>
      <P>This is the third strategic alliance announced by SIA since
mid-1997 and the first since then involving equity participation. SIA
has already entered into alliances with Lufthansa in Europe and with
Air New Zealand and Ansett.</P>
      <P>SIA operates a fleet of 87 aircraft and offers flights to 76
destinations in 41 countries. For the fiscal year ending March 31,
1998, the Singapore International Group's total revenue was S$7.72
billion.</P>
      <P>CAL was established in 1959 and operates a fleet of 52 of the
latest Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus jetliners. China Airlines
and its two subsidiaries, Mandarin Airlines and Formosa Airlines,
serve 46 destinations in 20 countries. The company's operating
revenue in 1997 totaled NT$55.85 billion and its pre-tax profit,
NT$2.77 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DNA TESTS TO BE ADOPTED TO PREVENT VISITS BY FAKE MAINLAND RELATIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan security authorities are considering
adopting DNA tests to prevent "fake" mainland Chinese relatives from
coming to Taiwan for visits.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau, an
underground mainland Chinese ring was recently found to have provided
bogus documents certifying that some mainlanders were related to
Taiwan residents allowing them to legally come to Taiwan to visit
relatives.</P>
      <P>MJIB officials believe several hundred mainland Chinese residents
obtained permission to visit Taiwan through this illegal channel.</P>
      <P>Some of these people were found to be gathering intelligence in
Taiwan for mainland authorities, according to MJIB officials.</P>
      <P>Others are suspected of involvement in the swindling of large
amounts of death benefits in Taiwan with counterfeit documents
certifying their relation to deceased veterans who came to Taiwan
four or five decades ago from mainland China and passed away alone on
the island, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The ring -- composed of several Taiwan lawyers, some retired
Taiwan servicemen originally from the mainland and an unknown number
of mainland Chinese officials in charge of notarization -- was found
to have made away with several hundred million NT dollars through
fraudulent claims for deceased ROC veteran death benefits.</P>
      <P>According to existing Taiwan laws governing civilian exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait, parents or children of Taiwan residents are
legitimately allowed to visit Taiwan for short- or long-term visits
depending on circumstances.</P>
      <P>On average, there are about 50,000 mainlanders who are "legally"
visiting Taiwan every day, said MJIB officials.</P>
      <P>Once the DNA examination measure is put into force, mainland
relatives who intend to visit Taiwan will be asked to include a
specimen with their entrance application for DNA comparison, they
added.</P>

      <P>South Africa switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing from
Taipei at the beginning of this year. Taipei severed official ties
with Pretoria in retaliation.</P>
      <P>Trade between Taiwan and South Africa was posted at around US$1.8
billion last year, a figure which accounts for less than 1 percent of
Taiwan's entire foreign trade in 1997, Du noted. The amount of trade
reflects the fact that there is ample room for both sides to increase
trade, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranks as South Africa's sixth largest trade partner.</P>
      <P>About 620 Taiwan businesses have invested over US$1.5 billion in

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND AMBASSADOR FAILS TO ATTEND HUMAN RIGHTS MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The boycott of a US House subcommittee
meeting Wednesday morning by a mainland Chinese ambassador "raises
grave doubts about the value of a promise made by a representative of
the Chinese government," a US congressman said.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing had promised to attend a
meeting of the House Subcommittee on International Operations and
Human Rights, chaired by Rep. Christopher Smith (R-NJ), but backed
out minutes prior to his scheduled appearance.</P>
      <P>Smith reiterated an invitation for Li to attend the
subcommittee's meeting and made it clear that Li was welcome to the
meeting whenever he decides to appear.</P>
      <P>"Ambassador Li, there is nothing to fear, so long as your
government does not fear the truth," the congressman said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Smith explained that the subcommittee meeting was called to
conduct a frank and open discussion with Li on the subject of human
rights in China. The meeting was arranged after Smith received a call
from the political counselor at the Chinese embassy stating that Li
would like to accept Smith's invitation to present Beijing's official
comments on human rights in China.</P>
      <P>However, as soon as the subcommittee agreed to schedule a
hearing, the Chinese embassy began placing numerous conditions on the
ambassador's attendance.</P>
      <P>First, they argued over the shape of the table, insisting that
the tables and chairs be arranged so that the ambassador would sit
directly across from the members of the subcommittee and on the same
level with them rather than at a witness table with the members
sitting on a dais.</P>
      <P>Then the Chinese embassy insisted that the subcommittee not call
the meeting a "hearing," although this is the word customarily used
to describe an open meeting of the House subcommittee.</P>
      <P>Later, the embassy insisted that no other outside party be
invited or permitted to make statements or answer questions at the
meeting. It was quite firm on not wanting Li to appear on the same
platform or even on the same day as such Chinese human rights
activists as former political prisoners Wei Jingsheng and Harry Wu.</P>
      <P>But in the interest of having the ambassador appear and defend
Beijing's record on human rights, the House subcommittee agreed to
all these conditions, Smith noted.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the subcommittee was notified 20 minutes before
the scheduled Wednesday meeting that the ambassador was not coming,
"even though the embassy no longer believes that we violated the
ground rules," the congressman said.</P>
      <P>It is really too bad, Smith added, because "we had planned to ask
him some very direct and detailed questions about human rights in
China, starting with the facts: Did anybody really die at Tiananmen
Square in 1989? Are there forced abortions in China? Are there
political and religious prisoners? Do elements of the Chinese
military sell organs harvested from executed prisoners? Where is the
nine-year-old Panchen Lama, who was abducted three years ago by
agents of the Chinese government?"</P>
      <P>On these questions and so many others, it is useless to exchange
opinions "until we get to the bottom of serious factual disputes,"
Smith said. In each case, human rights advocates, reputable
journalists, international organizations, and/or foreign government
have made detailed findings of serious human rights violations, and
in each case, the Chinese government has simply denied that anything
had happened.</P>
      <P>Smith said, "We will not learn this morning how the Chinese
government explains these amazing discrepancies. Instead, we have
learned yet another lesson about negotiating with the government of
the People's Republic of China."</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first batch of 200 live, farm-bred
ostriches arrived in the northern port city of Keelung Thursday from
Los Angeles, marking the first such import to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 50 birds were immediately transported to a plant and animal
quarantine center in Hsichih, suburban Taipei, for a quarantine
check.</P>
      <P>The 14 male and 36 female birds will then be delivered to their
buyer -- Chianan Ostrich Range in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan --
for permanent settlement.</P>
      <P>An additional 150 similar birds are expected to arrive in Taiwan
in the coming weeks as the application process to import them is
underway. The deliveries were divided into four groups because of the
limited capacity of the quarantine center, said the importer.</P>
      <P>The 200 birds are all adults aged between 4 and 5 years old, and
stand at about 180 centimeters tall. All of them have been tested for
fertility and were selected from ostrich farms in Utah, Texas and
California.</P>
      <P>The importer hopes to breed the birds and expand the ostrich
population on the island.</P>
      <P>Ostriches live an average of 50 to 60 years and remain fertile
for 20 to 30 years. Female birds produce an average of 50 eggs per
year.</P>
      <P>A bird of high economic value, ostriches are bred for their skin,
feathers and eggs.</P>
      <P>Currently, the importer, which also imports ostrich meat from the
United States, provides about 20 metric tons of frozen ostrich meat
to local gourmet restaurants. Ostrich meat tastes like beef but is a
healthy alternative to red meat as it is low in fat, the importer
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan mission said Thursday it will
continue to provide professional counseling to women in Indonesia who
were assaulted and raped during the May riots.</P>
      <P>The group, returning from a four-day, fact-finding trip to
Indonesia Wednesday night, said in a news conference that it found
the Southeast Asian country lacks the experience and support system
to help victims.</P>
      <P>The delegation said it will continue to offer long-term support
to victims through existing channels in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Comprised of officials from local civic groups such as the Garden
of Hope, Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, Taiwan Association for
Human Rights, and End Child Prostitution Association of Taiwan, the
mission was headed by Wang Ching-feng, a former Control Yuan member.</P>
      <P>Members of the mission originally wanted to meet with victims of
assaults and rapes, but later concluded it may be unwise to do so,
saying that they fully understood how the victims felt.</P>
      <P>From meetings with local women's groups, Wang said that there are
168 established cases of sexual abuse which occurred during the

    <HEADLINE>BODY OF COUNCILWOMAN TO BE ESCORTED TO TAIWAN SATURDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The body of Lin Ti-chuan, a member of
Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party, is expected to
arrive in Taiwan on Saturday.</P>
      <P>A hearse carrying Lin's body left Haicheng, Liaoning province,
Thursday morning. In the company of Lin's brother and sister-in-law,
the hearse and its accompanying motorcade arrived at Beijing Thursday
night.</P>
      <P>Lin's parents and another DPP Councilman, Huang Chao-hsing, also
left Haicheng by car Thursday for Shengyang and there took a flight
to Beijing.</P>
      <P>With her beloved family, Lin's body will be flown from
Beijing to Hong Kong Saturday and from there onto Kaohsiung, in
southern Taiwan. The plane transporting her body is expected to land
at Kaohsiung's airport by 4:50 p.m., in line with a local custom that
the body of someone who dies overseas must be brought back before
nightfall.</P>
      <P>Lin's friends and relatives, as well as DPP officials, will hold
a memorial at a makeshift funeral hall at a lot in the airport.</P>
      <P>The exact cause of Lin's death has not yet been determined,
although the results of an examination of her body performed
Wednesday indicate the Kaohsiung City councilwoman was not assaulted
or physically mistreated during her abduction.</P>
      <P>Chen Yao-chang, a forensics expert from National Taiwan
University
who was requested by Lin's family to travel to the
mainland to take part in the examination, said that the examination
was conducted in accordance with the wishes of the family, who had
refused to allow a full autopsy to be performed.</P>
      <P>Chen said that five puncture marks were found on Lin's upper
right arm. There were also what were apparently slight bruises to her
legs and arms, suggesting she may have been tied up.</P>
      <P>Lin, one of the rising stars of the DPP, made her debut in
politics at the age of 28. She and her boyfriend, Wei Tien-kang,
arrived at Dalian, Liaoning province, on July 27. Shortly thereafter
they were abducted and taken to Haicheng.</P>
      <P>According to Wei, he and Lin were given injections by their
abductors every few hours. On July 29, Lin was found to be foaming at
the mouth and was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced
dead. Meanwhile, Wei managed to escape and reported the incident to
the police.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATOR LU HSIU-YI DIES OF CANCER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Lu Hsiu-yi, one of the most
prominent and respected politicians in the opposition camp, died of
adeno carcinoma at a hospital in Taipei County on Thursday at the age
of 57.</P>
      <P>Lu, a three-term lawmaker from the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), passed away at 3:27 a.m. at the Koo
Foundation-Sun Yat-sen Cancer Center in Tamsui on the outskirts of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lu was rushed to the hospital on Tuesday evening when he
developed severe respiratory problems. After emergency medical
treatment, his condition initially stabilized but worsened Wednesday
evening. Respecting Lu's wishes, doctors decided not to administer
further life-saving measures.</P>
      <P>A physical checkup at National Taiwan University Hospital after
Lu swooned during a brawl on the legislative floor on April 15, 1991
revealed a small stain on Lu's right lung.</P>
      <P>Doctors advised Lu either to undergo surgery or receive regular
checkups. Because of his hectic schedule, Lu did not bother to
undergo another checkup until July 1995.</P>
      <P>By that time, the stain on Lu's lung had expanded, and doctors
diagnosed it as a malignant tumor. Lu was pronounced terminally ill
when he was admitted to the Sun Yat-sen Cancer Center in late 1995.
By then, cancer cells had already invaded his right collarbone.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Lu demonstrated enormous courage and
strong willpower in fighting the cancer. During the period, he scaled
Taiwan's highest peak, Mt. Jade, twice. In his first try, he failed
to reach the top of the mountain. But he made it in his second
assault.</P>
      <P>A native of Taipei County, Lu dedicated himself to Taiwan's
democratization and the development of indigenous culture.</P>
      <P>Lu and his wife, a musician, jointly set up the Egret Cultural
Foundation some 10 years ago to promote musical education in rural
areas.</P>
      <P>As one of the DPP's founding members, Lu demonstrated his love
and loyalty to the party by helping the DPP retain its control of the
island's largest and most populous county late last year.</P>
      <P>Although terminally ill, Lu rejected his doctor's advice and went
out to stump for the DPP's candidate for the Taipei County magistrate
election, Su Chen-chang. He even knelt down at Su's last campaign
forum on Nov. 28, 1997 to solicit popular support for his DPP
comrade.</P>
      <P>Lu's unexpected move pulled at the heartstrings of many voters
present at the occasion. Some political observers said Lu's kneeling
contributed much to Su's narrow victory over a strong competitor from
the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Su rushed to the hospital early Thursday morning to pay tribute
to Lu. "Lu's passing is a great loss to the DPP. I appreciate his
campaigning for me. I'll redouble my efforts to improve the Taipei
County Government's administration to fulfill his wish and repay his
assistance."</P>
      <P>Many other DPP heavyweights, including party Chairman Lin
Yi-hsiung and Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, also visited the hospital
to extend condolences to Lu's family.</P>
      <P>Lin praised Lu as a courageous man, not only for his fight for
Taiwan's democratization but also for his fight against cancer. "I'm
saddened by his death. I has lost a good partner in fight for the
DPP's cause."</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen said Lu's passing was not only a loss to the
DPP but also a loss to the whole of Taiwan. "We have much to learn
from his optimism and dedication to promoting Taiwan's
democratization."</P>
      <P>With a doctoral degree in political science from Paris
University, Lu once taught at Chinese Culture University and National
Tsinghua University before entering politics in 1989.</P>
      <P>Lu also once served a three-year prison term from 1983 through
1986 on a charge of sedition for promoting Taiwan independence. At
that time, Taiwan was still under martial law and advocating
independence was a taboo.</P>
      <P>A witty, humorous person, Lu often acted as an opinion leader in
the Legislative Yuan. His profound knowledge, rational manner and
resourcefulness helped him win much respect and admiration by his
legislative colleagues and by journalists.</P>
      <P>Lu's body is being kept at the Taipei County Public Funeral
Parlor. A funeral is scheduled to be held on Aug. 18. Lu is survived
by his wife, two daughters and one son.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LINCOLN SCHOOL TO BE GRANTED LAND LICENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Thursday denied that it secretly asked a local government to legalize
the existence of the Lincoln American School on a spot zoned for
residential use only.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu made the statement during a news conference
in a bid to clarify a report on the MOFA's alleged secret order.</P>
      <P>The widely-circulated United Daily News reported on Thursday that
the Taiwan Provincial Department of Reconstruction (DOR) has
recognized the Lincoln school as a "necessary public facility" within
Taichung's scenic Takeng district, according to a confidential MOFA
document.</P>
      <P>The recognition legalizes the relocation of the school, run by
Anna Lee, daughter of President Lee Teng-hui, the report said.</P>
      <P>It was found in late May that the foreign school had moved from
the city's Taya district to the Takeng district, a scenic area that
is zoned for resort use.</P>
      <P>Sung Ai-ko, a Taiwan provincial assemblyman from the opposition
New Party, disclosed the existence of an official agreement
Wednesday. He rebuked the government for discussing the issue through
confidential documents and he condemned some of the officials
involved in the incident for extending special privileges, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>Wu said documents such as the one that has been cited allow
exchanges of opinion among government agencies.</P>
      <P>The document in question, he said, merely contains calls from
American nationals living on the island for proper educational
facilities for their children. Wu stressed that MOFA did not
specifically mention the Lincoln American School in the confidential
document.</P>
      <P>Nearly 2,000 American nationals currently live in central Taiwan,
according to MOFA.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Chang Wen-ying said on Thursday her government is
expected to grant a license to the Lincoln school within two weeks.</P>
      <P>The approval was issued after MOFA, DOR and the Taichung City
Government agreed that the Lincoln American School can be regarded as
a necessary public facility, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The Lincoln American School has a total of 15 classes, from
kindergarten to the 12th grade. As a foreign school, it may accept
only foreign students or Taiwan students possessing dual citizenship.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 35 Chinese groups based in the
Philippines issued a statement on Thursday, strongly condemning the
recent Indonesian atrocities against ethnic Chinese.</P>
      <P>The statement also urged the United Nations Human Rights
Committee to pay attention to the anti-Chinese resentment in
Indonesia and to demand that the Indonesian government fully protect
its ethnic Chinese population. The horrible racial discrimination in
the Southeast Asian nation should be stopped, it said.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian government cannot shed its responsibilities, and
should address the fact that its inability to protect the personal
safety and property of ethnic Chinese has led to great suffering and
damage, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Ethnic Chinese were cruelly robbed, abused, and killed, and more
than 160 ethnic Chinese women were raped during widespread Indonesian
civil unrest in May which led to the downfall of President Suharto.</P>
      <P>The statement urged the ROC government not to ease its stance and
to continue pushing the Indonesian government to quickly arrest the
rioters and bring the culprits to trial.</P>
      <P>The ROC government should also continue monitoring subsequent

      <P>Although the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) could not fully fulfill its function in dealing with
matters concerning the murder of Kaohsiung City Councilwoman Lin
Ti-chuan in mainland China, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) nevertheless praised SEF's efforts.</P>
      <P>Lin was a member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.
After her death, SEF attempted to gain consent for foundation
officials to accompany Lin's family to the mainland.</P>
      <P>In addition, SEF communicated with its mainland counterpart, the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), and with ARATS' assistance was able to convey calls to
mainland officials to fully investigate Lin's murder. Afterward, SEF
called for Taiwan businesspeople in Shenyang, Liaoning province, to
hold a reception for Lin's family.</P>
      <P>ROC nationals have been permitted to travel to the mainland for
the past 10 years, and during that time there have been 195 reports
of threats to the security of Taiwan tourists and businesspeople in
the mainland, said MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipei has called repeatedly for SEF and ARATS to hold
discussions on the safety of Taiwan people in the mainland and the
protection of their property, as well as on cross-strait cooperation
in criminal investigations, said Lin. ARATS, however, has rejected
the overtures, instead preferring that political negotiations take
place first, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL OFFICIAL'S US VISIT CONFIRMED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential Office officials confirmed on
Thursday that Ding Mou-shih, secretary-general of the National
Security Council, made a visit to the United States late last month.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to a local newspaper report that
Ding traveled to New York last week to meet with US Deputy National
Security Adviser James Steinberg on Taipei-Washington ties and
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The officials said Ding left for New York on July 26 in the
company of a close aide, and that he had reported his travel plans to
President Lee Teng-hui prior to his departure.</P>
      <P>However, they would not divulge when Ding is scheduled to return,
nor would they explain the purpose of his trip.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Lee said Ding's visit was arranged by
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which was founded by US
authorities in 1979 to handle exchanges with the Republic of China
following the severing of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Lee declined to reveal whom Ding has met during his stay in the
United States, nor would he divulge any details of times, venues, or
contents of any meetings. He also refused to confirm whether Ding is
still in the United States.</P>
      <P>The trip is Ding's second to the United States so far this year.
He was originally also scheduled to visit France in May, but later
canceled the trip for unknown reasons.</P>
      <P>The China Times reported on Thursday that Ding met secretly with
Steinberg in a New York hotel last week, and that Thomas Pickering,
US under secretary of state for political affairs, was also present
at the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, the de facto ROC envoy to the United
States, Stephen Chen, and Vice Foreign Minister Lee also attended the
meeting.</P>
      <P>The paper said the two countries arranged details about the
meeting when AIT Chairman Richard Bush visited Taipei in early July
to brief ROC officials on US President Bill Clinton's June 25-July 3
visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The paper said Steinberg told Ding during their talks that the
United States maintains a very transparent stance on issues related
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Steinberg reportedly also assured Ding that Clinton's mainland
visit has not undermined Taiwan's interests, nor did the United
States and mainland China reach any Taiwan-related secret agreements
or understandings during Clinton's trip.</P>
      <P>Lee declined to comment on the reports, saying instead that
dialogue channels between Taipei and Washington operate very
smoothly.</P>
      <P>The AIT's Taipei office also refused to comment on the China
Times report.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Washington began holding confidential high-level
dialogue in New York in the spring of 1996, when mainland China
conducted live-fire war games and missile tests in waters near Taiwan
to intimidate Taiwan voters in the run-up to the ROC's first direct
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Last week's meeting was the fourth of its kind. Ding has
consistently served as the chief ROC delegate in all those meetings.</P>
      <P>The United States was originally represented by Sandy Berger,
then deputy national security adviser. In January 1997, Steinberg
replaced Berger as the US delegate. Berger is now national security
adviser.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S DEFENSE WHITE PAPER CONTAINS NOTHING NEW: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Thursday criticized Beijing's new national defense white
paper, saying it contains nothing new and that it lacks transparency.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Beijing has not changed its position toward Taiwan
on either the political or military fronts, MAC Vice Chairman Lin
Chong-pin said Beijing's reluctance to renounce the use of force
against Taiwan is apparently contradictory to its claim that mainland
China will not be an aggressor to other countries.</P>
      <P>Even if mainland China "becomes strong and powerful in the
future, it absolutely will not take to the road of foreign aggression
and expansion," according to the white paper.</P>
      <P>But it also says that mainland China "seeks to achieve the
reunification of the country by peaceful means, but will not commit
itself to a promise not to resort to force. Every sovereign state has
the right to use all means it deems necessary, including military
means, to safeguard its own sovereignty and territorial integrity."</P>
      <P>Lin said the 30,000-character white paper, made public by Beijing
on July 27, is not transparent enough, as it falls short of reporting
the aims of mainland China's national defense policy, and does not
touch on its military deployments, exercises, or combat programs.</P>
      <P>Lin was also skeptical about mainland China's military
expenditures as tallied in the white paper, saying that the
international community estimates that the real figure may be from
two to ten times higher than the figure claimed by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Citing the latest issue of the Military Balance 97/98, published
by a London-based international strategical policy research center,
Lin said mainland China may have allocated as much as US$38 billion
toward its defense spending over the past year.</P>
      <P>According to the white paper, mainland China has made "relatively
major reductions" in defense inputs. It says mainland China's defense
expenditure in 1997 was US$9.8 billion, only 3.67 percent of the
amount spent by the United States.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew returned to work on
Thursday after undergoing prostrate surgery last week.</P>
      <P>Siew, who has a six-year medical history of enlarged prostate,
received the surgery at the Veterans General Hospital in Taipei last
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The surgery was uneventful, and Siew's doctors allowed him to
return to work starting Thursday. But the premier is required to go
back to the hospital every day for the next week so that his
convalescence can be monitored.</P>
      <P>Siew, 59, was his customary smiling self when he left the
hospital early in the morning, accompanied by his wife.</P>
      <P>"I feel good after having `old parts of my body repaired,'" Siew
told local reporters covering his discharge from the hospital. "After
a week of rest, I now have more energy to fulfill my duties."</P>
      <P>Siew said he was grateful that many local citizens have sent him
greeting cards, flowers and e-mail to express their concern for his
health. "I'll redouble my efforts to perform my duties to repay their
goodwill and kindness," he said.</P>
      <P>Siew chaired a weekly Cabinet meeting after returning to work,
where he announced that the government will spend an additional
NT$100 billion (US$2.9 billion) on public infrastructure construction
over the next two years to bolster domestic economic development.</P>
      <P>The planned extra expenditure is aimed at revitalizing the
domestic economy amid a slowdown caused by the Asian financial
turmoil, Siew said.</P>
      <P>"Stimulating domestic demand through construction projects is
vital to maintain stable economic growth in the face of the regional
financial chaos," the premier explained.</P>
      <P>Siew said the move is also expected to stimulate private
investment.</P>
      <P>The premier also stressed the importance of government
restructuring, saying it is the government's most important political
engineering work for the moment.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's current administrative structure is obsolete
due to the changing social environment, Siew said government agencies
at all levels should work closely to complete a comprehensive
structural overhaul.</P>
      <P>"We must adjust the hierarchy, cut red tape, and trim redundant
workers in order to upgrade our administrative efficiency and overall
national competitiveness," Siew said.</P>
      <P>He urged the Taiwan Provincial Government to strengthen
communication with the Legislative Yuan in order to push the
legislature to pass a budget bill for central government grants for
the provincial government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has agreed to grant Poland an import
quota for compact cars, making the eastern European country the
eighth to obtain this type of quota prior to Taiwan's entry into the
World Trade Organization, a trade official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>An official with the Board of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs said that Poland will get an annual import quota of
3,000 compact cars, with an annual 10 percent growth rate, before
Taiwan is granted WTO admission.</P>
      <P>The official said that Poland raised the quota issue in May when
Taiwan trade officials were in Geneva, Switzerland to attend a WTO
working meeting</P>
      <P>Both Poland and Thailand were granted the privilege of exporting
cars into Taiwan this year. So far, Taiwan has given import quotas
for compact cars to eight countries -- Malaysia, Australia, the Czech
Republic, South Korea, Japan, Mexico, Thailand, and Poland -- as part
of the island's efforts to enter the international trade regulatory
organization.</P>
      <P>The quota for 1998, along with the annual growth rate allowed for
each country, is as follows: Malaysia -- 1,500, with zero percent
annual growth; Australia -- 2,200, with 10 percent annual growth; the
Czech Republic -- 2,662, with 10 percent growth; South Korea --
8,470, with 10 percent growth; Japan -- 8,470, with 10 percent
growth; Mexico -- 5,500, with 10 percent growth; Poland -- 3,000,
with 10 percent growth; and Thailand -- 4,000, with 10 percent
growth.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan has also agreed that the worldwide import quota
for compact cars will also increase by 10 percent each year and that
the cars will be imported and distributed by 12 car manufacturers in
Taiwan, including China Motors, Ford Lio Ho, Kuozul Motors, Prince
Motors, Yulon Motors, San Yang Industrial Co., and Yeu Tyan Machinery

    <TEXT>
      <P>Public security forces in the
northeastern mainland China province of Liaoning announced on
Thursday that two suspects wanted for the kidnap of a Taiwan city
councilwoman have been arrested.</P>
      <P>Liu Linlin, deputy head of the Public Security Bureau in Anshan
City, confirmed the arrests of Huang Shidong and Zhang Shifeng. Three
other accomplices, including Li Guangzhi, organizer of the abduction,
were described as still at large.</P>
      <P>Liu said they will announce subsequent developments regarding the
case as soon as the other three suspects are nabbed.</P>
      <P>Huang, 23, was arrested on Tuesday in Heilongjiang Province,
while Zhang, 21, was arrested on Thursday on board a Shanghai-bound
train departing from Yantai City in Shandong Province, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Huang has confessed to taking Lin Ti-chuan, 32,
a city councilwoman from the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung, to a
local hospital in Liaoning Province's Haicheng City. He also admitted
to running away upon discovering that Lin was dead.</P>
      <P>Huang, along with his four accomplices, abducted Lin and her
boyfriend, Wei Tien-kang, on July 27 in the city of Dalian. The
couple was taken to Haicheng, some 200 kilometers north of Dalian,
and detained in an empty room.</P>
      <P>Lin and Wei were given repeated injections of drugs until Lin
began to have difficulty breathing and other complications, and was
taken to a local hospital by Huang on July 29.</P>
      <P>During this time, Wei managed to escape the kidnappers unharmed
and alerted the police, who later found Lin's body at the hospital.
Lin was pronounced dead from an overdose of the drug used by her
captors to subdue her.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the two ROC nationals were abducted in an
attempt to force Wei to return a business debt of US$700,000 to Li,
one of his trading partners.</P>
      <P>In another development, it was reported that Lin's family and
mainland police authorities had reached agreement on transporting
Lin's body back to Taiwan via Hong Kong, instead of through Macao.
Her body, which is currently being embalmed in Beijing, is scheduled
to be brought back to Taiwan on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wei will have to stay in Haicheng for some time until the
conclusion of the investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAESTRO DEBIT CARD HITS TAIWAN MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Maestro debit card, the first of its
kind in Taiwan, was introduced Thursday, providing consumers with an
alternative to credit cards, sources from MasterCard International
reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at a ceremony marking the consumer launch of
the inter-bank Maestro in Taiwan, Finance Minister Paul Chiu noted
that an increasing number of Taiwan people are paying for purchases
both at home and abroad with credit cards, and this change is
bringing Taiwan consumers in line with consumers worldwide.</P>
      <P>The introduction of Maestro in Taiwan will both enhance local
payment options and contribute to Taiwan's goal of developing itself
into an Asia-Pacific finance center, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>The 34 million automatic teller machine (ATM) cards currently in
use in Taiwan can be enhanced with Maestro debit-payment functions in
the near future, enabling cardholders to make purchases at point of
sales in more than 2 million locations worldwide, said Willie Fung,
country manager of MasterCard International Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Initially 16 banks and financial institutions are participating
in the first phase of the consumer launch of Maestro in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"First launched in 1992, Maestro has quickly become one of the
most popular payment cards in the world with 160 million cards issued
by the first quarter of 1998," said Jeff Portelli, vice president of
debit services at MasterCard International. Maestro is the world's
only 100 percent personal identification number (PIN)-based global
on-line debit network, he said.</P>
      <P>"Introducing Maestro in Taiwan will bring more payment
convenience to the Taiwanese," he added.</P>
      <P>In the opening ceremony, Lin Chen-chen, general manager of the
Financial Information System Center, said Taiwan has the highest ATM
penetration in the Asia-Pacific region, with an average of 2.25 ATM
cards per adult. This creates a very strong base for the successful
development of point of sales debit services, she noted.</P>
      <P>"Maestro can not only help us launch a successful domestic point
of sales debit product in Taiwan, but also ensure our local Maestro
card and point of sales terminals are inter-operable with those
around the world. This will contribute to the internationalization of
Taiwan's financial services industry," she added.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing all the 34 million ATM cards in Taiwan
enhanced with Maestro within the next three to five years and to the
debit market reaching NT$206 billion (US$6 billion) in transaction
volume by the year 2000," he said.</P>
      <P>Debit card payment options, when added to an ATM card, allow the
cost of purchases to be deducted directly from a checking or savings
account. If there are not enough funds in the account, the
transaction will not be processed, which will help consumers manage
their finances and avoid over-spending, Fung said.</P>
      <P>And whereas credit cards are more commonly used for larger
purchases, debit cards have proved popular for everyday purchases,
such as those made at gas stations and neighborhood supermarkets, he
said.</P>

C$11.3 million (US$7.45 million).</P>

food in Sudan and some 700,000 are in the most affected area of Bahr
El Ghazal," Diane Marleau, minister for international co-operation,

      <P>She added that Canada continues to stress the immediate need for
a negotiated settlement to Sudan's civil conflict so that food can

isolated regions beset by rebel soldiers.</P>
      <P>Canadian relief funds will also go to therapeutic feeding

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the "constructive engagement"
policy pursued by US President Bill Clinton, most Americans -- 71
percent -- believe that mainland China poses a future threat to the
United States, while only 22 percent disagree, according to a new
opinion poll.</P>
      <P>The national survey also shows that 48 percent of Americans
believe that mainland China is an enemy of the United States at
present, while 43 percent disagree.</P>
      <P>The Center for Security Policy, the Claremont Institute, the Free
Congress Foundation, the Family Research Council and the Heritage
Foundation commissioned The Polling Company to conduct the nationwide
opinion survey of 800 voters on national security, ballistic missiles
and missile defense systems. The poll was conducted July 26 - 29 and
has a margin of error of 3.5 percent at the 95 percent confidence
level.</P>
      <P>Although President Clinton reached a missile de-targeting
agreement with the Beijing leadership during his June 25 - July 3
visit to mainland China, 62 percent of respondents are "not very" or
"not at all" confident that mainland Chinese missiles are not pointed
at the United States.</P>
      <P>Only 14 percent are "extremely" or "very" confident while 22
percent are "somewhat" confident.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 56 percent said they think mainland China will one day
launch a nuclear attack against the United States, while 29 percent
disagreed.</P>
      <P>Seventy-eight percent said the United States should not transfer
"sensitive technology," such as advanced satellite technology that
could be used for military or civilian purposes, to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 76 percent of Americans believe that the Beijing
government does not value human life as much as the US government
does.</P>
      <P>Mainland China appears to have replaced Russia as the United
States' arch rival, as 63 percent of respondents said Russia is not
an enemy of the United States. Nevertheless, 51 percent said Russia
poses a future threat to the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 88 percent of Americans believe that there are
countries other than Russia and mainland China that are getting
ballistic missiles capable of delivering chemical, biological or
nuclear weapons to the United States or its troops and allies
overseas.</P>
      <P>Seventy-one percent of respondents are worried that a nuclear war
may occur in the near future in the wake of India and Pakistan's
demonstrations of their nuclear capabilities. Twenty-five percent are
not worried about these recent developments hastening a nuclear
conflagration, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>In addition, 89 percent believe that nations like North Korea,
Iraq and Iran will have nuclear weapons of their own within 10 years.
And 58 percent of Americans believe that if these rogue nations
possess nuclear weapons, they will pose an "extremely" or "very"
serious threat to the United States or its forces and allies.</P>
      <P>When told that the US military cannot destroy even a single
incoming missile, 86 percent of Americans said they favor the
deployment of a missile defense system. Forty-six percent favor such
a deployment and believe it should be an "urgent priority." Only 8
percent is opposed to such a system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MALAYSIA'S SOVEREIGN RISK RATING DOWNGRADED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thomson Bankwatch, the world's largest
bank rating agency, announced Thursday it was downgrading Malaysia's
sovereign risk rating from A- to BBB.</P>
      <P>This downgrade is based on the mutually reinforcing effects of
this year's sharper-than-expected economic slowdown, ongoing
financial market volatility, mounting domestic debt and worsening
problems in the country's banking and corporate sectors, the agency
said.</P>
      <P>Malaysia's current status calls into question the adequacy of
government efforts to revive Malaysia's domestic economy and to
re-capitalize local financial institutions, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>A key concern is the further deterioration in asset quality
throughout the banking system, and the number of non-performing loans
is expected to increase in the coming months, according to the
agency, which provides ratings, analysis and research on over 1,000
financial institutions in more than 94 countries.</P>
      <P>Conditions in the non-banking sector are also worsening, as
reflected in this year's rising level of corporate debt and
worse-than-expected earnings results. With sharp downturns in local
stock and property markets and the scaling back of several large
infrastructure projects, the overall business climate in Malaysia
remains gloomy.</P>
      <P>The recent decision to lower rates is likely to intensify
pressure on the ringgit and raises concerns about the possibility of
a further outflow of foreign funds, the agency said.</P>
      <P>On the positive side, the bank rating agency said, Malaysia has
demonstrated a strong track record of economic policy management over
the past 15 years, which has endowed the economy with stronger
fundamentals than several of its regional neighbors have.</P>
      <P>Both foreign debt and the debt-serving costs remain low, and the
proportion of short-term debt maturation in the country remains
manageable, the agency stated, adding that the country's efforts to
modernize its economy and diversify its export mix provide it with
more of a cushion to withstand periods of economic downturn.</P>

Thursday attacks on ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and asked members of
Congress to join her in sending a letter to President Bill Clinton on
the urgent need to restore the confidence and security of the ethnic
Chinese in that Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>In the letter the Californian Democrat urged Clinton to make the
treatment of ethnic Chinese central to the administration's policy
toward Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Rep. Pelosi said there are credible reports that at least 168
ethnic Chinese women and girls were raped during the mid-May riots in
Jakarta.</P>
      <P>"These acts of brutality against ethnic Chinese women and their
families are well-documented and cannot be condoned," she wrote,
adding "The confidence and security of the ethnic Chinese community
in Indonesia must be part of any credible reform program by President
Habibie."</P>
      <P>The Indonesian military has come under criticism for failing to
protect the Chinese minority during the rioting and unrest that has
been linked to the country's ongoing political and economic crisis,
noted the congresswoman.</P>
      <P>The letter also urged the Clinton administration to impress upon
the Indonesian government that it must end all official
discrimination against ethnic Chinese, prevent any further attacks,
identify and prosecute those responsible for the May abuses, and
issue an apology and provide compensation to the victims.</P>
      <P>Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright were also urged
to raise concerns over these issues, particularly the raping of
ethnic Chinese women, in possible upcoming meetings with Indonesian

    <HEADLINE>ROC CONCERNED ABOUT JAPAN'S 'THREE NOES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan should not sign any agreement or joint
communique with mainland China on issues related to the Republic of
China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu made the statement in response to reports
that Beijing is pushing Tokyo to codify the so-called "three noes"
toward Taiwan during mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state
visit to Japan early next month.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, Japan and mainland China will sign a
third joint communique expressing their intention to forge a
long-term strategic relationship during Jiang's Tokyo visit.</P>
      <P>The reports said although Japan has yet to decide whether to
include the Beijing-proposed "three noes" into the joint communique,
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi is likely to throw verbal
support behind the "three noes" in his speech at a welcoming party
for Jiang.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" refer to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations in which
statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, Wu said MOFA has directed the ROC
representative office in Tokyo to express the country's concern and
stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as a sovereign state, the Republic of China does not
want to see any Taiwan-related issue enshrined in any official
documents between mainland China and other countries.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu said, mainland China has no legitimate right to
represent the 21.8 million people in Taiwan, nor is it entitled to
negotiate ROC-related issues with other countries.</P>
      <P>"We hope Japan will reject Beijing's unreasonable demand and
discuss any Taiwan-related issues directly with ROC authorities
rather than with Beijing," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He further urged Japan not to engage mainland China at the
expense of the well-being of the people of Taiwan and long-standing
friendly relations between Taipei and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Wu said Japan has informed the Republic of China through proper
diplomatic channels of its understanding of Taipei's stance on the
"three noes" issue.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" came into the limelight after US President Bill
Clinton mentioned them at a roundtable meeting in Shanghai during his
June 25-July 3 mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu dismissed as "untrue" a newspaper report that
Taipei-Tokyo ties are in danger because ROC Representative to Japan
Chuang Ming-yao has not devoted his full energy to his diplomatic
duties.</P>
      <P>"The report doesn't fit the facts," Wu said. "The reality is that
Chuang, a retired admiral, has worked wholeheartedly since assuming
his current post."</P>
      <P>Wu further said Taipei-Tokyo ties have never been in better shape
than at the moment.</P>
      <P>"Through the concerted efforts of Chuang and all the staff at the
ROC representative office, Japan has allowed Taiwan's EVA Airways to
operate direct Taipei-Osaka flights since April 1. This marks a
significant progress in bilateral relations," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Under Beijing's pressure, Japan forced Taiwan's flagship China
Airlines to discontinue its flight services between Taipei and Osaka
shortly after it switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in 1972.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said, Japan resumed on June 8 the extension of
72-hour visa-free privileges to ROC nationals intending to make
transit stops in Japanese territory. "The measure has contributed
much to bilateral commercial, cultural and tourist exchanges," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Wu said, the Republic of China and Japan have held
three rounds of fishery talks since 1996. "The talks have prompted
Japan to respect the established fishing order in some disputed
waters as well as the rights and interests of Taiwan fishermen," Wu
explained, adding that this is another of Chuang's achievements
during his tenure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CANCELS SWAZILAND TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
confirmed on Friday that Premier Vincent Siew will cancel a scheduled
trip to Swaziland following his prostate surgery last week.</P>
      <P>Timothy Yang, director-general of the MOFA's Department of
African Affairs, said that although Siew was discharged from the
hospital on Thursday after successful surgery to correct an enlarged
prostate, he still needs time to convalesce.</P>
      <P>Yang said that Swaziland is an important ally of the ROC, and
that the plan to send a high-ranking official to that country as an
envoy of President Lee Teng-hui has not changed.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office has yet to decide on who will make the
trip in Siew's place.</P>
      <P>The timing of the trip is significant because this year marks the
30th anniversary of the establishment of ties between the ROC and the
African nation. Siew originally wanted to depart for Swaziland in
early September to attend its national day celebration on Sept. 6,
and the 30th birthday celebration for King Mswati III.</P>
      <P>Siew was then to have traveled north to Malawi, according to his
original schedule, to take part in a cultural exchange and visit
overseas Chinese living there.</P>
      <P>Yang said the government has already explained Siew's condition
to the Swazi authorities through the ROC embassy in that country, and
that Swaziland understands the reason for Siew's cancellation.</P>
      <P>He added that an ROC delegation will still visit Swaziland for
its national day celebrations, and that it will include a 60-member
dance troupe.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) President Pan
Wen-yian will visit mainland China on Monday at the head of a
delegation of ranking CPC officials, to take part in a petroleum
summit meeting between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Pan will talk with his counterparts from
three mainland companies, including the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC), on cooperation in oil resource exploration and
the CPC's push to enter the mainland market, CPC officials said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>A significant cross-strait cooperation agreement was forged on
March 1, under the terms of which the CPC and the CNOOC will jointly
prospect for crude oil in a 15,400 square kilometer area southeast of
the Zhujiang Basin in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The state-owned CPC has also spared no effort in opening overseas
markets in a bid to sharpen its competitive edge in the wake of
Taiwan's trade liberalization in this sector.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is regarded as a leading potential buyer for CPC
products, including liquefied petroleum gas, diesel and gasoline.</P>
      <P>The CPC has recently shipped 2,000 kilotons of liquid petroleum
gas via Hong Kong to Guangdong, in order to test the mainland market,
the CPC officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOCTORS REASSURE WORRIED LIFEGUARDS OVER AIDS FEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chances are negligible that two local
lifeguards have contracted HIV as a result of administering
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), Doctor Hung Chien-ching of
National Taiwan University Hospital said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The two lifeguards at Shalun Beach in Tamshui, suburban Taipei,
tried CPR on a man who was dragged out of the sea unconscious on Aug.
1.</P>
      <P>They were only told after the man was rushed to the hospital,
where he later died, that the 61-year-old swimmer was an AIDS
patient.</P>
      <P>The lifeguards were terrified that they may have been infected
with the AIDS-causing HIV, since both men conducted mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation on the man.</P>
      <P>However, Hung, who had treated the man with a three-in-one "drug
cocktail" therapy for a year, said he is almost 100 percent sure that
the two lifeguards have not been infected by his former patient, as
the virus in his case had been eliminated to the extent that it was
undetectable.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hung said, the lifeguards told him that they have no
tooth problems and no injuries in their mouths.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the doctor recommended that both men check into
Mackay Memorial Hospital for thorough check-ups, including a
four-week course of preventive medication therapy and a six-month
follow-up monitoring period, just to make sure they are virus-free.</P>
      <P>Liu Wu-cheh, a physician with Veterans General Hospital-Taipei,
said mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is similar to kissing, and pointed
out that it is virtually impossible to transmit the virus in this
manner, unless the rescuers have injuries or open wounds in their
mouths.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-hsiung, an official with the Department of Health, urged
the general public, including lifeguards, not to be panicked by the
incident, and not to let groundless fears stand in the way of saving
people's lives, or cause AIDS victims to be shunned.</P>
      <P>Doctors have repeated that the AIDS virus can only be transmitted
through intimate sexual contact, transfusions of untreated blood
products, and injections with AIDS-contaminated needles.

      <P>Taiwan's imports and exports in July 1998
declined 22.1 percent and 16.3 percent, respectively, compared with
the same period of last year, according to statistics issued on
Friday by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's total import value in July amounted to US$7.9 billion,
while export value amounted to US$8.96 billion. The plunge in imports
and exports compared with the same period of 1997 is a record slide
since July 1982 and July 1976, respectively, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the MOF Department of Statistics,
pointed out that July's export decline resulted from a 34 percent
decrease in exports to Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) member states, as well as a 23.2 percent drop in
exports to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The fall in imports was primarily due to a sharp downturn in the
amount of goods imported from the US, Japan, Europe and the ASEAN
region, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>He further said that a recovery in Taiwan's exports to other
Asian nations depends on the recovery of Japan's economy and on
whether the economies of the nations of Southeast Asia can be
stabilized. Hsu added that he is afraid Taiwan's exports will not
rise before the fourth quarter of this year.</P>

      <P>The majority of local fathers say that the
family is the institution they most treasure, according to an opinion
survey released on Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey of 460 married men residing throughout the island was
conducted by the Women's Rights Promotion Foundation late last month
to mark this year's Father's Day, which falls on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 80 percent of the respondents chose
"a happy family" as their top priority, while only 17 percent said
career achievements are more important to them.</P>
      <P>Within the family, local fathers are most concerned about their
children, their wives, and their parents, in that order, although the
majority of those surveyed said they owe the most to their parents.</P>
      <P>Asked what would make them feel happiest and most fortunate, 61
percent cited a happy marriage; 33 percent mentioned their children's
achievements; and about 20 percent cited the amassing of wealth.</P>
      <P>Thirty-five percent said they feel miserable if their wives make
frequent complaints, while 28.7 percent said the most depressing
thing is when children fail to study hard or behave themselves.</P>
      <P>About 54 percent said they can happily accept the fact that their
wife is a strong woman; 17.8 percent said such a thing would be
unthinkable; 14.8 percent said they would feel threatened; and 7
percent said they would be unable to accept it.</P>
      <P>While 62 percent said they do not mind if their wives outpace
them in terms of career, 20 percent said they would feel embarrassed,
and 6 percent said they would feel ashamed.</P>
      <P>On their expectations for their children, 67 percent said they
hope all of their children will receive higher education; 8.3 percent
said they hope their sons will receive higher education, but do not
mind whether their daughters receive higher education or not.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 30 percent of the respondents said they hope all of
their children will excel in their studies and their careers, while
66.5 percent said they will take delight in seeing their children
pursue their own life goals. However, 1.3 percent said they want to
see their sons succeed in their careers, while not minding whether
their daughters do or not.</P>
      <P>Professor Tseng Hua-yuan of Tunghai University said the poll
results show that local fathers have high expectations for their
children and that some of them still hold the traditional concept
that males should take precedence over females.</P>
      <P>Lai Kuo-chou, director of the ruling Kuomintang's Youth Affairs
Department, said developing close relationships with their children
is a great challenge for modern fathers.</P>
      <P>"Fathers should never hesitate to express their love for their
children," Lai said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nine mainland Chinese dissidents in
Shanghai Wednesday boldly asked the Public Security Bureau of the city
for permission to collect signitures on a petition for the abolition
of the "reeducation through labor camps" system.</P>
      <P>In their application filed with the bureau, the nine dissidents
asked permission to set up tables at three public locations in the
city for collecting 10,000 signitures on the petition, according to a
press release from the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China.</P>
      <P>The information said the application has not been approved by
the bureau.</P>
      <P>The dissidents expressed the hope that their application will be
approved, because it is one of the basic rights of the people to
collect signitures for petition at designated public locations.</P>
      <P>They said in the application that the system, under which public
security authorities can throw people into the labor camps for up to
three years without trial, is in gross violation of the Constitution.
"This authoritarian system must be abolished," they said.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese public security authorities often send
dissidents to the camps for muzzling them. Of the nine dissidents,
Han Lifa, Yao Zhenxian, Li Guotao, and Dai Xuezhong have been
"reeducated" in the labor camps. The other five are Cai Guihua, Ma
Wei, Zhou Jianhe, Zhang Rujun, and Zhang Hualin.</P>

following reports that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
slated to visit Japan in September.</P>
      <P>Yen Wen-chin, director of the DPP's Mainland China Affairs

measures to enhance bilateral ties similar to its dealings with the

engagement with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Yen expressed concern over the visit's possible long-term impact
on Taiwan due to increased difficulties for the island to take part
in the international arena.</P>
      <P>In the face of a possible strategic partnership between Japan and
mainland China, Taiwan should make greater effort to improve its ties
with Japan, which has exhibited a strong fear of the Chinese

Taiwan's consent to add flights from Japan to Taiwan to meet
ever-increasing demand, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In an upcoming bilateral aviation consultation, Japan Asia
Airways (JAA) will request that 40 charter flights be added to its
annual number of flights to Taiwan, the first time that Japan has
made such a request.</P>
      <P>An unofficial request was made recently by Japan's Ministry of
Transport to Taipei through the Interchange Association, which
represents Japan's interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties between the two countries, CAA officials said.</P>
      <P>In past years, only Taiwan has asked for increases in the number
of flights from Taiwan to Japan, and Japan has usually taken two to
three years to give its agreement.</P>
      <P>The CAA has already agreed in principle to JAA's request, and in
the meantime, will ask for a corresponding increase in the number of
Taiwan flights to Japan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>If the two sides reach consensus on the issue, the annual number

even though mainland China refuses to renounce the use of force
against Taiwan, most local people do not believe that war will really
break out between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Asked if they think there may be a cross-strait military
confrontation in the future, 61.2 percent answered either "unlikely"
or "very unlikely," while only 3.6 percent responded "very likely,"
and 22.8 percent said "likely."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey found that 87.7 percent said they will
stand up to fight for Taiwan if the mainland attacks the island,
while 6.8 percent said they will not.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said the high percentage of
local people willing to defend their homeland is worthy of attention.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hsing, deputy secretary-general of the semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation, said the poll results indicate that
Taiwan people have high expectations for peace across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, the survey findings also manifest the
determination of the people of Taiwan to fight against communist
invasion," Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>The same survey further found that 67 percent of the respondents
do not think that allowing local youths to study in mainland China is
an important issue.</P>
      <P>Commenting on this finding, Lin said it indicates that the
government need not take bold steps to recognize academic degrees
conferred by mainland universities or colleges at the moment. "The
government should instead exercise prudence in tackling the issue and
adopt a gradual manner in accrediting mainland degrees."</P>
      <P>Asked if they think mainland-educated Taiwan students are likely
to become pro-Beijing, 42.6 percent answered in the affirmative, 30.4
percent said no, and 18.5 percent said they did not know.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 64 percent said they believe that
President Lee Teng-hui has a strong determination to protect
Taiwan's security; while 66.8 percent said they are convinced that
Lee has a firm determination to defend the Republic of China's
national dignity.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that nearly 70 percent support the
government's "no haste, be patient" policy toward investment in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, the government bans investment in mainland
China's high-tech industries and infrastructure projects, and
requires that each mainland investment project should not exceed
US$50 million.</P>
      <P>While 70 percent gave a thumbs-up to the government's regulation
that each mainland investment project should not exceed US$50
million; 66 percent threw support behind the government's ban on
investment in mainland China's high-tech industries; and 54 percent
said they support the current ban on investment in mainland China's
infrastructure construction projects, such as highways, railways and
power plants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, US SIGN WTO PACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China signed a formal
agreement with the United States Friday on the terms for Taiwan's
accession to the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed here by ROC Vice Economics Minister Lin
Yi-fu and US Assistant Trade Representative Robert Cassidy on behalf
of their respective governments.</P>
      <P>The accord marked a huge step forward in the ROC's bid to join
the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky issued a statement
expressing her delight at the conclusion of the accord with the ROC.
The United States will soon pass the document on to the WTO
Secretariat for reference, she said.</P>
      <P>Barshefsky added that the United States will continue discussing
several trade issues with Taiwan through multilateral WTO
consultation channels, including Taiwan's farm subsidies and import
procedures for agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States finalized bilateral WTO talks in
February. After several months of examining the meeting minutes, the
two sides finally came to terms on tariff rates for more than 8,000
agricultural and industrial products.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the ROC delegation said Taiwan made minor
concessions on tariff rates for four fishery products and three
industrial items at the last minute to smooth the way for a final
agreement. The sources, however, would not elaborate on the details.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, Taiwan will largely cut tariff rates
on a number of American agricultural and industrial products in
addition to opening its telecommunications and financial service
markets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also promised to sign the WTO-sponsored multilateral
government procurement and civil aviation aircraft agreements
immediately after its WTO accession.</P>
      <P>To date, Taiwan has sealed bilateral agreements with 23 of the 26
WTO contracting parties which had expressed the desire to hold talks
with the island on its WTO accession terms.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also completed bilateral consultations with the
15-member European Union, Canada and Hong Kong, but the three
economies have yet to sign formal accords with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong reportedly has assured ROC economics officials that it
will not be the last to seal a bilateral WTO pact with Taiwan. The
biggest obstacle may lie in negotiations with Canada, ROC sources
said.</P>
      <P>Canada has asked the ROC to offer it the same "down payment" that
Taipei offered to the United States. The request has been denied, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>The "down payment" refers to Taiwan's consent to imports of
5,000 tons of pork offal, 10,000 tons of chicken meat and 12,500
tons of animal intestines from the United States before its WTO
accession.</P>
      <P>The ROC's representative office in Geneva just concluded another
round of talks with the WTO working party responsible for screening
Taiwan's membership application. The consultations focused on farm
trade and subsidy issues. A similar multilateral meeting will also be
held in October to speed up Taiwan's WTO entry.</P>
      <P>ROC Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said earlier this year that
Taiwan expects to be formally admitted to the WTO in the second half
of next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan applied to join the WTO's precursor, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1990 as an independent
customs terriotry, while Beijing filed its application in 1986.
Although Taiwan is ahead of mainland China in membership talks, it
remains unclear whether Taiwan can enter the WTO ahead of Beijing.
Both Taipei and Beijing are now WTO observers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN MAINLAND FACE DIFFICULTY: THE ECONOMIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The murder of a Taiwan city councilor in
mainland China last week has highlighted the difficult situation
Taiwan businessmen in the mainland face, the latest issue of The
Economist reported.</P>
      <P>The weekly magazine said mainland China is one of the most
dangerous places in the world to do business.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen, like other foreign nationals, face problems
with bureaucracy, losses and adjustment difficulties, but unlike
others, they have also had to deal with being assaulted, kidnapped
and murdered, the article said.</P>
      <P>Citing figures from Taiwan's intermediary body, the Straits
Exchange Foundation, The Economist said 59 businessmen from Taiwan
have been reported missing or murdered in the past seven years.
During the same period, 127 Taiwan nationals have been kidnapped,
robbed or detained after encountering business disputes.</P>
      <P>The figures may be even higher as many victims choose not to
report crimes committed against them to hide their investments in an
effort to evade taxes, the article said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen have become a prominent target because of
their large number. There are an estimated 200,000 Taiwan businessmen
in the mainland at any time. The political rivalry across the Taiwan
Strait has also made them more vulnerable.</P>
      <P>However, The Economist noted that the behavior of some Taiwan
businessmen in the mainland may also contribute to the problem. Some
Taiwan businessmen, taking advantage of common language and cultural
background, have ventured to inland provinces of the mainland to
operate businesses which can cause trouble. Also, those who like to
show off their wealth can attract resentment and make them easy
targets for crime.</P>
      <P>The article said despite the risks, Taiwan businessmen continue
to seek opportunities in the mainland because of the perceived
business potential and the need for cheap labor.</P>
      <P>Some major Taiwan enterprises in the mainland have formed groups
to protect themselves against such criminal acts, the article said.</P>
      <P>There are reportedly 43 such groups. Because they employ a large
number of people, these groups have become a local business council
or an unofficial consulate because of its influence locally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE IN US PROTEST AGAINST ATROCITIES IN INDONESIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen, H.C. Huang, and Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese people throughout the United
States protested on Friday against atrocities committed against
ethnic Chinese by Indonesian rioters in May.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of demonstrators massed in front of the Indonesian
Embassy in Washington, D.C., where they held placards and shouted
slogans to express their anger over the attacks against Chinese
people during May's political upheaval in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>They urged the Indonesian government to ensure the personal
safety of ethnic Chinese living in the Southeast Asian country and
bring to justice those responsible for the brutal attacks.</P>
      <P>The protesters, including a large number of Chinese students,
came from as far away as Cincinnati, Ohio, a 10-hour drive from
Washington.</P>
      <P>An estimated 1,200 ethnic Chinese people were killed and more
than a hundred ethnic Chinese women were raped during the chaotic
period in Indonesia which eventually toppled President Suharto.</P>
      <P>One of the organizers of the event, Lee Hsing-kuo, called on
Chinese people around the world to stand firm behind their
compatriots in Indonesia, saying such horrific events could also
occur in Australia, Canada, and other countries.</P>
      <P>Lee, chairman of the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars
at Cincinnati University, said that Friday's demonstration was part
of a series of protest activities against Indonesian government.</P>
      <P>He said that the organizers will present petitions to the US
Congress and the Clinton Administration, asking them to help press
Indonesia to honor its promise that a thorough investigation into the
May rioting will uncover the truth, and that all those who committed
the atrocities will be severely punished.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian government should guarantee that this kind of
horror against ethnic Chinese should never happen again, Lee said,
adding that when international organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund provides financial aid to Indonesia, it
should set a condition that the Southeast Asian country improve its
human rights record.</P>
      <P>The largest protest against Indonesia in the United States was
staged in New York, attracting more than three thousand people.
Chanting "Shame on You," the protesters condemned the Indonesian
government for standing by and watching the rioters attack ethnic
Chinese and rape ethnic Chinese women.</P>
      <P>They demanded the Indonesian government uncover the truth about
the rioting, bring to justice all those who committed or masterminded
the atrocities, provide compensation for losses sustained by ethnic
Chinese, offer medical treatment to the injured, compensate the
families of the deceased and institute legislation to protect the
lives and property of the ethnic Chinese living there.</P>
      <P>Two representatives of the protesters sent a written protest to
the Indonesian Consulate General in New York, which was accepted by
one of its officials.</P>
      <P>The protest was initiated by New York-based Association of
Chinese People Protesting Atrocities in Indonesia. During the
two-hour demonstration, the organizers announced a declaration,
calling on the United Nations and the governments around the world to
impose an economic sanction on Indonesia as part of efforts to press
the country to work hard to uncover the truth about the rioting and
to bring the rioters to justice.</P>
      <P>Liu Kuo-kai, an official with the association, said that the
protest was aimed at safeguarding the dignity and rights of Chinese
people.</P>
      <P>Liu said that next week, they will present a name list containing
over 10,000 signatures to the United Nations. The signatures were
collected during a campaign last month.</P>
      <P>Similar protests also took place in Chicago, Houston, Los
Angeles, and San Francisco, as well as in the Canadian cities of
Toronto and Vancouver.</P>
      <P>In Los Angeles, the protest was attended by nearly 3,000 people.
They peacefully expressed concern to what the ethnic Chinese have
suffered during the chaos in May.</P>
      <P>In a written protest to the Indonesian Consulate General, they
demanded that the Indonesian government apologize to Chinese
Indonesians, provide compensation for losses sustained by ethnic
Chinese, set up a committee to investigate into the rioting, and make
sure such horrific events will not happen again.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the event said that if the Indonesian government
failed to respond to their requests, they do not exclude the
possibilities of staging another protest on Aug. 17.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Washington, D.C., and Boston will be the scenes of
similar protests against Indonesia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BODY OF COUNCILWOMAN RETURNED TO KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The body of murdered Kaohsiung City
Councilor Lin Ti-chuan was flown back to her southern Taiwan hometown
via Hong Kong at around 4:50 p.m. on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The return of Lin's body signals a tentative wrapping up of an
episode which is seen as having clouded cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Lin, 32, a member of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), was killed accidentally by an overdose of drugs
administered during a botched kidnap in the northeastern mainland
Chinese city of Haicheng late last month.</P>
      <P>Lin's body was flown to Hong Kong at around 11 a.m. from Beijing,
where the hearse carrying her body from Haicheng arrived on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top representative in Hong Kong, Cheng An-kuo, met the
flight when it arrived in Hong Kong, where he expressed his
condolences to Lin's family.</P>
      <P>A DPP delegation, including eight female DPP lawmakers, flew to
Hong Kong from Taiwan on Saturday morning to beef up the procession
ushering Lin's body back to Taiwan. Three officials from the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) also traveled to
Hong Kong to offer their help to deal with the aftermath of the
incident.</P>
      <P>Lin's parents, brother and several of her DPP colleagues held a
joint press conference in Hong Kong on Saturday afternoon prior to
their departure for Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, trees along the route between the airport and her
office were decorated with yellow ribbons to show sadness and
remembrance. A short memorial service was held at the airport, while
formal funeral rites will be conducted at her office, according to
DPP sources in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Lin and her boyfriend, Wei Tien-kang, were abducted by five
mainland Chinese men in Dalian City upon their arrival in the
northeastern city on July 27. It was Lin's first visit to mainland
China. Wei, a Kaohsiung businessman who runs an import-export
business, travels frequently across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to mainland Chinese authorities, four of the five
suspected kidnappers had been apprehended as of Friday. The fifth, Li
Guangzhi, who is said to have been the mastermind behind the
kidnapping, is still at large.</P>
      <P>The arrested suspects said that Li ordered Wei's kidnapping to
force him to repay a debt he owed to Li. The two victims were
abducted by the four men, taken about 200 kilometers north to
Haicheng City, and hidden in an empty apartment.</P>
      <P>Wei and Lin were injected with an unknown drug which may have
been heroin, and fell into on-and-off unconsciousness. Lin later
reportedly experienced difficulty breathing and turned pale on July
29. She was rushed to a Haicheng hospital, where she was declared
dead on arrival. The four suspects then fled.</P>
      <P>Wei regained consciousness during their absence and managed to
escape and notify local public security authorities of the
kidnapping.</P>
      <P>Since news of the incident broke, authorities in Taiwan,
including officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
and the SEF, were barred from joining the rescue effort or
negotiating on behalf of Lin's family.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lin's family and her DPP colleagues, the Beijing
authorities allowed only one local forensic expert, Dr. Chen
Yao-chang of National Taiwan University Hospital, to travel to the
mainland. He took part in an autopsy carried out to determine the
cause of Lin's death.</P>
      <P>One of the rising stars of the DPP, Lin made her debut in
politics at the age of 28. A political maverick, Lin was dubbed "the
little chili" for her spicy interpellation style.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Affected by the financial crisis in
Southeast Asia, Taiwan's economic growth has slowed down and its
exports recorded negative growth, a high-ranking economics official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Schive Chi, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said the government has decided to stimulate
domestic demand and promote investment to attain the goal of 5.5
percent growth rate this year.</P>
      <P>Schive was reporting on the economic prospects in the Republic of
China during a sub-Cabinet-level meeting between the ROC and the US
Friday.</P>
      <P>He used the short-term "growth recession" to describe the ROC's
present economic situation.</P>
      <P>Schive said that among economies on both sides of the Pacific, the
US thinks that economically, the US, Taiwan and the mainland have
fared well this year. But he said the US has adjusted upward its
prediction of economic growth twice, while Taiwan has revised
downward its prediction.</P>
      <P>Hit by the financial crisis in Southeast Asia, Taiwan's economic
growth in the first quarter this year has slowed down to 5.9 percent
from 6.86 percent in the whole year in 1997, the vice chairman said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the misery index, which takes into consideration the
unemployment and inflation rates, has risen to 4.3 percent in Taiwan,
far higher than the 3.1 percent in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The export of commodities in the first half this year declined by
7.1 percent, while imports declined by 3.5 percent. In terms of the
New Taiwan dollar, it amounts to zero growth in Taiwan's exports in
the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Schive noted that Taiwan's strong economic performance last
year did not come from the exports, but was triggered by private
investment as high as 15.6 percent. Private investment in the first
quarter of this year rose by 42.8 percent. The government is
estimating that private investment this year could reach a growth
rate of 20 percent.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC government has announced substantial economic
stimulus packages in the hope that the private sector will increase
participation in public construction projects to achieve an economic
growth rate of 5.5 percent this year.</P>
      <P>US officials were optimistic about Taiwan's plans to expand
domestic demand. They said in a statement that maintaining a sound
economic policy in Taiwan and promoting a stable Taiwan currency is
in the best interests of the island as well as the whole Asian
region.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's top negotiator with
Taiwan said Saturday he looks forward to meeting C. F. Koo, chairman
of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation, in Shanghai this
fall.</P>
      <P>Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait, made the statement in a meeting with Chang
Jung-kung, director of Taiwan's Mainland Research Department under
the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Wang told Chang that Koo is welcome to visit mainland China this
fall and added, "We'll arrange his itinerary in accordance to his
wish."</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang met for the first time in Singapore in April 1993 to
lay the framework for regular contact and dialogue between the two
organizations.</P>
      <P>The second Koo-Wang meeting was originally scheduled for the
autumn of 1995, but Beijing unilaterally suspended the meeting and
cut off all regular SEF-ARATS dialogue shortly after ROC President
Lee Teng-hui visited the United States in June 1995. Beijing regarded
Lee's visit as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>After over three years at an impasse, the two sides have
gradually resumed contact this year, and SEF Chairman Koo is
scheduled to travel to the mainland to meet Wang either in September
or in October. The two sides, however, have yet to finalize an agenda
for the planned Koo-Wang meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang also exchanged views with Chang on relations across the
Taiwan Strait. Chang said he hopes the two sides will pool their
wisdom to break the deadlock and forge rapprochement for mutual
benefit.</P>
      <P>Chang arrived in Shanghai Friday evening after attending a

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO HONOR CONCESSION COMMITMENTS TO US FOR WTO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will begin honoring its commitments
to further open its agricultural and industrial markets to the US
after the signing of a formal US-Taiwan agreement on terms for
Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the United States forged a formal WTO agreement in
Washington, formally wrapping up years of bilateral negotiations
which were loosely completed in February this year with only minor
details not tackled.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, Taiwan will allow the import of
US-made automobiles to a tune of 160,000 during the first year of
Taiwan's accession to the WTO. That figure is approximately 32
percent of the island's entire automobile market.</P>
      <P>Previously, Taiwan agreed that the US-made cars will enter the
island at an import tariff rate of 20 percent upon Taiwan's WTO
accession, 10 percent lower than the current average.</P>
      <P>But according to the WTO principle of the most-favored-nation
treatment, the 20 percent commitment to the US may be further slashed
to 17.5 percent since Taiwan has agreed to lower import tariffs on
European cars to 17.5 percent over a 10-year period, said officials
from the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT).</P>
      <P>Taiwan also agreed to lower the local-content rate for compact
cars from the current 50 percent to 40 percent beginning Jan. 1,
1999, and cancel preferential commodity tax rates for locally
developed engines, chassises and auto designs.</P>
      <P>For other industrial products, Taiwan agreed to lower the average
import tariffs to 4.9 percent before 2002 from the current 6.5
percent, and gradually down to 4.7 percent by 2004.</P>
      <P>On medical equipment and related products, Taiwan agreed to scrap
import tariffs on certain items, and will remove them
across-the-board before 2002.</P>
      <P>On tobacco and cigarette imports, Taiwan promised to continue
efforts to end the tobacco monopoly, agreed to impose zero-tariffs on
imported liquor products by 2000, stop imposing import tariffs on
beer in 2005, and cut tariffs on imported grape wine to 10 percent by
2002.</P>
      <P>On agricultural trade, one of the thorniest issues in the
US-Taiwan WTO talks, Taiwan agreed to partially open its agricultural
markets immediately to US imports as a "down payment" for exchange of
US support for Taiwan's WTO bid.</P>
      <P>The "down payment" includes 5,000 metric tons of pork bellies,
7,500 metric tons of pig offals and pork chops, 10,000 metric tons of
chicken meat, and 5,000 metric tons of beef chops and offals, said
BOFT officials.</P>
      <P>The "down payment" means an extra market of US$18 million for US
pork dealers, and US$10 million more sales for US chicken dealers. By
2004, US$43 million worth of American chicken products will be
cutting into the Taiwan market, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Also in the agreement, Taiwan will open its rice market to US
imports, allowing some US$60 million worth of American rice to hit
the Taiwan shelves over the next year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei has not received a reply from
mainland Chinese authorities regarding the detainment of a Taiwan
businessman, the Straits Exchange Foundation said Saturday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Secretary-General Wu Hsin-hsing said that the SEF sent
a letter to its mainland counterpart the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits on July 22. The letter requested ARATS to
check on information regarding Hsu Chai-hsin who reportedly has been
held in detention for nearly one year.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the SEF is still waiting for a reply from the ARATS
regarding this matter.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies formed to
handle cross-strait affairs in absence of official contacts.</P>
      <P>Hsu's case was another financial dispute involving businessmen
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Wu said, adding that over
the past 10 years, there were some 485 cross-strait financial dispute
cases.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the mainland authorities for detaining Wu for
such a long time without handling out a verdict to the case. The
mainland authorities should make sure the rights of Taiwan
businessmen operating in the mainland are upheld, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the SEF learned Wu's case from a petition sent by
Hsu's family on July 21. According to the petition, Hsu, who invested
US$10 million toward the establishment of a golf club, was arrested
in Beijing on July 31, 1997.</P>
      <P>Hsu was then charged with bribery. Since then, he has been held
in detention without being allowed to meet with his family. He was
also forced to transfer the property rights of the golf club, the
petition said.</P>
      <P>Wu once again called on ARATS to assume talks with the SEF. He
said that the two intermediary bodies should discuss ways to ensure
personal and property security of Taiwan businessmen based in the
mainland and put the issue into an agreement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation sent a
letter Friday to its Beijing counterpart expressing hope that the
recent death of a Kaohsiung city councilor will not affect the
planned meeting between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The SEF sent the letter in response to a letter from the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait dated Aug. 4.</P>
      <P>The SEF's letter said Taipei regretted ARATS' harsh condemnation
of the SEF's handling of the death of Lin Ti-chuan, who was also a
member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party. Lin died in a
botched kidnapping incident in Haicheng in mainland China's northeast
Liaoning Province late July.</P>
      <P>The ARATS letter criticized the SEF for "taking advantage of the
incident to deliberately create and exacerbate differences in order
to to sow dissension between compatriots across the strait." In
addition, the letter hinted at possible uncertainty over the upcoming
meeting in the fall between SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS
Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, SEF vice chairman and secretary-general, told
reporters the SEF regrets that Lin's death and that of Taiwan
businessman Wang Fu-ching remain unresolved. He added that the ARATS
censured the SEF's humanistic request to allow the SEF's legal expert
to visit the mainland along with relatives of the victim.</P>
      <P>Also, the SEF cannot understand the ARATS criticism that the SEF
impeded the mainland's efforts to conduct an autopsy on Lin's remains
as the SEF repeatedly exhibited respect for the opinions of
professionals as well as Lin's family, Shi said.</P>
      <P>As to the forthcoming Koo-Wang meeting and the trend of
cross-strait relations, Shi observed that dialogue between the two
sides have been halted for more than three years, a matter the two
quasi-official bodies have worked hard to end recently with plans for
the Koo-Wang meeting slated for later this year.</P>
      <P>Shi expressed the hope that the SEF and ARATS will help each
other handle issues which arise across the strait based on mutual
respect, and resume a dialogue as soon as possible. He added that
priority should be given to topics regarding ensuring the rights and
protection of interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, stressed Shi, improved relations across
the strait will be more likely to be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of formal ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST TAIWAN PEOPLE FEEL MAINLAND CHINA IS 'UNFRIENDLY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of local people supporting Taiwan
independence has increased in the wake of the kidnap and murder of a
local councilor in mainland China in late July, according to results
of a public opinion poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The poll of 902 adult citizens, conducted by a research and
personnel training center operated by the ruling Kuomintang on Aug.
6-7, found that 23.4 percent of the respondents hope to see Taiwan
move toward independence, compared to 13 percent of those who want to
see unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The gap between percentages of independence and unification
supporters is the largest in all similar KMT surveys," said Tsai
Pi-huang, director of the KMT research and training center. "In
previous surveys, the gap was only about 3 to 4 percent."</P>
      <P>Tsai, also a legislator-at large, further said the percentage of
unification supporters is the lowest compared to similar polls
conducted in recent years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42.4 percent of the respondents said they prefer to
see the status quo in cross-strait relations maintained.</P>
      <P>The latest poll results also show that 62 percent feel mainland
China is unfriendly toward Taiwan, while only 5 percent said they
feel mainland China is friendly.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said the number of
independence supporters has consistently increased whenever mainland
China threatened to use force against Taiwan or adopted unfriendly
behavior toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland China will pay more attention to Taiwan
people's feelings and sentiments to reduce animosity and forge
rapprochement," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 41 percent were dissatisfied with Beijing's
handling of issues related to the kidnap and murder of Kaohsiung City
Councilor Lin Ti-chuan in northeastern China in late July; only 18.7
percent approved of Beijing's handling.</P>
      <P>Wu said Beijing's refusal to allow Taiwan's semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation staff members to the mainland to help the Lin
family handle the aftermath concerning the councilor's death was a
mistake.</P>
      <P>Wu said denying entry of SEF staff to the mainland has had an
adverse effect on the Taiwan public's perceptions of the mainland
government.</P>
      <P>The same survey also found that 47.2 percent of local people
support the government's "no haste, be patient" policy on
mainland-bound investment; while 24.9 percent were against the
policy.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and the United
States held a sub-Cabinet-level meeting in Washington, D.C. on
Friday to discuss trade, economic and financial issues.</P>
      <P>The two countries signed a formal agreement on terms for
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) and forged
consensus on many points during the one-day meeting.</P>
      <P>The United States showed good will in the meeting, allowing for
the first time electornic media cameramen to enter the conference
room to shoot footage.</P>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) also issued a press
release on the event. The move seemed to call US media attention to
the fact that Washington and Taipei held a high-level dialogue
following a summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and
his mainland Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, in Beijing on June
27.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu served as chief Taiwan
negotiator, while the United States was represented by Deputy
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. AIT Chairman Richard Bush and
ROC Representative to the US Stephen Chen were also present at the
meeting.</P>
      <P>In addition to sealing a bilateral WTO accord, the two sides
agreed to sign a customs cooperation agreement before the end of
this year and reviewed progress in negotiations for the singing of a
bilateral investment agreement.</P>
      <P>The two sides also discuss issues related to finaical management
and liberalization, trade and investment, as well as the prevention
of economic and fianncial crimes.</P>
      <P>Lin said after the meeting that both sides agree that Taiwan's
maintaining a sound economic policy and promoting stability of its
currency are in Taiwan's and entire Asia's interests.</P>
      <P>An American delegate said the United States hopes to continue
similar engagement or to conduct any other forms of constructive
dialogue with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ROC is hopeful that similar sub-Cabinet-level
meeting will be held regularly in the future. The time, place and
format for the next sub-Cabinet-level meeting will be decided
later.</P>
      <P>The first sub-Cabinet-level meeting was held in Washington,
D.C. in June 1995, and the second meeting took place in Taipei in
September 1996. The third meeting was originally scheduled for 1997,
but was later postponed to this year.</P>
      <P>The United States reportedly will decide whether to hold
similar conferences with the ROC in the future after conducting an
interministerial review of the results of the three previous
sub-Cabinet-level meetings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thailand is expected to investigate the
alleged dumping of cheap fabric in the kingdom by mainland China, a
Thai Textile Manufacturers' Association official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The official said that locally made fabrics sell at about 58
baht (US$1.45) per meter, but fabric from mainland China sells at
just 40 baht per meter.</P>
      <P>The Commerce Ministry is collecting information about the price
of imported Chinese fabrics against the price in its home market,
following complaints by the association.</P>
      <P>The textile sector is one of the local industries suffering
severely from the recession, the official said.</P>
      <P>Thailand exported textiles and garments worth US$2.03 billion
during the first five months of 1998. The country expects to achieve
this year's export target of US$5.93 billion, representing a growth

      <P>Six Canadian members of parliament will
visit the Republic of China from Aug. 9-15.</P>
      <P>The six are Mac Harb, John Maloney, Ivan Grose, Richard Harris,
Madeleine Dalphond and Paul Bonwick.</P>
      <P>An official of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada
said the parliamentarians will try to discuss real issues between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Currently the biggest issue between Taiwan and Canada is probably
a Canadian proposal to sign an agreement on the avoidance of double
taxation with Taiwan. Taipei balks at signing the treaty because of
opposition from Taiwan emigrants to Canada.</P>
      <P>Taiwan immigrants in Canada are fiercely opposed to the treaty
because it would enable Canada to tax their overseas assets. The
Canadian government insists it's a fair deal which will only hurt tax
dodgers.</P>
      <P>Last spring, another group of Canadian MP's visited Taiwan and
returned to report to their colleagues in the House of Commons that
they support the government's initiative to sign such a treaty with

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui issued citations
to the seven deceased Suei Yang crewmen during their funeral rites
held at the Tsoying naval base in southern Taiwan on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The public funeral rites were presided over by Navy Fleet

posthumous promotions.</P>
      <P>Huang Chi-yuan was promoted to petty officer second class from
petty officer third class, while Wu Cheng-yang and five other seamen
second class were promoted to petty officers third class. As a token
of respect, their coffins were covered with national flags which were

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN PREFER TO RESOLVE DISPUTES PRIVATELY: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 65 percent of Taiwan businessmen
operating in mainland China have encountered disputes there and 91
percent of these people resorted to private mediation for resolution,
the results of a recent survey showed.</P>
      <P>According to the survey conducted by the monthly Teacher Chang
magazine, 68 percent of businessmen based in the mainland would
prefer to get help from Taiwan businessmen's associations. Only 1.3
percent said they would ask one of the two semi-official
organizations -- Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation or Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- for help.</P>
      <P>The most frequent cause of disputes arose in dealings with local
authorities and local trade partners. Violations of patents or
trademarks, disputes regarding labor-management relations and land
acquisitions were also common, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Although many Taiwan businessmen surveyed acknowledged that a
high percentage of fighting, kidnappings or even murders of Taiwan
businessmen were in connection with love affairs between Taiwan men
and local mainland Chinese women, it is worth noting that most of
them chose not to comment such affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-chang, publisher of the magazine, said most Taiwan
businessmen will first try to resolve their business problems through
"private relationships" which many times result in blackmail or
kidnapping. Businessmen who turn to the SEF are usually those who
have no other avenue of recourse, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the survey was conducted by 66 representatives
of the magazine who made several trips to the mainland in the first
half of this year. The survey was commissioned by the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>In the light of increased business disputes and crimes targeting
Taiwan businessmen in mainland China, a leader of a Taiwan
businessmen's group, whose name was not made known, called on Taiwan
investors to behave themselves while doing business in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The blackmailing and kidnapping of Taiwan investors would be
largely reduced if they abide by local rules and keep a low profile
in their private lives, he said.</P>
      <P>A survey by the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of
Industries in July also found that Taiwan businessmen based in
mainland China would rather resolve their disputes through private
channels in order to not annoy local mainland officials.</P>
      <P>Seeking help from the SEF or ARATS would only pose greater danger
to their personal safety and create more difficulties to their
businesses, it indicated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL DRUG RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
officers busted an international drug ring Saturday, seizing 22
bricks of heroin weighing eight kilograms with an estimated street
value of NT$300 million (NT$8.4 million).</P>
      <P>Teng Ter-ming, one member of the four-man drug trafficking
operation, was a former official of mainland China's State Council
stationed in Hong Kong, the bureau said. A Taiwanese buyer, Hsu
Chin-chuan, was also arrested along with three accomplices from Hong
Kong identified by police as Cheng Wei-wen, Lee Kuo-chiang, and Tan
Chien-chi.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-huan, a prosecutor with the Taipei District Prosecutors
Office in charge of the case, said the drugs were smuggled into
Taiwan from the mainland's Yunnan Province, rather than from the
Golden Triangle in the Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Expressing doubt that other mainland Chinese officials were
involved in the case, Huang said the case needs to be thoroughly
investigated. He called for greater efforts from both sides of the
Taiwan Strait to jointly crack down on cross-strait criminal
activities.</P>
      <P>Acting on tip, Huang, in conjunction with Investigation Bureau
agents in Taipei and Hsinchu, as well as military police, began to
monitor and probe movements of the suspects a year ago.</P>
      <P>Through their monitoring efforts, investigators found that Teng
moved a large amount of heroin into Taiwan from Hong Kong last
Wednesday. Hsu had met Teng at the airport and later met with Tan in
a hotel in downtown Taipei on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Following a 24-hour wait, investigators learned that the drugs
were stashed by the smuggling ring separately in two locations in
downtown Taipei, one on Hoping East Road and the other on Linsen
North Road.</P>
      <P>Agents found Teng and Tan with some of the drugs on Saturday when
they were enroute to delivering them to Hsu. The remainder of the
drugs were found hidden in the two buildings later the same day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH ARATS CHIEF ON CROSS-STRAIT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai, Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Chang Lung and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's chief in charge of
mainland Chinese affairs urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to
pool their wisdom and work toward a common ground which would
contribute to the reunification of China.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Mainland Research Department Director General Chang
Jung-kung made the call during his meeting with Beijing's top
negotiator with Taiwan Wang Daohan in Shanghai Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, told Chang the two sides should develop their relations under
the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Speaking on cross-strait talks, Wang said the current priority is
to end the prevailing hostility on both sides and promote common
interests.</P>
      <P>Beijing has called for cross-strait negotiations on China's
reunification to take place in an equal and peaceful manner, Wang
said, but he noted the talks should take place under the "one China"
principle. Beijing's version of the principle maintains that Taiwan
is a province of China and Beijing is the only legitimate government
of China.</P>
      <P>Wang said Taipei should authorize its Straits Exchange Foundation
to conduct political negotiations with the mainland. Such a channel
for dialogue can help resolve problems related to the security of the
Pacific region and Taiwan, Wang stressed.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are two intermediary bodies formed by Taipei
and Beijing authorities to deal with cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official links.</P>
      <P>Responding to Wang's comments, Chang said that the "one China"
principle should be interpreted based on the principles of historical
consistency, the reality and future prospects.</P>
      <P>According to Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui, Chang
said, the KMT's mainland policy is based on the reality of a
"separated China." The policy states that both sides of the strait
should work toward a newly unified China where freedom, democracy and
prosperity exists.</P>
      <P>Chang arrived in Shanghai on Friday after attending a seminar on
cross-strait affairs in Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator urged the government Sunday to
take precautions against the capital inflow of mainland Chinese funds
into Taiwan's stock and real estate markets as it would influence
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hung from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
made the call in a written interpellation to the Executive Yuan,
according to a news release.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmaker said Beijing is expected to intervene in
Taiwan's year-end legislative elections through any means possible,
including use of their capital.</P>
      <P>Injecting money into Taiwan through financial and economic
institutions is the easiest way Beijing can manipulate the island's
elections, Chang warned.</P>
      <P>He noted that mainland Chinese funds can be transferred to Taiwan
in huge quantities through two channels. One of those is through
Taiwan investment companies in Hong Kong where capital can flow into
Taiwan's trading in stock and real estates, two sectors that play
leading roles in a economic system.</P>
      <P>The other channel is through foreign businesses with mainland
funds, including those in Hong Kong, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Currently, the authorities in charge of foreign investment
affairs, the Investment Commission, holds no power to launch
investigations into tracing the source of foreign capital, the
legislator said.</P>

      <P>Fifty-three mainland Chinese dissidents
in Zhejian Province Saturday issued an open letter, calling for the
release of dissident Wang Youcai, through the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.</P>
      <P>Wang, who attempted to legally register a preparatory committee
for the formation of an opposition "Chinese Democratic Party" in
Hangzhou on June 25, was picked up by public security authorities on
July 10, and was formally arrested Saturday on charges of inciting
people to overthrow "the country's ruling power."</P>
      <P>In the open letter, the 53 dissidents said what Wang has done is
exercising his freedom of association guaranteed by the Constitution.
His advocacy of political reforms by peaceful, rational, and
nonviolent means does not constitute any crime, they said. Under
mainland Chinese law, inciting people to overthrow the government is
a serious crime. It is feared that Wang will be indicted.</P>
      <P>Wang, 32, was one of the 21 student leaders most wanted by police
for their part in the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy incident. He was
later sentenced to three years in prison. Hangzhou is the capital
city of Zhejiang Province in eastern mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, members of four dissident groups in Hong Kong Sunday
staged a demonstration at the Hong Kong branch office of Xinhua News

      <P>Washington and Manila will conduct six
small-scale joint military exercises similar to the recent live-fire
exercises in the South China Sea, Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado said Friday.</P>
      <P>The exercises, involving not more than 30 soldiers from both
sides, have taken place in international waters since Dec. 1997 due
to the lack of a bilateral agreement regarding joint military
training between the two countries.</P>
      <P>US Secretary of Defense William Cohen visited Manila Sunday to
begin two-day talks with Philippine officials regarding Washington's

      <P>The agreement was offered after the United States withdrew its
military bases from the Philippines. It allows free visits by US war
planes and ships to any air and sea port in the country in exchange
for military assistance and economic aid. It also obliges US troops
to conduct military exercises with their Phillipine counterparts.</P>
      <P>Mercado, who along with current President Joseph Estrada were

    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington State Governor Gary Locke on
Saturday praised Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui as an
outstanding leader with visionary plans for Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Locke, the United States' first ethnic Chinese state governor,
said under Lee's leadership, Taiwan has set itself as a model of
democracy, freedom and economic development for other Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>Locke, who recently returned from a weeklong visit to Taiwan,
said one of the most important things he accomplished during his trip
was meeting President Lee. Their meeting was extended from half an
hour to an hour amid an enthusiastic exchange of opinions, he noted.</P>
      <P>Stating that President Lee is a man of extensive knowledge and
has a good understanding of bilateral relations between Taiwan and
Washington State, Locke said he was very surprised when the president
said he has instructed relevant authorities to clamp down on the
import of fake Washington apples from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Washington governor made the remarks while attending the
opening ceremony of the 21st annual conference of the Formosan Club
across the United States held in Seattle.</P>
      <P>Although Locke was reluctant to make a comparison between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, he said his trip back to his hometown in
mainland China's Guangdong Province last year was like a "return to
the 18th century," as it has no tap water, telephones, nor
electricity.</P>
      <P>Republican Senator Slade Gorton from Washington State said in his
speech that supporting Taiwan has become a mainstream position in the
United States, pointing out that the US Senate passed a resolution to
support Taiwan in a vote of 92 to 0 shortly after US President Bill
Clinton concluded his trip to mainland China in early July.</P>
      <P>Taiwan "deserves and will receive" US support, Gorton said,
adding that there is still ample room for the two countries to
strengthen bilateral ties and expand two-way cooperation.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By J.J. Hwang &amp; Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A New York-based Chinese human rights
organization said Saturday the family of Liu Nienchun, a mainland
political dissident, will go to Beijing on Aug. 10 to protest against
his persecution.</P>
      <P>In a letter to Beijing authorities on Aug. 2, Liu's mother Wu
Huifen and his wife Tsu Hailan noted that Liu was sentenced to a
labor camp for three years for his political beliefs. The letter said
Liu was ill-treated while in prison and has suffered from various
illnesses including high blood pressure and a serious stomach
ailment.</P>
      <P>Prior to the visits of US Vice President Albert Gore and Speaker
of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich in 1997, and President
Bill Clinton's tour of mainland this year, Beijing authorities
assured Liu's family that he will receive medical care outside prison
on the condition that they do not meet with the visiting officials or
reporters.</P>
      <P>After complying with the authorities' demands, Liu has yet to
receive medical attention outside prison. His family has expressed
dissatisfaction over Beijing's false promises.</P>
      <P>There has been no improvement in Liu's medical care and
treatment, Wu and Tsu said. Therefore, the two have decided to appeal
directly to Beijing authorities. If they are not received by relevant
agency representatives, then they will protest in front of the
Beijing City Committee building.</P>
      <P>Liu, a noted mainland dissident, took part in the 1978 Democracy
Wall movement. He was one of the leaders of the Peace Charter
movement and Laborers' Rights Protection Union.</P>
      <P>The dissident has been arrested many times. He was secretly
detained for 17 months two times, and twice sentenced to serve in
labor camps for a total of six years. Due to prolonged maltreatment,
he reportedly suffered from several illnesses which have so altered
his appearance that his mother barely recognized him.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIAN OFFICIAL MEETS WITH CHINESE PROTESTERS IN CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  8 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 500 Chinese Canadians staged an angry
but peaceful rally Saturday in front of the Indonesian embassy in
Ottawa to protest crimes of violence committed against Chinese
Indonesians.</P>
      <P>In an unexpected move, an embassy official met with two of the
group's leaders and received a letter of protest. Achsan Djunaedi,
assistant to the head of the embassy's political section, also
expressed Jakarta's "deep regret" over the incidents.</P>
      <P>The meeting was an improvement from the embassy's previous
reaction to a protest against Jakarta's occupation of East Timor, a
policeman guarding the Indonesian embassy said.</P>
      <P>At the head of the protesters, the Federation of Ottawa-Carleton
Chinese Organization collected several thousand signatures in a
petition and will deliver it to Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien next week in Parliament.</P>
      <P>The petition decries the treatment of Chinese Indonesians during
the May riots which subsequently toppled then President Suharto and
seeks Canada's condemnation of the violation of human rights. It also
urges Jakarta to thoroughly investigate the cases and punish those
found guilty.</P>
      <P>Gangs of rioters have been accused of targeting ethnic Chinese by
looting and burning their property and assaulting and raping Chinese
Indonesian women.</P>
      <P>The federation strongly condemned Jakarta for having failed to
prevent the racial violence and crimes, demanding that it "severely
punish all those" who participated in the horrendous acts.</P>
      <P>They also demanded that Indonesia adopt immediate and effective
measures to protect Chinese Indonesians' rights and compensate all
victims of violence. They then urged Indonesia to pass legislation to
prevent the recurrence of similar violence in the future.</P>
      <P>In response, Achsan said the Indonesian government has no
intention of covering up the cases, but he noted Jakarta is
experiencing difficulty in punishing those criminals because few
victims were willing to come forward and testify in court. The
Indonesian official asked the federation for help in providing
evidence that will lead to the conviction of criminals.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 21st annual conference of the
Taiwanese Friendship Association in the United States opened here
Saturday with leaders of Taiwanese American communities in the US
participating.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, the participants pledged their strong support for
the government of the Republic of China on Taiwan in its endeavor to
pursue national unification under the principles of freedom,
democracy, and equitable distribution of wealth for all Chinese.</P>
      <P>They also pledged to help improve the relationship between
Taiwan and the US, and to help promote economic and social
development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his congratulatory message to the conference, President Bill
Clinton praised Taiwanese Americans for their contribution to the
peace and prosperity enjoyed by people in the US.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan, and Premier
Vincent Siew also sent congratulatory messages to the meeting.</P>
      <P>In the conference, Governor Gary Locke of Washington State
praised President Lee for his far-sightedness and able leadership.
Locke visited Taipei July 26-30 for trade promotion. Some other US
leaders also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Addressing the conference, Minister Chiao Jen-ho of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission of the Executive Yuan praised members of
the association for their strong support for the government of the
Republic of China. He also briefed the participants in the meeting on
the current situations in Taiwan and the current relations between
Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>When turning to the problem concerning the rape of many ethnic
Chinese women in recent Indonesian riots, Chiao said it is the
government policy of the Republic of China on Taiwan to protect the
interests of all overseas Chinese in the world. He added that the
time is not ripe for the governments in Taipei and Beijing to
cooperate in dealing with the problem in Indonesia at the present
time, because cross-strait relations still stay in the stage of
civilian exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SURVEY ON SINGLE-PARENT FAMILIES RELEASED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There were a total of 176,000 single-parent
families in Taiwan, a recent survey released on Sunday by the
Ministry of the Interior showed.</P>
      <P>There were more divorced, single-parent families in urban areas
than rural areas, accounting for 64 percent of the total, the survey
found.</P>
      <P>Most of the single-parent families in rural areas were the result
of the death of one parent, with 43 percent belonging to this
category.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, each single-parent family has an average
monthly income of NT$23,350 (about US$660), as 36 percent of the
overall single-parent families islandwide earn between NT$20,000 and
NT$30,000 a month.</P>
      <P>Some 28 percent of Taiwan's single-parent families earn between
NT$10,000 and NT$20,000 each month, while 17 percent earn between
NT$30,000 and NT$40,000. About 10 percent earn less NT$10,000, while
6.3 percent and 3.5 percent enjoy a relatively high monthly income of
between NT$40,000-NT$50,000, or over NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>The survey found that each single-parent family spends an average
of NT$7,446, nearly one third of its monthly income, on education
fees or nursery care every month, an indication that Taiwan's
single-parent families may have difficulty meeting economic
requirements for child care and career development.</P>
      <P>Judging from social welfare indexes, single-parent families also
require more medical care and higher insurance, increased
subsidiaries for accidents, daily expenses, housing loans, and higher
priority in the application for public housing.</P>
      <P>As to those single-parent families without stable incomes, most
of them live on government subsidiaries and charity. Some also live
on assistance from relatives or earn compensation money or pensions.</P>
      <P>The survey also indicated that single-mother families have
greater economic difficulties than single-father families as many
such mothers are unemployed.</P>
      <P>Figures showed that most of both the single mothers and fathers
are employees in the manufacturing sector or white-collar workers,
while many of them are also salesmen and vendors, as well as farmers
or fishermen.</P>

      <P>A majority of people surveyed are
opposed to making a large increase in the quota for mainland
Chinese spouses allowed to live in Taiwan, the results of an opinion
poll released Sunday found.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Public Administration Society of the

a large-scale increase in the quota for mainland spouses permitted to
reside in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At present, the government allows about 1,800 mainland spouses

    <HEADLINE>DISNEY HITS MAINLAND'S BRICK WALL OF RED TAPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  Aug.  8, (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Walt Disney's latest animated film,
Mulan, has hit a wall of red tape in mainland China, the Los Angeles
Times reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The film is based on a Chinese legend about a girl who marches
off to war in her father's place. It has been earning relatively
healthy revenue in North America, but it has yet to play in the
country which it was intended.</P>
      <P>The article said it is uncertain if or when the film will play in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mulan's case illustrates the unpredictable and often frustrating
workings of the mainland's entertainment industry, a minefield for
enthusiastic but unwary foreigners and an uneasy intersection of
politics and culture in the world's most populous nation, the article
said.</P>
      <P>Few observers doubt that the waiting game for Disney, which is on
a rocky footing with the Beijing regime, turns as much on delicate
questions of policy and politics as on aesthetic merit.</P>
      <P>Complications include everything from the low limit slapped on
the number of international films allowed in theaters, to the prickly
reaction to Tibet, a sensitive issue that triggered a cat-and-mouse
game between Beijing and Disney over a year ago.</P>
      <P>Only about a dozen foreign movies are permitted to show films in
mainland theaters annually on a profit-sharing basis between Beijing
and the original distributors, a quota that chafes studio executives.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of Taiwan residents believe
dialogue between Taiwan and mainland China is conducive to better
relations, but many do not think the long-stalled talks will resume
any time soon, results of a recent poll showed.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by Sigma Poll, found that 63 percent of
those interviewed were in favor of an early resumption of the
Koo-Wang talks. Koo-Wang refers to a previous meeting between Koo
Chen-fu, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation and Wang
Daohan, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang, authorized by their respective governments, met for
the first time in Singapore in 1993. During the landmark meeting, the
two sides loosely agreed on a framework for regular dialogue in the
future.</P>
      <P>Beijing slammed the negotiation door shut on Taiwan after
President Lee Teng-hui made a personal visit to the United States in
1995, which Beijing saw as a move promoting Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The poll, carried out between Aug. 3 and 5 at the request of New
Party legislative candidate Lee Ping, found that 50 percent of Taiwan
residents polled do not believe the Koo-Wang talks will resume this
year because "Beijing has shown no sincerity toward such an
initiative."</P>
      <P>About 40 percent were in favor of Taiwan independence while
another 40 percent were opposed to it. Also, 57 percent believed
Beijing would launch a military attack against Taiwan if the island
were to declare independence. Forty-six percent believed the United
States may come to Taiwan's defense in the event of such an attack.</P>
      <P>A total of 56 percent of the respondents believed the political
status quo across the Taiwan Strait will remain unchanged in the next
five years, while 24 percent believed the status quo will remain
unchanged in the next 10 years. Only 7.6 percent said the status quo
will not change in 30 years.</P>
      <P>In addition, 39 percent said they supported President Lee's "no
haste, be patient" policy on Taiwan's business and trade activities
in mainland China. Another 33 percent said the policy will undermine
Taiwan businesses' development potential in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 55 percent favor a personal visit to mainland
China by President Lee, while 67 percent would welcome a visit by
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>As many as 70 percent of the respondents said they would be
gravely concerned if their relatives were to visit mainland China
either for business or pleasure.</P>
      <P>The New Party's Lee, a Taiwan-born ROC citizen who studied
business management in the United States and has been doing business
in Shanghai for over 10 years, ordered the poll to gain insight to
Taiwan public's opinion on cross-strait relations. He is seeking a
seat in the legislature in the year-end elections and said he will
represent the interests of Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>During the three-day poll of Taiwan adults islandwide, Sigma
obtained 1,081 valid responses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME NOT YET 'RIPE' FOR CROSS-STRAIT COOPERATION IN RAPE CASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The time is not yet "ripe" for cooperation
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to deal with the atrocities
committed against ethnic Chinese women by Indonesian rioters earlier
this year, a Taiwan official said.</P>
      <P>Chiao Jen-ho, visiting ROC minister of the Cabinet-level Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission, made the remarks Saturday in response to
questions of such possible cooperation.</P>
      <P>Ethnic Chinese Indonesians were targeted in the days of rioting,
looting, burning of property and sexual assaults which eventually
toppled the Suharto regime in May.</P>
      <P>Chiao said at present, cross-strait exchanges and cooperation
have been confined to the private level.</P>
      <P>He added that most of the ethnic Chinese living in Indonesia are
not willing to leave Indonesia, and that the ROC government should be
cautious in expressing its views on the issue as it may exacerbate
the situation for Chinese Indonesians.</P>
      <P>Media reports of the atrocities committed against Chinese
Indonesian women during the riots naturally caused widespread
indignation, Chiao said, but the commission has yet to receive a
direct appeal for help from the victims. The commission is
nevertheless trying to obtain more information about the crimes.</P>
      <P>He said the problem in Indonesia is complex as economic,
political, cultural, and religious factors are all involved. It would
be better that Amnesty International come forward to handle the
problem.</P>
      <P>Chiao, former secretary-general of Taipei's intermediary body
Straits Exchange Foundation, also said if private groups in the
mainland were to invite him for a visit, he would certainly accept
the invitation.</P>
      <P>He said if overseas groups and Chinese language schools from the
mainland were to need Chinese textbooks, the commission would be
willing to provide them. He added that the move would not affect the
commission's present budget or resources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) called a meeting on Monday of resident ambassadors from
countries that maintain formal diplomatic ties with the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the MOFA has held such a meeting
aimed at shoring up the ROC's relations with its diplomatic allies,
which now number 27.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who personally chaired the conference,
said the Foreign Ministry decided to hold this kind of meeting once a
year in the future to boost mutual understanding and friendship.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hu said, the three vice foreign ministers will also
hold biannual meetings with envoys from the ROC's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"In the past, we didn't maintain close contact with foreign
embassies. We must make an improvement and step up efforts to
strengthen engagement and exchanges with them," Hu told local
reporters after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu said he has instructed department directors in charge of
relations with different continents to intensify contact with foreign
embassies here. Most of the ROC's diplomatic allies are located in
Latin America and Africa.</P>
      <P>During Monday's meeting, Hu said he exchanged views with foreign
ambassadors on a broad range of issues, including the substance of
the June 27 summit meeting between US President Bill Clinton and
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the latest situation in
Taiwan and abroad, the Asian financial crisis and other matters of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Noting that the meeting was helpful to boost exchanges between
the MOFA and foreign embassies here, Hu said he takes pleasure in
briefing foreign envoys on major ROC policies that interest them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said the MOFA has consistently attached great
importance to the security of foreign institutions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have tightened security measures at foreign embassies,
consulates and representative offices here in the wake of bomb
attacks at US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The minister went on to say that a 16-story building in Taipei's
Tienmu district is scheduled for completion at the end of the year to
accommodate foreign embassies and consulates in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The new building, constructed by the MOFA, will make a
concentration of security forces easier, Hu said.</P>
      <P>At present, security at foreign embassies and consulates is
handled by a task force under the National Police Administration. Due
to the wide distribution of these institutions, district police
forces are also in charge of protecting foreign officials in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said the new building will enable the MOFA to offer better
protection and services to foreign diplomats stationed here. But Hu
added he could not yet confirm whether the staff of foreign embassies
and consulates will be able to move into the building by the end of
this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE-YEAR-OLD BOY TESTS POSITIVE FOR HIV</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A three-year-old boy was tested positive
for HIV after being given AIDS-tainted blood during an operation,
sources from the Department of Health reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Shocked by the tragic incident, Hsu Kuo-hsiung, director of the
DOH Bureau of Communicable Disease Control, said the department will
step up the investigation into the source of the blood and may resort
to publicizing the name of the donor.</P>
      <P>The child received three bags of red blood cell concentration and
seven units of platelet during a stomach operation in a southern
Taiwan hospital in March this year. Doctors at Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital in Linkou, northern Taiwan, recently examined and diagnosed
the boy.</P>
      <P>The boy checked into Chang Gung after sustaining blisters, milia
and crusts all over his body, unlike symptoms of chicken pox, a
common childhood disease.</P>
      <P>Chang Gung doctors conducted an HIV test on the child and found
that he tested positive for the virus that causes AIDS. They
concluded that the skin disorder was an indication of full-blown
AIDS, which he contracted through blood transfusions during his
operation.</P>
      <P>The DOH is considering publicizing the name of the donor to
prevent other people with AIDS from donating blood who were either
intentionally trying to spread the disease or due to ignorance. Hsu
said the department will first consult with relevant specialists
about the handling of the situation.</P>
      <P>He said the DOH will fully discuss the possible outcome of the
name-publication initiative, including whether it will affect blood
donors' willingness, its legality, and the donors' privacy rights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thailand's plans to build a nuclear reactor
will be delayed after the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace failed
twice to produce a safety analysis report in the past year.</P>
      <P>OAEP Secretary General Kriengsak Bhadarakom said the agency was

US-based General Atomics, as the OAEP failed again to produce a
safety analysis report for consideration by the nuclear facility
safety subcommittee last week.</P>
      <P>GA submitted the first report to OAEP last December but it needed
to be revised several times, Kriengsak revealed.</P>
      <P>The contract, signed by OAEP and GA on June 26 last year,
requires the contractor to complete the report within 48 months.</P>
      <P>The subcommittee insisted that the analysis be reviewed by the

Regulatory Commission has declined to do so because the reactor is

(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing called for a slowdown in the
sell-off of small state-owned enterprises, underlining its concern
that their sale would increase unemployment and undermine social
stability.</P>
      <P>The call suggests that Beijing's commitment to state sector
reform is weakening in the face of slowing economic growth and rising
redundancies, according to a report in the Financial Times.</P>
      <P>"The spree of selling enterprises is spreading, which disrupts
the ongoing work of re-employing laid-off state firm workers. This
has triggered serious social problems in some areas," the newspaper
quoted the People's Daily as saying.</P>
      <P>Regional governments must take urgent measures to arrest the
trend, it added.</P>
      <P>"Small state firms employ a large number of people and they play
an indispensable role in easing unemployment pressure and maintaining
social stability," the report said.</P>
      <P>The transfer of small state enterprises into private hands was
one of the central elements of President Jiang Zemin's address at the
Communist Party Congress in September, which was intended to set the
country's strategic course for the next five years.</P>
      <P>According to official figures, mainland China's state enterprises
are due to lay off 3.5 million workers this year alone. There are
currently 11.5 million people officially registered as unemployed,
but economists privately suggest the true number is much higher.</P>

      <P>Singaporeans have to brace themselves
for slower growth given the region's economic downturn, Singapore
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Little can be done to boost the economy to the 7.8 percent level
of growth the city state enjoyed last year, he told reporters at a
National Day ceremony.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government had introduced a S$2 billion (US$1.1

Lee said introducing such measures was not something done casually.</P>
      <P>"We have to accept that this will be a slow year, less growth,
smaller bonuses, maybe pay cuts, some retrenchments," he said. "But
we are not going to starve. We have been through worse before. So I
think we can manage it."</P>
      <P>The official growth forecast of between 0.5 percent and 1.5
percent for this year was realistic, he added.</P>
      <P>He also urged Singaporeans to stay calm, steady and resolute in

      <P>Indonesia is unsafe for the thousands of

      <P>In an interview with The Australian, the Jakarta-based Indonesian

claim that 168 rapes occurred during the riots mainly against Chinese

    <TEXT>
      <P>The anti-impotency drug Viagra may not hit
local pharmacies in September as previously expected, a senior
official with the Cabinet-level Department of Health said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu Yo-fu, director of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs
said US-based Pfizer Co., Viagra's manufacturer, filed an application
with the department on June 18 to market the new drug in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We began to screen the application in early July. We have asked
the applicant to furnish us with some additional documents to
facilitate our examination of the drug's effectiveness and safety,"
Hu said.</P>
      <P>The additional documents required by the DOH include research
reports on 39 foreign nationals suspected to have died from the use
of Viagra.</P>
      <P>"We need to know the causes of those deaths and their medical
history to ascertain the safety of the drug," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>The maker is also required to present reports on clinical tests
at several local hospitals. "It is a required procedure for the
marketing of new drugs on the island," Hu explained, adding that
clinical test reports are needed to determine local patients'
reaction to the drug and the dosage most suitable for Taiwan users.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hu said, Pfizer must produce documents proving the drug
has been permitted to be marketed in Australia since it plans to
import Viagra manufactured there to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said even though Viagra has been legally marketed in the
United States, the DOH will still strictly follow normal
domestic legal proceudres in screening the Pfizer application.</P>
      <P>"The legal marketing of Viagra hinges on when the applicant can
submit all these required documents," Hu stressed.</P>
      <P>As Canberra has not yet issued the green light for marketing the
drug in Australia, Taiwan nationals may have a long wait before
Viagra is legally available here.</P>
      <P>According to previous news reports, over 200 volunteers have
undergone clinical tests involving Viagra at the National Taiwan
University Hospital, Veterans General Hospital and four other major
hospitals in line with application requirements.</P>
      <P>Black market prices reportedly have soared up to NT$2,500

      <P>Australia is seen struggling amid an
Asia-induced recession as its major Asian trading partners experience
slow economic growth, according to Access Economics in Melbourne.</P>
      <P>In its latest five-year business outlook, AE warned that economic
growth within Australia's major trading partners will be far slower
than the estimate by the Australian government when it presented its
annual budget in May this year.</P>
      <P>The problems in Asia are turning 1999 into a year of risks, the
report said, adding that "Asia is a huge problem for Australia and a
recession is far from an impossibility."</P>
      <P>AE forecasted gross domestic product growth among Australia's
major trading partners at just 0.4 percent in 1998-99, compared to
the government's forecast of 1.75 percent.</P>
      <P>The report also warned that a second wave of financial turmoil
could still engulf Asia as South Korea is being pressured by a weak
yen, increased corporate failures and labor unrest.</P>
      <P>It added that the US economy may run out of steam just as Asian
economies come back on line, causing more problems for Australia.</P>
      <P>The AE predicted that Australia's gross domestic product may only

      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. said Monday it
will likely announce a further cut of petroleum prices Tuesday, and
the level of cuts could be within 3 percent.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said with the continued slump of international
petroleum prices, the purchase cost for the CPC has set lows not seen
since 1989.</P>
      <P>The CPC imported over 18.72 million barrels of crude in July at a
cost of US$217 million, averaging US$11.62 a barrel. Costs in June
were US$242 million at an average cost of US$12.6 per barrel.</P>
      <P>The officials said CPC revenues in July reached NT$33.88 billion
(US$97.36 million), with a pre-tax surplus of NT$4.1 billion, or
NT$1.87 billion over the targeted surplus.</P>
      <P>They said although the Taiwan dollar has depreciated in the past
months, the CPC has met the targeted surplus and it is not ruling out
a further crude cut this month with the continued slump of

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dragged down by the Asian financial turmoil
and natural disasters, mainland China's economic growth continued its
downward spiral and did not make an upward swing as expected.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's gross domestic product rose 7 percent in the
first half of 1998, below the 8 percent target Beijing set for the
whole year.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the year, the falling trend of the
mainland's economic growth has not ended. It fell to a new low of 6.8
percent in the second quarter of 1998 after registering 7.2 percent
in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Facing a downward spiral in economic growth, Beijing confessed in
an article in the Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Bao daily that the figures
have taken many Beijing authorities by surprise.</P>
      <P>Beijing economic experts predicted at the beginning of this year
that the slipping economy would bottom out in the first quarter of
1998. In addition, Qiu Xiaohua, chief economist of the State

the first quarter that the mainland's half-year economic growth would
surely surpass the figure registered in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>The poor performance of mainland China's economy, said Qiu, was
due to two unexpected factors, one of which was the lingering effects
of increasingly devalued Asian currencies, and the El Nina weather
phenomenon which caused serious flooding along the Yangtze River.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration on
Monday ordered all Dornier-228 aircraft in service in Taiwan be
temporarily grounded for an across-the-board examination.</P>
      <P>The CAA issued the directive after a UNI Airlines Dornier-228 ran
off the runway Sunday as it was making a landing at Peikan Airport on
the offshore Matsu island group.</P>
      <P>It was the second mishap involving this model of aircraft in
Taiwan so far this month. On Aug. 5, a Formosa Airlines Dornier-228
also veered off the runway when it landed at Makung Airport on the
offshore Penghu archipelago. No injuries or casualties were reported
in either accident.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that both incidents were caused by
failure in the aircraft's brake systems.</P>
      <P>In August 1997, a Formosa Airlines Dornier-228 crashed in Matsu,
killing all 16 crew members and passengers aboard.</P>
      <P>"In view of the comparatively high frequency of accidents
involving the German-made 19-seat aircraft, we have decided to ground
all Dornier-228s for thorough examinations and maintenance," CAA
Deputy Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Among domestic airlines, only Formosa Airlines and UNI Airlines
have Dornier-228 aircraft. Each carrier has three Dornier-228s for
flight services between Taiwan and its offshore islands.</P>
      <P>The CAA's order has forced the two carriers to suspend a total of
53 Taipei-Matsu, Taitung-Green Island, Taitung-Orchid Island,
Kaohsiung-Taitung, and Chimei-Makung daily flights.</P>
      <P>It will take at least two days to complete examinations and
maintenance, airline sources said.</P>
      <P>In the interim, passengers between Taipei and Matsu must rely on
chopper services offered by Daily Air Corp., while travelers between
Taitung and Orchid Island must resort to Asia Pacific Airlines'
chopper services.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CAA has demanded UNI Airlines to reduce the number
of its daily flights because of the frequency of flight accidents. In
July alone, 14 mishaps involving the carrier were reported. Nearly
all mishaps involved the carrier's BAE-146 aircraft.</P>
      <P>CAA Deputy Director-General Chang attributed the frequency of
flight mishaps mainly to the carrier's merge with Great China
Airlines and Taiwan Airlines on July 1, which resulted in a
serious shortage of maintenance manpower.</P>
      <P>"To ensure flight safety and protect personal safety of
passengers, we must demand UNI Airlines to trim the number of its
daily flights," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said the CAA is still discussing with the carrier the
exact number of flights to be cut. "We'll make a formal announcement

    <TEXT>
      <P>A planned visit to mainland China by
Taiwan's chief negotiator with Beijing this fall will be realized
smoothly despite the recent twists and turns in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, a Kuomintang official predicted on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director-general of the KMT's Department of
Mainland Research, said he is cautiously optimistic about relations
across the Taiwan Strait in the coming months despite the kidnap and
murder in northeastern mainland China of Kaohsiung City Councilor Lin
Ti-chuan in late July and the recent verbal sparring between the
intermediary bodies on either side of the strait.</P>
      <P>Chang returned to Taipei on Sunday after traveling to Beijing and
Shanghai to take part in seminars on cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Chang met with Chen Yunlin, director of the
Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council, who also serves
as director of the Office for Taiwan Affairs under the Chinese
Communist Party. He also met with mainland China's top negotiator
with Taiwan, Chairman Wang Daohan of the Association for Relations
across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Although he exchanged views on cross-strait ties with Chen and
Wang, as well as issues surrounding the planned mainland visit by Koo
Chen-fu, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
Chang described the meetings as courtesy calls rather than
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issues arising from the Lin murder, Chang said he
told the mainland Chinese authorities that Taiwan's populace is
well-informed as a result of the island's efficient mass media. This
led to widespread anger in Taiwan when the mainland authorities
failed to abide by requests from Lin's family regarding the treatment
of her body, and when they barred SEF personnel from helping to deal
with the situation.</P>
      <P>He said although the mainland authorities told him that Koo is
welcome to visit this fall, he suggested that a meeting between SEF
Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow and his ARATS
counterpart, Tang Shubei, be arranged prior to Koo's arrival, in
order to discuss procedural details of the visit.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of formal ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NINETY-ONE DISSIDENTS PROTEST WANG YOUCAI'S ARREST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ninety-one dissidents from 21 mainland
Chinese cities and provinces have jointly issued an open letter,
calling for the release of Wang Youcai, who have been arrested for
attempting to establish an opposition party in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wang, who applied with the government for establishing a
preparatory committee for the formation of an opposition "Chinese
Democratic Party" in Hangzhou, the capital city of Zejiang Province
in eastern mainland China, on June 25, was taken away from his home
by police on July 10, and was formally arrested Saturday on charges
of inciting people to overthrow "the country's ruling power."</P>
      <P>The New York-based Human Rights in China (HRIC) said Monday
that, in the letter the 91 dissidents also called for the release of
Zhang Shanguang, who was arrested for attempting to establish an
association for protecting the rights of laid-off workers in Hunan
Province.</P>
      <P>The open letter said that what Wang and Zhang have done are
conducive to political modernization in mainland China, and that
their behavior is consistent with mainland Chinese law and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Under mainland China law, inciting people to overthrow the
government is a serious crime. It is feared that Wang will be
indicted. Fifty-three dissidents in Zhejiang Province issued an open
letter Saturday, calling for Wang's release.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said Monday in a press
release that Xu Wenli of Beijing will go to Hangzhou with other
dissidents during Wang's trial. They may stage a demonstration in
that city during that time. They said they would be pleased to go to
jail for doing that.</P>
      <P>Wang, 32, was one of the student leaders most wanted by police
for their role in the 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy movement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOSPITAL OFFICIAL CALLS FOR MORE VOLUNTEERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Mackay Memorial Hospital
called on Monday for more people to participate in volunteer work at
the hospital.</P>
      <P>The official said that people aged between 18 and 65 with a good
command of Mandarin and Taiwanese are welcome to register as
volunteers if they can provide their services for at least three
hours each week. Volunteers must undertake a 12-hour training course
before taking up their duties, he said.</P>
      <P>The call coincided with the release of statistics showing that
nearly 87 percent of the volunteers at the hospital are female.</P>
      <P>The official said that Mackay has a total of 562 volunteers, 487
of whom are women and 75 of whom are men. Forty-four percent of the
volunteers described themselves as followers of Buddhism, while 22
percent said that they are Christians.</P>
      <P>Although the general belief is that volunteers are usually
middle-aged, elderly, or housewives, the statistics show that a
number of young people and career people also dedicate a portion of
their time to hospital volunteer work.</P>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of the volunteers at the hospital are aged
between 21 to 40, with those aged between 21 to 30 accounting for 17
percent of the total, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that 36 percent of the volunteers hold
full-time jobs, while only 39 percent are housewives.</P>

March 1996, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced on Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FM HU DENIES ADJUSTMENT OF FOREIGN POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu denied on Monday
that the government will adjust its foreign policy by stressing
"quality" instead of "quantity."</P>
      <P>Hu dismissed as "untrue" the press reports that the Republic of
China will no longer focus on forging ties with small-sized
countries and will devote more energy to upgrading substantive
relations with influential or powerful countries.</P>
      <P>"The reports don't fit the facts," Hu stressed, adding that the
ROC has consistently intended to make friends with as many countries
as possible.</P>
      <P>Hu went on to say that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
attached equal importance to quality and quantity in expanding its
external ties and diplomatic frontiers. "What we care most in seeking
foreign friends is sincerity."</P>
      <P>In the face of Beijing's constant attempts to isolate Taiwan in
the international community, Hu said, the ROC must try its utmost to
make friends with as many countries as possible, no matter how large
or how small those countries may be. "This is our country's demand
and the MOFA's policy."</P>
      <P>Hu, also a National Assembly deputy, said he has been carrying
out his diplomatic duties using the fundamental guideline of
political campaign -- "Shaking hands with every hand you can shake
and knocking on every door you can knock."</P>
      <P>"With this in mind, we are unlikely to adopt a discriminatory
attitude in forging ties with countries around the world," Hu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said the MOFA has spared no efforts to
contain the possible adverse effect of the so-called "three noes"
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" refer to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations in which
statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-proposed "three noes" came into the limelight after
US President Bill Clinton mentioned them at a roundtable meeting in
Shanghai during his June 25-July 3 state visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Beijing reportedly is pushing Tokyo to throw its support for the
"three noes" during mainland President Jiang Zemin's state visit to
Japan in September.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, Hu said he hopes all of the
ROC's diplomatic allies and countries in the Asia-Pacific region
will understand that if they indiscriminatingly yield to Beijing's
unreasonable demands, they will incessantly be required to make
concessions to Beijing.</P>
      <P>"We are also hopeful that Beijing will understand that if it
continues taking advantage of its engagement with other
countries to hurt Taiwan's position, relations across the
Taiwan Strait cannot make headway and unification of the two sides
will only be hindered," Hu stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MULTI-PURPOSE SMART CARDS TO BE ISSUED IN 2001</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A multi-purpose electronic "smart card" is
expected to be ready for issue in 2001 at the earliest, the Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The smart card project, which will combine the present ID card
with the national insurance card, and various other electronic cards,
is currently in the planning stages by the RDEC and will be pushed by
the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</P>
      <P>BNHI officials said the new card will help reduce abuse of the
country's medical resources.</P>
      <P>They said that the issuance of the smart card will cut
bureaucracy, help the bureau trace those who fail to pay their
insurance premiums, and help in the computerization of the island's
medical institutions.</P>
      <P>The card will also prevent tampering by the public or by the
hospitals, as cardholders will be unable to lend their cards to
others, which the officials say will greatly save valuable medical
resources.</P>
      <P>The right to issue the card was awarded to a 15-member consortium
headed by the China Rebar Group, which beat out bids by three
competing consortiums, RDEC Chairman Kirby Yang said.</P>
      <P>The four consortiums presented their proposals on June 30, and a
screening committee comprised of seven scholars and four government
officials conducted the screening on Sunday, announcing the result
the following day.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the winning consortium, named the Republic of
China Card Management Team, will begin discussions with the
government on a formal contract to issue the smart card within three
months. After the signing of the contract, the consortium is expected
to take 30 months to prepare for the issuance of the card, giving a
projected launch date of 2001 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>If the contract falls through, the committee will start the
screening process from scratch.</P>
      <P>Yang stressed that the screening operation focused on overall
planning, professional management capacity, and financial planning,
adding that the winning consortium stood out in all three key areas.</P>
      <P>He said the card is expected to simplify paperwork in the
government and private sectors, which will help boost the efficiency
of an "electronic government."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY PLEDGES TO ELIMINATE ELECTION BRIBERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party will offer a
reward of NT$1 million (US$28,800) to anyone who informs on bribery
in the party primary elections for legislative candidates, Jaw
Shau-kong, a high-ranking party official, said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The supervisor for the party's campaign affairs stressed during a
press conference that his party will at the same time impose harsh
punishment on bribery and vote-buying culprits, including
denunciation and expulsion from the party.</P>
      <P>However, although there have already been reports of dirty deeds
in the primaries since they started on Aug. 1, the party will never
give up its campaign, described by Jaw as an exercise democracy.</P>
      <P>The island's second-largest opposition party has so far held four
primaries for candidates for the legislature and for the city
councils of Taipei and Kaohsiung cities in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Vote-buying has been rampant during all the primary elections,
with the two most recent cases coming to light on Sunday in Taichung
and Taoyuan counties, respectively, according to party officials.</P>
      <P>It has also been reported that several candidates are planning to
hire public relations companies to increase their voter base and
provide additional vote-buying channels, as voting in the New Party
primaries is not restricted only to party members but is open to all
voters, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The press conference followed a meeting of New Party leaders to
discuss election irregularities. Those taking part included: Jaw;
Chou Yang-shan, convener of the National Campaign and Development
Committee; Lee Sheng-feng, who is in charge of primary elections
planning affairs; Legislator Hau Long-ping; and Chen Kuei-miao,
convener of a task force supervising the party's election affairs in
Taiwan's northern area.</P>
      <P>In order to reinforce their determination to eliminate election
bribery, the party has contracted three credit information firms to
investigate and collect evidence to support the findings of the
seven-member task force.</P>
      <P>Jaw stressed that if the party cannot elect candidates of good
character who can speak for the Taiwan people and who can maintain
the New Party's "clean image" in the Legislative Yuan, they will
consider scrapping the primaries and adopting a "flexible nomination"
whereby candidates will be selected by the party leadership.</P>
      <P>The New Party was founded in August 1993 by a group of
disgruntled Kuomintang members who broke away from the ruling party
in protest against its "undemocratic practices."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SHOULD ENJOY SOVEREIGN RIGHTS IN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew stressed on Monday
that the Republic of China is a sovereign country which should have
the right to take its place as a full member of the international
community.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks while receiving a delegation of Japan's
Association for Japan-ROC Friendship headed by Kobayashi Tatsuya.</P>
      <P>Tatsuya and his group paid a courtesy call on the premier at the
Executive Yuan, accompanied by Lin Chin-ching, chairman of Taiwan's
Association of East Asian Relations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the "three noes" remarks made by US President Bill
Clinton in Shanghai, Siew pointed out that since the Republic of
China is a sovereign country, there is no need for it to declare
independence.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, the US refusal to support Taiwan
independence, and its refusal to support "two Chinas," or "one China,
one Taiwan," has no significant meaning for the ROC.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that until unification of both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the ROC and the Chinese mainland will remain separate
political entities on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>He added that in order to seek its own international space, the
ROC has the right to take part in international community affairs,
and is therefore firmly opposed to and will not accept the US refusal
to support Taiwan's membership in international organizations for
which statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>The premier thanked his guests for their long-term promotion of
ROC-Japanese exchanges in the fields of economy and culture, and for
helping overseas Chinese working and studying in Japan. He also
expressed his hope that the association, which has great influence at
the grassroots level in Japan, will continue to enhance the
substantive ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>On July 24, the association held its general meeting, when it
passed a resolution asking the Japanese government not to make
remarks similar to those made by Clinton, when mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin makes a state visit to Tokyo in September.</P>
      <P>The request, in the form of a petition, has been submitted to
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECT ARRESTED IN POLICE EXAM SCAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A computer expert at the Central Police
University was arrested on Monday for allegedly manipulating police
entrance exam results in exchange for big-figure bribes, police
officials said.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chen-yuan, former director of the university's Electronic
Computing Center, was apprehended at his girlfriend's house. Police
had been looking for Kuo following a report on Friday from university
President Hsieh Ruey-chi.</P>
      <P>During an initial police interrogation, Kuo denied all the
accusations against him.</P>
      <P>Kuo, 37, is believed to have altered the report cards of 43
participants in the entrance exam for the two-year course. Each of
the examinees reportedly paid between NT$1 million and NT$1.5 million
to several unidentified brokers, who investigators said might also be
police officers.</P>
      <P>The stringent exam, which is open only to incumbent police
officers and graduates of the junior police college, means that the
school has a very low admission rate. This year, for example, only
205 out of nearly 15,000 examinees advanced to the oral stage, which
was held earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Kuo had already been demoted and removed from his position as
head of the computing center before the exam was held on July 10-11,
although he was still on the university's staff. However, as the
designer of the university's computerized examination grading and
scoring system, he was invited to provide assistance in operating the
system, giving him the chance to alter the scores.</P>
      <P>Kuo might have got away with his crime, had it not been for
Hsieh's determination to eradicate irregularities in the exams. For
years rumors have been circulating of cheating in the Central Police
University entrance exams, but they had not been taken seriously
until Hsieh was appointed university president last July.</P>
      <P>After being tipped off that Kuo had manipulated several report
cards, Hsieh decided to mobilize 200 university faculty and students
to check the English exam answer cards for inconsistencies. The
week-long task revealed that 43 scores had been altered. Checks on
scores for other subjects confirmed the findings.</P>
      <P>Police have also questioned most of the 43 examinees, some of
whom have reportedly admitted paying bribes to Kuo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER INTERVIEWED BY FORBES (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's relative success amid the
region's financial turmoil can largely be attributed to its
democratic system and sound economic fundamentals, Republic of China
Premier Vincent Siew said in a recent Forbes magazine interview.</P>
      <P>Describing the island's economic performance as being the
"sturdiest" in the region, the article sought to determine what set
Taiwan apart from its regional neighbors.</P>
      <P>Touching on a variety of topics including the conditions for
Asian economic recovery, US President Bill Clinton's comments on the
"three noes" and mainland China's emerging role as a regional leader,
Siew gave an interview to Andrew Tanzer for an article in the Aug. 24
issue of Forbes.</P>
      <P>The premier identified Taiwan's democratic system, its tight
control over the banking system, and its resilient enterprises as key
to minimizing the damaging effects of the region's financial and
economic woes.</P>
      <P>"Democracy creates more transparency between government and the
business community. Democracy also helps the government to face the
crisis," Siew said, adding, "Taiwan's democratic system, legal
institutions and the free press all work to monitor relations between
government and business and reduce the likelihood that the government
will steer its banks to funnel capital to the consortiums it favors."</P>
      <P>The government has strict control over the banking system -- the
proportion of overdue loans made by banks is less than 4 percent,
Siew stated.</P>
      <P>Also, the fact that 98 percent of Taiwan's domestic industry is
composed of small- and medium-sized enterprises makes them more
resilient and flexible when responding to external elements.</P>
      <P>Siew said the quality of Taiwan's goods has continually risen,
with high-tech products emerging as the mainstream of Taiwan's
production and exports.</P>
      <P>He added that the financial structure for domestic enterprises
has remained good. The capital-to-assets ratio of Taiwan enterprises
is 53.9 percent -- much higher than the ratio in South Korea and
Japan -- so the debt ratio is lower.</P>
      <P>Other contributing factors were a lack of dependency on foreign
capital and the fact that the New Taiwan dollar was not overvalued.</P>
      <P>In response to the question of economic recovery, Siew listed
three necessary conditions which were political stability in
Indonesia, the restoration of Japan's consumer confidence and Beijing
maintaining its promise to not devalue the renminbi. If all these
conditions are met, recovery could take one or two years, he
predicted.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the lack of democracy was going to slow down
the mainland's growth, Siew said that if one looked at the history of
economic development in modern countries, one would see that after a
certain period of economic growth, people would want to see political
reform, so that the benefits of economic growth can be shared.</P>
      <P>"That's what we're seeing in Indonesia now. That happened in
Taiwan 10 years ago, but we had a quiet revolution," Siew said.</P>
      <P>The issue between Taiwan and the mainland is a conflict of
systems, the premier said in response to a question of reunification.</P>
      <P>"Only a good system that will bring the whole of China toward
modernization and provide for the welfare of the people can serve as
a foundation for unification," Siew said. "We have a very clear
objective: We will pursue peaceful unification on the principles of
democracy, freedom and equitable prosperity."</P>
      <P>The premier also spoke on US President Bill Clinton's comments on
the "three noes" -- no support for Taiwan independence, no support
for "two China" or "one Taiwan, one China" and no support for
Taiwan's membership in any organizations for which statehood is a
requirement -- when he visited the mainland recently.</P>
      <P>Siew said that the talks between Clinton and his mainland
counterpart Jiang Zemin have not directly resulted in any substantive
harm to Taiwan, and both President Clinton and US policy officials
have repeatedly stated that US policy toward the Republic of China
remains unchanged.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nevertheless, Siew said that President Clinton's statement has
caused a considerable degree of misunderstanding in the international
community and especially among nations friendly to the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>"Although Clinton's declaration had negative implications, the US
president also made numerous comments favorable to the ROC, including
twice calling on Beijing -- and only Beijing -- to resume bilateral
talks as soon as possible. This shows that the US understands
Taipei's sincerity in seeking to resume consultations with Beijing,"
Siew said.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Clinton on five occasions repeated that
the cross-strait questions should be resolved by peaceful means. At a
time when the mainland repeatedly refuses to renounce the use of
military force against Taiwan, these remarks were particularly
significant. Even more significant, Siew said, was Clinton's clear
rejection of Beijing's position on US arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to the possibility that China may emerge from the
regional financial crisis as the leader of Asia, Siew noted that one
of the greatest obstacles to the continued development of the
mainland economy was institutional.</P>
      <P>He said that most state-run enterprises in the mainland are
losing money and have been unable to repay bank loans. This
accumulated bad debt represents a crisis in the making. Unemployment
on the mainland has risen, social order has deteriorated, and
political and administration reforms have been implemented too
slowly. The economy still lags far behind such an economic powerhouse
as Japan.</P>
      <P>The interview titled "We had a quiet revolution," also featured a
photo of Siew showing him full of confidence with his trademark smile
and the ROC national flag in the background.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNET DEMAND TO INCREASE IN EUROPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Demand for Internet access is on the rise
throughout Europe as businesses increase use of the network and a
greater number of consumers move online.</P>
      <P>According Forrester's European research center, overall Internet
access spending in Europe will climb from US$2.5 billion in 1998 to
US$11.8 billion in 2001. Driven by the growth of Internet commerce in
Europe, business access and not consumer access will be the primary
source of revenue by 2001.</P>
      <P>As larger companies pull their partners online and fend off
incursions from global competitors, there will be a surge in demand
for new connections and more bandwidth, the center said.</P>
      <P>The demand from large- and medium-sized companies will generate
77 percent of business access expenditures in 2001. In contrast,
small businesses which account for more than 90 percent of
enterprises in the region will stick to simple dial-up accounts,
contributing a considerably smaller share to overall growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE'S ECONOMY SLOWS TO 1.6% IN 2ND QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's economy slowed further in
the second quarter of this year to 1.6 percent from the revised 6.1
percent in the first quarter, the Economic Development Board
announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The slowdown was attributed to the adverse developments in the
global electronics industry, which had an adverse effect on
Singapore's manufacturing industry and in turn, its service exports.</P>
      <P>Growth in all sectors moderated, the EDB said. Signaling
deteriorating growth momentum, the manufacturing sector turned in two
consecutive quarters of negative quarter-on-quarter growth while the
commerce sector registered a third consecutive quarter of
quarter-on-quarter decline.</P>
      <P>Manufacturing output shrank by 1.1 percent on a year-on-year
basis, down from 6.1 percent growth in the first quarter, the EDB
said. Nearly all segments shrank, or grew more slowly than in the
first quarter.</P>
      <P>Despite healthy US and European Union economies, a worsening
industry supply-and-demand imbalance, sharp price erosion and intense
competition combined to cut Singapore's electronics output by 7
percent.</P>
      <P>Stock market activity was healthy, but this largely reflected
selling pressures arising from a slew of unfavorable news including
uncertainty over the Japanese economic reform, the weakness of the
yen, Indonesia's May riots and weak corporate performance, the EDB
said.</P>
      <P>Singapore's trade performance weakened significantly as total
trade declined by 7.7 percent in the second quarter compared to
registering a 4.2 percent growth in the first quarter. Total exports
declined by 1.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The EDB predicted that Singapore's economic growth will weaken
further in the remainder of the year. The Singapore Ministry of
Trade and Industry is maintaining its economic growth forecast to
0.5 percent to 1.5 percent for 1998.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUNK FOOD, LARGE QUANTITIES OF MEAT SEEN CONTRIBUTING TO CANCER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The heavy consumption of meat and junk
food loaded with sulfur preservatives is turning people's digestive
systems into war zones between natural healthy microbes and bad bugs
which can cause colon cancer.</P>
      <P>Research by Dr. John Cummings of the Dunn Nutrition Unit in
Cambridge found that when daily meat consumption rises from 60 grams
to 600 grams, sulfides in the feces of patients increase tenfold, the
Sydney Morning Herald reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cummings said these toxic sulfides might promote cancerous
changes in gut cells by damaging their DNA. He plans to continue with
his research to determine how much sulfur people typically consume
and how much of this total is derived from meat and food additives.</P>
      <P>A leading Australian researcher at the Department of Surgery at
the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Adelaide in South Australia told the
daily that he had tried unsuccessfully to get funding for similar
research in Australia.</P>
      <P>However, Assistant Professor William Roediger said the latest
British research reinforced the health message that people should eat
much more fiber than meat and resist processed foods.</P>
      <P>He said sulfur has been used as a preservative for thousands of
years in beverages but modern people consume far more because it is
also used to preserve foods on store shelves.</P>
      <P>Roediger said he has found a link between sulfides and the
disease colitis. Meanwhile, Cummings said he believed sulfur bacteria
could be implicated in a range of bowel diseases.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are 51 confirmed imported cases of
dengue fever so far this year, over twice the number from the same
period last year, Department of Health officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Officials said the 51st patient was a 46-year-old woman who
became ill after traveling to Burma and was diagnosed as having
dengue fever on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of DOH's Bureau of Communicable
Disease Control, said compared to the 22 imported cases of dengue
fever last year, this year's number is obviously too high.</P>
      <P>Hsu also confirmed that the patients all contracted the disease
from Southeast Asia. Thailand topped the list with 15 cases, followed
by 10 cases contracted from the Philippines, and nine and seven cases
from Indonesia and Burma respectively.</P>
      <P>Among the 51 patients, 12 cases are reported in Taipei County,
eight cases from Kaohsiung City, and six cases each in Pingtung and
Taoyuan Counties. The remainder of the cases were scattered in other
regions around the island.</P>
      <P>DOH officials again urged the public to exercise great care when
traveling to Southeast Asia. They also advised travelers to upgrade
their accommodations to cleaner facilities to prevent the contraction
of diseases spread by infected mosquitoes.</P>

 As a remedy for its revenue loss in recent years, TransAsia has

to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the package, and the delays
in recent days have caused a large number of passengers to complain.</P>

beyond 15 minutes from the boarding time is considered a delay.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC ANNOUNCES ANOTHER OIL PRICES CUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.
announced yet another oil price cut on Tuesday to reflect its reduced
crude oil import costs.</P>
      <P>Starting Wednesday, domestic prices for a variety of petroleum
products will be lowered by an average of 1.53 percent, a CPC
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>This is the third time since July that the CPC has offered an
across-the-board price cut for its products amid a downward spiral in
international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>After the adjustment, the retail price for premium gasoline will
drop to NT$17.6 (US$0.51) per liter from the current NT$17.8, while
the price for fuel oil will be slashed by NT$82 per kiloliter.</P>
      <P>The price for 95-unleaded gasoline will decline to NT$17.4 from
NT$17.6 and 92-unleaded gasoline will be cut to NT$16.4 from NT$16.6.</P>
      <P>The price for high-grade diesel will fall to NT$12.5 from
NT$12.7, while normal-grade diesel will slide to NT$11.3 from
NT$11.5.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, prices for household-use and vehicle-use liquefied
petroleum gas will be cut by NT$0.19 and NT$0.1 per kilogram,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The CPC spokesman said the new prices were calculated based on
three criteria -- crude oil prices at NT$13.55 per barrel, the
currency exchange rate at NT$34.52 against the US dollar, and the
annual profit target at NT$22.2 billion.</P>
      <P>With weak crude oil prices in the international market, CPC's
crude import costs dropped to an average of US$11.62 a barrel in
July, the lowest level in more than a decade. As a result, the state
monopoly registered a pre-tax profit of NT$4.1 billion for the month,
or NT$1.87 billion over the targeted surplus.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the CPC decided to further lower prices
for its products starting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The company first offered a 1.57 percent cut in prices for its
products on July 1, and again trimmed its prices by an average of
1.28 percent on July 22.</P>
      <P>The CPC has conducted a weekly review of domestic petroleum
prices since March, enabling the company to adjust its prices in
tandem with international crude oil prices and the local currency's
exchange rate against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Economic observers said the CPC's oil price cuts will help
maintain domestic price stability. Nevertheless, another state
monopoly, Taiwan Power Co. said it will not lower its electricity
rates because the latest CPC price cut will have only a limited
effect on its power generation costs.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung-based An Feng Steel Corp.
has temporarily put its US$1.1 billion steel construction project
plans for Australia on hold due to the Asian crisis and falling steel
prices.</P>
      <P>The planned joint venture between An Feng and Kingstream
Resources in Perth was put on hold after funding for the operation
was suspended, Kingstream Vice Chairman Ken Court said Monday.</P>
      <P>Kingstream's Taiwan steel subsidiaries have had to pursue debt
restructuring options with the China Development Corporation in
Taipei with a view to eliminating debts approaching US$560 million.</P>
      <P>"We really are in the hands now of China Development Corp. And
while the Taiwanese seem to prefer short-term debt contracts, we'd
like to see them extended over a much longer term," Court said.</P>
      <P>He said a fall in demand for steel products and a slump in world
steel prices have severely affected the financial position of the
company's Taiwanese steel operations.</P>
      <P>The steel company is now negotiating the terms of an engineering,
procurement, construction and management contract with Japan's Mitsui
and Co., Ltd. in which Mitsui will arrange US$675 million in
financing for the joint venture project, which is expected to produce
2.6 million metric tonnes of steel a year after construction is
completed in the next two years.</P>
      <P>Court said stage one of the project, including some leveling for
the steel plant, had been completed at a cost of around US$2.7
million, but stage two would not begin until a debt restructuring of
the Taiwanese entities had been completed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHY MAINLAND CHINA DOESN'T DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is being praised for not
devaluing its currency despite suffering from fewer exports and a
lower economic growth rate than forecasted, the Australian Financial
Review said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, the daily's correspondent Rowan
Callick said mainland China has received kudos for keeping the
renminbi at a rate of about 8.3 to the greenback. The exchange rate
in the black market however is over 9 renminbi to the dollar.</P>
      <P>Callick said mainland China is beginning to emerge as the United
States' favored ally in Asia, supplanting Japan and disorienting
Taiwan, since US President Bill Clinton's visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>With the relative strength in the renminbi, Western leaders and
investors are overlooking growing problems elsewhere in the
mainland's economy, Callick noted, saying that it is being compared
favorably to Japan which has been unable to take a lead in solving
its economic problems.</P>
      <P>Beijing recognizes that devaluing its currency to an excess of 20
percent may contribute to a downside which could translate into a
massive loss in mainland China's domestic confidence. It could also
send the stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen plummeting,
reducing the prospects of raising capital to reform the state sector,
Callick wrote.</P>
      <P>Mainland authorities have already acted to boost exports in a
more targeted way than devaluing the currency. Premier Zhu Rongji has
also been forced to extend the deadlines for reform in state-run
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Neither mainland China nor Hong Kong are being driven to devalue
their currencies by a lack of funds. The mainland holds US$141
billion and Hong Kong US$97 billion in foreign exchange reserves.
Since the renminbi is not convertible on the capital account, the
mainland Chinese government and not the market holds the upper hand,
leading analysts to believe the currency will not be devalued at
least until the end of this year, the daily reported.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's top negotiator with Beijing on
Tuesday called for a meeting among Asian leaders including both sides
of the Taiwan Strait to discuss the region's financial problems if
the Japanese yen continues its plunge.</P>
      <P>"A game of devaluation" may take place across Asia if the
Japanese currency slides further, said Koo Chen-fu, Senior Advisor to
the President and chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>He added that Taipei could do something to interfere in its
foreign exchanges although only on a limited scale.</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks to the media after attending a meeting at
the invitation of the Ministry of Economic Affairs on Taiwan's trade
deficit with Japan.</P>
      <P>The burden of economic reform in Japan has resulted in much
pressure on the depreciation of the yen, Koo stated. He went on to
say that given a continued sagging yen, an adverse effect on Asia as
a whole can occur which may lead to "a game of devaluation" in the
region or even a new wave of monetary turmoil.</P>
      <P>It is hard to predict when the yen will stop sliding, Koo said,
but the New Taiwan dollar is truly over-devalued.</P>
      <P>Responding to the question of what was a reasonable value for
Taiwan's currency, Koo said it was difficult to determine as the
foreign exchange rate is a "relative issue" and no financial minister
of any country would dare assert a reasonable value for a currency.</P>
      <P>Regarding what measures Taipei should take, Koo said the
government should take some action, although interference should be
limited. This was because a high New Taiwan dollar would not do us
much good, Koo observed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of mainland Chinese
dissidents calling for the release of dissident Wang Youcai have
increased from 53 on Saturday to 91 on Sunday and 136 on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang was formally arrested Saturday by the Public Security Bureau
in Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province , after he applied
with the provincial government on June 25 for establishing a
preparatory committee for the formation of an opposition "Chinese
Democratic Party." He was taken away from his home by police on July
10, and then formally arrested on charges of inciting people "to
overthrow the country's ruling power."</P>
      <P>The 136 dissidents jointly sent a letter to mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji Monday through
the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China, asking for immediate release of Wang from jail. It
is feared that Wang will be indicted.</P>
      <P>In the letter the 136 dissidents expressed anger at Wang's
arrest. They said that Wang was merely exercising a citizen's basic
rights enshrined in the Constitution when he applied for
permission to set up the preparatory committee, and that his arrest
has given rise to the grave concern of many people in the world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 40 dissidents jointly filed an application with the
Changsha City People's Government on Aug. 6 for permission to stage
a demonstration in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan Province, in

been arrested for attempting to establish an association to protect
the rights of laid-off workers in Hunan Province. The application has
not been approved so far, the information center said Monday in a

      <P>Kuo said the money was remitted to his three bank accounts. He
also claimed it was the first time he had rigged the entrance exam
for the two-year university course despite the fact that he assumed
the post in 1994.</P>
      <P>However, the preliminary police investigation revealed that Kuo
had altered the report cards of at least 43 participants in the exam,
which was open only to incumbent police officers who were graduates
of the junior police college.</P>
      <P>In addition, after being interrogated, 14 of the 43 police
officers on suspension have admitted paying between NT$800,000 and
NT$1.5 million in exchange for higher scores in the difficult exam.</P>
      <P>Some 9,600 ground-level policemen throughout the island attended
the exam this year with only 205 police officers permitted to advance
to the oral exam segment which was held earlier this month. After
having finished the program, the police officers are automatically
eligible for a big promotion.</P>
      <P>Investigators said they have thus far discovered at least 10
people who were acting as brokers for Kuo. Known as "white gloves,"
most of these brokers are also police officers or students of the
Central Police University.</P>
      <P>One of the main brokers was Kuo's nephew, Wang Chun-chie, who
graduated from the university this year. Wang, who has admitted his
involvement in the bribery, has been turned over to military
prosecutors for further investigation as he is currently serving his
military service.</P>
      <P>For years, rumors of cheating in the Central Police University
entrance exams have circulated, but they had not been taken seriously
until Hsieh Ruey-chi was appointed university president last July.</P>
      <P>Hsieh removed Kuo from his position as head of the computer
center days before the exam was held on July 10-11, but kept him on
the university's staff. The move, however, failed to prevent the
cheating in the exam results. As the designer of the university's
computerized examination grading and scoring system, Kuo was invited
to provide assistance in operating the system, giving him the
opportunity to alter exam scores.</P>
      <P>After receiving a tip that Kuo had manipulated several report
cards, Hsieh mobilized 200 university faculty and students to check
the English exam answer cards for inconsistencies. The week-long task
revealed that 43 scores had been altered. Checks on the scores for
other subjects confirmed the findings.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reported the incident to prosecutors in Taoyuan on Friday
which led to Kuo's capture at his girlfriend's house in downtown
Taipei on Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOKYO SHOULD AVOID COMMENT ON 'THREE NOES', SAYS JAPANESE PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Chang Fang-ming and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan should in no way involve itself in
negotiations between the two rivals across the Taiwan Strait, Japan's
Mainichi Shimbun national paper said in an editorial Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The daily said Japan should avoid making any comment on the
so-called "three noes" policy which US President Bill Clinton
committed to during his visit to mainland China in late June.</P>
      <P>Clinton spelled out the United States' policy toward Taiwan
during the Shanghai leg of his mainland tour on June 30, saying that
the US does not support independence for Taiwan, does not support
"two Chinas," or "one Taiwan, one China," and does not support
Taiwan's membership in any organization for which statehood is a
requirement.</P>
      <P>In the editorial titled "No Need for Another Joint Statement on
New Japan-China Diplomacy," the daily questioned Beijing's attempt to
get Japan to sign a new bilateral diplomatic joint statement in which
Tokyo's support for the "three noes" will be carried. It questioned
whether Beijing intended to use such a statement as a bargaining chip
in its negotiations with Taipei on reunification.</P>
      <P>Following Clinton's comment on the "three noes," Beijing has
reportedly asked for a similar statement by the Japanese government
when mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin visits Tokyo in
September.</P>
      <P>Beijing will ask Tokyo to commit to a new bilateral diplomatic
joint statement as an addition to the 1972 Joint Statement and the
1978 Treaty on Peace and Friendship signed between Japan and mainland
China, the paper noted.</P>
      <P>In the prospective new statement, Beijing will ask Tokyo to
codify in black and white the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan, it
added.</P>
      <P>The Mainichi Shimbun reiterated that no matter when or how, Japan
should not comment on issues concerning relations or reunification
between Taiwan and mainland China, given that Japan agreed in the San
Francisco Treaty to forsake its colonial rule over Taiwan as well as
all rights of say in Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Tokyo and Beijing both have their eyes on different issues. Tokyo
is concerned with an action plan for future cooperation between the
two sides while Beijing is only concerned with the Taiwan issue and
some historic recognition points, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Japan has no need to be hasty in forging a new joint statement
with Beijing as the 1972 Joint Statement and the 1978 treaty are
sufficient frameworks from which relations between the two sides can
operate on, the editorial said.</P>
      <P>The new treaty is worth signing only if it is of long-term
benefit to both sides as they approach the 21st century, the paper
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>American Express International Inc. has
adopted the name "Republic of China" in its computer data network in
the United States since the beginning of August.</P>
      <P>The change was regarded as the conglomerate's recognition and
respect for the ROC despite a strong blockade against such a move by
Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>American Express had previously referred to Taiwan as "Taiwan,
Province of China" on its credit card bills mailed to its
Optima-class customers in the United States.</P>
      <P>The classification led the ROC's Government Information Office
(GIO) to protest that the label "downplayed the independent
sovereignty of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The GIO's US office explained to the American company that the
ROC has been an independent state since its establishment in 1912,
and that the name "China," which is commonly used to refer to the
People's Republic of China on the mainland in international circles,
does not include the ROC on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the mainland have been divided since the end of the
1949 civil war, and are under the rule of two separate governments
with no link to one another.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, American Express has issued over 310,000 credit cards

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan will not acknowledge the so-called
"three noes" stance regarding Taiwan when it hosts a visit early next
month by mainland China's President Jiang Zemin, a New-Delhi
newspaper reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Within the Japanese ruling Liberal Democracy Party there is
great opposition to altering or expanding on the existing bland `one
China' policy," while Beijing wants Japan to acknowledge the "three
noes" statement regarding Taiwan made by US President Bill Clinton
during his recent visit to mainland China, The Hindu reported.</P>
      <P>The newspaper reported from Tokyo that one of the most serious
disagreements between mainland China and Japan is over the scope of
the redefined US-Japan Security Treaty.</P>
      <P>"China is allergic to the specific exclusion but implicit
inclusion of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait in the new US-Japan defense
guidelines," it reported.</P>
      <P>Top Japanese ministers said the new guidelines are not
geographically specific but flexibly depending on the situation, it
added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a recent visit by Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura to Beijing, The Hindu said the Komura mission
produced "some limited institutionalizing in a bilateral
relationship" where economically and financially the dice are heavily
loaded in Japan's favor.</P>
      <P>It stressed that Japan is one of mainland China's top trading
partners, its top aid donor and one of its principal foreign
investors. "Thus, both countries have decided to establish a standing
committee on economic and financial matters at vice ministerial
level," it added.</P>
      <P>The newspaper indicated that Japan is not doing enough to prevent
mainland China from devaluing the renminbi, "because among other
things a weaker yen and deflation at home prevents Japan from
importing more Chinese goods."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CITES ROC AS GUIDEPOST FOR MAINLAND CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   11  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday
reiterated that the unification of China should be based on freedom,
democracy and the equitable distribution of wealth, rather than on
the autocratic and totalitarian communist system.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when receiving a group of 27 overseas
Chinese leaders from the United States which was paying a courtesy
call at the Presidential Office, accompanied by Chiao Jen-ho,
minister of the Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>On behalf of overseas Chinese organizations in the southwestern
United States, the group extended support for the Republic of China
and expressed concern over cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The president told his guests that the unification of China
should be carried out peacefully. For this reason, Lee said, the
Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Rebellion was
terminated on May 1, 1991, signifying the ROC government's
determination not to use force to achieve national unification.</P>
      <P>However, Lee noted, not only has Beijing failed to make a
friendly response to this gesture, it has strengthened its moves to
isolate the ROC in the world community, and still refuses to renounce
the use of force as a means of unification.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that the two sides have now been
separated for nearly 50 years, and that different systems and
lifestyles on either side of the Taiwan Strait have created feelings
of alienation on both sides.</P>
      <P>To expedite future cross-strait unification, Lee suggested that
Beijing should change its strong ideology. In addition to opening up
its economy, he said, Beijing should allow people to enjoy full
democracy and freedom, should treat the ROC as an equal political
entity, and should engage in peaceful exchanges and dialogue.</P>
      <P>The president further said that freedom and democracy is not only
a world trend, but also a common goal sought by many of the Chinese
immigrants who have spread across the globe and by the ancestors of
modern Taiwanese who moved to Taiwan from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee said, the Republic of China on Taiwan has become the first
place in China to ever completely implement freedom and democracy,
and has become a model for the future development of mainland China.
It has also become a guidepost for all Chinese people who are seeking
national unification, he said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the president said, the existence and development of
the ROC on Taiwan will play a very important role in history.</P>

      <P>A DNA researcher has reportedly traced
the origins of New Zealand's Maori to descendants from Taiwan, The
Australian said in an article Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Geoffrey Chambers from Victoria University in Wellington believes
the Maori traveled from Taiwan through the Philippines and Indonesia
to West Polynesia on the islands of East Polynesia and then southwest
where they eventually settled in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>"There is an exact living record of these voyages of colonization
preserved in the DNA of their modern-day descendants, who are still
living in these places along the route," Chambers said.</P>
      <P>His research made use of DNA data first obtained for another
purpose by researchers at the university's Institute of Molecular
Systematic (IMS) molecular biology laboratory.</P>
      <P>The Victoria University data from several IMS human genetic
studies in New Zealand were then compared with similar information
from other populations around the world, he said.</P>
      <P>The research report said forensic DNA profiling studies done at
the Victoria University also found that Polynesians in general show
less genetic diversity than many other ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>The overall probability of finding two individuals possessing the

be one in 112 million for Asians, one in 47 million for Caucasians,
one in 6.7 million for Polynesians and one in 2.8 million for Maori,

    <HEADLINE>TWO SENIOR SIA OFFICIALS TO JOIN CAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two senior officials from Singapore
Airlines (SIA) are scheduled to join the management team of
Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) under the terms of a recent
cooperative agreement between the two carriers.</P>
      <P>The two officials, Capt. Pow Tuk Kwan and Capt. Gui Wee Kee, will
work for two years in Taipei as CAL's flight vice president, and
special aide to the carrier's president, respectively, a CAL
spokesman said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pow, 54, is a former chief pilot of SIA's A340 fleet and a board
member of the Singapore Academy of Flight. He will be in charge of
CAL's flight management and training from Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>Gui, 51, is a former deputy chief pilot of SIA's B747-400 fleet
and is currently a management consultant for Singapore's civil
aeronautics authority. He will join CAL's team for coordination and
consultancy in flight operations and management.</P>
      <P>The move marks the first cooperative program between the two
carriers after they signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to
form a strategic alliance on Aug. 4.</P>
      <P>The proposed alliance aims to benefit regional customers by
providing better coordination between the two carriers, including
code-sharing on certain routes which will provide customers with a
wider choice of travel options.</P>
      <P>The MOU also sets out general principles for SIA's purchase of
between 5 percent and 10 percent of CAL shares within six months.</P>
      <P>SIA has also agreed to provide CAL with aviation safety and
flight management training, while CAL will provide catering, ground
maintenance and cargo services.</P>
      <P>A formal agreement on the MOU is expected to be signed in six
months time, said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>SIA operates a fleet of 87 aircraft and offers flights to 76
destinations in 41 countries. For the fiscal year ending March 31,
1998, the total revenue of the Singapore International Group, the
mother company of SIA, was S$7.72 billion.</P>
      <P>CAL was established in 1959 and operates a fleet of 52 of the
latest Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus jetliners. CAL and its
two subsidiaries, Mandarin Airlines and Formosa Airlines, serve 46
destinations in 20 countries. The company's operating revenue in 1997
totaled NT$55.85 billion (US$1.63 billion) and its pre-tax profit was
NT$2.77 billion (US$80 million).</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST PEOPLE IN TAIWAN DON'T KNOW 'THREE NOES' POLICY: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey report released Tuesday by the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of the Executive Yuan reveals that
83.6 percent of people in Taiwan do not know what is the "three noes"
policy of the United States toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton said in an informal setting in
Shanghai during his visit to the Chinese mainland on June 25-July 3
that the US government does not support "independence for Taiwan",
"Two Chinas or One China, one Taiwan", and Taiwan's bid to join
"international organizations for which statehood is a requirement."
This US position is usually called the "three noes" policy.</P>
      <P>In the survey conducted between July 17 and 20, randomly-
selected people over 20 years of age were interviewed by telephone to
find out their attitudes after Clinton's last summit meeting with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing. There were 1,098
effective samples, with a sampling error of plus and minus 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey also finds that only 13.9 percent of the
people interviewed knew the US government does not support Taiwan
independence, that only 4.8 percent knew the US does not support "Two
Chinas or one China, one Taiwan," and that only 10.7 percent knew the
US does not support Taiwan's bid to join international bodies for
which statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>The survey also revealed that more than 50 percent of the people
interviewed believed Taiwan and mainland China can hold
consultations on matters of economic, practical, and even political
nature. Only 19 percent oppose such consultations.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the last Clinton-Jiang summit has affected
cross-strait relations, 34 percent said "no," 25 percent said "yes,"
and 10.5 percent said the summit is helpful to cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin predicted Tuesday
that Beijing will make great efforts to ask Japan, France, and other
leading countries in the world to formally mention their "three noes"
policy toward Taiwan in the near future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Tuesday that a total of 74 trade promotion missions will be sent to
Japan in fiscal 1999 to try to narrow a trade deficit which it is
estimated will reach US$18 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks at a meeting held at the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) on how to enhance trade promotion and reduce
the trade deficit with Japan.</P>
      <P>Participants at the meeting included: Senior Advisor to the
President Koo Chen-fu; Chinese National Federation of Industries
Chairman Kao Chin-yen; General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of
China Chairman Wang You-theng; and representatives from related
government agencies and professional associations.</P>
      <P>The minister pointed out that the Asian financial turmoil,
Japan's domestic economic recession, and the foot and mouth disease
epidemic last March, have caused Taiwan's exports to Japan since
August 1997 to continuously suffer two-digit negative growth for each
consecutive month.</P>
      <P>To cope with the situation, Wang said, the MOEA in fiscal 1999
will organize at least 74 professional missions to promote industrial
products such as electronics, electrical appliances, machinery, bags
and shoes. Meanwhile, more Japanese investment in Taiwan is needed to
boost Taiwan's exports to the Japanese market, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOEA will conduct market surveys on the Japanese
market, and will hold seven trade and investment seminars in Japan to
encourage Japanese businesses to organize purchasing groups to visit
Taiwan. The MOEA will also enhance training of human resources
related to trade promotion in Japan.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the MOEA's Board of Foreign
Trade, Taiwan suffered a deficit of US$10.58 billion in its trade
with Japan during the first seven months of this year, an increase of
26.2 percent in comparison with the same period of last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN ERROR CAUSE OF WARSHIP FIRE, SAYS MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fire that claimed the lives of seven
seamen aboard the naval destroyer "Suei Yang" on Aug. 3 was caused
mainly by human error, a Ministry of National Defense (MND) official
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The accident happened as a sailor was trying to replace an oil
rod for the No. 4 boiler in the destroyer's rear boiler room.</P>
      <P>The sailor did not completely shut off the root valve, which
controls the oil volume in the boiler, before pulling out the oil
rod, said Maj. Gen. Ma Ke from the MND's United Operations and
Supervision Department.</P>
      <P>The mistake caused oil to burst from the boiler. The oil then
caught fire and soon spread to the whole boiler room, killing the
seven sailors instantly and injuring five others working in the
enclosed area.</P>
      <P>The task force formed to investigate Taiwan's worst naval
accident in recent decades also attributed inexperience, inadequate
training, and insufficient shift management, as other contributing
factors.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma said, maintenance defects and manpower shortages
were also blamed as root causes of the mishap.</P>
      <P>The "Suei Yang," one of 18 Yang-class destroyers the ROC Navy
bought from the United States nearly 50 years ago, has been in
service for 47 years. Although some of the aging fleet have been
recommissioned and now undertake only second-line duties, most of the
destroyers have had their weaponry and radar systems extensively
upgraded, and remain the backbone of Taiwan's naval combat force.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy's combat force also includes 14 US-made Knox- and
Perry-class frigates, and six French-made Lafayette-class frigates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND-MADE MOBILE PHONE HANDSETS STILL BARRED FROM TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) approved
44 categories of mainland Chinese-made goods for indirect import
Tuesday, but the much-favored mobile phone handsets did not make the
list.</P>
      <P>Of the 93 categories of items up for approval, 34 were rejected
and 15 others are pending.</P>
      <P>As mobile phones are a popular item around the island, Taiwan
importers were disappointed by the board's decision as mainland-made
handsets would have made prices more competitive.</P>
      <P>The Dutch-based company Philips was given the green light to
import all of the approval list's four electrical appliances, they
are vacuum cleaners, electric irons, electric teapots and electric
frying pots. The BOFT rejected the company's application for hair
dryers and air cleaning machines.</P>
      <P>Other items which made the approval list included powdered oyster
essence, yeast abstract, cotton-combing machines, live eels, palm
leaves, coconut husks, frozen white asparagus, frozen baby corn,
coconut fibers, and dried water lily leaves.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has continued to relax
restrictions on mainland-made products over the past several years.
As of July this year, the ministry has given the green light to 5,483
categories of mainland-originating products for indirect import. Of
the total, 5,099 were industrial products and 384 were agricultural
products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD PROPOSES NEW 'THREE LINKS' WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of mainland
Chinese affairs on Wednesday proposed forging three "new direct
links" aimed at narrowing psychological and cultural differences
between the two rivals across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), which crafts Taiwan's mainland Chinese policies,
called for Beijing's support in promoting direct links of mind,
technology information, and culture across the Taiwan Strait to pave
the way for reunification.</P>
      <P>Chang said only when those on both sides of the strait are
mentally, intelligently and culturally able to communicate that
reunification can be easily achieved.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing authorities to discard the "zero win" hegemonic
mentality toward Taiwan and forsake political interference and
containment schemes against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed the importance of cultural interaction across the
Taiwan Strait, saying that closer cultural exchanges is the only way
to narrow the lifestyle and ideological gaps.</P>
      <P>He also urged Beijing authorities to relax controls on the
digital world, including the Internet to allow the mainland public
access to the truth and facts.</P>
      <P>The MAC head said in addition to accelerating private exchanges
between the two sides, the council is actively promoting cross-strait
dialogue, hoping that through step-by-step talks, the two sides will
work out resolutions to issues regarding the welfare and interests of
the people across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In previous years, there have been proposals to set up direct
postal, transportation and commercial links, or the so-called "three
links" across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan has continued to resist such
proposals on the grounds that Beijing continues to regard Taipei as a
local government and not an equal "political entity."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Nengdan National Park
in central Taiwan is expected to open at the end of this year which
would make it the island's seventh national park.</P>
      <P>The proposed park, located in the Central Mountain Range -- the
backbone of Taiwan -- is noted for its great numbers of mountain
lakes and indigenous animals and plants. It was recommended as a
national park by scholars, outdoor activists and wildlife
conservationists, said officials from the Construction and Planning
Administration.</P>
      <P>An area of more than 100,000 hectares, the Nengdan National Park
stretches from Mt. Nengkao in the north to Mt. Dandah in the south.
There are more than 30 mountains standing at least 3,000 meters high
in the area, numerous forests, mountain lakes, five ancient hiking
routes, the highest temple in the island, and rich resources of
wildlife.</P>
      <P>If officially approved, the park will be the largest national
park on the island, boasting unique natural scenic attractions
coupled with historical and geological treasures. It will also help
form Taiwan's "ecology corridor" together with the neighboring Mt.
Jade, Sheipa and Toroko National Parks.</P>
      <P>The other three existing national parks of Taiwan are Kenting
National Park, Yangmingshan National Park and the offshore Kinmen

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
recently completed a complex built to accommodate foreign embassies
and consulates in Taipei, a ministry official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>John Feng, MOFA director of protocol, said the complex contains
two buildings -- one for offices and the other for residential use.</P>
      <P>The office building consists of 28 units with each unit measuring
about 100 pings (roughly equivalent to 3,600-square feet). The
monthly rent for a unit is NT$50,000 (US$1,440).</P>
      <P>Each residential unit occupies an area of around 60 pings (2,160
square feet), which will be offered at a monthly rent of NT$30,000,
Feng said. The complex's security will be handled by an elite police
group under the Police Administration.</P>
      <P>The complex is expected to relieve some of the enormous costs
the island's foreign allies have had to pay for office rent in the
downtown Taipei area.</P>
      <P>The building complex is situated on Tienmu West Road in suburban
Taipei across from the Chen Hsing Hospital. The road in front of the
building is a one-way street, which allows for more effective
security control.</P>
      <P>MOFA Spokesman Roy Wu said the complex is located in an area
where security is a priority.</P>
      <P>Safety, convenience and an ease of general management are the
reasons why the ministry has constructed the complex, Wu said, adding
that similar buildings also exist for the same reasons in many
countries such as South Korea and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</P>

(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has overtaken Japan as Asia's
largest purchaser of Applied Materials Inc. products as the
semiconductor industry suffers greater losses due to the Asian
crisis.</P>
      <P>Applied Materials, the world's largest supplier of wafer
fabrication system and services to the global semiconductor industry,
reported Tuesday that sale figures from its third fiscal quarter at
US$884 million were down 16 percent from the same period last year
and down 25 percent from the second quarter this year.</P>
      <P>"The semiconductor industry downturn continued to deepen during
the third fiscal quarter because of poor economic conditions in Asia,
industry over-capacity and weaker than expected PC sales compounded by
a movement to lower priced PCs," said James Morgan, chairman and CEO
of Applied Materials.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is emerging from the regional morass in relatively better
shape than Japan and Korea, whose semiconductor industries have
either canceled or delayed orders of new manufacturing equipment.</P>
      <P>According to Applied Materials, Taiwan overtook Japan and Europe
as the second largest buyer of Applied Materials equipment and
services in the third quarter of 1998.</P>
      <P>Of Applied Materials' US$608 million new orders, North America
represented 45 percent, Taiwan 20 percent and Japan 18 percent.
Korea's semiconductor industry limited its expansion by reducing its
purchases of new equipment from Applied Materials which represented
only 5 percent of the company's revenue.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter of the year, Taiwan ranked fourth among
Applied Materials' purchasers, after North America, Europe and Japan.</P>

Pacific region, and has raised concern over the rise of Australia's

      <P>Mainland China's Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Yang Jiechi, who

American troop deployments in the region, and also voiced its
opposition to US alliances in the Pacific.</P>
      <P>Yang said: "China believes, and it is our consistent policy, that

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD NOT BE DETERRED BY BOMBINGS: CLINTON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Aug. 7 bombings at the US embassies
in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Dalaam, Tanzania will not deter the
United States from its global involvement, nor from its fight against
terrorism, said President Bill Clinton Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at the top of a speech on the
environment delivered at an event in San Bruno, California.</P>
      <P>"It is important that we all, as Americans, send a clear signal
to the world that we are not going to back away from our involvement
with other people, and we are not going to back away from our
opposition to terrorism," noted Clinton.</P>
      <P>Eleven American citizens killed in the bombing in Nairobi "are
coming home and Hillary and I will go to Andrews Air Force Base to
meet that sad homecoming plane on Thursday," Clinton said. A 12th US
victim, married to a Kenyan, will be buried in Kenya.</P>
      <P>Clinton added that in addition to the American deaths, "well over
200 African citizens have been killed and almost 5,000 injured," and
over 500 people still remain in the hospital in Nairobi.</P>
      <P>The United States has "worked very closely with the governments
of Kenya and Tanzania in, first of all, determining and finding those
who were killed and those who were injured and now in their
treatment. And also they are working very closely with us in our
attempts to find those who are responsible," said the president.</P>
      <P>Clinton added, "in an ever more open world, where people are
traveling more and where more information and technology and,
unfortunately, weaponry are available across national lines, and more
and more information (is available) through the Internet .... It
makes us more vulnerable as targets because we have taken the
toughest stand around the world against terrorism. Now is the time to
bear down, not back up, on that. And that is my determination. And I
believe that's what the American people support. And I hope all of
you will."</P>
      <P>President Clinton cut short his domestic travels by a day to
return to Washington for a meeting Wednesday at the White House with
his national security team. The meeting will focus on the African
bombings, but other issues such as Kosovo and Iraq could also come
up, Deputy Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said.</P>
      <P>Secretary of State Madeleine Albright leaves Washington early
Wednesday to go to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany to escort the
bodies of the 11 US victims home. She is also expected to visit with
some of the wounded who are being treated at a US military hospital
there at the German Air Force Base.</P>
      <P>In his formal report to top leaders of the US Congress, President
Clinton said a joint task force of US military specialists was
deployed to Nairobi, Kenya last Friday to coordinate medical and
disaster relief efforts.</P>
      <P>He also noted that small contingents of armed security personnel
arrived at both sites last Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Although US forces are equipped for combat," he said in a letter
to the speaker of the House of Representatives and the president pro
tempore of the Senate Monday, "This movement is being undertaken
solely for the purpose of enhancing embassy security and ensuring the
security of American citizens. United States forces will re-deploy as
soon as the additional security support is determined to be
unnecessary."</P>

      <P>The leader of four Taiwan businessmen who
have been detained in mainland China since March on charges of spying
was given a four-year jail sentence on Wednesday, according to
sources from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Beijing First Secondary People's Court concluded the trials
of all four businessmen -- Ko Chien-ming, Chen Shao-yu, Han Yueh-ting
and Chou Chang-ming -- but only Ko was sentenced to jail.</P>
      <P>The other three, although all found guilty of espionage, were
released because they "made major contributions to the country," the
court said without elaborating on the form these contributions took.</P>
      <P>The sources quoted a report from Beijing's China News Service
(CNS) on the trials, which said that the men -- all members of the
Taipei-based Chinese Association for the Promotion of Cross-Strait
Civil Exchanges -- used the association as cover for their espionage
operations in mainland China between June 1993 and March 1998.</P>
      <P>These operations included the collection of political, economic,
and military intelligence for Taiwan, according to the court.</P>
      <P>The court said that Ko had confessed to spying for Taiwan and
that it had solid evidence to prove his guilt.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced on May 28 that it had broken a Taiwan spy ring
and arrested four Taiwan businessmen on espionage charges. It accused
the four of working for Taiwan's Military Intelligence Bureau under
the Ministry of National Defense, charges which the ministry

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Wednesday that it has worked out countermeasures to deal with
possible developments arising from a planned visit to Japan in
September by mainland China's President Jiang Zemin.</P>

Obuchi, and the signing of a new Japan-mainland China communique on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China will express its concern and opinions to
Japan through the proper channels and at the proper time, he added.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China and

to Japan to seek Tokyo's commitment to supporting the "three noes" --
no support for Taiwan independence, no support for "two Chinas," or
"one China, one Taiwan," and no support for Taiwan's membership in
international organizations for which statehood is a requirement.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading mainland Chinese dissident on
Wednesday denounced a bilateral human rights dialogue between
Australia and mainland China, saying the talks did not address the
most serious human rights abuses in the mainland.</P>
      <P>US-based Harry Wu, who spent 19 years in the laogai -- mainland
China's gulag -- said Australia did not raise the central issues on
mainland China's violation of human rights abuses.</P>
      <P>"If this is a real human rights dialogue, we have to talk about
forced abortion, forced sterilization, we have to talk about
religious freedom, about Tibet fighting for its future, we have to
talk about the labor camp system in China, about organ trafficking,"
Wu told the Australian newspaper in an interview.</P>
      <P>The Australia Tibet Council also condemned the talks for the lack
of progress on the Tibet problem.</P>
      <P>"We have yet to see a single positive outcome for Tibetans from
any bilateral dialogue," said council member Paul Bourke. "On the
contrary, over the past 12 months, China has continued to imprison,
torture and even kill Tibetans who try to express their political
beliefs," he said.</P>
      <P>The two-day closed door dialogue in Canberra ended on Wednesday.
In a statement released after the meeting between senior Australian
and mainland Chinese officials, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said the talks were designed to make human rights issues "an integral
part of our bilateral relationship."</P>
      <P>Australian officials later said they had raised human rights
issues, and that a mainland Chinese government observer will attend
an Asia-Pacific human rights forum in Jakarta next month. Australia
will also provide mainland China with technical advice on submitting
reports to the UN Human Rights Commission.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese officials will attend courses in international
human rights law at Australian universities, according to the daily,
while Australian experts will continue to lecture at the Chinese
National Judges College in Beijing.</P>
      <P>But Wu was skeptical about the programs.</P>
      <P>"I don't think training communist judges is important. Did you
ever train Soviet judges or the KGB? It's ridiculous," Wu said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky announced on Tuesday that Taiwan will be placed on the US
Special 301 watch list because of continuing concerns about
enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Barshefsky said in a statement that the United States is
concerned that Taiwan's efforts on IPR enforcement "have not been
effective in reducing the production and export of pirated and
counterfeit goods, especially video games and components, CD-ROMs,
and music and video CDs."</P>
      <P>According to US data, Taiwan remains one of the top four sources
of pirated goods seized by US Customs, and is also a major source of
such exports to Latin American markets, especially Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Barshefsky also expressed concern about the "persistent
difficulties" US patent, trademark, and copyright holders face in
Taiwan courts and administrative bodies when defending their
interests against IPR infringements.</P>
      <P>But she promised to consider removing Taiwan from the watch list
once Taiwan takes definitive enforcement actions and makes other
necessary changes to its laws to remedy these long-standing bilateral
irritants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEPRECIATION MAY RESULT IN HIGHER ASIAN INTEREST RATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   12  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asian governments are encountering
increasing pressure to devalue their currencies because of the
weakened Japanese yen, a Central Bank of China official said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, central bank intervention to avoid devaluation will lead
to a general raising of interest rates, the official from the
Economic Research Department of the Central Bank said.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example the recent interference by Hong Kong's
foreign exchange officials in its currency exchange rate, carried out
to maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar after it was hard
hit by international speculators.</P>
      <P>That interference caused Hong Kong's short-term interest rates to
rise sharply, the official said.</P>
      <P>Large-scale fluctuations in interest rates will surely affect the
willingness of private investors and stifle national economic growth,
and therefore have to be taken seriously, said the official.</P>
      <P>When depreciation occurs, the research official explained, and a
country decides to stabilize its foreign exchange rate, its central
bank must intervene. This measure will tighten the market capital and
make a rise in short-term interest rates inevitable, he added.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's market capital has been stringent in recent days,
short-term interest rates have hit the danger line of 7 percent set
by the Central Bank. This is regarded by experts as a result of
Central Bank interference.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian Vegetable Research and
Development Center (AVRDC) has successfully cultivated Arabian jujube
trees in Tainan County in southern Taiwan as the first crop hit the
market on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yang Yao-pik, deputy chief of the AVRDC farm in Ta Nei Village of
Tainan County, said he planted more than 300 date trees on a land
measuring about one hectare. As the crop was good this year, he had
sent the fruit to the market for the first time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang also planted another 10,000 saplings to be
supplied to farmers in Ta Nei Village in the hopes of promoting Ta
Nei as a special area which grows Arabian dates.</P>
      <P>Yang had served as a member of an agriculture technological team
to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 21 years ago. After his return from
that country, Yang began researching how best to plant the date trees
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>About 14 years ago, Yang was successful in the propagation of the
jujube trees, and six years ago, the trees started to bear fruit in
red, yellow, violet and orange colors.</P>
      <P>Yang said although it takes about seven years for a date tree to
mature, by using a technique of pruning, the growth period can be
reduced to three to five years.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, although date trees are native to desert
areas, they are also adaptable to Taiwan's subtropical weather. They
are remarkably adaptable to salted land areas, making them suitable
for planting on coastal areas, he added.</P>
      <P>Yang noted that earlier, experts at the Taisugar Research

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI 'REGRETS' US PUTTING IT ON SPECIAL 301 LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan said on Wednesday that it was
surprised at being put back on US "Special 301 Watch List."</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu expressed regret over the move,
saying Washington should not ignore Taiwan's long-term efforts in
protecting intellectual property rights (IPR) based on a one-sided
complaint by a few US businesses.</P>
      <P>In a news release, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) took
issue with the US trade representative for accusing Taiwan of not
having been "effective in reducing the production and export of
pirated and counterfeit goods," emphasizing that the MOEA's efforts
to fight against commercial pirating never faltered.</P>
      <P>According to a statement made by US Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky Tuesday in Washington, Taiwan was listed as one of the
four leading sources of illegally copied goods seized by US customs
officials.</P>
      <P>The US statement also illustrates the USTR's concerns over
"persistent difficulties US patent, trademark and copyright holders
face defending their interests against infringements in Taiwan courts
and administrative bodies."</P>
      <P>USTR officials explained that their concerns were mainly
triggered by the setback of several American companies, including
Princeton Biomeditech Co. and Microsoft Inc. The two companies are in
the process of suing Taiwan manufacturers for alleged patent and IPR
violations.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said in its news release that it was "unfair and
unreasonable" that the USTR placed Taiwan on its "black list" based
on a few failed IPR and patent related lawsuits.</P>
      <P>Taipei regrets the USTR's actions that have obviously ignored the
fact that the country's judicial operation is independent of the
government's administration, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said his
ministry has spared no effort in seizing pirated and counterfeit
goods, similar to actions taken by US customs authorities.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan authorities can not confiscate suspected IPR
violated goods without a court order. Every enforcement act should be
made according to the laws, Yen stressed.</P>
      <P>Lin Rong-chu, chief of customs administration under the Ministry
of Finance, defended the department's anti-pirate efforts. He said
according to official statistics, from Jan. 1 to July 31, customs
officials cracked down on a total of 11 cases involving in
counterfeit items and seized 23,855 illegally copied CDs for video
games, 18,100 units of pirated cellular phone components, 4,820
counterfeited CD-ROMs, and 1,193 copied Intel micro processors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was removed from the Special 301 Watch List in 1996. The
list is under provisions of a US law that allow punitive measures
against countries believed to have harmed the export US goods or
services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO NEGOTIATE NEW AVIATION RIGHTS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has targeted
countries in South Asia, South America, East Europe and South Europe
to negotiate new aviation pacts to meet trade and tourist demand, a
civil aviation official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official with the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
said many countries are willing to exchange aviation rights with the
ROC since Taiwan allowed its citizens to make overseas sightseeing
trips in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>In terms of the needs of local business people and travel
agencies, the officials said the CAA has given top priority to
exchanging aviation rights with South Asian, South American, East and
South European countries.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that a major obstacle to negotiating new
aviation rights with countries in Europe and Latin America lies with
the fact that Taiwan's geographical location makes it difficult for
carriers of those countries to obtain benefits or commercial profits
comparable to what Taiwan carriers can acquire.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said the CAA plans to increase the number
of flights and destinations that local carriers can serve in the
Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Britain and Germany.</P>
      <P>"We are planning to negotiate amendments to our existing aviation
agreements with those countries in the near future," the official
said, adding that consultations with the Philippines and Thailand are
scheduled for mid-August and late August, respectively.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official said Singapore has expressed its
intention to negotiate a new aviation pact with Taiwan with a view to
expand its flight services to the United States and Canada via
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the benefits Singapore will gain from increased flights to the
United States and Canada through Taiwan will surpass the interests
Taiwan will reap from extending flights from Singapore to other
countries, the official said the CAA has yet to make a final decision
on whether to open negotiations with the Southeast Asian city-state
on aviation pact amendments.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former US presidential assistant has urged
the United States to make clear that it believes Taiwan's status is
up to the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an article in Wednesday's Japan Times daily, Douglas Bandow,
who worked for former US President Ronald Reagan, said Washington
should also emphasize the importance of a peaceful resolution.</P>
      <P>In the article titled "US exacerbating China-Taiwan tension,"
Bandow, now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said US President
Bill Clinton's bizarre mixture of appeasement and threats to Beijing
risk turning Taipei into an even greater flash point than the Korean
Peninsula.</P>
      <P>During his tour of mainland China, Clinton explicitly opposed
independence for Taiwan and Taipei's entrance into international
organizations in which statehood is a requirement. This damaged
Taiwan's bargaining position in any negotiations with Beijing, Bandow
said.</P>
      <P>Clinton's policy shift presages a reduction and eventual
elimination of arms sales to Taiwan and this could leave Taipei
highly vulnerable to Beijing's intimidation or outright military
coercion within a decade, Bandow quoted a colleague at the institute
as saying.</P>
      <P>Yet, at the same time, the Clinton administration apparently
continues to threaten a military response to Beijing's attempts at
intimidation or coercion, thus the administration risks the security
of Americans as well as the people on Taiwan if Beijing does not take
such threats seriously.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration's approach to the Taipei-Beijing issue
is "stupid" in every way, Bandow wrote. He notes that the US opposes
self-determination by people who have built a highly successful
capitalist and democratic society, and is moving to deny the ability
on the part of Taiwan to defend itself.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 12 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The German-based Bayer Taiwan Co. Ltd. will
be asked if it wants to sign a contract to lease a parcel of land in
the Taichung Harbor area, where the company previously planned to
build a chemical plant.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Bayer scrapped the proposed NT$50 billion
plan to build a toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) plant in face of strong
opposition from residents in Taichung County, it has never
relinquished its right to rent the land owned by the Taiwan
Provincial Government.</P>
      <P>As the Executive Yuan has approved the land lease contract, the
Bureau of Taichung Harbor Administration will notify Bayer of the
decision and ask the multinational to sign a contract, the provincial
government said.</P>
      <P>If Bayer fails to ink a contract within 10 days from the date it
receives the notification, it will automatically waive its right to
rent the 78-hectare land.</P>
      <P>The controversial land contract passed its critical stage in
February when it cleared the Taiwan Provincial Assembly following
several rounds of heated discussions and even physical confrontation
between the assembly deputies.</P>
      <P>In the end, Bayer's headquarters in Germany announced on March 18
it would suspend the plan once and for all on the grounds that the
company had no confidence that Taiwan could provide the legal
framework required for it to go ahead with the project.</P>
      <P>The fact that Bayer did not announce any intention to give up its
right to lease the land prompted rumors that Bayer might stage a
comeback with a plan for a similar chemical plant.</P>
      <P>A spokesman with Bayer Taiwan said on Wednesday that ever since
the German headquarters made its decision to move the proposed
investment project from Taiwan to Texas, no instruction has been
given on the leasing of the land.</P>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis has made the German group reassess the
situation in Taiwan, he said, adding that whether Bayer signs the
contract depends on a number of variables. The whole situation is not
optimistic, he said.

as he felt Supachai could contribute to the country's economic
recovery. Supachai said earlier that he would retire from politics if
he were elected to the trade organization.</P>
      <P>WTO candidates must be nominated by their governments before
Sept. 30. The term of the current WTO chief, Renato Ruggiero, expires
next April 30.</P>
      <P>Former Canadian Trade Minister Roy MacLaren is also widely
expected to join the race as are former New Zealand Prime Minister
Mike Moore, Brazil's Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia, and
former Morocco Trade Minister Hassan Abouyoub.</P>
      <P>Diplomats expect the competition to be high, partly because the
post has gained a high profile under Ruggiero, a former Italian trade
minister and European Union official who has been praised for
boosting the credibility of the fledgling WTO.</P>
      <P>Under Ruggiero, the WTO has clinched sweeping global accords to
open up the booming telecommunication, information technology, and
banking and financial service industries.</P>
      <P>The Geneva-based institution, with a channel for dispute
resolution, has a membership of 132 with some 30 more countries,
including mainland China and Taiwan, negotiating for admission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOF TO KEEP EYE ON FOREIGN COMPANIES SEEKING CAPITAL IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will keep an
eye on foreign companies seeking to raise capital in Taiwan, Finance
Minister Paul Chiu said on Wednesday following comments from
President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>President Lee asked the Securities and Futures Commission under
the MOF to closely monitor the flow of foreign capital and establish
a crisis-handling mechanism during a regular weekly Central Standing
Committee meeting of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Chiu said there was no need to worry about professional foreign
investment institutions making investments in Taiwan, but the
ministry will closely watch foreign companies seeking to raise
capital on the island.</P>
      <P>He said if foreign companies want to raise capital in Taiwan,
they must be reputable businesses with credible and excellent
performance records.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official from the Central Bank of China (CBC) said
Wednesday that the bank is closely monitoring the foreign exchange 
market.</P>
      <P>The CBC has not discovered any abnormal movement of foreign
capital, said Chou A-ting, director of CBC's foreign exchange
department.</P>
      <P>The CBC announced earlier that between January and June, the net
inflow of foreign capital totaled US$700 million.</P>
      <P>In face of further financial turmoil in Asia, the department has
expressed the hope that foreign capital in Taiwan should not be used
in short-term manipulation of the island's currency.</P>
      <P>The department, which announces the figures of foreign capital
investment in the local bourse every month, noted that foreign
investors could invest US$86.68 billion, or 30 percent of the total
market value of listed and over-the-board stocks as of July 8.</P>
      <P>The department estimated that as of July 8, foreign capital only
accounts for 3.45 percent of the total market value of listed and
over-the-board stocks, showing that the ratio of foreign capitals in
local securities is still low.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RICH WOMEN SEEN LESS LIKELY TO BEAT BREAST CANCER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rich women are less likely to beat breast
cancer, according to new research by the New South Wales Cancer
Council.</P>
      <P>Researchers said there may be biological differences in breast
cancer found in women from different socio-economic groups.</P>
      <P>Council director Professor Bruce Armstrong said this could be
caused by factors influencing estrogen production, which has been
linked to breast cancer deaths.</P>
      <P>Estrogen production depended on such lifestyle factors as diet,
obesity, exercise and alcohol intake. Biological factors appeared to
outweigh any possibly difference in medical treatment for the
different groups.</P>
      <P>The study of women diagnosed with breast cancer since 1973 found
that about 76 percent from the highest of five socio-economic groups
survived for five years after diagnosis. In the lowest group, the
figure was nearly 78 percent.</P>
      <P>The study also found that overall five-year survival rates for
breast cancer increased from 73 percent in the early 1970s to 81.5
percent for the period between 1988 and 1995.</P>
      <P>Women in their 40s had the best survival rate with 77.5 percent
of those diagnosed since 1973 surviving at least five years. Only 74
percent of women under 39 survived for five years. Older women also
had a higher death rate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WARTIME ENEMIES TO MEET FOR FRIENDSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese National Air Force pilot who
fought against Japanese fighters during World War II, will meet in
Tokyo Saturday with the Japanese pilot who shot him down almost 58
years ago.</P>
      <P>Gen. Hsu Hua-chiang and Kazuyoshi Mikami, both 81, will meet at a
ceremony commemorating Japan's defeat planned for Saturday. It will
mark the pair's first meeting since the two battled in the skies over
Chungqing on Sept. 13, 1940.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Taipei-based United Daily News, Mikami,
a retired stationary merchant, said he is a little worried over
whether he should greet Hsu with "how do you do" or "I'm sorry."</P>
      <P>On one misty autumn morning in 1940, a squadron of Japanese "Zero
fighters" quietly approached the skies above western China's
mountainous city of Chungqing. Before long, six Russian-made fighters
from the Chinese National Air Force rose to meet the Japanese.</P>
      <P>After locking in several rounds of dogfights, Mikami shot down
three Chinese fighters and continued to aim at the fourth, which was
commandeered by Hsu. Mikami shot at the fighter and saw it nose-dive,
emitting black smoke.</P>
      <P>Mikami did not follow the downed fighter plane with machine gun
fire, which was a rule of Japan's Imperial Forces to ensure that the
enemy was dead, he told the United Daily.</P>
      <P>"I don't know why didn't I continue the shooting. Maybe it was
the subtle empathy of a warrior," he said.</P>
      <P>In 1996, when Mikami became acquainted with Hsu through mutual
friends, he discovered what had happened to the fourth Chinese
fighter who not only survived but later became a deputy
commander-in-chief of the Republic of China Air Force.</P>
      <P>After Mikami and Hsu first began to write each other in 1996, the
two former enemies from different countries became friends who shared
many common memories.</P>
      <P>Mikami said among his 13 fellow comrades, only three including
himself survived the war. He became a businessman after the war and
never spoke about his involvement in the cross-border assault five
decades ago.</P>
      <P>His son was shocked when he read a book about the "Zero fighters"
in a bookstore and found his father's name among the other pilots. It
was the first time that his son knew Mikami was a fighter pilot
during World War II.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA CONDEMNS HARASSMENT OF FOREIGN DIPLOMATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
Thursday condemned the harassment of foreign diplomats and
representatives at their offices and residences by local politicians
and members of the general public.</P>
      <P>"MOFA deplores this sort of uncivilized behavior," the ministry
said in a statement, adding that such actions have tarnished the
Republic of China's international image.</P>
      <P>The ministry appealed to the public to help put a stop to such
activity before more harm is done.</P>
      <P>MOFA pointed out in the statement that recent demonstrations led
by some local politicians have targeted foreign embassies and
representative offices.</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, they turned into disorderly incidents that
violated the personal safety and privacy of foreign envoys and
diplomats and hampered their freedom of movement and their ability to
perform official business," the ministry said.</P>
      <P>For example, some protesters against US President Bill Clinton's
June 25-July 3 visit to mainland China posted banners on the walls of
the American Institute in Taiwan facilities, MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Anti-Japanese protesters went to the residence of the director of
the Japanese Interchange Association in June, where they defaced the
walls, lights and intercom with paint, eggs and graffiti and
physically vandalized the property, MOFA said.</P>
      <P>In addition to trespassing on the premises, MOFA said, the
anti-Japanese protesters also threatened to intrude at night.</P>
      <P>In July, demonstrators against the rape of ethnic Chinese women
in Indonesia threw bags of urine, damaged office facilities, and
physically attacked the vice chairman of the Indonesian Economic and
Trade Office in Taipei who went out to receive them.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it has continued to receive complaints and
concerns registered by foreign envoys.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry said, foreign friends in Taiwan have
begun to worry that this uncivilized and seemingly behavior will not
only portray the Republic of China as being unfriendly to foreigners,
but also invite retaliation against Taiwan diplomats, businessmen and
even tourists overseas.</P>
      <P>"The grandstanding by politicians should be stopped immediately
and be condemned in the strongest possible terms," MOFA stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TRIAL VIOLATES BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities violated the
human rights of four Taiwan businessmen by not giving them an open
trial, an official with the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, MAC vice chairman, made the remarks a day after
Beijing's Number One Intermediate People's Court sentenced Kou
Chien-ming, one of the four men, to four years in prison on spying
charges.</P>
      <P>The three others identified as Chen Shao-yu, Han Ming-wen, and
Chou Chang-ming were also convicted of espionage but were exempted
from punishment because their crimes were considered minor.</P>
      <P>Sheu said many questions in the case remain unclear, and Beijing,
which began the trial Aug. 3 behind closed doors, has violated the
principle of basic human rights</P>
      <P>The case has raised concern among many Taiwan businessmen
operating in the mainland as they are worried that their human rights
will not be protected.</P>
      <P>Kou has filed an appeal with the higher court. Meanwhile, the
other three are now under protection of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Beijing's intermediary body
established to deal with Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The three men should be allowed to return to Taiwan as soon as
possible, Sheu said. He added that the MAC will continue to ask SEF
to convey to the mainland the sense that the MAC will give its full
support to Kou in his appeal.</P>
      <P>Sheu said he hoped the mainland can resolve the case without
damaging the relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He
also asked the mainland to address a series of cases involving the
protection of Taiwan people's personal safety and property in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>He urged SEF and ARATS to actively pursue "constructive"
consultation on issues that directly affect the lives and interests
of the people on both sides of the strait, including the protection
of personal safety and property of Taiwan businessmen, judicial
assistance, trade dispute arbitration and joint crackdown on crime.</P>
      <P>Beijing accused Kou, who established the Taipei-based Chinese
Cross-Strait Civilian Exchanges Association in 1971, and the other
three men, who are all members of the association, of using the
association as a cover for spying operations in mainland China
between June 1993 and March 1998.</P>
      <P>These operations included the collection of political, economic
and military intelligence, according to Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian authorities on Wednesday revised
downward its estimate for second-quarter growth in the country's real
gross domestic product to 2.5 percent from 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The summer 1998 edition of the Bank of Canada Review painted an
otherwise positive picture for the Canadian economy, saying there was
a strong momentum in the economy for at least the short term.</P>
      <P>It forecast that Canada's 1998 annual growth rate will reach a
healthy 3.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The quarterly review confirmed that Asia's economic crisis has
had a negative effect on Canada. Less manufacturing in Asia means
less demand for Canadian materials, but the losses caused by Asia
have been offset by the booming US economy which absorbed 80 percent
of Canadian exports, the report said.</P>
      <P>"Here in Canada, allowing for the effects of temporary factors
such as layoffs associated with the strike at General Motors, the
underlying momentum in the economy continues to be positive," an
update in the review said.</P>
      <P>Inflation should remain in the bottom end of the bank's 1 percent
to 3 percent target range for the remainder of the year, business
investment remains strong, retail sales continue to climb and
employment and income continue to grow.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, the bank warned that the US Federal Reserve
may have to raise interest rates to curb the overheated US economy.
No change, however, is anticipated in the next few months, it added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Thursday it is keeping a close watch on the situation in Indonesia
amid reports that new riots may erupt again later this month.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said the ROC representative office in
Indonesia has also called a series of meetings with Chinese community
leaders and representatives of Taiwan business people in that country
to exchange views on the possibility of new rioting breaking out on
Aug. 17, Indonesia's National Day.</P>
      <P>"The staff of our representative office in Jakarta has also
discussed feasible measures with Chinese community leaders and senior
executives of major Taiwan trade associations to cope with possible
developments in the Southeast Asian country," Wu said.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Wu said, the Indonesian government has attached
great importance to the possible outbreak of new riots and has taken
precautionary measures to prevent the recurrence of political turmoil
in May that led to the downfall of the Suharto government.</P>
      <P>Responding to foreign wire service reports that the Indonesian
government will ask US, Taiwan and mainland Chinese law enforcement
authorities to jointly investigate atrocities committed by Indonesian
rioters against ethnic Chinese women during May riots, Wu said both
the ROC government and its private sector have coordinated their
efforts to assist Indonesian authorities in handling related issues.</P>
      <P>For example, Wu said, the ROC representative office in Jakarta
has promised to help search for ethnic Chinese women raped or abused
by Indonesian rioters and to report those cases to the Indonesian
government for reference.</P>
      <P>"Our representative office has long taken the initiative to
coordinate with Indonesian authorities with a view to better protect
personal safety and property rights of ROC nationals and overseas
Chinese there," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said, local women's rights groups have sent

      <P>Taiwan ranked seventh in the world for its
scientific and technological strengths, the highest such ranking it
has ever achieved, according to the Council of Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The ranking, issued by the Lausanne-based International Institute
for Management and Development (IMD), noted Taiwan's advance in
science and technology development. The island ranked 10th in the
1997 survey, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said compared with other Asian economies, Taiwan
was seen to have made significant progress in sharpening its
competitive edge in the technology industry.</P>
      <P>The IMD's competitive study placed Taiwan on top among the tiger
economies in Asia, ahead of Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked among the top 12 in four sub-categories. It ranked
12th for resources in research and development, fifth in science and
technology management, sixth in scientific research environment, and
seventh in intellectual property protection, according to the IMD

      <P>The Swiss institute annually compares the competitiveness of 46
economies by measuring economic strength, the economic openness to
international trade, government efficiency, financial services,

training. The study defines national competitiveness as a country's
ability to help keep businesses competitive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was listed 16th in the 1998 general rating, up seven
notches from its 1997 ranking.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials pointed out that technology is regarded as the key
battle field of the world's economic campaigns in the approach to the
21st century. Taiwan must now concentrate on its technological
progress and further enhance its competitiveness, which are currently
its most important tasks, they said.</P>
      <P>However, the economic experts warned that although Taiwan enjoyed
a boost in its IMD intellectual property protection rating, its
record on patent applications and patented goods -- which are key
criteria for the competitive rating -- were seen declining over the
past two years. The decreases are expected to pull down Taiwan's
future ranking in the field, they said.</P>
      <P>According to latest statistics released by the National Bureau of
Standards, the authority approved 19,551 local patent applications in
1997, and 19,410 cases in 1996, down from 20,717 in 1995.</P>
      <P>Growth in the number of approved patents posted at 0.73 percent
last year, while there was a negative figure in 1996 following the
64.9 percent growth in 1995, the figures showed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should also pay more attention to its protection of
intellectual property rights especially after the United States
reinstated the island to its "Special 301 Watch List." The list,
under provisions of a US law, allows punitive measures to be taken
against countries deemed to have harmed the export of US goods or
services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEBERTHAL SAID TO PLAY CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN US-TAIWAN TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The de facto US ambassador to Taiwan
has said that he believes Kenneth Lieberthal, the new senior director
in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs under the US National Security
Council (NSC), will play a constructive role in US-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>Darryl N. Johnson, director of the Taipei Office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which represents US interests in Taiwan in
the absence of official ties, made the remarks in an exclusive
interview with the CNA on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Describing Lieberthal as "a very good friend of mine," Johnson
said Taiwan need not be concerned over Lieberthal's appointment to
the NSC post.</P>
      <P>Johnson recalled that he last met Lieberthal in Taipei in
February, when the noted China hand traveled to the island to attend
a conference on mainland China's political and economic development
in the wake of the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party and on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Johnson said Lieberthal was "very impressed, very positively
impressed" by his Taipei visit.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lieberthal is a brilliant scholar, Johnson said the
former director of the China Policy Research Center of the University
of Michigan is highly qualified for his new NSC position.</P>
      <P>However, Johnson said Lieberthal may not be accurately understood
in Taiwan in terms of his personal views and in terms of his
background. He pointed out that Lieberthal has many years of
experience in management of US relationships with both Beijing and
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"It's of vital significance to the United States. So I think with
him in the position at the National Security Council, he will
certainly take guidance from the president and from the other people
in the policy process. I have every hope and expectation that his
role will be very constructive," Johnson explained.</P>
      <P>During his Taipei visit, Lieberthal presented a paper urging the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to sign a 50-year provisional
agreement to regulate bilateral relations under a "one China"
principle.</P>
      <P>According to the Lieberthal-proposed agreement, Taiwan should
recognize itself as part of China and promise not to seek de jure
independence, while mainland China is required to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan. During the 50-year period, the two sides should
hold regular high-level talks to pave the way for eventual
reunification.</P>
      <P>Lieberthal's proposal triggered negative responses in
Taiwan, but Johnson said the reaction was partly due to
the fact that Lieberthal's views were misunderstood.</P>
      <P>In fact, Johnson said, the objective of Lieberthal's paper was to
try to lay out some ideas for maintaining the status quo. "That's
what it was about," he said.</P>
      <P>Johnson further said that what Lieberthal was trying to do was to
lay out a framework for maintaining the status quo in a constructive
way that would allow Taiwan and mainland China to go about their
business for an almost indefinite time, without worrying about the
question of future status.</P>
      <P>Commenting on some local observers' worries that Lieberthal may
take advantage of his new post to force Taiwan to negotiate political
issues with Beijing, Johnson said it is US policy to encourage
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"The policy of encouraging dialogue between Taiwan and the
mainland goes back many years. It does not depend on any one
individual. It is US policy. We do support dialogue. We have long
supported dialogue. This is not something dependent on who is on the
National Security Council," Johnson stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-US COMMUNICATION CHANNEL EFFECTIVE: AIT CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The existing communications channel between
Taiwan and the United States is "extremely effective," said a ranking
US official in charge of Taiwan affairs on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Darryl N. Johnson, director of the American Institute in Taiwan's
Taipei Office, said although there have been suggestions recently
that a "Track Two" communication channel be set up between Taiwan and
the US, the "Track One" communication channel representing the two
parties is working efficiently and smoothly.</P>
      <P>As the top US liaison official in Taiwan, the AIT official said
he and his counterpart Stephen Chang, Taiwan's representative based
in Washington D.C., do not have any difficulties in meeting local
people.</P>
      <P>"I don't think there is any problem as far as communicating
between people representing these two bodies (is concerned)," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>As to meetings between Taiwanese and US officials, Johnson said
they still represent the "Track One" approach.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the two countries maintain no official
diplomatic relations, these meetings have a special "unofficial
characteristic, because they are meetings between people with a
specified responsibility and authority on both sides," the AIT
official said.</P>
      <P>The idea for a Track Two communication channel was proposed by
former US officials and academics, including former US Defense
Secretary William Perry, Johnson said, noting that the 1996 Taiwan
Strait missile crisis was one of five or six most serious issues
Perry had to deal with during his tenure as defense chief.</P>
      <P>This event may have motivated Perry to try to play a more
constructive role, Johnson added.</P>
      <P>However, Johnson emphasized that Perry, who is not an incumbent
US official, does not speak for or act on behalf of the US
government. "His meetings with people in the States or with people
here or in other places are the same as those between any other
unofficial private American and people in responsible positions
here," he went on to say.</P>
      <P>"My own view is that as long as you have good communications on
Track One between the authorized representatives on both sides, Track
Two is basically something extra," Johnson said. "It's something
which may provide additional outside ideas, additional motivations,
or additional influences if you like. It does not change the context
within which the players participate."</P>
      <P>Citing remarks made by President Lee Teng-hui about a year ago
during a meeting between the two, the AIT Taipei Office director
said, "We don't lack for messengers, we lack for a message."</P>
      <P>"A lot of people want to be messengers to carry messages back and
forth," he said, "but the point is what is the context of the
message. And for that we have adequate channels, and the mechanism is
quite effective."</P>
      <P>Asked whether the US already has a candidate in mind for the
Track Two talks -- such as Koo Cheng-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with
mainland China and chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation -- Johnson stressed the US government and the AIT take no
position on who should participate in "informal conversations."</P>
      <P>"There are many people in the US who have an interest in
encouraging peaceful resolutions ... Some of them have official
authority, and many do not," he noted. "They are driven in
most cases by an effort to try to help, but they do not act on behalf
of the US government."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the word "American" appears in its title, the school has
no affiliation with the AIT, Johnson explained. He expressed
confidence that the whole matter will be properly handled by the
Taiwan provincial and central authorities.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the incident has been overpoliticized,
Johnson was hesitant to comment on the issue, but he said the AIT, as
an agency which represents the US government in Taiwan, is concerned
about the welfare of American students and citizens here.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the recent tragic terrorist bombings of US embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania, Johnson said the AIT is cooperating very
closely with the authorities in Taipei to increase security measures
for its facilities.</P>
      <P>In his view, Taiwan is a safe place to live and work. "We have
no reason to assume otherwise," the AIT official said.</P>
      <P>"We have to be vigilant, and I think that is true everywhere.
But we intend to keep our doors open and intend to continue
operating, to issue visas, and to receive people. We will do so with
care and sensible prudence," he added.</P>
      <P>Hailing Taiwan's democratization, Johnson called himself an
interested observer of the year-end elections as "democracy is a
wonderful thing." However, the AIT is not in the position to make a
comment in this regard. "But we support the free exercise of
political opinions, and we applaud the process."</P>
      <P>The veteran diplomat, who previously served as US ambassador to
Lithuania and has been at his current post for more than two years,
said he and his wife have been "deeply touched, impressed and moved
by the warmth of the people of Taiwan. This applies not only to high
officials but also to lots of ordinary people."</P>
      <P>"We like to get out a lot and get around on the island, and to
visit people in the private sector, as well as government
institutions and schools," Johnson said, concluding that "we have
been very pleased to be here."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The top US liaison official in Taiwan said
on Tuesday that Taiwan-US relations are healthy and strong, and that
there is universal support in the United States for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Darryl N. Johnson, director of the Taipei Office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), told the CNA in an exclusive interview
that there has never been such a broad range of good feeling,
understanding, and close relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Apart from some core issues and a few "very hard problems" on
intellectual property rights and certain commercial activities, "I
think it (the Taiwan-US relationship) is a very healthy and strong
relationship," he asserted.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on remarks by US Senator Slade Gorton last
week that supporting Taiwan has become a mainstream position in the
United States, Johnson said he agrees with Gorton's observation.</P>
      <P>Stressing that US public opinion toward Taiwan has always been
favorable, especially in the last 11 years, as democracy has
flourished on the island, Johnson said: "I think it is true to say
that there is almost no difference in opinion across the political
spectrum (and) no opposition to Taiwan democracy. It is considered a
great success story, economically as well.</P>
      <P>"Maintaining the deepest possible contacts with Taiwan has been
and is the US policy," the ranking AIT official said.</P>
      <P>However, Johnson said that maintaining friendly relations with
Taiwan does not mean being hostile to mainland China, or vice versa.
"We don't do this as an `either-or' situation because most of the
American people think it is both possible and desirable to have good
relations with both, and we do. It is true now," he continued.</P>
      <P>Asked whether US President Bill Clinton's engagement policy with
mainland China goes against the will of the American people, Johnson
said that although there have been several advances, there have been
no big changes in US engagement policy toward Taiwan and mainland
China, and that Clinton is only following the policy set as far back
as the Carter administration, and carried on through the successive
administrations of Reagan and Bush.</P>
      <P>Referring to two recent resolutions which were almost unanimously
passed in the Senate and the House of Representatives to extend
congressional support for Taiwan, Johnson said that the passage of
the resolutions served to "reaffirm the basis of our policy towards
Taiwan and the mainland."</P>
      <P>"The administration did not oppose these resolutions. Extracting
the political language and looking at the wording of the documents,
in this case, there were no important differences between what the
Congress was saying and what the administration says," he said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Acts signed by former President Jimmy Carter
in 1979 has been, and still is the basis for US policy toward Taiwan,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Turning to other current issues, Johnson commented on the case of
the Taichung Lincoln American School, a central Taiwan school for
foreign children which made headlines after it was discovered to have
been illegally built on land zoned for resort use.</P>
      <P>Johnson made clear that the role played by the AIT was purely as
a "receiver of information" from the local community there. "We have
been no party in any way at all."

    <HEADLINE>US ENVOY REAFFIRMS NO CHANGE IN US POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The de facto US ambassador to Taiwan has
reaffirmed that there is no change in Washington's policy of selling
defensive weapons to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"The United States will continue to sell arms of defense nature
to Taiwan," Darryl N. Johnson, director of the Taipei Office of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), said in an exclusive interview
with the CNA on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The United States has consistently sold a number of defense items
to Taiwan annually, Johnson said, adding that such deals will be
continued in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The veteran career diplomat, however, would not elaborate on the
items, quantity and prices concerning a new deal expected to be
announced in the near future.</P>
      <P>"The point is, as our president said in Beijing, that we do
intend to continue our arms sales policy to Taiwan," Johnson said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that US President Bill Clinton clearly explained
the basic elements of the US arms sales policy toward Taiwan during
his June 25-July 3 state visit to mainland China. Clinton also
reaffirmed US commitment to abiding by the Taiwan Relations Act, a US
law that regulates its relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Johnson stressed that Clinton is the first US president to state
on mainland China's territory the US intention to continue arms sales
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The amicable American envoy further said there are generally no
conflicting views between Taiwan and the United States concerning
arms deals. The two countries also maintain close military
cooperation, he said, adding, "We hope Taiwan is satisfied with
military equipment provided by us."</P>
      <P>Touching on the possible impact of improving Beijing-Washington
ties on the interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
Johnson said the United States is hopeful that better
Washington-Beijing ties will create an incentive for Beijing to
moderate its policy toward Taiwan and to improve the conditions
for better cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Johnson said it will become clear in the coming month whether
both sides of the strait are prepared to move toward a better
relationship. He was referring to a planned landmark trip to mainland
China by Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, C. F. Koo, this fall.
During his trip, Koo is expected to meet his mainland counterpart,
Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Johnson said the planned "Koo-Wang" meeting this fall was not
necessarily prompted by Clinton's high-profile mainland visit.</P>
      <P>"I think the event has its own engine, its own momentum," Johnson
noted.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan's drive to expand its international space will be
limited by Clinton's recent "three noes" statement, Johnson said
Taiwan need not worry about that.</P>
      <P>Clinton mentioned the "three noes" at a roundtable meeting in
Shanghai on June 30, which refers to no US support for Taiwan
independence, no US support for "two Chinas, or one China, one
Taiwan," and no US support for Taiwan's membership in international
organizations for which statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Johnson said a major development in Taiwan-US ties in recent
months was the signing of a formal agreement on terms for Taiwan's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) last Friday.</P>
      <P>The agreement manifests US support for Taiwan's membership in
international organizations for which statehood is not a requirement,
Johnson said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out although the United States does not support
Taiwan's entry to the United Nations and UN-related bodies, it has
never hesitated to support Taiwan's participation in non-political
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on news reports that Beijing is pushing Tokyo to
either codify or throw its verbal support behind the so-called "three
noes" during mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan
early next month, Johnson said he believes there will be no important
changes in Japan's approach to Taiwan-related issues.</P>
      <P>Johnson supported his assessment by citing Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's recent call on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to resort to peaceful dialogue for a peaceful solution to
their disputes.</P>
      <P>As for how Japan will deal with those issues, Johnson said it is
up to the Japanese to make their own decision.

      <P>In the course of the interview, Johnson would not directly
confirm a newspaper report that Ding Mou-shih, secretary-general of
the ROC's National Security Council, met with US Deputy National
Security Adviser James Steinberg in New York late last month.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Johnson did say that although such a meeting would
have been of an unofficial nature, it would still have been part of
the "Track One" dialogue between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Johnson explained that although Taiwan and the United States do
not maintain official ties, meetings between authorized
representatives from both sides, namely the AIT and the ROC
representative office in Washington, D.C., should still be defined as
"Track One" dialogue. "And such meetings have been very helpful," he
added.</P>
      <P>"I don't think there is any problem as far as communication
between the people representing these two bodies (is concerned)," he
said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the idea presented by former US Defense Secretary
William Perry and several American scholars to set up "Track Two"
informal dialogue channels, Johnson said he thinks such channels can
provide additional ideas, opinions and motivation.</P>
      <P>However, Johnson said he does not think "Track Two" dialogue
channels can change the "context within which the players
participate."</P>
      <P>Johnson further said the United States is fully aware that Taiwan
is highly sensitive to any improvement in Washington-Beijing
relations.</P>
      <P>"There are people here who believe that better US-PRC relations
must be disadvantageous, must be not beneficial for Taiwan. In fact,
our view, and my strongly held personal view, is that the opposite is
true," Johnson said.</P>
      <P>Johnson further pointed out that US public opinion toward Taiwan
has always been favorable, especially in the past 11 years, as
democracy has taken root and flourished on the island.</P>
      <P>"I think it is true to say that there is almost no difference in

      <P>Johnson further said apart from some core issues and a few "very
hard problems" on intellectual property rights protection and certain
commercial activities, the United States has never maintained such
expansive, friendly and close relationships with both sides of the
Taiwan Strait as it does now.</P>
      <P>The soft-spoken American envoy, who has been in his current stint
for more than two years, said he and his wife have been "deeply
touched, impressed and moved by the warmth of the people of
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>As the the tenure for the AIT directorship is usually three
years, Johnson said it will not become clear until either late this

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice's Investigation
Bureau has maintained surveillance operations for reasons of national
security, bureau officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after a local news magazine
reported that the government has stepped up political surveillance of
personnel on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to The Journalist weekly, the MJIB decided on Feb. 13
that it would monitor Taiwan people traveling to the mainland for
investment, tourism and cultural exchanges, those who are suspected
of smuggling guns and ammunition from the mainland, illegal mainland
immigrants, Taiwan gangsters traveling to the mainland and those in
the publishing industry.</P>
      <P>Even entertainers who have recently made frequent visits to the
mainland will also be monitored, the report said.</P>
      <P>The MJIB would not confirm the report, saying only that it
monitors the past and present telecommunications, whereabouts and
connections of related personnel for safeguarding of national
security.</P>
      <P>The Journalist said the MJIB has another project which targets
religious figures traveling to the mainland and foreign nationals in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Those targeted included local temple personnel who organize group
pilgrimages to the mainland, foreign nationals who are in Taiwan to
collect financial, industrial technology and political information
and foreign laborers employed by local manufacturers.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the project aims to prevent foreign and
religious figures from being lured and used in the collection of
information for mainland China.</P>
      <P>The reports said another project was established on March 1, 1992
and it monitors mainlanders who snuck into Taiwan and those who came
to Taiwan to visit or live with their relatives.</P>
      <P>The bureau officials said the purpose of the project was to
prevent the infiltration of mainland spies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VALUABLE 5TH CENTURY B.C. INSTRUMENT BOUND FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The duplicate of a fifth century B.C.
chimed instrument is expected to be imported indirectly from mainland
China's Hubei Province to Taiwan in two days.</P>
      <P>The instrument, comprised of 65 bronze bells, is considered proof
of the sophistication of ancient Chinese musicians and artisans. The
original dates back to the Early Warring States Period over 2,000
years ago and was unearthed from the middle chamber of the tomb of
Zenghou Yi, a feudal lord, in an area known today as Suixian, in the
central province of Hubei.</P>
      <P>The duplicated instrument is expected to be included in the
collections of the Ethnic Music Center being established by the
Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA), said Liao
Kuei-ying, executive curator of the private Chang Foundation Museum
which is importing the instrument on behalf of the CCA.</P>
      <P>The set that is being delivered to Taiwan is one of the three
copies made by the Provincial Hubei Museum after the valuable
instrument was unearthed in 1978.</P>
      <P>The instrument consists of 65 bells or "bianchong" which hang
vertically or diagonally under wood beams on three different levels.
Each bell can produce two different notes, making the instrument
capable of playing almost any modern piece of music, Liao said.</P>
      <P>In an overseas performance tour several years ago, mainland
Chinese musicians played Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with a
duplication of the instrument, debunking the myth that the Chinese
have no theory and instruments to play sophisticated music.</P>
      <P>What is perhaps most amazing about the ancient chimed instrument
is not only that it can produce a full-range of musical notes and 12
semi-tones from C2 to D7, but it also contained gold-inlaid
inscriptions revealing the then theory of music and how people from
six neighboring states played the same music.</P>
      <P>The inscriptions involving 3,755 characters greatly advanced
modern-day knowledge of ancient Chinese music, said Liao of the Chang
Foundation Museum, which sponsored an exhibition in Taiwan featuring
a duplication of the ancient instrument late last year.</P>
      <P>Another amazing aspect about the fifth century B.C. musical
instrument is the sophistication of the bronze material. The bronze
alloy indicated that the metallurgical industry in China 2,000 years
ago was well established. Other details, including the casting,
painting and carving on the instrument were equally stunning, she
said.</P>
      <P>The import of the duplication has so far not been smooth, Liao
admitted. First, it is not allowed to be directly ordered by the CCA
because of the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Second, the Chang Foundation Museum is now facing an import tax
and handling fees of more than NT$2 million (US$58,310) charged by
customs authorities who do not consider the duplicated instrument as
"materials to be used in academic research" as it was claimed by its
importer.</P>
      <P>The CCA has filed an appeal with the Department of Customs
Administration for a re-examination of the import application in the
hopes that the instrument will be allowed to be imported duty-free.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's stock market and currency
remained under pressure on Thursday as investors worried that Asia's
volatility would effect Wall Street amid deepening Asian economic
woes.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index edged up slightly in early afternoon
trade, rising about four points from Wednesday's close of 2,551, the
lowest close since June 17 this year.</P>
      <P>The index dropped for the sixth consecutive day since Aug. 5 and
analysts said there is still room for the index to fall further in
coming days unless good news comes from Wall Street and Japan.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar slipped to 59.12 US cents in early
afternoon trade, down from Wednesday's close of 59.85 cents. Analysts
said the currency could fall further to 55 US cents if the Japanese
yen breached the psychological barrier of 150 to the US dollar.</P>
      <P>"The stock and currency markets are volatile and it's more
difficult to predict how long they would continue to come under
pressure," one analyst said.</P>
      <P>"But investors are getting more jittery and they are now liable
to get burned if they make a wrong investment," another said.</P>
      <P>Analysts said not only Australian investors have suffered losses,
but also investors in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Japan and other
Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Wall Street could fall further because fundamentals are
deteriorating rapidly which is further compounded by a deceleration
in credit growth as well as lower growth and earning forecasts from
Latin America, which accounts for 21 percent of US exports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Broken Hill Proprietary Corp. (BHP),
Australia's leading industrial conglomerate, registered sharp
declines in its steel exports to Taiwan and other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>BHP's two operating divisions, BHP Integrated Steel and BHP Steel
Products, are reducing their steel exports to one-third from
two-thirds of their overall sales of over 3 million tonnes a year in
Asia.</P>
      <P>BHP officials believe the slump in the first two months of this
year will adversely affect the group's steel exports which have led
it to shift its promotional focus to other markets to make up some of
the losses in Asia.</P>
      <P>In addition, BHP is trying to increase its sales of steel
products domestically, a company spokesman said. He said the steel
market in Asia will remain gloomy and the Asian economic crisis could
last longer than early predicted, possibly four instead of two years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S CRACKDOWN ON SMUGGLERS DEALS A BLOW TO HK, WESTERN FIRMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's unprecedented crackdown
on military smuggling is dealing a heavy blow to Hong Kong and
western companies looking for cheap access to the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing on Thursday, the Sydney Morning
Herald's correspondent David Lague reported that the crackdown is
choking a massive inflow of illegal imports from Hong Kong and is
threatening to deny many major western companies cheap access to the
mainland market.</P>
      <P>The early success of the central government's anti-smuggling
crusade appears likely to boost mainland's burgeoning trade surplus
but it could also hurt Hong Kong's embattled economy, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>A major proportion of goods shipped illegally through ports on
mainland China's southern coast come from the former British colony.</P>
      <P>Elements of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed
Police reportedly control much of this illegal trade, but the threat
of smuggling and official corruption to mainland's economic growth
and political stability forced President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji to back the sweeping crackdown.</P>
      <P>Special teams of customs inspectors from northern mainland China
have been deployed to ports along the south coast over the past month
in a bid to halt the rampant smuggling of goods such as cigarettes,
electronic items and food, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Beijing authorities estimated it was losing about US$12 billion

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE RECEIVES CANADIAN LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Thursday
expressed the hope that Canada would support the Republic of China in
its bid to join international economic and trade organizations.</P>
      <P>He made the remark when receiving a group of Canadian
parliamentarians headed by Mac Harb.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan, Harb and his
colleagues, including John Maloney, Ivan Grose, Richard Harris, 
Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral, and Paul Bonwick, paid a courtesy call to
Lee at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Lee told his guests that bilateral trade between Taiwan and
Canada has ample room for growth in the future as it currently
averages only US$3 billion annually.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the belief that the current trade problems
between the two countries will be resolved smoothly after Taiwan
enters the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Harb praised Taiwan for its vitality and its ability to survive
the severe test of the Asian financial turmoil. The lawmaker
expressed hope that the two sides would further enhance economic and
cultural exchanges in the future. He also reiterated Canada's support
for Taiwan's bid to join the WTO.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing his appreciation for Canada's support,
Lee said the Republic of China, which is a free and democratic
country, has confidence in facing the financial challenges ahead. He
attributed the relative small impact the region's economic storm has
had on Taiwan to its on-the-track economic and political system, and
precautions taken by both the government and public.</P>
      <P>The president considers Canada a very good investment destination
for Taiwan businessmen. He also welcomes industries with advanced
technology from Canada to invest and build factories in Taiwan to
improve substantive relations between the two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN RESIDENTS SCARED BY INVADING MAINLAND FISHING BOATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of mainland Chinese fishing boats
have been landing on the beaches of Taiwan's frontline Kinmen island
group to poach fish and shrimp in recent months, triggering fears
among Kinmen residents, local police said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We have continued to receive complaints from local residents
that mainland fishing boats have been making night landings at low
tide to trespass on Kinmen coastline in recent months," a Kinmen
police officer said.</P>
      <P>The incursions have triggered worry among many Kinmen residents
about their personal safety, the officer said, adding that some
locals have complained that they cannot sleep at night because of
fears of mainland threats and the noise made by the mainland
fishermen.</P>
      <P>Responding to the mounting complaints, Chang Chang-po, chief of
the Kinmen County Police Bureau, made an inspection tour of the
region on Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>Chang said the issue has become very serious. In the past,
mainland fishermen conducted illicit trade deals with their Kinmen
counterparts in waters near the center line of the narrow Taiwan
Strait that separates Taiwan and mainland China. Later, however, they
began intruding into ROC territorial waters near Kinmen to sell
agricultural goods.</P>
      <P>"And now, they have even started landing on Kinmen's coastal
regions to poach fish and shellfish. Their daring provocative actions
have imposed heavy pressure on local police and security forces,"
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that hundreds of mainland fishing
boats are often to be found anchored along the coastline from Houfeng
port in southwestern Kinmen to the neighboring ports of Kuningtou,
Anchi, Housha, Chunglin, Chiuanlin and Liuao.</P>
      <P>With so many mainland fishing boats operating during the hours of
darkness, police said, the light cast by the ships brightens the
night sky and makes Kinmen's coastal region look like a night market.</P>
      <P>"Apart from poaching, we are worried that the mainland fishermen
may commit crimes such as drug trafficking and smuggling of firearms
and humans," Chang said, adding that he is also afraid that some of
the mainland fishermen may even commit robberies or burglaries during
their secret landings.</P>
      <P>Chang said he has ordered all Kinmen's police branches to set up
special task forces to intensify coastal patrols to prevent mainland
fishermen from making illegal landings, as well as to thwart any
smuggling attempts.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen military command has also ordered the coast guard to
tighten spot checks and patrols to defend the island group's
coastline.</P>
      <P>Kinmen is closer to mainland China's Fujian province than to
Taiwan. As relations across the Taiwan Strait have been very
sensitive of late, Kinmen's garrison troops no longer open fire with
warning shots on encroaching mainland vessels. Instead, they now just
chase them away.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATOR QUESTIONS LEAKS OF NSC SECRET MEETINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker on Thursday called on the
National Security Council (NSC) to address the problem of serious
leaks within the organization.</P>
      <P>Su Huan-dji, an opposition Democratic Progressive Party
legislator, said that each of the five secret meetings between
high-ranking officials from Washington and Taipei had been leaked to
the media, including the contents of one meeting.</P>
      <P>He urged the chairman of the NSC, ROC President Lee Teng-hui, to
deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Meetings between high-ranking officials from Taipei and
Washington have been held on an irregular basis since March 1996 when
the missile crisis erupted in the Taiwan Strait. It is the most
important "first track" channel of communication between Taipei and
Washington, Su said.</P>
      <P>The NSC talks have involved sensitive topics regarding
cross-strait matters and issues between Taipei and Washington, the
legislator said.</P>
      <P>Starting from October 1996, a double-tracked, high-level
dialogue, directed by the US national security adviser took place
between Washington and Beijing, as well as Washington and Taipei, Su
said.</P>
      <P>The dialogue between Washington and Beijing was conducted by the
US national security advisor and Liu Huaqiu, mainland's director of
the Office of Foreign Affairs under the State Council. The dialogue
between Washington and Taipei involved the US deputy national
security adviser and Ding Mou-shih, secretary-general of the NSC, who
was accompanied either by a vice minister of the Foreign Affairs
Ministry or Taipei's representative in the US, explained Su.</P>
      <P>In an effort to stave off interference from Beijing, Washington
demanded that Taipei keep the contents of the talks and its itinerary
a secret, Su said. This was why the meetings were held in a
low-profile manner and no official details were released to the
media.</P>
      <P>However, Su remarked, all five meetings between Taipei and
Washington were reported in the media. The first three meetings were
disclosed two months after the meetings were held, the fourth was
known three days later, and in the fifth meeting, details of the
discussions appeared in local papers prior to Ding's return.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker went on to say that only the itinerary was disclosed
in the first two trips while the contents of the dialogue were
revealed after the third meeting. The details of the fifth meeting
published in newspapers appeared as though they had been recorded
from the meeting.</P>
      <P>Su said the repeated leaks in the NSC talks may interrupt the
dialogue between Washington and Taipei or may result in Washington
downgrading the level of officials it sends to the talks. If this
were to happen, it would constitute a threat to Taiwan's security, he
added.</P>
      <P>The legislator said as NSC chairman, Lee should order a thorough
investigation into the matter since the NSC has not done anything
prior to or following the leaks to prevent a similar recurrence.</P>
      <P>The director of the National Security Bureau should also
make a report to the legislature on the investigation of the matter,
added the DPP lawmaker.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin may
pressure Japan to explicitly exclude Taiwan from the geographic
areas covered by the US-Japan defense cooperation pact during his
forthcoming visit to Tokyo, a senior official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, issued
the warning in a special report on its working programs delivered at
a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>"In addition to pushing Japan to throw support behind the
so-called 'three noes' toward Taiwan, Jiang is also likely to force
Japan to promise not to abide by its defense cooperation guidelines
with the United States for any Taiwan-related incidents, " Chang
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that 1997 was a banner year for mainland China's
bid to upgrade its international reputation and status, Chang said
Beijing's all-out diplomatic offensive has borne fruit.</P>
      <P>Chang cautioned that the triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing and
Washington-Tokyo-Beijing relations have both shown signs of
leaning toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that US President Bill Clinton's
recent "three noes" statement has had negative effect on Taiwan. "We
must heighten alert on whether Clinton's statement will result in a
domino effect on Taiwan's bid to expand international space."</P>
      <P>The "three noes" refer to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for "two Chinas or one China, one Taiwan," and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international bodies in which statehood
is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Chang said mainland China attaches great importance to relations
with the United States. "It intends to use its close ties with the
United States to impose further pressure on Taiwan," the chief
mainland policy planner warned, adding that Beijing will certainly
use Clinton's explicit endorsement on the "three noes" to further
squeeze Taiwan's international space and block its presence in
international community.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) on Thursday suspended three China Airlines (CAL) flight crew
following a meeting to review aviation safety held in the wake of a
recent incident involving a CAL cargo jet.</P>
      <P>The CAA also instructed the country's former flag-carrier to make
improvements to flight safety within a stipulated period or risk
losing some or all of its flight concessions, a CAA official said.</P>
      <P>The punitive measures were issued in response to an incident on
June 27, when a CAL-owned Boeing 747-200F all-cargo aircraft found
itself short of fuel and made an unapproved landing at Abu Dhabi
airport in the United Arab Emirates.</P>
      <P>The plane departed Taiwan for Amsterdam on June 27. However, on
its first stopover in Thailand, it suffered a mechanical failure.</P>
      <P>The repair procedure burned more fuel than expected, but the
plane's flight crew did not follow aviation regulations and request
refueling, CAA Deputy Director General Chang Kuo-cheng told reporters
after the meeting.</P>
      <P>The mishaps continued when the aircraft was unable to fly at its
expected altitude due to heavy air traffic en route to Abu Dhabi, the
capital of the United Arab Emirates. This meant that the fully loaded
plane was forced to take an alternative route, which consumed even
more fuel, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Desperately short of fuel, the plane ran into yet more problems
when it was denied permission to land at Abu Dhabi due to bad
weather. The plane then made for a nearby reserve airport but this
facility had also been closed because of the weather.</P>
      <P>Now running on fumes, and with no other recourse, the plane
returned to Abu Dhabi airport, where it made an unauthorized landing.
No damage or casualties were reported.</P>
      <P>The incident was caused by "a series of mistakes," which left the
plane with nowhere to go, said Chang, stressing that his bureau is
further investigating the case.</P>
      <P>The pilot of the plane was suspended from flight duties for four
months, while his co-pilot was suspended for two months and the
flight engineer was grounded for one month, according to the CAA.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yiu-ching, CAL's deputy chief of aviation security, said that
in light of the incident, the company has reviewed its accounting
methods for reserve fuel, and has also reevaluated regulations for
selecting standby airports.</P>
      <P>He also said that all CAL flight crew will be required to
undertake more training on abnormal flying conditions.</P>

said.</P>
      <P>The schedule for implementing AFTA is 2003 within the six core
ASEAN nations of Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines,

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER DENIES REPORT OF SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Cheng Chun-mo on Thursday
denied a news report that the Investigation Bureau under his ministry
is carrying out surveillance of the activities of targeted figures.</P>
      <P>The Journalist weekly magazine reported in its latest issue that
the bureau decided on Feb. 13 to monitor certain local people
traveling to mainland China for investment, tourism and cultural
exchange purposes.</P>
      <P>Arms and drugs smugglers, gangsters, and even entertainers and
publishing tycoons who have close connections with the mainland are
also being targeted by the operation, the report said.</P>
      <P>The Investigation Bureau absolutely has not put specified
figures under surveillance as has been alleged, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>But for the sake of national security and the national interest,
as well as social stability, the bureau is only seeking to ensure
that persons who have links with the mainland are not endangering
national security, he said.</P>
      <P>"The `white terror' of past decades, during which certain figures
were monitored and even suppressed, is long over, as a result of the
island's successful democratization," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The rights and freedom of every citizen are protected under the
Constitution, Chen said, adding that the nation's security is the
responsibility of everyone in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, one of the priority tasks of the bureau is to
prevent the infiltration of mainland Chinese spies onto the island,
Cheng added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF HIGH SPEED RAILWAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday issued a
series of instructions after hearing a report at the Executive Yuan
on the new high speed rail system project by Minister of
Transportation and Communications Lin Feng-chen.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed the vital importance that construction of
the new railway should be a resounding success, with no room for
failure or error.</P>
      <P>He requested the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) to coordinate fully to carry out the project. He pointed out
that the private sector has invested some NT$100 billion, and that
the government has also earmarked a large amount of money for the
project, the largest since the Ten Major Construction Projects of the
1970s.</P>
      <P>During the worldwide recession of 1973-74, these projects
stimulated other undertakings, provided a large number of jobs, and
mitigated the severity of the economic slump.</P>
      <P>Wu Jung-ming, deputy governor of the Taiwan Provincial
Government, pointed out at the meeting that only a few plots of land
along the route of the railway still need to be purchased pending
agreement from the Construction &amp; Planning Administration under the
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Siew also asked Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development, to set up an ad hoc
group without delay to help coordinate with related government
agencies. He also instructed Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen to help
solve various related problems immediately.</P>
      <P>He stressed again the importance of the new railway, and added
that officials who fail to "fit in" with the project should be
transferred.</P>
      <P>The premier also exhorted the MOTC's Engineering Office of
Highspeed Rail to do its best on the project, or risk being
abrogated.</P>

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A marine police officer allegedly involved
in the recently exposed police exam scam shot himself dead on
Thursday, police said.</P>
      <P>Lee San-ming, 27, a marine police chief stationed in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung, was supposed to have met with a prosecutor in
northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County that day for a talk aimed at
clearing his role in the rapidly snowballing scandal.</P>
      <P>The incident occurred in the early hours of the morning, when Lee
was supervising a patrol detail. He asked one of the duty officers to
hand him his gun for checking, and then used it to shoot himself
between the eyes.</P>
      <P>Lee was rushed to a nearby military hospital for treatment, but
died later the same day.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Huang Mo-hsin confirmed that Lee was among the police
officers who allegedly acted as a broker in the scam involving the
entrance exams held by the Central Police University.</P>
      <P>The scandal emerged last week when the results of the exam for
the two-year university course were found to have been altered. Kuo
Chen-yuan, former acting director of the university's computer
department, has admitted that he committed the crime in exchange for
bribes from a number of examinees. The bribes were paid through
brokers, or so-called "white gloves."</P>
      <P>An investigation into the scandal has shown that 47 examinees
paid between NT$800,000 and NT$1.5 million for higher scores in the
exam, which was open only to incumbent police officers who were
graduates of the junior police college.</P>
      <P>In addition, at least 12 other people were believed to have acted
as Kuo's brokers, most of whom were police officers or students at
the university.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the National Police Administration announced that 52
police officers implicated in the scandal have each been given two
major demerits and discharged from the service. Forty-three of them
were bribe-paying examinees, while the other nine were brokers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH  TO CUT RISK OF CONTRACTING HIV THROUGH BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will discuss
on Friday ways to cut the risk of contracting AIDS-causing HIV
through transfusions of contaminated blood.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-hsiung, acting director of Communicable Disease Control
under the DOH, noted on Thursday that of the 1,750 AIDS cases traced
by the DOH so far, 95 percent can be linked to high-risk sexual
behavior.</P>
      <P>Although victims who contracted the deadly disease through blood
transfusions account for only 0.3 percent of the total, the DOH is
still determined to cut this risk through more rigorous methods of
screening donated blood.</P>
      <P>He said that the DOH will invite experts, blood donation center
officials, and AIDS advisory council officials to discuss the problem
at Friday's meeting.</P>
      <P>The discussion will focus on a stipulation which puts a one year
waiting period on donations from people who indulge in high-risk
sexual behavior, who have had a venereal disease, or who are inmates
of a penitentiary. The meeting will be seeking to have the period
increased to two years.</P>
      <P>It will also seek prosecution of blood donors who are found to
have circumvented the waiting period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DOH urged travelers to Southeast Asia to refrain
from high-risk sexual behavior such as visiting prostitutes.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that of the 5.8 million AIDS victims recorded in the
world last year, 1.3 million were from Southeast Asia. This was the
second-highest concentration of victims in a single region, behind
only Africa.</P>
      <P>Most of Southeast Asia's AIDS cases are the result of high-risk
sexual behavior, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui was urged at a
public hearing on Thursday to express his concern over the ethnic
Chinese women who were raped during the May rioting in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The public hearing on "riots and rapes against ethnic Chinese in
Indonesia," jointly sponsored by Taipei Legislator Chien Ta of the
opposition New Party, and National Assembly member Tang Sao-cheng,
was held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tang noted that many ethnic Chinese have suffered in the
anti-Chinese incidents which have drawn anger from Chinese around the
world. He urged the government to pay attention to the severe
humanitarian problem and to take effective measures to cope with it.</P>
      <P>Ou Chi-lung, a professor from National Chengchi University, said
many overseas Chinese have expressed the hope that the leader of the
Republic of China will stand up and say a few words. He added that it
is not necessary for the president to condemn Indonesia, so long as
he expresses concern for the victims.</P>
      <P>He said many Chinese abroad have described Beijing as "incapable"
and Taipei as "helpless" in their governments' reactions to the
allegations of mass rapes of ethnic Chinese women and girls by
Indonesian rioters.</P>
      <P>The tearful scholar, himself an overseas Chinese from Indonesia,
suggested that the celebrations for the ROC's Double Ten National Day
in Indonesia should be called off as a form of ROC protest. He also
suggested that the government should send religious groups to
Indonesia and that it should communicate with Indonesia's leadership.</P>
      <P>Yu Teh-sheng, an official from the East Asian &amp; Pacific Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noted that the
government has taken various measures to address the situation. He
said the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in Jakarta has done its
best to deal with the problem, and should be commended.</P>
      <P>Yu said the government is very concerned over the victims, and
stressed that the MOFA will provide assistance to ethnic Chinese rape
victims who wish to seek medical care.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday called on
mainland China to face the reality that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait are ruled by separate political identities.</P>
      <P>Siew said in a Cabinet meeting that Taipei and Beijing should
conduct cross-strait dialogue and consultation on the basis of mutual
respect and mutual benefit.</P>
      <P>He also expressed his anger at Beijing's attempts to dwarf the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and block the Republic of China's
efforts to seek a greater international presence.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that although the kidnap-murder of Kaohsiung
councilor Lin Ti-chuan aroused great concern in Taiwan, the mainland
authorities denied entry to the SEF officials who wanted to accompany
Lin's family to the mainland. This signals that the mainland does not
intend to allow the SEF to exercise its function as a cross-strait
intermediary body, Siew said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that even though the mainland authorities have never
given up their attempts to isolate Taiwan in the international
community, the ROC will make ever-greater efforts to fight for its
existence.</P>
      <P>Siew also announced that the government will hold a national
meeting on mainland policy on Nov. 2, when officials from government
agencies will discuss the course of mainland policy in the wake of

      <P>Taiwan's projected economic growth for 1998
will be adjusted downward to 5.5 percent by the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) at a meeting scheduled for
Friday.</P>
      <P>In a report released in May, the DGBAS predicted that the
country's economy will grow by 6.02 percent. At that time, the
economic growth for the first quarter was 5.92 percent, while
economic growth projections for the second, third and fourth quarters
this year stood at 5.78 percent, 6.16 and 6.18 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>However, continuing fallout from the Asian financial crisis has
meant the economic growth forecasts for the three quarters have had
to be adjusted downward, with fourth quarter growth expected to be
the worst-hit, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>It also said that economic growth for next year has been
predicted to reach 6.3 percent because of an Executive Yuan-planned
"expanding domestic demand package."</P>

on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, authorities said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Rodolfo Miguel, Ariel Broas, Esmeraldo Esteban and Juanito Ilagan

stowaways overboard to their deaths in March 1996. The sailors
immediately applied for refugee status in Canada once the ship landed

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS TO TAIWAN RISE, SEEN FALLING ELSEWHERE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's exports to Taiwan continue to
grow while its sales to other major markets are expected to fall in
the second half of the year, the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade (DFAT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA, the DFAT said Australia's
exports to Taiwan in June 1998 rose about 10 percent from the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is the only regional export destination which, in
smoothed terms, has not showed a noticeable fall at any time during
the regional economic crisis," it said.</P>
      <P>Between January and June this year, Australia's total exports
reached A$43.13 billion (US$29.74 billion), up from A$40.19 billion
(US$29.33 billion) in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>However, a DFAT spokesperson said exports are expected to fall in
the second half of this year as the full effect of the Asian crisis
reaches Australia.</P>
      <P>Official statistics indicate that between July 1997 and June
1998, Australia's exports to 11 East Asian countries, including
Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, China, and South Korea, rose about 5.5
percent to A$47.2 billion (US$34.45 billion) thanks to an increase
in sales from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Australian exports to South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand
and the Philippines fell from 5 percent to 18 percent during the same
period.</P>
      <P>Australian exports to Taiwan in fiscal 1997-98 jumped 15 percent
to A$4.18 billion (US$3.05 billion) from 1996-97. Exports to mainland
China rose 8 percent to A$3.87 billion (US$2.82 billion) and to Hong
Kong were up 33 percent to A$4.14 billion (US$3.02 billion) during
the same period.</P>
      <P>Trade officials said Australian exports to China already plunged
11 percent in June this year and the figure is expected to further
drop in coming months partly because of the deepening crisis in Asia.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the Sydney Morning Herald's
correspondent David Lague on Friday reported Australian shipments of
key commodities, including wool, wheat and sugar to China plunged
sharply.</P>
      <P>It said contrary to earlier expectations, China's imports have
shown signs of falling and the outlook for Australian exports to the
mainland may be worse in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a Hong Kong-based trade analyst as saying,
"China is a lot weaker underneath than it appears to be. The
blood bath is upon us; it is not out there in the future."</P>
      <P>The Canberra-based Access Economics, an institution engaged in
economic forecasting, warned that Australia faced its worst trade
outlook in decades and risks sliding into recession in 1999 if the
Asian crisis continued.</P>
      <P>"Asia may cut Australian activity to a crawl by the first half of
1999. With Japan sagging and China not far behind, our major trading
partners are going from bad to worse," said an Access Economics
analyst.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Canberra said
two-way trade between Australia and Taiwan would remain steady in the
second half of 1998 despite a decline of Australian exports in other
Asian markets.</P>
      <P>"We believe our trade with Australia will remain steady in the
rest of this year," Henry Yang, director of the TECO's economic
division, said in an interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>Australia mainly exports coal, iron ore, crude oil, liquefied
natural gas, gold, metals, seafood and agricultural produce to
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A Taipei City councilor on Friday asked the
government to ban a television program which she said openly promotes
sex tourism under the guise of finding brides in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-mei said in a news conference that the program, aired by
a local television station in the early hours on weekdays, has lured
Taiwan men to the mainland in search of sex.</P>
      <P>She said the Congress Satellite TV Co. features live coverage of
the Legislative Yuan's sessions during the day and rents the
remainder of its air time to other companies which provide
programming.</P>
      <P>A clip of the program in question showed a man introducing a host
of young mainland Chinese women, and inviting Taiwan men to go to the
mainland to meet their "prospective brides."</P>
      <P>Those who choose to participate are asked to pay NT$50,000
(US$1,437) and are given their choice of companion for a 10-day trip.
If they want to marry their companion, they are asked to pay an
additional NT$300,000 (US$8,620).</P>
      <P>Chen said after she investigated the program, she found that the
group of Taiwan men invited to the mainland was not confined to
single men.</P>
      <P>She said the news media which openly organizes such groups run
counter to social decency and contributed to family disputes.</P>
      <P>The councilor asked the government to immediately ban the
television program and launch its own investigation into the matter.</P>
      <P>Telephone calls to the producer of the program for comment
received no response.</P>

      <P>A locally built 500-ton-class naval
patrol vessel was christened and launched on Friday at the state-run
China Shipbuilding Corp.'s (CSBC) shipyard in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Navy Deputy Commander-in-Chief Yeh Shih-wen personally presided
over the christening and launching ceremony for the new CSBC-built
coastal patrol ship.</P>
      <P>The ship, christened the Hsin-chiang (New River), was the second
Chin-chiang-class offshore patrol vessel built under the ROC Navy's
Kuanghua No. 3 warship building program.</P>
      <P>The Hsin-chiang will undergo a series of navigation tests and
weaponry installation following its launch, naval officials said,
adding that the Navy will take delivery of the ship only after it
ascertains that the craft's quality and overall equipment meet its
requirements.</P>
      <P>The officials said the Chin-chiang-class patrol boat possesses
high mobility and requires neither a large crew nor large maintenance
costs.</P>
      <P>Construction on the Hsin-chiang started last September and is
scheduled to be completed by early next year. The ship will be
responsible for offshore surveillance and regional patrol after it is
commissioned into service, the officials said.</P>
      <P>During wartime, the officials, said the ship can be armed with
additional weaponry systems and coordinate with mainstream warships
in conducting interception and anti-landing operations.</P>
      <P>Under the Kuanghua No. 3 program, the Navy has plans to
commission the CSBC to build a total of 11 offshore patrol ships
patterned after the locally-designed, 500-ton-class Chin-chiang
vessel, which was commissioned on Dec. 1, 1994.</P>
      <P>The first of the program's 11 Chin-chiang-class patrol vessels,
christened the Tan-chiang, was launched in June and is scheduled to
be delivered late this year.</P>
      <P>Construction on four other Chin-chiang-class coastal patrol boats
are also under way. All of the 11 ships are scheduled to be completed
by May 2000.</P>
      <P>The Kuanghua No. 3 project is part of the Navy's ambitious
warship modernization plan aimed at beefing up Taiwan's naval defense
capabilities and safeguarding the waters surrounding the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT READJUSTS GROWTH DOWNWARD TO 5.5 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's projected economic growth rate
this year is expected to be sizably readjusted downward to 5.5
percent in a Cabinet meeting Friday afternoon, according to sources
from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS).</P>
      <P>In its economic forecast in May, the DGBAS predicted that the
country's economy would grow by 6.02 percent for 1998. At that time,
the economic growth in the first quarter was 5.92 percent, while
growth projections for the second, third and fourth quarters this
year stood at 5.78 percent, 6.16 percent and 6.18 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The new figure was a practical readjustment as a result of the
continued decline in Taiwan's foreign trade, which has been a prime
mover in the island's economic growth, said DGBAS officials.</P>
      <P>Bearing the full brunt of the Asian economic turmoil, Taiwan's
foreign trade has declined drastically in the first seven months of
this year with exports totaling US$63.4 billion and imports at
US$61.1 billion, down 8.6 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, from
the year-earlier levels.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu said even if the economic growth were
readjusted downward to below 5.5 percent this year, Taiwan's overall
economic performance is not bad compared to other countries and areas
in the world. The 5.5 percent growth would be the second highest in
Asia behind only that of mainland China, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DGBAS announced a "domestic demand expansion
package" as a prime-pumping measure to stimulate growth.</P>
      <P>Under the package, the value of newly-initiated public investment
projects total a gigantic NT$39.7 billion (US$1.16 billion), which is
expected to contribute to the country's overall economic growth by
0.5 percent this year helping shore up the annual growth figure to
5.5 percent or even higher, DGBAS officials noted.</P>
      <P>They also predicted that Taiwan's economic growth will top 6.2
percent next year, as a result of continuing expansion of domestic
investment, including major public construction projects.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chung-hua Institute for Economic Research on
Friday cut back their 1998 annual growth figures from the previously
projected 5.95 percent to 5.24 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN PM INTRODUCES NEW TAX PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard
has introduced a new tax package which includes a goods and services
tax (GST).</P>
      <P>With the introduction of a GST, Howard has promised to compensate
Australians with tax cuts as they pay 10 percent or more in tax for
almost everything they buy, including houses.</P>
      <P>Howard's new GST package proposes a A$32 billion (US$20 billion)
switch from wholesale and state taxes. It would also revolutionize
key business and investment taxes.</P>
      <P>The GST would cover most goods and services, including food, but
exclude health, education, child care, nursing homes and local
government rates, according to officials of the Federal Treasury.</P>
      <P>The new GST will be implemented on July 1, 2000 but some of the
state taxes slated for removal will not come off until 2001 and the
transitional period to the new system effectively starts in mid-1999.</P>
      <P>Under the tax reform, the government will reduce the company tax
rate to 30 percent from the current 36 percent. The thrust of the tax
package favors lower- and middle-income taxpayers.</P>
      <P>Howard has described the new GST package as a "visionary taxation
reform." But Opposition Leader Kim Beazley dubbed it "unfair"</P>

    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  August 13 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Massive flooding in mainland China
continues as torrential rains are threatening the country's
northeastern region and flood waters continue to rise.</P>
      <P>Henry Chu, the Los Angeles Times' staff writer stationed in
Beijing wrote that as central mainland continues to battle the worst
inundation by the Yangtze River since 1954, the province of
Heilongjiang on the Sino-Russian border was awash Wednesday in water
from the swollen Nen River.</P>
      <P>Fed by huge downpours over the last several days, the Nen and its
tributaries burst their banks, overflowing "one after another" in the
worst season of flooding on record in the area, the People's Daily
reported.</P>
      <P>There has been no word on how many have perished in the deluge.
The official overall death toll from the floods is at about 2,000,
but many believe the figure is much higher. Relief workers now fear
outbreaks of cholera and other waterborne diseases may claim many
more.</P>
      <P>Millions of people have been left homeless, mostly along the
Yangtze in the central and eastern regions, as soldiers and civilians
work around the clock shoring up saturated dikes in danger of
collapsing. In all, the government estimates that 240 million people
have been effected by the flooding -- nearly the equivalent of the
entire US population.</P>
      <P>The floods, a perennial problem in mainland China, have caused
more than US$4 billion in damage so far this year, leading some
economists to forecast that mainland China's annual growth rate could
drop by as much as a percentage point when the final toll is tallied.
Factories as well as farms have been inundated.</P>
      <P>"The worst flooding in four decades is having a considerable
negative influence on the industrial sector," an economist told the
state-run China Daily in its Wednesday edition. Industrial output
should have exceeded 8 percent in the first half of 1998 but had only
reached 7.8 percent, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTHER APPEALS FOR HELP TO SAVE HER MAINLAND-IMPRISONED SON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  eastern  Taiwan,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mother of an Ilan
resident convicted of spying and serving a 20-year prison term in
mainland China on Friday appealed for government help to save her
son.</P>
      <P>The distraught mother said her 29-year-old son Lin Yi-lin left
Ilan for mainland China four years ago to study dentistry in Fuzhou,
in the southern mainland Chinese province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>However, Lin was taken away by public security authorities on
just his second day in Fuzhou. Without any explanation or public
trial, he was sentenced to a 20-year prison term on charges of
spying, and ceased all contact with his family in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin's family did not hear from him until two years later in 1996,
when they were informed that he had been arrested and was in jail in
Fujian Province. Lin's father, then 75 years old, flew to Fuzhou to
visit him, when he discovered that his son had been unjustly
imprisoned.</P>
      <P>Lin has been married for 10 years and has two sons, his mother
said, but went on to add that his wife became a stranger to the
family after he vanished, leaving the two children in the custody of
their grandparents.</P>
      <P>Distressed over the broken home, the mother contacted the Straits
Exchange Foundation for help, but has heard nothing from the
quasi-official intermediary agency charged with handling cross-strait
affairs in the absence of official contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lin's father received a letter from Lin in June this year, saying
that he had been transferred to a reform camp in Putien, Fujian, and
asking for a regular allowance to be sent from Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday that
the Republic of China would like to share its development experience

      <P>Siew made the remarks when he received a delegation from the
Philippines comprising Secretary of the Department of Finance Edgardo

      <P>ROC officials said that the financial officials are seeking to
woo more Taiwan investment in the Philippines, while the agricultural
officials want to learn about Taiwan's agricultural development.</P>
      <P>The premier told the delegation that the ROC attaches great
importance to its relations with the Philippines. Geographically
close, the two nations also share the same values of democracy,
freedom, and respect for human rights, he said, adding that the two
nations should step up bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Philippine delegation said their country could learn a lot

agriculture.</P>
      <P>Espiritu earlier called on his ROC counterpart Paul Chiu, to

      <P>He expressed the hope that the ROC will invest in his country and
that Taiwan's banking and insurance sectors will set up more branches
in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Noting that six Taiwan banks have so far set up branches in the
Philippines, Chiu said that the ROC Ministry of Finance has to screen
all Taiwan banks and insurance companies wishing to set up branches

      <P>The screening process depends heavily on the Philippine economic
situation and on the operations of the banks or insurance companies

      <P>The Australian government on Friday
launched the first stage of an anti-racism campaign -- the "Living in
Harmony" initiative -- to fight the racist One Nation party.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to CNA, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock
said: "Living in Harmony is designed to build upon the cohesiveness
of Australian society and make it clear that there is no place for
racism in Australia."</P>
      <P>"It is the values we all share that bring us together -- those
traditional Australian values of fairness, equality and justice --
and they strengthen our ability to resist those who want to divide us
on racial or cultural grounds," he said.</P>
      <P>One Nation and its leader, Pauline Hanson, are known for their
anti-Asian, anti-foreign investment, anti-Aboriginal, and
anti-multiculturalism stances. They advocate one flag, one language,
one culture and one (white) society.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing the social and economic benefits of diversity,
Ruddock reinforced the need for individuals and communities
throughout Australia to move beyond mere acceptance of cultural or
racial difference and towards encouraging active participation of all

      <P>"In the market research for this initiative, people indicated
very clearly their desire to focus on what makes us all Australians,

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL CONFERENCE TO OPEN FOR POLICE ADMINISTRATION REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's decaying police administration,
highlighted by a recent exam-fixing scandal and three police deaths,
prompted Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen on Friday to call a national
conference to discuss reforms in police affairs.</P>
      <P>Huang stated that the conference will be aimed at making a
comprehensive review of personnel affairs, educational training, and
the system for police retirement and compensation.</P>
      <P>Grass-roots policemen, retired police officers, and scholars and
experts in police affairs, will be invited to take part in the
conference slated to take place some time between late August and
early September, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Although he described the police examination scandal, the two
police suicides and the murder of a police officer, as "merely
isolated cases," Huang pointed out that they have lowered the morale
of the entire police force.</P>
      <P>The minister paid his respects to grassroots police officers,
describing them as anti-crime heroes. He encouraged those allegedly
involved in the recent scam to face justice, and urged them to
treasure and respect their own lives and those of others.</P>
      <P>Huang's statement came in the wake of reports that 32-year-old
policeman Huang Chen-jung, who served in a public security police
squad stationed in Tainan County, shot his squad leader dead before
turning his gun on himself on Thursday night.</P>
      <P>Squad leader Wung Shui-shang died at the scene of the incident,
while Huang passed away after receiving urgent medical treatment,
according to police.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation revealed that the two had allegedly
quarreled over a performance evaluation, resulting in Huang shooting
his supervisor in the head and chest.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the tragic incident, the first case in Taiwan of
a policeman shooting a colleague to death, Ting Yuan-chin,
director-general of the National Police Administration (NPA),
expressed "extreme sadness."</P>
      <P>That same day, a marine police officer stationed in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung shot himself dead. Lee San-ming, 27, was
supposed to have met with a prosecutor that day for a talk aimed at
clearing his role in the recent police examination scam.</P>
      <P>The scandal exploded in the media last week when the results of
the exam for the two-year university course were found to have been
altered. Kuo Chen-yuan, former acting director of the university's
computer department, has admitted committing the crime in exchange
for bribes.</P>
      <P>At least a dozen other people are believed to have acted as Kuo's
brokers, introducing examinees to the bribery scam. Most of these
so-called "white gloves" were police officers or students at the
university.</P>
      <P>The NPA announced on Thursday that 52 police officers implicated
in the scandal have been given two major demerits and discharged from
the service. Forty-three of them were bribe-paying examinees, while
the other nine were brokers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with the number of policemen committing suicide twice
the number of police officers dying in the line of duty, Huang
Fu-yuan, director of the crime prevention department of the Central
Police University, suggested on Friday that every examinee of the
university and other police schools should receive psychological
testing before taking entry examinations.</P>
      <P>Training courses aimed at teaching police freshmen ways to ease
stress should be given in schools, the scholar suggested. Huang also
recommended police institutions to provide vacations to police
officers suffering from heavy stress, and to offer comprehensive
counseling services.</P>
      <P>According to NPA statistics, 92 policemen have committed suicide
since 1986, six of them during the first eight months of this year
alone. Five of the six served at the grassroots level.</P>
      <P>Failed love affairs, family disputes, debts, and criminal
involvement were the causes of the six latest deaths, according to
the NPA educational department.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIV-INFECTED FOREIGN BRIDES ON THE RISE: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of HIV-infected foreign brides
has increased significantly, with brides from Thailand accounting for
the lion's share, the Department of Health (DOH) warned on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level agency issued the warning amid an ever-rising
fad among local men for marrying foreign women, particularly those
from Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>According to DOH tallies, 21 foreign brides have tested HIV
positive, including one from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The same statistics further show that five of these HIV-infected
foreign brides have transmitted the deadly AIDS-causing virus to
their husbands. The figure accounts for nearly 10 percent of the 55
local cases involving HIV transmission between spouses.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the number of confirmed cases of HIV infection
involving foreign brides has grown rapidly in recent years. In 1995,
only one such case was reported. The number increased to five each in
1996 and 1997, and stands at 10 so far this year.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable
Disease Control, said Southeast and South Asian countries,
particularly Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and India, are high-risk
areas for HIV infection.</P>
      <P>"Local people should not engage in high-risk sexual behavior when
making trips to Southeast Asian countries if they want to avoid HIV
infection," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>There are currently 5.8 million AIDS patients around the world,
1.3 million of whom are in Southeast Asia, the second-highest
concentration of cases in a single region behind only parts of
Africa, according to statistics released by the World Health
Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Hsu quoted WHO as warning that the number of AIDS patients in
Southeast Asia may soon surpass those in Africa.</P>
      <P>The senior official further pointed out that 72 percent of
Thailand's prostitutes are HIV carriers, and that the ratio is even
higher in popular Thai tourist destinations, including Chiang Mai.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the percentage of HIV-infected prostitutes in other
Southeast Asian countries may not necessarily be lower than that in
Thailand. "If the figures for other Southeast Asian countries are
lower, it may simply be because they are not as active as Thailand in
tracking HIV cases," he added.</P>
      <P>According to DOH statistics, Taiwan has so far recorded 1,925
confirmed HIV carriers, of whom 1,720 are ROC nationals. Among these,
609 have developed full-blown AIDS and 413 have already died. DOH
tallies further show that male homosexuals and bisexuals form the
bulk of local HIV carriers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OYSTER FARMERS PROTEST AGAINST SMUGGLED SHELLFISH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Oyster farmers from southern Taiwan
demonstrated in Taipei on Friday, demanding that the government put a
stop to oyster smuggling from mainland China and prohibit the
importation of mainland oysters via a third country or area.</P>
      <P>The recent heatwave has caused massive oyster die-offs in Taiwan,
triggering rampant smuggling of the popular shellfish from mainland
China.</P>
      <P>About 300 oyster farmers from the Chiayi area demonstrated in
front of the Council of Agriculture (COA), complaining that local
producers are losing money because of the huge amount of mainland
contraband in local markets.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Fisheries Administration of the COA pointed
out that oyster production along the coast of Taiwan has decreased by
about 30 percent to 40 percent, while the market price has risen this
year to NT$150 per kilogram from NT$70-NT$80 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>The shortfall in supply, plus the higher selling price, has made
smuggling from the mainland more profitable and attractive, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The director of the Fisheries Administration, Hu Hsin-hua, and
James Sha, director of the Taiwan Fisheries Bureau under the Taiwan
Provincial Government, met with the protesters.</P>
      <P>The two top-level fisheries officials remarked that the
government is concerned about the drop in Taiwan's oyster production
resulting from the unusually warm weather brought by the El Nino
phenomenon.</P>
      <P>With regard to the smuggling problem, Hu and Sha promised to
coordinate with the marine police to ensure that more of the
smugglers are arrested.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA also indicated that the council is willing
to assist oyster farmers in building up domestic product awareness to
raise competitiveness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'THREE NOES' IS ONLY A SMALL PART OF US POLICY: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A diplomatic official said here Friday that
the 'three noes' is only a small part of United States policy toward
Taiwan, and that he hoped leaders of other countries would not allow
it to obscure their view of US police toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Bill Clinton said at an informal setting in Shanghai
during his last visit to mainland China on June 25-July 3 that the
US doesn't support "independence for Taiwan", "Two Chinas or one
China, one Taiwan", and Taiwan's bid to join "international
organizations for which statehood is a requirement." This US
position is often referred to as the "three noes" policy.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-shun, director of the North American Affairs Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pointed out at a regular press
conference that the US government has reiterated many times just
before and after Clinton's visit to the mainland that its
guarantees to and policy toward Taiwan have not changed, that the
Taiwan Relations Act will be properly carried out, and that disputes
between Taiwan and the mainland should be resolved by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>During this period, the US Congress adopted four resolutions,
expressing strong support for Taiwan. The resolutions urged Beijing
to renounce the use of force and the threat of using force against
Taiwan, and supported Taiwan's bid to join such world organizations
as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The executive
branch of the US government welcomes the resolutions of Congress.</P>
      <P>Shen said that the US goodwill and support for Taiwan is a
"clear fact," and that the "three noes" constitutes only a small part
of US policy toward Taiwan. Beijing has misunderstood it, and has
tried to cause some other nations to misunderstand it, he added.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that those countries which might mention
their "three noes" in public settings at the behest of communist China
will watch the whole picture of US policy toward Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The current economic crisis is a
blessing, because Hong Kong needed a wake-up call, Hong Kong's Chief
Secretary Anson Chan said in Singapore on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The community had been lulled into a false sense of complacency
following 10 to 15 years of sustained economic growth, she noted.</P>
      <P>"But as we know, economies work in cycles, and what goes up has
to come down, as it is doing now," she said in an interview with The

      <P>The crisis will lessen Hong Kongers' reliance on the government,
and will encourage them to look more to their own resources and
abilities, she said.</P>
      <P>Chan, who arrived in Singapore that day for a three-day visit,
said that once Asia overcomes its current turmoil, Hong Kong will be

      <P>The consultancy said Taiwan's gross domestic product will grow by
a healthy 5 percent this year and 4 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Despite the effects of the current economic crisis, Singapore is
still the world's second-most profitable place to invest in this
year, BERI said in its 120-page report which ranks profit
opportunities in 50 countries.</P>
      <P>However, Singapore will be a less attractive destination for
investors next year, it added. The report lowered Singapore's
profit-opportunity ranking in 1999 to third place behind Taiwan.</P>
      <P>BERI predicted that Singapore's gross domestic product will grow
by only 1 percent this year and there will be no growth next year.

      <P>The BERI report is published three times a year -- at the end of

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE  TO  ALLOW WIDER USE OF CURRENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore government announced on
Thursday that it will allow wider use of the Singapore dollar for
business transactions, but stressed that it will stick by its policy
of not internationalizing the currency.</P>
      <P>The measures will loosen some key rules that constrict
Singapore's development as an international financial hub, said
Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in a keynote speech
at the launch of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Electronic
Payment System.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is also MAS chairman, explained that Singapore's economy
and financial sector has outgrown the framework of regulations banks
must follow on the international use of the Singapore dollar. This
was last revised in 1992, before Singapore's regionalization drive.</P>
      <P>The new regulations, with clearer and more explicit provisions,
will minimize the need for banks to consult the MAS, he said.</P>
      <P>On Singapore dollar credit facilities for use outside Singapore,
he clarified that banks can extend local currency financing to
residents for overseas projects without consulting the MAS. "In
practice, this is already MAS policy, as MAS has publicly stated
several times," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee also elaborated on the need to develop broad capital markets
to attract a broad range of international issuers, investors and
intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The new notice will make it easier for foreign companies to list
Singapore dollar-denominated shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Until now, only those with at least 35 percent of their revenues,
profits, or expenses attributable to Singapore could have such a
listing, but this will now be reduced to 20 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNA INTERVIEW WITH DARRYL JOHNSON, DIRECTOR OF AIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: President Clinton was critized in Congress after he made the
"three noes" statement. But on the other hand, he was the first
American president to mention the Taiwan Relations Act in mainland
China. How significant is his TRA reference?</P>
      <P>Johnson: I think both parts are important, because what President
Clinton did in the mainland was to reiterate the basis of US policy
towards the mainland and towards Taiwan. And when he was asked at
Beijing University a specific question about arms sales to Taiwan, he
also -- for the first time, I think, on PRC soil -- he reiterated the
basis for our continued arms sales; that is, we do not agree that it
is an obstacle to better cross-strait relations. We think it is an
essential part of helping to create a fair and balanced process. As
far as the "three noes," as you know, we have been saying ever since
late June that this did not represent any change in policy. It did
not -- all three elements have been on the record for a long time. In
fact, it did not represent any change in policy. The only thing that
was new was that it was the president personally who said it and --
you know maybe that's significant. Certainly, in terms of the
content, it was not significant. In term of the form, people attach
greater importance to it. But it didn't represent any change in
policy. That's important. He was -- the President was very
articulate, I think you would agree, in defending the ideas of
democracy and openness. He called for Jiang Zemin and for China
broadly to evolve in the direction of more openness and more
tolerance -- religious tolerance, polical tolerance and so forth. And
I think one could read in his words an endorsement of the kind of
change which has occurred in Taiwan, especially over the last 11
years.</P>
      <P>Q: When Mr. Richard Bush (AIT chairman) visited Taipei last
month, President Lee Teng-hui said the majority of Taiwanese people
feel that the US stance on cross-strait relations is unbalanced and
that this stance will certainly affect the cross-strait relations.
Was the US surprised by Taiwan's emotional response?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Interestinly enough, in the meetings with President Lee
and other senior leaders, the tone was very cordial when Dr. Bush was
here. The kinds of concerns that were expressed by the president and
by others really were more in terms of efforts to clarify or efforts
to understand the points which President Clinton had made and which
Dr. Bush and others had made subsequently. I think we are always
aware that there is high sensitivity in Taiwan to any improvement in
US-PRC relations. There are people here who believe that better
US-PRC relations must be disadvantageous, must be not beneficial for
Taiwan. In fact, our view and my personal view very strongly is: the
opposite is true -- that better US-PRC relations create an incentive
for Beijing to moderate its policy towards Taiwan and to improve the
conditions for better cross-strait relations. We hope that's the
case. I think we will see in the coming months whether both sides are
prepared to move forward. But, of course, it's up to them. We hope
that the better climate between Washington and Beijing will also lead
to better a climate between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Q: Judging from the murder of Lin Ti-chuan (a Democratic
Progressive Party councilor at the Kaohsiung City Council)
mainland China and the forthcoming Koo-Wang talks, do you think
that cross-strait relations have been affected by Clinton's visit to
Beijing?</P>
      <P>Johnson: In broad terms, no. In broad terms, I think that those
things have their own engine, if you like, their own momentum. Of
course, the Lin Ti-chuan case was a tragedy, there is no question, a
very tragic accident. And I think frankly that it certainly could
have been more wisely handled on both sides. It certainly did not
contribute to better understanding. And of course, her case is not
the only one involving threats or actual damage to people from Taiwan
doing business or visiting the mainland. So I think this is an
important area where closer cooperation would be in both sides'
interest. (MORE)</P>

      <P>Q: Did the AIT ask the Mainland Affairs Council to give it
information on the Lin Ti-chuan murder case?</P>
      <P>Johnson: I don't know, because I was not in that meeting. But we
talk to different government organizations all the time. And maybe
that was certainly a major issue over the past several days. But we
talk to the Lu-Wei-Hui (the Mainland Affairs council) and to the
others, to everybody involved on a frequent basis. We were
interested, for example, in the recent visit by the PRC minister of
science and technology. We were interested in the recent visit by Mr.
Li Ya-fei from the ARATS (Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait) and so forth. So, you know, part of our business is to be
informed. And we feel that in order to be informed, we need to talk
to the people responsible.</P>
      <P>Q: Taipei is concerned that Beijing is going to push Tokyo to
codify the "three noes" during Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan next
month. And some media reports also said that the Japanese prime
minister may throw verbal support behind the "three noes" in his
speech at a welcoming party. So do you think a so-called domino
effect has happened already in this region?</P>
      <P>Johnson: I think that everybody has to make their own decision as
far as policy (is concerned) and whether it's that subject or another
subject. I noticed in the newspaper today that the prime minister of
Japan was again quoted as endorsing the principle of peaceful
dialogue and peaceful resolution of disputes between Taiwan and the
mainland. I don't expect that there is going to be any important
change in Japan's approach to the Taiwan question. As for how they
choose to address it, that's basically their business, and they will
decide.</P>
      <P>Q: Taiwan has been trying to seek more international space. Do
you think that Taiwan's international space will be limited after
President Clinton made the "three noes" statement?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, no. I don't think so. In fact on the contrary, I
think that one of the most important developments, at least between
the US and Taiwan in recent months, was the signing of the WTO
agreement, which was officially signed last Friday (Aug. 7), although
the agreement in principle was reached in February. We very much
support the idea of Taiwan's participation in the WTO, which, of
course, is an organization which does not require statehood for
membership. It's a system which recognizes customs territories and in
some cases, economies -- similar to APEC. Taiwan's participation in
APEC as an Asian economy is entirely appropriate. And it was
substantially the result of American efforts to reach consensus among
the other Asian economies that permitted Taiwan to participate as a
full participant. So these are examples of organizations where we
think Taiwan's participation is appropriate. But, of course, those
are not organizations for which statehood is a requirement for
membership. So, we don't support Taiwan's efforts to rejoin the
United Nations or UN-related bodies.</P>
      <P>Q: And how about IMF and the World Bank?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, those of course are UN-related bodies although the
connection is a little distant. I think the real answer is in a way
to sort of get past the question of what constitutes an organization
that require statehood for membership. If there is a consensus of
existing members to permit Taiwan to participate, the US is not going
to oppose it. So you know that's the question. It's how to build
consensus, how to encourage other countries to support Taiwan's
participation in these organizations. To be quite candid, I think
that Taiwan's economy -- important because of its economic role in
the world as the world's 19th or 18th largest economy -- one can make
a case for its participation in a number of multilateral economic
organizations.</P>
      <P>Q: So you mean that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should build
consensus first, then the US will make its decision?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, the US isn't going to decide these things. These
will be decided by the -- you know, in most organizations the US is
one of many members. And if it's an organization that requires
consensus and the PRC is a member already, then obviously the PRC has
to be willing to participate in that consensus. That's a cross-strait
issue. On the question of a broader consensus and the US role role --
we play a role sometime, and we don't play a role other times. It
depends on the organization; it depends on the issue. (MORE)</P>

      <P>Q: Some US scholars, including Chas Freeman, have argued that
because of the aspiration for independence in certain parts of
Taiwan, military conflict in the Taiwan Strait seems more likely now
than in any time since 1979. What's your assessment?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Ambassador Freeman is a good friend. We've known each
other for many years. I think on this subject, his views are intended
to encourage peaceful processes in this region. But I think that
there is not -- well, I don't agree with the assessment. Let's put it
that way. I don't think that the danger of conflict in the Taiwan
Strait is greater than it has been since 1979. And in fact, on the
contrary, I would hope that the atmosphere will gradually improve.
And this is also one of the objectives -- one of President Clinton's
objectives -- and one of our broader objectives. But if I can take a
part of this question that you didn't ask but nonetheless I think is
relevant is: President Clinton reaffirmed in Beijing the basis for US
arms sales to Taiwan. And as you mentioned before, he also reiterated
our commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act as a part of our
principled position. These -- both parts of that -- of those
statements continue to be the guiding principles of our policy. We
will continue to sell arms of a defensive nature to Taiwan. We will
continue to abide by the commitments of the Taiwan Relations Act,
which are our law.</P>
      <P>Q: Our Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling said because of the
unbalanced military developments across the Taiwan Strait, there is
an urgent need for Taiwan to acquire sophisticated military equipment
and to upgrade its defense capability to ensure its security. And we
have heard that the US Congress will soon be notified by the Pentagon
about an arms sale to Taiwan. Do you know anything about that?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, first of all, it's not the Pentagon. It's the
State Department that notifies the Congress of the intention to sell
or -- I guess the technical term is that the Congress is provided a
notification in case they choose to disagree. They have a certain
period within which to act if they disagree with a proposed sale of
arms, not just to Taiwan, but to any place. So there is a procedure
whereby the administration, acting through the State Department,
notifies the Congress of its intention to go forward with an arms
sale. Yes, I assume that there will be some sales of arms soon,
because there always are. I mean every year there are a number of
items. And this will not change; it will go forward. As for which
particular items, I don't know which itmes are on the agenda right
now. I am familiar with the statement that the minister made, and of
course, we look carefully at any requests that Taiwan has made, as
far as its requirements for defensive weapons.</P>
      <P>Q: So you don't know what type of weapons are involved?</P>
      <P>Johnson: As regards the items that are presently in the queue, if
you like, or being in line to be notified, no, I don't remember which
items are on the agenda right now.</P>
      <P>Q: And how about the quantity and price?</P>
      <P>Johnson: It will depend on the item. There are different
quantities and different prices for different items. But the point is
that, as the president said in Beijing, we do intend to continue with
our arms sales policy to Taiwan.
 Q: And how soon will the notification be?</P>
      <P>Johnson: That is not up to us. It's a decision that's made in
Washington. But, you know, there are notifications every couple of
months. It sometimes depends on the congressional calendar; it
sometimes depends on when the reqeusts are examined, and you known
whether there are -- what kinds of alternatives, what kinds of
options there are. It's a thorough, long and thorough process. Often
from the time of the initial request until the final approval can be,
you know, a couple of years. So, it's not a speedy process. Each case
must be looked at on its own merits. (MORE)</P>

      <P>Q: Some media reports also have said that a deal between Taiwan
and the US to purchase anti-aircraft stinger missiles has been
postponed because of President Clinton's visit to Beijing. What's
your comment?</P>
      <P>Johnson: I don't think that's true. In fact, my recollection was
that that was reported in the newspapers here a year ago, because as
I recall, the notification on the Stinger Missiles and the Avenger,
which is a variation of the Stinger missile, was sent to the Congress
in September or August of last year, not long before President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Washington. I think that's right. I think that we
sent that up last year. So whatever has occurred since then would
simply be negotiations about the actual deliveries and other details.</P>

      <P>Johnson: Well, first of all, the word "appeasement" has a
particularly unpleasant ring because it refers usually to the
policies in Europe in the 1930s to try to accommodate Hitler and the
German Reich. To suggest that there is such an attitude or behavior
on the part of the US or other countries at the present time, I
think, is clearly out of line. As regards the decision on particular
items, there will always be a review of any specific request for
military goods. And it is the abiding interest of the US that the two
sides settle their differences by peaceful means, not by military
means. It is our objective not to contribute to an arms race in the
region. And, therefore, we look very carefully at Taiwan's requests
and at what we consider to be their legitimate defensive needs. I
think, though, that one would have to say if you look at the items
that have been provided to Taiwan over the last decade by the United
States, there has been no evidence of unwillingness or reluctance to
provide defensive weapons to Taiwan. F-16's are perhaps an obvious
example. A number have already been delivered and these will continue
to be delivered. Those are very modern, very sophisticated weapons.</P>
      <P>Q: Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling also asked for information
on the possible deployment of TMD (theater missile defense) on
Taiwan. Do you know when he may have gotten that information?</P>
      <P>Johnson: No, because we are nowhere close to making any kind of
decision even in the United States on whether to proceed with any
kind of TMD program -- theater missile defense program. It has been a
subject of a great debate ever since the idea was first proposed by
the Reagan administration, having to do both with its effectiveness
and its cost. And, of course, it's always related to arms control
issues as well. So far as I know, we are far, far from any decision,
from the US side, from our own standpoint in terms of going ahead
with a theater missile defense program. I can understand that Taiwan
will be interested in information about such a thing, but no such
program exists at the present time. So, it is, at minimum, premature,
and there certainly will not be any decision on that subject for some
considerable time to come.</P>
      <P>Q: Do you have anything you'd like to add on the subject of arms
sales?</P>
      <P>Johnson: I think the main point is that we continue to abide by
the Taiwan Relations Act, by the -- our assessment of Taiwan's needs,
that this is a strong program which we feel that our view and the
view of the Taiwan authorities are very much in harmony. We work very
closely with the Taiwan military. And we hope they are satisfied with
the kind of equipment which we have provided.</P>
      <P>Q: We know that you cannot confirm for us a recent trip to the
United States by Ding Mou-shih (secretary general of the National
Security Council). Can you tell us how would you define these kinds
of meetings between the US and Taiwanese officials? Do you call this
"track one" or "track two" communication?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, that's a good question. The way the second track,
track two, is usually used, is to refer to unofficial meetings
between people who have no specific official positions. In this case,
the participants in these meetings do have official positions. So, in
that sense, it represents the first track. The caveat, I guess, you
have to say is that because we don't have official diplomatic
relations, therefore, these meetings have a special unofficial
characteristic. But they still -- I guess I would have to say that
they still represent track one because they are meetings between
people who have a specified responsibility and authority on both
sides. And they are very useful, by the way. I think these meetings
are very useful. (MORE)

TRANSCRIPT-5</P>
      <P>Q: We hear many US scholars, including former Defense Secretary
William Perry, saying that they would like to have a track two
communication channel with Taipei. Is that because the first track is
not working efficiently?</P>
      <P>Johnson: I don't think that's it. I think our communcations with
Taiwan are extremely effective. I see people here; others in the AIT
see people here. My counterpart in Washington Stephen Chen -- Steve
sees people in Washington very frequently. So I don't think there is
any problem as far as communicating between people representing these
two bodies that conduct their business between their people (are
concerned). No, I think that the incentive from the standpoint of Dr.
Perry or others who have proposed a track two approach is to try to
help resolve an unresolved problem. When Dr. Perry was secretary of
defense, the crisis involving the PRC missile tests was one of the
most serious issues that came up duing his tenure as secretary of
defense. Of the maybe five or six most important issues during his
tenure -- that was one of them. So, I think that he feels, as do many
other people, that if there is a problem, let's do something and try
to solve it. And it is that motivation, I think, above all else that
has led him to try to play a constructive role. But I would emphasize
that Dr. Perry does not speak for the US administration. He was in
the government, but he is not presently in the government. His
meetings with the people in the States and with the people here or
other places are the same as those between any other unofficial,
private American and people in responsible positions here. My own
view is that as long as track one -- as long as you have good
communication on track one between the authorized representatives on
both sides -- track two is something extra. It's something which may
provide additional outside ideas, additional motivation, additional
influence, if you like, but it doesn't change the context within
which the players participate. I think the same is true on the other
side. I remember, if I may quote President Lee Teng-hui, I am sure he
would not mind. At a meeting that I had with him about a year ago on
a different subject, he said, "We don't lack for messengers; we lack
for a message." Lots of people want to be messengers to carry
messages back and forth, but that is not the point. The point is the
content of the message, and for that there are adequate channels. We
have adequate channels, I think, across the strait -- the mechanism
is quite adequate in conveying messages.</P>
      <P>Q: Mr. Perry said he met with Wang Daohan (ARATS chairman) in
Hawaii. So, people are wondering if we are going to have a track two
communication channel, does the US have any specific candidate in
mind to be the chief delegate from the Taipei side, for example, Wang
Daohan's counterpart, Mr. Koo Chen-fu?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Let me go back to the point I was making. Dr. Perry does
not act on behalf of the US government. We have no opinion -- the
United States government has no opinion, nor does the AIT have any
opinion on who should participate in the informal conversations.
There are many people in the United States who have an interest in
trying to encourage peaceful resolution of disputes, whether it's
this dispute, whether it's Bosnia, whether it's Ireland or the
Middle East. Some of them have official authority, and many do not.
They are driven in most cases by an effort to try to help -- to try
to help resolve problems. But they do not act on belhalf of the
United States government. So the question of who Dr. Perry should
talk with is for Dr. Perry to decide.</P>
      <P>Q: What kind of role did the AIT play in the Lincoln American
School issue? What's your major concern?</P>
      <P>Johnson: The only role that we played in that dispute was one of
receiving information from the people in the school and from the
community there, particularly at the end of the last school year when
they were very concerned about the disruption of the last two weeks
of school for the students, especially those who were graduating,
those who were taking exams and so forth, that some way be found to
allow the students to finish the school year without disruption. As
regards the specific issues involved in the case, we have never a
party to any of this, especially we are not familiar with, nor are we
actors in any way in the questions that are appropriately handled by
the Taiwan authorities -- the provincial authorities as well as the
central authorities. They have certain jurisdiction, and that is
appropriate. Even though the name "American" appears in the title,
the school does not have any affiliation with the AIT. (MORE)</P>

      <P>Johnson: I am really hesitant to comment on it at all because
apart, as I said, from being informed on behalf of the welfare of the
students, we have not been a party to this in any way at all. so I
don't know whether the charges were justified or not justified,
whether the reactions were appropriate or inappropriate. It really is
something entirely within Taiwan's jurisdication.</P>
      <P>Q: What will you do if, in the future, the school is ordered to
close or move?</P>
      <P>Johnson: I think we will have to deal with the circumstances at
the time. As I said, the one and only concern that this raised with
us was the welfare of the students. And certainly as an institution
that has a specific responsibility for looking after the welfare of
the American citizens, we will be concerned on those grounds that the
American citizen-students -- that their efforts to receive an
education be honored by the local authorities. But exactly how and in
what manner, is really Taiwan's responsibility.</P>
      <P>Q: You've been here for almost two years. Can you share with us
how you feel about Taiwan? What's your personal view about the
yearend Taipei mayor election?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, let me answer the last question first because
that's an easy one. We are interested observers in the process, but
that's all -- interested only in the sense that we think democracy is
a wonderful thing, and we support the free exercise of political
opinion regardless of whose opinion it may be. And this has so far
been and will continue to be a very exciting, interesting,
stimulating example of democracy in action. But as regards the
candidates themselves or the issues for which they stand, this is not
something on which the AIT or the United States has a position. It
really is not our business at all, and we only applaud the process.
With regard to your observation that we have lived here now for two
years, we feel -- as I think I mentioned to you some time ago -- my
wife and I feel that we have been very warmly welcomed. And I have to
say I think even the press has been very kind to me, to us, and fair.
And I think we have been really deeply touched, impressed, moved by
the warmth of the people of Taiwan with whom we've met. And I should
say this applies not only to high officials -- of course, they have
been very cordial -- but also to lots of ordinary people that we have
a chance to meet at the flower markets or temples or at schools or
other places where we travel. We like to get out a lot, and get
around the island, and to visit people in the private sector as well
as government institutions and schools and so forth. So, we have been
very pleased to be here. I might say that my wife's particular
interests have to do with the textiles and with art. She is an
artist, an art teacher by background. So she has greatly enjoyed
meeting people in Taiwan with similar interests.</P>
      <P>Q: How long do you expect to stay in Taiwan?</P>
      <P>Johnson: We expect to be here for another year. It's normally a
three-year assignment, and it will be three years next year.</P>
      <P>Q: After that, where can we find you? (Laughters)</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, if I knew the answer, I would probably tell you.
But I don't know the answer. And I don't expect to know for probably
another six months or so, prabably around the end of the year. And I
would expect to hear by early next year and I think by then we would
also know who is coming in my place -- by around January or so, we
should know.</P>
      <P>Q: We have seen reports on CNN -- the explosions in Kenya and
Tanzania. Many Taiwanese people come here to AIT every day to
apply for visas. Is it safe for them to come here?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, of course, we certainly assume they are safe to
come here, although that question really is one you need to ask the
local authorities, I think, in terms of any evidence of possible
action against us. We work very closely with the local authorities,
of course. And in response to the bombings, the tragic bombings in
East Africa, we have worked with the local authorities to increase
the protection of our building and of our facilities throughout
Taiwan. We feel that this is a safe place to live and work, and we
have no reason to assume otherwise. We have to be vigilant, and I
think that's true everywhere. But we intend to keep our doors open;
we intend to continue operating, to issue visas, and to receive
people. We would do so with care, with sensible prudence, but also
with a sense of our responsibility to the public that we serve.

      <P>Q: Are you familiar with Kenneth Lieberthal?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Yes. Kenneth Lieberthal is a very good friend of mine. I
first met him actually in Hong Kong almost 30 years ago, and have
seen him many times, including when he visited Taiwan earlier this
year. I think it was in February or March. I don't remember exactly.
He was here for a conference. I saw him during that time. Yes, he's a
good friend of long standing.</P>
      <P>Q: He has been named director of the Asia-Pacific Affairs
Department of the National Security Council. Many local scholars
believe he is pro-Beijing. Do you think his appointment to that
position will have any adverse effect on Taiwan-US relations?</P>
      <P>Johnson: I have heard reports that Professor Lieberthal will be
moving to that position. I have not seen it confirmed yet. But
assuming that these reports are accurate ...</P>
      <P>Q: Yes, today ...</P>
      <P>Johnson: They announced it today?</P>
      <P>Q: Yes, yes.</P>
      <P>Johnson: In any case, there was no reason to doubt it because he
is a highly qualified, very capable person. As to the possible
effects on relations between the US and Taiwan, I think that
Professor Lieberthal may not be accurately understood here in terms
of his own views and in terms of his own background. He is a serious
scholar. And he has, for many years, felt that the management of this
relationship, both the US-PRC relationship and the US-Taiwan
relationship, is of vital significance to the United States. So I
think with him in this position at the National Security Council, he
will certainly take guidance, of course, from the president, from
other people in the policy process. I have every hope and expectation
that his role there will be constructive. He was very impressed, very
positively impressed by his visit here earlier this year. And he gave
a paper there which I also think was widely misunderstood, but
nonetheless it was not welcomed, shall we say. And I think that, in
an unusual sort of way, had a beneficial effect for him to hear the
concerns that people here expressed about the ideas that he had in
that paper. But the objective of the paper was to try to lay out some
ideas for maintaining the status quo. That was what it was about. It
was about maintaining the status quo in a constructive way that will
allow Taiwan and the mainland to go about their business for almost
an indefinite time without worrying about the question of future
status. That was the objective of the paper. So, anyway, I think
Professor Lieberthal is a brilliant man. I think he will be a very
constructive voice in managing the Taiwan part of our China
relationship.</P>
      <P>Q: Will he likely push the US government to force Taiwan into
speeding up political negotiations with Beijing?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, first of all, whatever Professor Lieberthal says
is going to be mostly on paper, and mostly will involve meeting and
talking and presenting ideas with many other people who are involved
in the policy process. The policy of encouraging dialogue between
Taiwan and the mainland goes back many years. It does not depend on
any one individual. It is US policy. We do support dialogue. We have
long supported dialogue. And this is not something that depends on
who is in the National Security council. It is President Clinton's
policy. Before that, it was President Bush's policy. Before that, it
was President Reagan's policy, and so forth. We have always supported
dialogue, just as we have always supported democratization.</P>
      <P>Q: About the policy of appeasement on US arms sales to Taiwan,
many local observers believe the United States will gradually change
its arms sales policy to Taiwan, and that Taiwan will be denied
access to weapons it really needs. (MORE)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Johnson: Well, first of all, for reasons I've said before, I
can't accept the word appeasement regardless of the context of what
you mean, because it doesn't mean anything like that. I don't know
what the word is in Chinese that you mean, but it's not the English
word. The second thing is that we are guided in relations with Taiwan
and the mainland by the three communiques and the Taiwan Relations
Act. One of the three communiques specifies the framework for future
arms sales to Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act also makes very
explicit the commitment by the US to sell defensive weapons to Taiwan
and to evaluate requests on the basis of Taiwan's defense needs. And
that's what we do. I'm not sure -- I mean I understand that there
will always be speculation of one type or another in terms of
possible changes. But there has been no change in policy on that or
any other aspect of our policy towards Taiwan. Every request will be
examined, analyzed and discussed on its merits. And some will be
approved, some won't. That would be on the basis of our best
judgement of Taiwan's defense needs. There has been no change in that
policy and there won't be any change because it's law.</P>
      <P>Q: Taiwan needs submarines but it has no way to get that kind of
equipment.</P>
      <P>Johnson: Well, the question of what Taiwan really needs is a
matter that we discuss with the military frequently. And it's always
a question of the purposes for which the items are requested, and the
question of balance, the question of arms race and so forth. Each
case is looked at individually on its merits.</P>
      <P>Q: The US Congress has very strong support for Taiwan. Now
President Clinton's engagement policy toward mainland China seems to
go against the American people's will, at least in the Congress.
What's your opinion?</P>
      <P>Johnson: The interesting thing is that the resolutions which were
introduced in both the Senate and in the House passed overwhelmingly,
almost unanimously. In the case of the Senate, it was unanimous. In
the case of the House, there was one opposing vote. Obviously those
would not have carried with that kind of margin if the president and
his party had been against them. What these resolutions did,
regardless of what the sponsors said, what these resolutions did was
to reaffirm the basis of our policy toward the mainland and Taiwan --
by reaffirming the Taiwan Relations Act. The Taiwan Relations Act was
written in 1979, signed by President Carter in 1979. It has been the
law ever since, and it still is. And these resolutions simply
reaffirmed the law which presently exists. So The administration did
not oppose those resolutions. So, you know, it's a question of sort
of subtracting the political rhetoric, if you like, the political
language which is used by the sponsors. And looking at the actual
wording of the document itself, and in this case, there was no
important difference between what the Congress was saying and what
the administration says.</P>
      <P>Q: So actually Clinton is only continuing the policy of the past
administrations ...</P>
      <P>Johnson: Exactly. Even though there have been very significant
differences on many issues since the time of President Nixon through
Carter, Reagan, Bush and now Clinton. Oh, add Ford to that. There has
been no significant change in policy, even vis-a-vis the PRC or
vis-a-vis Taiwan. There have been different events during that time.
But the policy of engagement with the mainland, and the policy of
maintaining the deepest possible contacts and relationships with the
people of Taiwan -- those have been consistent all the way through.

      <P>Q: Sen. Slade Gorton has said that supporting Taiwan is the
mainstream position in the United States today. Is this just the
view of the US Congress? You have said the administration's opinion
of Taiwan does not contradict that held by the US Congress. If so, do
you agree that supporting Taiwan is now the mainstream position in
the United States?</P>
      <P>Johnson: Yes, it always has been. The public opinion in the
United States has always been favorable towards Taiwan, especially in
the last 11 years, as Taiwan's democracy has flourished here. I think
that there really and truly is no difference of opinion across the
political spectrum. Some people come at the issue from a different
perspective. Even in the old days, we were very strong supporters.
Others have come more recently to support the evolution in Taiwan.
But I think it is true to say there is almost no place on the
political spectrum in the United States where there is opposition to
Taiwan, and especially to Taiwan's democracy as it evolves. It is
considered a great success story, economically as well as
politically. And this is nearly universal. I think Sen. Gorton's
observation is very correct. But I would also say we don't feel it as
an "either-or" situation. Most people don't say that if you are
friendly with Taiwan, therefore, you have to be hostile with the
mainland. Or vice versa, if you have good relations with the
mainland, you have to be hostile to Taiwan. In fact, most Americans
think that it is both possible and desirable to have good relations
with both. And we do. Historically, that is true, and it's true now.
I mentioned to somebody the other day -- I guess it was in connection
to signing the WTO agreement. I said that in terms of core issues,
real hard problems, there are still a few intellectual property right
protection, some of the issues having to do with the commercial
activities here, bidding processes and so forth. There are problems
like that. But generally speaking, there has probably never been a
time when we had such a broad range of good feeling, good
understanding, good relationships as we do now. And I think it's a
very healthy and very strong relationship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUPPET SHOW LEGEND LEE TIEN-LU DIES AT AGE 90</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Puppet master Lee Tien-lu, one of Taiwan's
national treasures, died of heart failure on Thursday at his home in
Sanchih, Taipei County. He was 90 years old.</P>
      <P>Lee had suffered from poor health in recent years due partly to
his advanced age. He was admitted to Veterans General Hospital in
suburban Taipei in June because of his failing heart and lungs.</P>
      <P>Knowing his days might be numbered, Lee insisted on returning to
his ancestral home a few weeks ago because of his belief in the
traditional Chinese concept, "Fallen leaves return to the roots."</P>
      <P>The master dedicated his life to puppetry. He began to study the
artistry of hand puppets under the tutelage of his father at the
tender age of eight. By 22, he had organized his own troupe and
embarked on his performing career. His outstanding skills had made
him a household name on the island when he turned 37.</P>
      <P>His troupe, I Wan Jan, had performed throughout Asia and in the
United States and Europe, winning awards at puppetry festivals in New
York and France.</P>
      <P>Lee had performed puppet shows for US President Bill Clinton on
two occasions and received the Lifetime Dedication to Arts Award at
the prestigious Lincoln Center in New York. He was also a recipient
of the ROC's Folk Arts Master Award.</P>
      <P>Possessed of a rapier-sharp wit and strong willpower, Lee never
compromised in his pursuit of refined hand puppet skills and
artistry.</P>
      <P>He was especially popular for his innovative martial arts
sequences, acrobatic stunts, and use of modern slang mixed with
classical Chinese.</P>
      <P>His legendary life was immortalized in local movie director Hou
Hsiao-hsien's award-winning film "The Puppetmaster."</P>
      <P>Lee ended his performing career at 69 and had devoted the rest of
his life to cultivating a new generation of puppeteers. Along with
his two sons, Lee had also helped set up two children's puppet
troupes, the Wei Wan Jan and the Cheau Wan Jan, both of which
were highly praised.</P>
      <P>Some of Lee's fans traveled all the way from Europe, the United
States and Australia to Taiwan to study with him. Several of his
French students formed a troupe, Hsiao Wan Jan, to present
professional puppet shows to European audience.</P>
      <P>An optimistic, confident man, Lee never hesitated in trying new
things. At the age of 75, Lee ventured into movies. He starred in
many award-winning films, including the "City of Sadness" and the
"Puppetmaster." He earned much acclaim for his moving and sometimes
funny performances.</P>
      <P>The affable old man did not even mind appearing in TV variety

      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang replaced Sisy Chen on Friday as chairman of
the Rising People Foundation, a private non-profit organization.</P>
      <P>Ranking government officials, including Premier Vincent Siew,
Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-fan, Control Yuan President Wang
Tso-yung, as well as National Assembly President Fredrick Chien,
Kuomintang Secretary-General John Chang, and DPP Chairman Lin
Yi-hsiung and his predecessors Shih Ming-te and Huang Hsin-chieh, all
attended the appointment ceremony at the Taipei Grand Formosa Regent
Hotel.</P>
      <P>In his address, Siew hailed Hsu for his contributions to Taiwan's
democratization and said he hopes Hsu will go on to accomplish even
greater achievements in his political career.</P>
      <P>The out-spoken Control Yuan head Wang praised both Hsu and Shih
as "very outstanding" citizens for their commitment and devotion to
the pursuit of Taiwan people's well-being.</P>
      <P>Lin, who took over the DPP chairmanship from Hsu on Aug. 1, also
had high praise for Hsu, noting his bravery in standing alone to
voice his own opinions. Lin said Hsu's encouragement was especially
apparent in the face of strong criticism from others.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hsu said he was very worried over Taiwan's future
as the situation in the international community is becoming
increasingly difficult for the island.</P>
      <P>Hsu said his "go west" policy, support for broader cross-strait
economic exchanges and his prediction that Taiwan would encounter
greater international pressure to begin political talks with mainland
China have proven correct.</P>
      <P>But is Taiwan really ready for these challenges, Hsu asked. He
expressed the hope that all Taiwan politicians would think over these
issues in light of a foreseeable harsh political climate for the
island in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Hsu had said earlier this year that he would take part in
Taiwan's next presidential election slated for 2000. Meanwhile Sisy

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI DOWNGRADES ECONOMIC GROWTH FORECAST FOR 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's projected economic growth for 1998
was adjusted downward to 5.3 percent by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) on Friday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Director-General Wei Duan said this will be the eighth time
in decades that Taiwan's economic growth rate will register below 6
percent following the years of 1956, 1971, 1981, 1985, 1990, and
1996.</P>
      <P>However, compared with other Asian countries, Wei said, Taiwan's
overall economic performance for 1998 is not bad at all. The 5.3
economic growth is the second highest in Asia behind only mainland
China.</P>
      <P>In its economic report in May, the DGBAS predicted that Taiwan's
economy would grow by 6.02 percent for 1998. It also said the
economic growth for the first quarter of this year was 5.92 percent,
while the second, third and fourth quarters were expected to grow by
5.78 percent, 6.16 and 6.18 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>However, continuing fallout from the Asian financial crisis has
made the economic growth forecasts appear to be too optimistic,
prompting the DGBAS to adjust the economic growth from the first
quarter throughout the fourth quarter to 5.86 percent, 5.21 percent,
4.95 percent and 5.21 percent.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said as Taiwan's foreign trade has declined
drastically, this year's economic growth has to depend on the private
sector's investment. Although growth in private sector investments
was slightly adjusted downward to 19.7 percent from 22 percent, the
growth represented the highest in 11 years.</P>
      <P>The gross national product for 1998 was predicted to reach
US$262.1 billion with the per capita national income standing at
US$12,030.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also predicted that economic growth will rebound to 5.8
percent for the first half of next year as fallout from the Asian
financial turmoil is expected to subside during this period, and
investments either in the private or public sector will be boosted by
the government's "domestic demand expansion package."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANOTHER VICTIM CONTRACTED AIDS THROUGH TRANSFUSION: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health on Friday revealed
that another person in Taiwan had contracted AIDS through a blood
transfusion.</P>
      <P>Officials said the 24-year-old female patient died of cirrhosis
on July 28.</P>
      <P>This is the sixth such case since 1988, the year when the DOH
began requiring that all donated blood be tested for contamination.</P>
      <P>The contaminated blood the victim received was from a regular
male donor who first donated blood in May 1993. The man tested HIV
positive on April 17 this year when he attempted to make another
donation.</P>
      <P>The man's last two blood donations were made on July 22, 1997 and
Dec. 5, 1997. This blood supply had been given to six people
including the victim.</P>
      <P>Two of the other recipients died in Dec. 1997 and Feb. 1998.
Another recipient tested HIV negative while the remaining two have
not yet been located.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the blood donor admitted to patronizing
prostitutes while on a trip to a Southeast Asian country in June
1997. He married a Southeast Asian woman in August later that year
and brought her back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The man's wife has also tested HIV positive which led to her
deportation back to her home country.</P>
      <P>As the number of similar cases are surfacing, the DOH said it
will adopt more rigorous methods of screening donated blood.</P>
      <P>In a Friday meeting, hosted by the DOH, a number of experts,
blood donation center officials, and AIDS advisory council officials
discussed the issue.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, the DOH announced that as part of efforts to
address the issue, the waiting period on donations from high-risk
people will be raised from one year to two years. Those who indulge
in high-risk sexual behavior, who have had venereal disease, or who
are inmates of a penitentiary have to wait two years before they can
make any blood donation.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, those blood donors who are found to have
circumvented the waiting period will be prosecuted and face severe
punishment. In addition, the DOH said that it will require all the
blood donation centers to use the latest technique to screen donated
blood.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's misery index in daily life and
financial state are both lower than those posted by neighboring
countries, a government agency reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-level Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), Taiwan's misery index in daily
life -- which calculates the 2.4 percent unemployment with the 1.7
percent increase in the consumer price index -- totaled 4.1 percent
in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>The figure was only slightly higher than Singapore's 2.9 percent,
but noticeably lower than the Philippines' 19 percent, South Korea's
14.8 percent, Hong Kong's 8.5 percent and Japan's 5.4 percent, the
DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>The Asian financial turmoil has had an even greater impact on the
countries' financial sectors since the crisis broke out about a year
ago, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's financial misery index -- the combination of a 18.9
percent depreciation in the New Taiwan dollar and a 14.4 percent
plunge in share prices -- stood at 33.3 percent, far lower than
figures in other neighboring countries such as Malaysia and
Indonesia, where the financial misery indexes all exceeded 100
percent, according to the DGBAS.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO DEFEND ITS INTERESTS WHEN JIANG ZEMIN VISITS JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers and scholars are
scheduled to travel to Japan prior to mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's September visit to Japan, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan and National Assembly members and the
scholars, who are making the trip with full government support, will
be trying their utmost to express Taipei's position that Taiwan's
interests should not be sacrificed by Japan as a result of Jiang's
visit, said MOFA spokesman Roy Wu.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China does not want to see Jiang's visit
adversely affect relations between Taiwan and Japan either, he added.</P>
      <P>Announcing the results of a supra-ministerial meeting held on
Friday in the face of Jiang's upcoming Japanese visit, Wu said that
while it is believed Tokyo will not directly address the so-called
"three noes" policy stated by US President Bill Clinton toward
Taiwan, Beijing may continue to exert pressure on Tokyo until it
makes a similar acknowledgment of the policy.</P>
      <P>President Clinton said at an informal setting in Shanghai during
his last visit to mainland China on June 25-July 3 that the US
doesn't support "independence for Taiwan," "Two Chinas or one China,
one Taiwan," and "Taiwan's membership in international orgaziations
for which statehood is a requirement." This US position is oftened
referred to as the "three noes" policy.</P>
      <P>Friday's meeting worked out six resolutions aimed at making
Taiwan's position clear and defending Taiwan's interests at a time
when Japanese-mainland Chinese engagement may result in an outcome
harmful to Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>The government officials resolved that a supra-party Legislative
Yuan mission will visit Japan between Aug. 24 and 27 to voice
Taiwan's concerns about Jiang's upcoming visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>An academic mission, to be jointly sponsored by the MOFA and the
Government Information Office, will also visit Japan later this month
with a similar purpose.</P>
      <P>Members of the Japanese media will be invited to Taiwan to
interview ROC officials, and government agencies will accelerate
bilateral contacts so that they can stay well-informed of every
development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOFA urged Tokyo to strengthen parallel relations
with Taipei and not make any promises or engage in any activities
with mainland China that may result in undermining the peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>

abolished.</P>
      <P>Chang described a China Times newspaper report on Saturday as
untrue. The paper said the KMT is seeking to have the Legislative

Assembly next year.</P>
      <P>The paper said the country's "key decision makers" have recently
reached a consensus that the operations of the National Assembly, one
of the Republic of China's two chambers of parliament, will be
suspended, with its abolition legitimized through another
constitutional revision.</P>
      <P>It went on to say that President Lee Teng-hui has recently

within his tenure, and that during a routine weekly meeting of the
KMT Central Standing Committee, he instructed the KMT Policy
Coordination Committee to study relevant measures on the initiative.</P>
      <P>Chang, however, said that it is true that the structure of the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Saturday he is optimistic that the economy will take a turn for the
better by late 1999 or early 2000.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) adjusted its prediction for
Taiwan's economic growth downwards to 5.3 percent.</P>
      <P>He said the figure, though not ideal, is acceptable, noting that
Asia's economic slowdown will make it difficult to enjoy a rebound in
the short time frame involved.</P>
      <P>Noting that US-based Wharton Econometric Forecasting Association
(WEFA) had earlier predicted that Taiwan's economic growth this year
will be 5.2 percent, he said that it is roughly the same as the DGBAS
prediction.</P>
      <P>He compared the figure with the WEFA forecasts for the other
countries in the Asian region, saying that the association predicted
economic growth of 0.6 percent for Japan, 1.2 percent for Singapore,
and 13 percent negative growth for Indonesia this year, which
illustrates the fact that Asian economies in general are in decline.</P>
      <P>Wang said that compared with other nations in the world, Taiwan
ranks as one of the top 20 in terms of economic growth. Those who are
ahead of Taiwan, such as mainland China, have higher predicted growth
rates because they are newly developing economies. Taiwan's economic
development has reached a more mature stage, causing growth to
naturally slow down, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the continued slowdown of the Asian economy has
inevitably affected Taiwan's exports, adding that Taiwan's economy
must now depend on its domestic market.</P>
      <P>He said the government will continue to step up public
construction projects and promote private investment by removing
investment hurdles. Private investment this year is expected to show
a 16 percent growth rate, he said.</P>

      <P>However, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sadaaki Numata added

      <P>According to these reports, Obuchi will come under pressure from
Beijing to follow in US President Bill Clinton's footsteps and

war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in central Africa
remain safe, Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu said, it remains unclear when the two-member ROC
mission and eight ROC expatriates in the capital, Kinshasa, can be
evacuated, because foreign aircraft have been prohibited from flying
into the country for evacuation purposes.</P>
      <P>The French-speaking African state has also forbidden the
departure of all scheduled or chartered flights from its airports, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The ministry on Friday ordered Hsiao Kuang-yu, the de facto ROC
ambassador to the DRC, to arrange for evacuation, as rebels were
reported to be marching toward Kinshasa from the country's western
coastline.</P>
      <P>Wu said Belgium, which had originally planned to send a chartered
plane on Saturday to evacuate its nationals, had agreed to help pick
up the ROC nationals there, including Hsiao.</P>
      <P>However, the flight ban meant that the plane could not enter the
DRC's airspace, Wu said, adding that a French military aircraft was
also barred from entry.</P>
      <P>Wu quoted Hsiao as having told him early Saturday morning that
the French Embassy in Kinshasa was arranging a ship to evacuate its
nationals, as well as 25 Japanese and 46 South Korean expatriates in
the country.</P>
      <P>"According to the French plan, the ship will carry evacuees
across the Zaire River to Brazzaville, capital of Republic of the
Congo, which sits on the opposite bank of the river from Kinshasa,"
Wu said.</P>
      <P>He added that Hsiao is negotiating with the French Embassy for
its consent to help evacuate the ROC nationals.</P>
      <P>Wu said the situation in Kinshasa remains peaceful at the moment
and that all the ROC nationals are safe and in good shape.</P>
      <P>Many neighboring countries, as well as the United Nations, are
planning to send personnel to the DRC to help mediate peace between
President Laurent Kabila's government and the rebels, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"We hope the situation will stabilize soon," Wu said, adding that
the Foreign Ministry is keeping close watch on developments there and
is doing its utmost to protect the safety of its staff members and
other ROC nationals in the country.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, an army of Tutsi
rebels, Rwandan soldiers, and disenchanted troops from Kabila's army
-- the same people who helped Kabila oust longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko in May 1997 -- is marching toward Kinshasa, possibly
ushering in an inglorious end to Kabila's turbulent 14-month rule.</P>
      <P>The DRC was previously known as Zaire. The ROC first established
diplomatic ties with Zaire in 1960, but cut such ties in early 1973
after the African state switched diplomatic ties from Taipei to
Beijing in late 1972. In June 1991, the ROC signed an agreement with
Zaire on the exchange of representative offices. The ROC's
representative office in Kinshasa was inaugurated in July 1991. Zaire
changed its national title to the Republic of Congo in May 1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VALUABLE 5TH CENTURY B.C. INSTRUMENT ARRIVES IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A duplicate of a fifth century B.C. chime
unearthed in the mainland Chinese province of Hubei arrived in Taiwan
on Friday.</P>
      <P>The instrument, crafted by the Provincial Hubei Museum and
imported via Hong Kong, was ordered by Taipei's Chang Foundation
Museum at the behest of the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural
Affairs (CCA).</P>
      <P>The chime, comprising 65 bronze bells, is considered proof of the
sophistication of ancient Chinese musicians and artisans.</P>
      <P>Its original, called a "Bianzhong," dates back to the Early
Warring States Period of over 2,000 years ago, and was unearthed from
the middle chamber of the tomb of Zenghou Yi, a feudal lord, in an
area known today as Suixian, in the central province of Hubei.</P>
      <P>The CCA, which had long sought a copy of the instrument in an
effort to help preserve the cream of ancient Chinese artifacts and
musical theory, will now sponsor a program through which Taiwan
musicians can learn to play the instrument, considered to be the most
sophisticated musical equipment ever unearthed.</P>
      <P>The copy, which cost NT$22 million (US$641,400), is expected to
be included in a collection of the Ethnic Music Center being
established by the CCA, said Liao Kuei-ying, executive curator of the
privately owned Chang Foundation Museum.</P>
      <P>The chime is one of three copies made by the Provincial Hubei
Museum after the valuable instrument was unearthed in 1978.</P>
      <P>Consisting of 65 bells which hang vertically or diagonally under
wood beams on three different levels, the chime weighs a staggering
4,421 kilograms. Each bell, the largest of which stands 152
centimeters high, can produce two different notes, making the
instrument capable of playing almost any modern piece of music, Liao
said.</P>
      <P>In an overseas performance tour several years ago, mainland
Chinese musicians played Beethoven's Fifth Symphony on a reproduction
of the instrument, debunking the myth that the ancient Chinese had no
muscial theory and lacked the instruments to play sophisticated
music.</P>
      <P>What is perhaps most amazing about the chime is not only that it
can produce a full-range of musical notes and 12 semi-tones from C2
to D7, but that it also bears gold-inlaid inscriptions revealing the
musical theory of the time and the way in which people from six
neighboring states played the same music.</P>
      <P>The 3,755-character inscription has greatly advanced modern-day
knowledge of ancient Chinese music, said Liao, whose museum sponsored
an exhibition in Taiwan featuring a reproduction of the ancient
instrument late last year.</P>
      <P>Another amazing aspect of the chime is the sophistication of the
bronze alloy used to make the bells. The alloy indicates that the
metallurgical industry in China 2,000 years ago was well established.</P>
      <P>Other details, including the casting, painting and carving on the
instrument are equally stunning, she said.</P>
      <P>Liao admitted that importing the chime was far from easy. First,
it was not allowed to be directly ordered by the CCA because of the
absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Second, the Chang Foundation Museum faced an import tax and
handling fees of more than NT$2 million (US$58,310) charged by
customs authorities, who did not consider the instrument to be
"materials to be used in academic research" as was claimed by the
importer.</P>
      <P>The CCA then filed an appeal with the Department of Customs
Administration (DCA) for a reexamination of the import application,
in the hope that the instrument would be allowed entry duty-free.</P>
      <P>To the relief and joy of all concerned, the DCA gave a
last-minute green light for the importation, and the chime was
finally allowed entry into Taiwan duty-free on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE DISSIDENTS ISSUE OPEN LETTER CENSURING BEIJING AUTHORITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By David Wang and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of mainland Chinese dissidents
Thursday issued an open letter of protest to Beijing authorities over
the detainment of dissident Liu Nianchun and the brutal treatment of
Liu's family.</P>
      <P>The 27 dissidents, who are currently living in exile in the
United States, called for Liu's release and an investigation into the
physical confrontation between Liu's family and security officials.</P>
      <P>Their letter described how Liu's mother and wife went to the
Beijing Municipal Committee on Monday with the intention of
protesting against the abuse and detention of Liu. But they were
attacked by public security police on their way to the committee, and
were dragged away by force to the police station.</P>
      <P>The exiled dissidents called on Beijing authorities to
immediately investigate and punish the security officers involved in
the confrontation with Liu's family. They also urged authorities to
take necessary measures to prevent other similar incidents from
happening again.</P>
      <P>Liu joined the mainland's pro-democracy movement as early as
1978, and was the editor of a periodical titled "Today." He was
sentenced to three years in prison in 1982, and detained for five
months in May 1994 after organizing a league for the protection of
labors' rights. Liu was arrested once again in 1995 and was sentenced
to three years of "re-education" which was due to be completed in May
1998.</P>
      <P>However, authorities continue to hold Liu in custody without
offering a reason. He is reportedly very ill and is not getting
proper medical treatment, which led his mother and wife to take his
case to the committee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMOSA PLASTICS' HEAD URGES UPGRADE OF INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must actively work to upgrade its
industries to produce high-end value-added products in the face of
higher competition in the region, the head of the Formosa Plastics
Group (FPG) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Y.C. Wang was speaking in Taipei County about his experiences in
running the FPG as an example of the importance of upgrading
industries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan initially gained its success in labor-intensive industries
such as processing and manufacturing, but as other regions are
offering cheaper conditions with lower labor and production costs,
more and more industries are going overseas.</P>
      <P>Looking for bargains, Taiwan businessmen are on their way to the
mainland. The local wage in the mainland is only one fourth of
Taiwan's, Wang said. It is only natural that over 30,000 Taiwan
businessmen have been lured to the mainalnd.</P>
      <P>He said under these circumstances, Taiwan has to upgrade its
technology in shipbuilding, automobile production, heavy industry,
high-technology, and closely control its investment costs so it can
remain competitive.</P>
      <P>Wang was also asked about the three factories under related to
the FPC have closed in Taipei County not because they lost money, but
because they could not meet their operation targets.</P>
      <P>He said the recent closure of Tai Shih Textile Industry Corp. --
a joint venture between the FPG and a Japanese company in Ilan,
eastern Taiwan -- was an example of closing an operation to upgrade
the industry.</P>
      <P>Wang said the government has to carefully assess the industries
in Taipei County and their conditions, then determine what other
industries need to be developed and how to improve the present
conditions.</P>
      <P>To promote the expansion of national industry, the focus must be
on infrastructures, Wang noted. The mainland is still at a fledgling
stage in its steel refinement, shipbuilding and automobile industries
but its attitude is aggressive.</P>
      <P>In planning for the major industries of the nation, it is
important to take into consideration not only its talent, but also
education, experience and management, Wang said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Legislative Yuan President Liang
Su-jung on Saturday expressed anger over allegedly being placed under
surveillance by the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau
(MJIB).</P>
      <P>Liang said he, along with former Premier Hau Po-chun and former
Justice Minister Lin Yang-kang, will present joint petitions to the
Executive Yuan and Presidential Office asking them to explain why the
MJIB has placed them under surveillance.</P>
      <P>Saying that surveillance is a serious invasion of human rights,
Liang demanded the MJIB to immediately suspend such activity, or
action would be taken against the government in the United Nation's
Human Rights Committee.</P>
      <P>According to a report carried in the latest issue of The
Journalist weekly magazine, the MJIB conducted another round of
surveillance in March, which targeted certain local people who travel
to mainland China for investment, tourism, religious and cultural
exchange purposes.</P>
      <P>Liang, chairman of the Chinese Association for the Promotion of
Cross-Strait Civil Exchanges, said he discussed the issue with Lin
and Hau over the telephone on Friday.</P>
      <P>"We all feel very angry. Such a surveillance is absurd and
shameless," Liang said in a joint news conference he held with New
Party Legislator Lee Ching-hu who is also allegedly targeted by the
bureau.</P>
      <P>Liang also accused President Lee Teng-hui of being behind the
surveillance. Saying that he respects President Lee despite their
political differences, Liang used strong language to express his
dissatisfaction over the issue. He claimed that President Lee is
using the surveillance as an instrument to "terminate" his opponents.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, Legislator Lee described the
surveillance as an "intimidation" or a "purge." He said that most of
the people monitored by the bureau are those who are not in the
political mainstream or those who are pro-unification, signaling that
the government is actually pro-independence in its agenda.</P>
      <P>The legislator said if the government were conducting
surveillance for national security, it should target the right people
such as those who have power or those who have acted as secret envoys
to the mainland and those who were once communists.</P>
      <P>In response to the press conference, Justice Minister Cheng
chun-mo said that although the political surveillance is the bureau's
main priority, it is only part of its mission. Cheng admitted the
existence of such surveillance on Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng stressed that the MJIB has not put specified
figures under surveillance as has been alleged, rebutting such claims
as "nonsense."</P>
      <P>Cheng said for the sake of national security, national interests,
as well social stability, the bureau is only seeking to ensure that
persons who have links with the mainland are not endangering national
security.</P>
      <P>"The white terror of past decades, during which certain figures
were monitored and even suppressed, is long over as a result of the
island's successful democratization," Cheng said.</P>

      <P>Perng said in a news conference that the CBC respects the market

      <P>As the new European Union currency, the euro, is expected to make

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fate of New Zealand's Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley seems increasingly uncertain following the sacking of
Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters on Friday, political analysts
said.</P>
      <P>They said Shipley, leader of the National Party, must now
persuade at least seven members of the New Zealand First Party (NZFP)
to remain in her Cabinet so she can remain in power. If she is unable
to do so, she may face an early election.</P>
      <P>Shipley's party has only 44 seats in the 120-seat parliament, but
she has support from independent MPs and other minority parties.
However, to stay in power, she needs support from at least seven MPs
from the NZFP.</P>
      <P>Peters, who also served as treasurer, is the leader of NZFP,
which has altogether 16 MPs in the parliament, serving as the balance
of power.</P>
      <P>It is expected that Peters will also try very hard to persuade
his colleagues to boycott Shipley's coalition to oust her from power.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, another main party -- The Labor Party -- is
possibly moving to dethrone Shipley.</P>
      <P>Having 37 seats in the parliament, the Labor Party may be trying
to win the support of other parties, including the support of some
NZFP MPs, analysts said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US EXPERT DONATES 2-28 INCIDENT ARCHIVES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American Taiwan affairs expert has
donated to the island a valuable collection of manuscripts and
official US documents concerning the tragic incident which occurred
in Taiwan on Feb. 28, 1947.</P>
      <P>Yeh Poh-wen, curator of Taipei's 2-28 Incident Museum, told a
news conference on Saturday that George Kerr, author of the book
"Formosa Betrayed," donated the collection to the museum earlier this
year.</P>
      <P>"The precious archives were already sent to Taiwan. We are
examining the collection and will put it on public display next
February," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Kerr focused on studying Taiwan-related
affairs during a stint at the military intelligence headquarters
under the US Defense Department from 1942 to 1943.</P>
      <P>Between 1944 and 1946, Kerr served at the US Navy's intelligence
center. He was then transferred to the State Department. Kerr was a
deputy consul at the US embassy in the Republic of China from 1946
through 1947. When the incident, often referred to as the 2-28
Incident, took place, Kerr was in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Kerr had painstakingly recorded the statements, speeches
and talks delivered by leading figures involved in the 2-28 Incident
as well as their ordeal.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yeh said, Kerr took many pictures featuring everyday
life and major social events or activities in Taiwan during that
turbulent period.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chang Yen-hsien, a research fellow
with Academia Sinica's Institute of Social Sciences, said the
collection contributed by Kerr is highly valuable because there is
limited documentation detailing the incident.</P>
      <P>Kerr's collection include geographic maps, photos, books,
newspaper clippings, official US documents and private letters.</P>
      <P>"The archives provide a glimpse into all aspects of Taiwan from
late 19th century to the 1960s, ranging from political, economic and
social developments to cultural, environmental and agricultural
situation," Chang added.</P>
      <P>The 2-28 Incident was sparked by the arrest and beating of an
elderly female street vendor selling untaxed cigarettes. Subsequent
islandwide rioting and anti-Kuomintang protests followed by a brutal
military crackdown caused the death of thousands of innocent people
all over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For years, talks about the incident were a taboo. With Taiwan
becoming a full-fledged democracy, the government has adopted a more
open attitude toward the incident. President Lee Teng-hui has made a
public apology to the families of the incident's victims.</P>
      <P>The government has also offered financial compensation to their
families and set up a foundation to study measures for restoring the
reputations of many innocent people who were convicted and executed
in connection with the incident. In addition to the 2-28 Museum, a
Taipei park has also been renamed the 2-28 Peace Memorial Park in
rememberance of those who died in the incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD BANK WARNS INDIA OF DEFICIT DANGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Bank has warned India that its
high public sector deficit is threatening the country's macroeconomic
stability and dragging its growth, according to reports of the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) Friday.</P>
      <P>In its annual report on India's economy, the World Bank said
India urgently needs to cut subsidies and broaden its tax base "to
reduce the risk of macroeconomic instability" and increase resources
for paid, private-sector led growth.</P>
      <P>"High fiscal deficits absorb funding from the private sector,
threaten macro-stability and hinder financial sector reform," the
report stated.</P>
      <P>During the last fiscal year, India's central government deficit
was about 6 percent of gross domestic product, one of the largest in
the world. Although the budget in June projected a deficit of 5.6
percent of the GDP, the bank said subsequent adjustments, including a
rollback in a proposed import tariff, will reduce projected revenues
by 0.2 percent in the GDP, leaving the deficit at 5.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The report also said India's states are in an "increasingly
unsustainable position" due to their excessive subsidies on items
such as power to farmers, and this increasingly threatens the
provision of the social and physical infrastructure needed for
development.</P>
      <P>While India's external position was comfortable in the last year,
the bank warned of growing pressure on the balance of payments. In
1997-98, the current account deficit rose to an estimated US$6.2
billion, or 1.6 percent of the GDP, up from US$4.4 billion in

rise further to 2.5 percent of the GDP by 1999-2000.</P>
      <P>The bank noted that India's foreign exchange reserves, which were
US$26.3 billion at the end of March 1998, will fall to US$22.6
billion in the current fiscal year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC UNVEILS MEASURES TO STEM MONEY SPECULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) announced
four measures to stem speculative currency trade in the local
monetary markets.</P>
      <P>The central bank unveiled the measures in response to President
Lee Teng-hui's recent call for more rigorous regulatory mechanisms
for securities and futures markets and a closer monitoring of the
flow of foreign capital.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Peng Hui-nan told a news conference that the CBC
will refer to taxation authorities a list of individual and
institutional customers who have purchased a large amount of the US
dollar or other foreign currencies. "The information will be useful
for probing possible tax evasion by those clients," Peng said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Peng said, the central banks will take steps to
control supply of the New Taiwan dollar capital to institutions
which have been involved in speculative currency trade.</P>
      <P>The central bank will also tighten regulation and monitoring of
the figureheads used by foreign speculators to speculate on the NT
dollar's exchange rate against the greenback in May, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Peng said, the central bank will require local banks
to make immediate reports of large greenback purchase deals to
facilitate the CBC's monitoring. The large greenback purchase deals
refer to those whose trading amount exceeds US$50,000 each.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the central bank has made public
its measures to curb speculation on the NT dollar's exchange rate.</P>
      <P>Peng would not predict whether the NT dollar will rise against
the US dollar in the second half of this year or not. He instead
said the NT dollar's exchange rate will be determined by market
mechanism.</P>
      <P>Peng further said the central bank will consider further
lowering the bank reserve requirements only when the local commodity
prices and the NT dollar's exchange rate remain stable.</P>
      <P>The senior banker also called on all Asian countries to
cooperate and coordinate closely to maintain stability of their
currencies. "Otherwise, Asia's economic outlook will become even
gloomier in the years ahead," Peng said.</P>
      <P>He also reiterated his hope that the mainland Chinese currency
will not be depreciated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF OFFICIAL URGES CAUTION IN CROSS-STRAIT DEALINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must be more cautious in its
dealings with mainland China as Beijing has intensified its efforts
to entice the island's population, an official in charge of
cross-strait affairs said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hsing, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), said the government must be very careful in its
dealings with the mainland because Beijing authorities are now
seeking to ruin Taiwan from the inside.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at an academic seminar sponsored by the ROC
Public Administration Association. He stressed that he was speaking
in his capacity as a scholar and not as a government official.</P>
      <P>He said the mainstream opinions of the Taiwan people regarding
cross-strait exchanges included the following major characteristics:</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan people think mainland China is not friendly toward
Taiwan;</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan people prefer to maintain the status-quo regarding
cross-strait exchanges;</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan people do not support imminent declaration of
independence or unification with mainland China;</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan people hope for an improvement in cross-strait ties and
a peaceful co-existence across the Taiwan Strait;</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan people are opposed to Beijing's "one country, two
systems" unification formula; and</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan people support the government's "no haste, be patient"
policy governing local investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing is trying to use every means possible to isolate
Taiwan in the international community, Wu said Taiwan must continue
to "reach out" to build greater strength and get bargaining chips for
future negotiations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The SEF official, however, called on the public to be careful of
the mainland's increased efforts to entice them. Beijing recently
held a meeting on Taiwan and decided to shift its focus to a "united
front" strategy with the Taiwan public, he noted.</P>
      <P>As the state of hostility has not ended between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait and cross-strait exchanges are more and more
frequent, Wu warned that Taiwan must be more cautious against
mainland China's attempt to take advantage of its character as a free
society to disintegrate it.</P>
      <P>Wu suggested that the government take concrete measures to build
a national consensus on national security and unity, since national
security takes precedence to all issues.</P>
      <P>The SEF official also repeated that Taiwan and mainland China
should first resume talks on technical issues, such as joint efforts
to crack down on crime and the signing of accords to protect Taiwan
business interest and travel safety in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The SEF is Taiwan's semi-official body in charge of negotiations
and exchanges with mainland China in the absence of official contact
between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S PRIVATE MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT SLUGGISH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   16   (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investment in Taiwan's domestic
manufacturing industries was sluggish while makers of electronic
parts and components significantly reduced the amount of investments
put into upgrading equipment, a recent survey indicated.</P>
      <P>A total of NT$108.84 billion (US$3.14 billion) was invested into
upgrading equipment in 1998 compared to NT$111.68 billion recorded in
the same period last year, a survey by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) indicated.</P>
      <P>The decline was mostly attributed to the semiconductor industry
as several large manufacturers, including Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp., postponing their plans for business expansion,
DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the sector's reluctance to invest would
lead to a reduction in growth of Taiwan's private manufacturing
investments to 14.7 percent in the last half of this year based on
projections.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS survey of domestic investment projects, in
July about NT$332.1 billion worth of investments is expected to be
put into the manufacturing sector by surveyed businesses. This figure
registers a 2.3 percent annual growth, but is down from January's
figure by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>However, despite the weakened investment environment, the DGBAS
predicted that Taiwan's annual growth in private investments will hit
19.7 percent this year. The two-digit rise is mainly attributed to
increased textile investment resulting in the sector's expanding
production capability, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS's July survey showed that domestic investment in the
electronic parts and components industry for the construction of
facilities was estimated to reach NT$11.14 billion in 1998, down 64.3
percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>In the sector of electrical engineering, the money to be injected
into construction projects is expected to be NT$197.36 billion this
year, down 49.2 percent from 1997, the survey said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Panama  City,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade between Taiwan and Panama is
increasing at a steady pace, Chen Ming-shi, an economics counselor at
the Republic of China Embassy to Panama said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$200 million worth of products to Panama during
the first half of this year, up 6 percent from the same period last
year. Imports from Panama were valued at US$3 million in the
six-month period, up 400 percent, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The imports were mostly aquatic products and hand-made art works,
Chen said. He noted that a trade fair will be held in Taipei from
Jan. 31 to Feb. 2 to introduce goods from ROC allied countries,
including Panama, to the Taiwan public.</P>
      <P>Last year, two-way trade between Taiwan and Panama amounted to
US$401 million, with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of over US$30
million, according to the ROC embassy.</P>
      <P>To help Panama's industrial development, experts from Taiwan have
held six conferences on the development of small- and medium-sized
enterprises in the Latin American country, Chen indicated. He also
mentioned that Panama and Taiwan signed an agreement on technology
cooperation last Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>In the near future, five Taiwan experts in food processing will
visit Panama to help upgrade local production.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taipei will also soon sign an agreement to offer US$10
million loans for Panamanian small- and medium-sized enterprises,
while at the same time the ROC government will invite Panamanian
officials in trade and industrial affairs to visit Taiwan to learn
about the island's successful economic development.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The troublesome times Singaporeans and
the government face ahead will lead to stronger ties if the two sides
are united in standing up against the economic crisis, Singapore
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew said Saturday.</P>
      <P>He noted that the turmoil in the region sparked by the economic
downturn was the most serious crisis Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and
his team have faced since Goh took charge in 1990.</P>
      <P>"It is the duty of leaders to instill confidence in the people so
that they will stand up to be counted, otherwise all is lost," Lee
said at a National Day dinner celebration.</P>
      <P>"When together they fight against all odds and win, a bond will
be forged between people and leaders, like the deep unshakable
feeling of trust between an army and its generals who have been in
battle," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He likened this to the bond between leaders of his generation and
people who during the 1960s fought against communism, communalism,
confrontation and the withdrawal of the British troops.</P>
      <P>Turning to the economy, Lee said as the "resource-poorest country
in the region", Singapore can not afford to be anything other than
honest, efficient and capable if it were to stay out of trouble.</P>
      <P>To maintain Singapore's competitiveness, costs would have to be
kept down, he said. A budget deficit was possible not only next year,
but also in 2000, he added.</P>
      <P>All major infrastructure projects would have to be brought
forward, even if they might not be needed immediately, to generate
increased economic activity, he said.</P>
      <P>Despite the troubled times ahead, Lee said he was confident
Singaporeans will pull through if they keep their nerve and stay on a
safe and steady course.</P>
      <P>"We have lived through more perilous days when we had less
resources, and we made it," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 200 Chinese Canadians demonstrated in
Ottawa Saturday to protest against the savage treatment of ethnic
Chinese in Indonesia during that country's May riots.</P>
      <P>The Chinese community, supported by other Canadians, urged
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to strongly condemn the
violation of human rights in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>In a petition signed by 1,600 people, the Federation of
Ottawa-Carleton Chinese organizations asked the Chretien government
to press Jakarta to conduct a thorough investigation into the racial
attacks and punish those found responsible.</P>
      <P>In the middle of the two-hour rally at Parliament Hill, two
community leaders were escorted by police into the Center Bloc to
submit the petition letter.</P>
      <P>Anton Cheng and Fred Wong were greeted by the security and
intelligence officer of the Prime Minister's Office, Burnie Bougesis,
who received the signed petition and promised to pass it onto
Chretien on Monday.</P>
      <P>"We, as Canadian citizens and citizens of the world, do not wish
to enter the next millennium with claims of progress in civilization
if we continue to ignore, or allow atrocities to continue against our
fellow human beings," the federation said in its petition.</P>
      <P>Last Saturday, more than 500 Chinese Canadians staged an angry
but peaceful rally in front of the Indonesian Embassy in Ottawa to
protest crimes of violence against Chinese Indonesians.</P>
      <P>During days of rioting which toppled President Suharto's regime,
many Chinese Indonesians were targeted in the looting and burning of
property, as well as violent assaults, reports said. Hundreds of
Chinese Indonesian women and girls, some as young as 10 years old,
were said to have been sexually assaulted and brutally gang raped.
Some of these victims were burned alive or murdered.</P>
      <P>All these crimes were allegedly committed by organized gangs with
links to Indonesia's security forces, the federation noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMICS WARN OF JAPAN'S SUPPORT FOR 'THREE NOES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei should prepare to counteract against
Tokyo's possible commitment to mainland China's "three noes" demand
with regard to Taiwan, academics at a seminar on Sunday said.</P>
      <P>The seminar, sponsored by the Chinese Culture Association, was
held to discuss mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's coming visit
to Japan where he is scheduled to meet with Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.</P>
      <P>During a recent trip to Beijing, Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahito Komura reportedly reached an agreement with mainland
authorities on the framework of a new joint communique on bilateral
ties to be announced during Jiang's visit early next month, according
to Taiwan newspapers.</P>
      <P>The news has prompted widespread concern here that Jiang will use
the occasion to seek Japan's verbal or written commitment to
Beijing's "three noes" regarding Taiwan -- no support for an
independent Taiwan, no support for "two Chinas," or "one China, one
Taiwan," and no support for Taiwan's membership into world bodies for
which statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Pang Shih-tang, a mainland affairs professor at the Tamkang
University, said Jiang will use his September visit to pressure Tokyo
into signing a third communique on the "three noes."</P>
      <P>Although Japan is not expected to jeopardize Taiwan's interests
in clinching such an agreement with mainland China, Taipei must relay
its position on the issue to Tokyo through proper channels, Pang
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would welcome Jiang's planned visit to Japan if the
purpose of the trip were solely to strengthen Tokyo-Beijing ties and
to find ways to fight the Asian financial crisis, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Jiang's visit is aimed at "something extra," Pang said,
adding that Jiang will undoubtedly seek to build a closer
Beijing-Tokyo relationship. Jiang is aware that a closer, long-term
strategical partnership with Japan will help him in the
Washington-Tokyo-Beijing relationship, the professor said.</P>
      <P>Chang Ling-cheng, a political science professor at the National
Taiwan University, said Jiang will pressure Japan to voice at least
verbal support for the "three noes" now that the United States and
the Philippines have done so.</P>
      <P>The government should pay greater heed to the possible adverse
effect on Taiwan, she warned.</P>
      <P>Echoing this view, Fu Jen Catholic University Professor Liang
Chung-min said he thinks Tokyo will give way to Beijing and sign a
new joint communique on the "three noes."</P>
      <P>Liang also expressed concern that Beijing is already trying to
undermine a number of the ROC's diplomatic partners, which he said is
something that the government must deal with properly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA-PACIFIC OPERATIONS CENTER PLAN BEARING FRUIT, THINK-TANK SAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's plan to develop itself into an
operations center in the Asia Pacific region has begun to pay off, an
economic think-tank said Monday.</P>
      <P>Since its inception two-and-a-half years ago, the Asia-Pacific
Regional Operations Center (APROC) has helped increase Taiwan's gross
domestic product (GDP) by 1.65 percentage points, increased two-way
trade by 0.7 percentage points, and expanded investment capital by
2.24 percentage points, said the private Chung-hua Institute for
Economic Research (CIER).</P>
      <P>The APROC plan, kicked off in 1995, is scheduled to be carried
out in the following three stages: 1995-1997, 1997-2000, and
2000-2005. The plan hopes to establish regional operations centers
for manufacturing, shipping, air transportation, banking,
telecommunications, and mass media by 2005.</P>
      <P>In its first stage of implementation, the APROC plan has led
government departments to amend 39 relevant bills, devise 90 new
administrative orders, and complete revisions to 35 administrative
policies in order to promote free trade and investment, bring down
barriers on professional personnel and capital movement, and
facilitate the movement of information.</P>
      <P>In a review of the APROC implementation after the plan entered
its second stage, the CIER, at the request of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), found that the
project has contributed significantly to the country's overall
economic growth in the last two-and-a-half years.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials attributed the achievement to deregulation of
government restrictions, privatization of state-own enterprises,
acceleration of government efficiency, and the inflow of capital, all
developments reportedly brought about by the plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC NATIONALS IN KINSHASA EVACUATED TO GABONESE REPUBLIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eight of the 10 Republic of China nationals
in the strife-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have been
evacuated to the neighboring Gabonese Republic, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Roy Wu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"The two staff members of the ROC representative office in
Kinshasa and six ROC expatriates in the DRC's capital arrived in
Gabon via a leased small commercial plane early this morning," Wu
said in response to a press inquiry.</P>
      <P>Wu said the evacuees, including Hsiao Kuang-yu, chief of the ROC
mission in Kinshasa, arrived in Libreville, capital of the Gabonese
Republic, at 7 a.m. Monday (Taipei time.)</P>
      <P>The seven other evacuees were Hsu Kai-ping, secretary of the ROC
mission in Kinshasa, and six citizens identified as Chiang-Chen
Ling-hua, Hsu Mei-lan, Chan Kai-wen, Chan Kai-yi, Chan Kai-yueh (a
3-month-old baby boy) and Hsu Sung-hung.</P>
      <P>Wu said through the arrangement of the ROC representative office
in the DRC, ROC expatriates in Gabon greeted Hsiao and the other
evacuees from Kinshasa at Libreville's international airport.</P>
      <P>Most of the evacuees are scheduled to return to Taipei in the
near future, Wu said, adding that two other ROC nationals -- Chiang
San-lung and Chan Chia-fa -- were unwilling to leave the DRC and are
still in Kinshasa.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said the Belgian embassy in Kinshasa
originally agreed to allow ROC nationals onto its chartered flight
leaving the DRC.</P>
      <P>As gunshots were heard in Kinshasa on Sunday, a large number of
expatriates from Belgium, France and other European Union (EU) member
states swarmed the Kinshasa International Airport.</P>
      <P>The Belgian embassy then told the ROC mission that it had to back
away from its promise to transport ROC nationals because it was
required to evacuate Belgian, French and other EU expatriates first.</P>
      <P>With the situation in the DRC worsening, the ROC mission decided
to rent a small commercial aircraft to evacuate its expatriates to
Gabon, diplomatic sources said, adding that the ROC government will
assume the evacuation costs.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, a coalition of Tutsi
rebels, Rwandan soldiers and disgruntled members of President Laurent
Kabila's army had captured the western Congo river port town of
Matadi and are fighting to take up positions closer to Kinshasa.</P>
      <P>The DRC was previously known as Zaire. The ROC first established
diplomatic relations with Zaire in 1960, but cut such ties in early
1973 after the French-speaking central African state switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in late 1972.</P>
      <P>In June 1991, the ROC signed an agreement with Zaire on the
exchange of representative offices. The ROC's representative office
in Kinshasa was inaugurated in July 1991. Zaire changed its national
title to the Republic of Congo in May 1997.</P>

      <P>Human forces fighting the massive floods
along the Yangtze River are in a losing battle as Beijing leaders are
claiming victory, The Times of India reported from Hong Kong Sunday.</P>
      <P>The daily noted that the mainland's top three officials,
President Jiang Zemin, National People's Congress Chairman Li Peng,
and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, have all been shown on state
television visiting flood stricken areas during the last few days.</P>
      <P>Their visits, like most of the coverage of the floods in China,
"are all being placed in the context of a glorious victory being won
against the Yangtze by the forces assembled by the Chinese Communist
Party", the New Delhi-based English daily reported.</P>
      <P>About a million People's Liberation Army soldiers, or roughly
one-third of its combat strength, have been fighting the forces of
nature but are almost certain to lose the battle, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Downplaying the damages of the massive floods, said to be the
worst since 1954, is self-defeating and makes little sense, the
report noted.</P>
      <P>Predictions on the disaster's effect on the country's economic
growth have been vastly understated, as is the official death toll of
2,000, The Times of India said. In the floods of 1954, an estimated
30,000 people lost their lives and 30 million people were effected.</P>
      <P>With the rains unlikely to cease before October, the daily
estimated that the damage and dislocation of people brought about by
the floods will have a "lasting impact well into 1999 and even
beyond."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new species of indigenous edible mushroom
has been successfully developed by the Taiwan Agriculture Research
Institute (TARI) and is being commercially cultivated by farmers in
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chinfu mushroom, the island's largest fungus recently put on
supermarket shelves for a trial run, is in hot demand despite its
high price tag of NT$1,000 (US$29) a kilogram, sources from the
Council of Agriculture (COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The tasty and fleshy fungus was produced after TARI began
researching seven agarics of this species -- tricholoma giganteum in
academic terms -- since 1994.</P>
      <P>Commercial cultivation began this year, enabling the large
fungus, which reportedly tastes like chicken, to be marketed as an
ordinary vegetable, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>The chinfu mushroom, a genetic-revised species of Taiwan's
indigenous tricholoma giganteum, is also one of the largest fungi
species in the world. Unlike other species of mushrooms, the chinfu
has a small cap and a large thick stalk. Because its stalk tastes
like chicken meat and can be shredded and cooked like shredded
chicken meat, the fungus is also called "the shredded chicken
mushroom."</P>
      <P>A clump of the fungus, also called "the king's mushroom" by the
Japanese, can be as large as one kilogram with individual stems as
thick as a ball-point pen. It stands at an average of 20-centimeters
high.</P>
      <P>The chinfu mushroom is promising to become a new savior to
Taiwan's beleaguered mushroom farmers hit by slow exports and the
promise of Taiwan's World Trade Organization bid which will allow the
import of foreign-grown mushrooms into the island, COA officials

    <HEADLINE>SITUATION IN INDONESIA QUIET AMID UNREST RUMORS: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Monday that the situation in Indonesia was quiet amid fears of
unrest on the nation's Independence Day.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesperson Roy Wu made the remarks after the ministry
contacted the ROC's representative office in Jakarta in the morning.</P>
      <P>The office reported that the Indonesian government, paying heed
to unrest rumors, sent 15,000 troops and police to patrol the
Indonesian capital. The situation is under control and no incidents
have been reported, it added.</P>
      <P>MOFA has instructed the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in
Jakarta, the de facto ROC embassy in Indonesia, to be on guard and
maintain regular contact with the Indonesian government, overseas
Chinese groups, and Taiwan businessmen to ensure the safety of ROC
nationals.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said ROC Representative Lu Pao-sun and Deputy
Representative Chang Yung-lang have been invited to attend
festivities marking the independence of Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Rumors of fresh unrest circulated as the national holiday
approached, leading many in Jakarta to leave the city particularly
those among the ethnic Chinese community which has been the target of
violence and looting in the past.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC financial officials said exports to Indonesia
decreased in the first seven months of this year.</P>
      <P>They said exports to Indonesia in the first seven months totaled
US$601.1 million, down US$657.7 million, or 52.2 percent from the
same period last year. Meanwhile imports from Indonesia totaled
US$1.21 billion during the same period, down US$56.2 million, or 4.4
percent form the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The officials said after the unrest broke out in May, exports to
Indonesia dropped to US$66.9 million in July alone.</P>
      <P>They added that since the riots, which eventually toppled former
President Suharto, local ethnic Chinese have moved out of Indonesia
and investments by Taiwan businessmen also dropped significantly.</P>
      <P>If there is fresh unrest, the recovery of Taiwan's trade with
Indonesia to earlier levels may take longer, the officials added.</P>

      <P>Protesters gathered in front of the
Indonesian Embassy in Canberra Monday demanding that former
Indonesian President Suharto be tried for the atrocities committed
against ethnic Chinese during the May riots.</P>
      <P>The over 130 protesters included migrants from Taiwan, Hong Kong,

      <P>Rain dampened some spirits as organizers expected a much larger
turnout. Another rally of about 1,000 people was called off because
of the continued rain.</P>
      <P>Several of the rally's speakers accused the Indonesian government
of not protecting the ethnic Chinese during the May riots, in which
168 Chinese women, including a nine year old, were reportedly
gang-raped, molested and some killed, while many others suffered
massive property losses after their houses and shops were
looted and burned down.</P>
      <P>Rally speaker Beverly Hong, senior lecturer at the Australian

ethnic Chinese as scapegoats during the May riots after Jakarta was
unable to resolve its financial and economic problems.</P>

      <P>A senior official with the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) said on Monday that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should treat each other with respect.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow made the
appeal in response to a newspaper report that Li Yafei, deputy
secretary-general of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), demanded the removal of an ROC
national flag in a conference room during his July 24-31 visit.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times said in a front-page article that Li asked Ken
Jung-shui, secretary-general of the Taipei-based Great Wall Cultural
Foundation, to remove an ROC flag in the press briefing room in the
management office of the Kenting National Park on the southernmost
tip of the island on July 30.</P>
      <P>Without the permission of the Kenting park management office, the
paper said, Ken moved the flag to the office's storage house next to
the press room.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted unnamed government sources as saying that if
similar incidents were to take place again, the government will
consider suspending exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Shi said he still does not have the
full details about incident. "I'll look into the case to gain a
better understanding," he said.</P>
      <P>Shi also expressed the hope that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will engage with each other with a healthy attitude.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing SEF and ARATS staff members treat each
other with respect and avoid taking any actions that will embarrass
the other side," Shi stressed.</P>
      <P>As to whether Ken's actions constituted an offense to the
Criminal Code, which stipulates that no person is be permitted to
insult the country's national flag, Shi said he is not in a position
to comment on the issue. "It's up to law enforcement authorities to
make a judgment," he added.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies authorized by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS URGE STRATEGY  TO  DEAL  WITH  OBUCHI-JIANG MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei should work out a comprehensive
strategy to minimize the impact of mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Japan in September, local academics said Monday.</P>
      <P>The remarks were made in a public hearing hosted by Legislator
Chen Hung-chi of the ruling Kuomintang at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen called the public hearing amid concerns that Beijing will
push Tokyo to codify the so-called "three noes" toward Taiwan while
Jiang is in Japan.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, Tokyo and Beijing will sign a third
joint communique during Jiang's visit expressing their intention to
forge a long-term strategic relationship.</P>
      <P>Although Japan has reportedly yet to decide whether to include
Beijing's "three noes" into the joint communique, Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi is likely to throw verbal support behind the
"three noes" in his speech at a welcoming party for Jiang, the
reports said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Shen-chan, president of the Japanese Studies Association of
the Republic of China, said that due to its geographic proximity,
Japan is more concerned over the mainland China and more cautious in
its exchanges with Beijing than the United States or European
countries.</P>
      <P>He believed that the Obuchi-Jiang meeting will not go beyond the
Clinton-Jiang meeting, and that the "three noes" policy will not be
spelled out.</P>
      <P>Liang Chung-min, associate professor of Fu Jen Catholic
University, said Taiwan must step up its diplomatic efforts in all
directions and work out separate approaches to countries that have
and do not have diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>He said civilian exchanges between Taiwan and Japan are friendly,
but national interests should take precedence over civilian
interests. The ROC has to think of what Tokyo may do from the
viewpoint of Japan's national interests.</P>
      <P>Pan Hsi-tan of Tamkang University said there could be three
possible outcomes of Jiang's meeting with Obuchi. One is the written
support of the "three noes," verbal support for the policy, or
neither a written nor verbal support for the policy.</P>
      <P>Japan may follow US foreign policy and make a verbal support to
the "three noes," Pan said, adding that as Japan is seeking a
permanent seat in the United Nations' Security Council, its attitude
is clear.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to map out a strategy and prepare very
cautiously for the Obuchi-Jiang meeting.</P>
      <P>If the "three noes" policy is written down on paper, it could
cast a shadow over the high-level talks between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait scheduled for October, Pan said.</P>
      <P>In such an event, the cross-strait talks may be postponed further
as the ROC may think Beijing still harbors hostility toward the
island, and the ROC may fall into Beijing's trap if it resumes talks
too soon, he added.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" came into the limelight after US President Bill
Clinton mentioned them at a roundtable meeting in Shanghai during his
recent mainland visit. The "three noes" refer to no support for an
independent Taiwan, no support for "two Chinas" or a "one Taiwan, one
China," and no support for Taiwan's bid to enter international
organizations for which statehood is a requirement.</P>

prosperous Taiwan gives the people in mainland China and Hong Kong
greater hope for a democratic way of life," Lee said, adding "We also
believe that China must reunify in the future, but that it must be
reunified under a democratic system."</P>
      <P>"The people on Taiwan cannot accept the undemocratic 'one
country, two systems' arrangement, and we cannot abandon our 87 years
of history and 52 years as a constitutional sovereign country and
turn ourselves into a local government," Lee pointed out.</P>
      <P>Asking Taiwan to meet all its responsibilities while denying
Taiwan's right to participate in international organizations, even to
observe, makes a mockery of the ideas of a global community that
pursues human rights and justice, Lee stated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1% OF TAIWAN'S POLICE OWN MERCEDES, LEGISLATOR SAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 1 percent of Taiwan's police force
drive expensive German cars of Mercedes Benz, and about 80 percent of
these cars are registered under the officers' own names, a ruling
Kuomintang legislator said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Legislator Hsu Chung-hsiung, quoting a recent
survey conducted by Kashide Taiwan, said that out of Taiwan's roughly
80,000 policemen, 767 of them drive Mercedes Benzes. The figure does
not include officers with other models of imported luxury cars.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the number of police-owned Mercedes
Benzes was particularly high in counties where businesses operate on
the edge of legality. These included Yunlin, Changhua, Chiayi, Taipei
and Taoyuan Counties, it said.</P>
      <P>It is a phenomenon worthy of further study, said Hsu, given that
it is almost impossible for a grass roots police officer making a
monthly salary of NT$50,000-NT$60,000 (US$1,458-1,749) to buy a
Mercedes Benz E220 worth NT$2.3 million (US$67,055) without other
sources of income.</P>
      <P>Officials from the National Police Administration were shocked by
the revelation, saying that the agency will begin an investigation
into the matter soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC COMMENTS ON REPORTS OF JIANG'S REFORM PLANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Monday a report on Beijing's plan to promote
political reforms was denied by mainland authorities to prevent
social uncertainty.</P>
      <P>The Asian Wall Street Journal reported on its July 23 issue that
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin ordered advisers and
researchers at government-run think tanks to study the possibility of
implementing various political reforms in the mainland, including
establishing presidential elections and a multi-party system,
separating the party from the army, and strengthening the rule of
law.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Social Science has
officially denied the report, but the MAC, the highest government
agency in charge of charting Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
said the denial may have been issued to prevent widespread social
unrest resulting from increased public demand for political reforms
in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Increased economic and social developments in mainland China have
forced Beijing leaders to face the people's call for democracy, a
core issue which Beijing cannot ignore and dodge as a pluralistic
society is emerging, the MAC analyzed.</P>
      <P>The MAC offered four possible reasons why Jiang may be
interested in introducing political reforms.</P>
      <P>One reason is that following the recent riots and upheaval in
Indonesia, Jiang must be aware that political reforms and the rule of
law should be further boosted to crack down on corruption and
inefficiency if mainland China is to become a genuine world power and
establish a real market economy.</P>
      <P>Another reason may be due to Jiang's confidence in his political
base. Following his two summit meetings with US President Bill
Clinton and the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China last fall, Jiang may think he has full control of the
mainland's economics and politics. He may also believe that the
mainland is now capable of enduring the impact of discussing issues
related to human rights.</P>
      <P>Also, Jiang may be trying to ensure continued political and
economic development in mainland China by promoting political reforms
step by step. Direct elections in some small villages have made the
international community believe that mainland China is becoming a
more open and pluralistic society.</P>
      <P>Finally, in an effort to consolidate a legacy in the post-Deng
era, Jiang may be seeking to stay in power longer by amending the
constitution to allow him to serve a third four-year term as
president. Jiang is scheduled to step down in 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>A DEVALUED RENMINBI WOULD BENEFIT TAIWAN &amp; HK'S INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Wang Mann-na &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong investors in
mainland China would be benefited by a devalued renminbi rather than
be adversely effected, businessmen from the two sides said.</P>
      <P>The continued reports and rumors about the possible devaluation
of mainland China's currency has resulted in a common concern that it
would effect Taiwan and Hong Kong's economies. However, this was
dismissed by Taiwan and Hong Kong businesspeople investing in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Goo Guomin, board member of a small- and medium-sized enterprises
commercial association in Hong Kong, pointed out on Monday that Hong
Kong's small- and medium-sized enterprises in the Chinese mainland
have been focusing primarily on production and trade.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if the Chinese currency were to be devalued while the
Hong Kong dollar remained stable, it will be beneficial to Hong Kong
investors, Goo said. This is because Hong Kong investors' businesses
in the mainland are mostly engaged in importing raw materials which
are re-exported after being processed.</P>
      <P>If the renminbi were to be devalued, Goo said, there would be no
loss incurred from the foreign exchange, instead, a cut in the
expenditure of wages and rent of the plant would occur.</P>
      <P>Taiwan investors are also largely engaged in this type of
processing and re-exporting business. Due to concern over a possible
devaluation of the renminbi, many Taiwan investors have exchanged
their profits into Hong Kong dollars or US dollars which has recently
resulted in a devaluation of the Chinese yuan on the black market.</P>
      <P>Most Taiwan and Hong Kong investors in the mainland believe the
devaluation of the renminbi will have a more psychological impact
than one effecting businesses.</P>
      <P>However, some Taiwan investors who have permission to sell
domestically in the mainland, will be affected negatively.
Nevertheless, these businesspeople accounted for only a small part of
Taiwan investment interests in the mainland. Most investors from
Taiwan and Hong Kong in the business of processing and re-exporting
products would benefit if the renminbi were devalued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, US MAY SIGN JUDICIAL ASSISTANCE PACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is interested in signing
a judiciary assistance agreement with the Republic of China, but it
remains uncertain when such an accord can be formally sealed, a
senior Ministry of Justice (MOJ) official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>MOJ Vice Minister Chiang Hao made the remarks in response to a
newspaper report that the United States will send officials to Taipei
next month to discuss a long-talked-about judicial assistance accord
aimed at facilitating bilateral cooperation in fighting crimes.</P>
      <P>The report also said the United States has sent a draft pact to
Taipei and that the MOJ will call an inter-ministerial meeting to
review the content of the US-drafted accord.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Chiang said the United States has
expressed a desire to sign a judicial assistance pact with the ROC to
lay out a framework for bilateral cooperation in cracking down on
cross-border drug trafficking, money laundering and other criminal
activities.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chiang said, it is still not clear when American
representatives will come to Taipei to exchange views on related
issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu said the two
countries have consistently cooperated in fighting cross-border
criminal activities and have helped each other in accordance with
their respective legal regulations.</P>
      <P>Under the ROC's statute governing the handling of cases
commissioned by foreign courts, Wu said, relevant government agencies
can offer such assistance only in a limited number of fields and are
subject to many complicated procedures.</P>
      <P>With cross-border criminal activities, including drug
trafficking, money laundering and computer hacking, becoming ever
more rampant, Wu said the two sides have felt an increased urgency to
sign a formal agreement to make it easier for expanded judiciary
assistance to facilitate joint anti-crime operations.</P>
      <P>As the signing of such an agreement involves many problems, Wu
said, the two countries must prudently mull all related issues.
"Bilateral consultations will continue to go ahead, but we do not
have a timetable for concluding the discussion," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the United Daily News, the United States agreed to
send officials to Taipei in September to discuss guiding principles
for the proposed accord at MOJ officials' request.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted unidentified sources as saying that MOJ
officials took advantage of their visit to Washington, D.C. early
this month to attend an ROC-US sub-Cabinet-level meeting to discuss
the issue with their counterparts from the US Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The paper further said the United States plans to brief Beijing
authorities on its main purposes for signing the pact with the ROC in
an effort to soften Beijing's opposition to the proposed
Taipei-Washington accord.</P>
      <P>As signing such a pact involves sovereignty issues, the paper
said, Beijing has strongly opposed the plan.</P>
      <P>The United States recognizes Beijing while maintaining close
substantive ties with Taipei.</P>

separatist movement leaders to help maintain stability in the region.</P>
      <P>According to the broadcasting monitored here, the "Independence"

close attention to the situations there. The Uygurs in Xinjiang
demand separation from mainland China and want to establish an "East
Turkistan" state.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said Russia doesn't want the situation in Central
Asia to become volatile. Therefore, Moscow should support "peaceful
dialogues" between Beijing leaders and Xinjiang separatists, and help
promote economic development in the region for the welfare of all
the people living there.</P>
      <P>The newspaper also said that Moscow should condemn terrorist
activities in Xinjiang, criticize Beijing and its local government in
Xinjiang for violation of human rights and the economic and political
freedoms of the people living there, and scold those "foreign forces"
that are trying to make troubles in the region.</P>
      <P>The broadcasting also said that some Muslim countries are
holding sympathy for the Xinjiang separatists. Saudi Arabia, for
example, "often gives money and ideas to the separatists in
Xinjiang," the radio station said in the broadcasting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 4,000 Chinese-Filipinos gathered
on Monday in front of the Indonesian Embassy in Manila to protest the
atrocities against ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia's May riots.</P>
      <P>Angry roars burst from the throats of the protesters, who
demanded that the Indonesian authorities punish those responsible for
the rapes and killings of ethnic Chinese residents, compensate the
victims, and improve the treatment of ethnic Chinese living in the
Southeast Asian nation.</P>
      <P>A leader of the protest group, composed of members of Christian,
Muslim, Buddhist, human rights, and ethnic Chinese organizations,
delivered a letter of protest to embassy authorities, asking for a
full investigation into the anti-Chinese atrocities, a comprehensive
compensation policy, and legal protection for all minorities in
Indonesia, including Chinese.</P>
      <P>The group also called for global economic sanctions against
Indonesia, where racism against ethnic Chinese has simmered for many
years. At the same time, it urged international financial
institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, World Bank,
and Asian Development Bank, not to offer economic aid to Indonesia
until it has improved its treatment of ethnic Chinese.</P>
      <P>Nearly 200 ethnic Chinese women were reported raped or murdered
in the social unrest in May which led to the downfall of former
President Suharto. Numerous Chinese-owned houses and buildings were
ransacked and burned.</P>
      <P>The "ethnic cleansing" atrocities have been blamed mainly on the
collapsed economy caused by the Asian financial meltdown. Although
the ethnic Chinese population in Indonesia accounts for just 4
percent of the population, it controls much of the country's economy.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang
arrived in Manila on Monday at the head of a 33-member Taiwan
delegation for the 1998 joint economic cooperation conference between
Taiwan and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>During the two-day meeting, which will open on Tuesday, the two
sides will discuss bilateral cooperation in the fields of trade,
investment, tourism, labor, technology, and agriculture.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he will propose at the meeting that the
Philippines allow foreign investors to enjoy sole business ownership,
and allow foreign nationals to own land for industrial use.</P>
      <P>He further said he will also ask the Philippines to support
Taiwan's bid to become a dialogue partner of the Association of
Southeast Nations (ASEAN), to establish a reasonable brokerage system
for its export of laborers to Taiwan, and to improve its management
of the Subic Bay Industrial Park, in which Taiwan is a major
investor.</P>
      <P>The Philippines is one of Taiwan's major sources of foreign
labor, with more than 100,000 Filipinos currently working on the

      <P>The annual conference, first held in 1992, has contributed
greatly to promoting economic cooperation between the two countries.
Taiwan is now the Philippines' fourth-largest trading partner, and

    <HEADLINE>AIRCRAFT FLIGHT SAFETY COMMISSION FORMALLY INAUGURATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Aircraft Flight Safety Commission
under the Cabinet formally became operational on Monday, marking a
step forward in establishing an overall flight safety control system
on the island.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Premier Vincent Siew said
the commission will operate independently. "I hope all commission
members will perform their duties fairly and impartially for
building up the commission's credibility," he urged.</P>
      <P>The premier pointed out that the commission is expected to
fulfill two main tasks: investigating and inspecting causes of flight
accidents or mishaps, as well as examining and evaluating flight
safety control systems and measures at all local air companies.</P>
      <P>"We hope the commission will come up with flight safety
improving measures through performing the two main duties," Siew
said, adding that the commission is expected to make judgment, not
to assume the responsibility of flight safety management.</P>
      <P>Siew said the inauguration of the commission just marks a modest
step forward in upgrading the country's overall flight safety level.
"Improvement of flight safety requires concerted and continued
efforts of all relevant personnel," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that a series of tragic flight accidents occurring
earlier this year were caused by a combination of factors, Siew said
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) should
cooperate closely with the new commission and formulate a
comprehensive civil aviation development policy and a stricter flight
safety control system based on the commission's recommendations.</P>
      <P>"The MOTC should also direct the Civil Aeronautics
Administration to faithfully carry out its duty of pushing all
commercial carriers to improve flight safety measures and overseeing
operations of the overall flight safety control system," Siew said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet decided to set up an independent flight safety
commission in March following a series of air crashes involving
local airlines early this year, which resulted in the death of more
than 200 crew members and passengers.</P>
      <P>The commission was established on May 25, but it didn't begin
formal operations until Monday for failing to find an appropriate
office.</P>
      <P>Wong Cheng-yi, chairman of the five-member commission, said the
commision has forged dialogue channels and cooperative ties with its
counterparts in the United States, Canada and Australia.</P>
      <P>The commission has also finalized a blueprint for establishing a
flight safety report system, a flight mishaps databank, and a
laborartory for decoding the "black box" recordings.</P>
      <P>The commission will employ eight to 10 professional air crash
investigators and flight safety controllers as well as several
engineers and technicians to probe flight mishaps and carry out some
technical work.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen attending a seminar in
central Changhua County complained on Monday about the Taiwan
authorities' inability to protect their interests in mainland China,
and said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should begin talks on the
issue soon.</P>
      <P>The seminar, sponsored by Ko Chin-ter, a Changhua County
councilor of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), was also
attended by officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), and the semi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Apart from complaining that their personal safety is not fully
protected in mainland China, the businessmen urged the government to
negotiate and sign accords with mainland China as soon as possible on
investment guarantees, trade, and judicial arbitration.</P>
      <P>They also called on the government to publish regular reports of
incidents involving Taiwan businessmen in the mainland, strengthen
the SEF's ability to handle emergencies, and help Taiwan
entrepreneurs to set up a national association in the mainland to
boost communication among them.</P>
      <P>Lien Cheng-shih, deputy director of the SEF's Department of
Economic and Trade Services, said the SEF has received a total of 485
complaints from Taiwan businessmen arising from trade disputes since
its founding in late 1991, 271 of which were forwarded to its
mainland China counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- for help. However, ARATS handled only 82
of the cases, he added.</P>
      <P>An official from the MAC's Department of Economic Affairs said
the scale of investment plans by Taiwan firms in mainland China has
decreased over the past two years since cross-strait relations began
to sour in mid-1996 following a series of missile tests and military
exercises by Beijing in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MAC official added that the scale of Taiwan investment, which
averages some US$57,000 per project, is expected to continue to
decline because of the recent kidnap-murder in the mainland late last
month of Lin Ti-chuang, a Kaohsiung City councilwoman and DPP member.</P>
      <P>Lin was abducted and murdered by a group of armed men during a
private visit to northeastern Liaoning Province. Initial
investigations by local police indicate that Lin's death was the
result of a business dispute between her boyfriend and his mainland
business partners.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE PM URGED NOT TO VOICE `THREE NOES' POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of Republic of China National
Assembly deputies called on Monday for Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi not to voice the so-called "three noes" policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a letter to Obuchi, six deputies expressed their concern that
Taiwan's interests might be sacrificed as a result of a September
visit to Japan by mainland China's President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>The letter, signed by Tang Pi-o (KMT), Lan shih-tsun (KMT), Chen
San-si (independent), Chiang Wen-ju (independent), Tsai Chung-chih
(DPP), and Chen Chien-ming (DPP), was sent to the Interchange
Association's Taipei Office, which was expected to forward the
message to the Japanese prime minister.</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association represents Japanese interests in
Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>The deputies said in the letter that as a key member of the Asian
community, the Japanese government's diplomatic utterances and
activities serve as an example for other Asian countries. They
expressed the hope that Tokyo will not bow to pressure from Beijing
to make an acknowledgment similar the one reiterated by US President
Bill Clinton during his visit to mainland China earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The so-called "three noes" policy spelled out by Clinton states
that the US does not support Taiwan independence, does not support
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and does not support
Taiwan's membership in international organizations for which
statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Tang said that at a time when Japanese-mainland China engagement
might result in an outcome harmful to Taiwan's interests, Taipei
should clearly express its position that the future of Taiwan should
be decided by the people of the island, and not by the United States,
Japan, or mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TRADE DEFICIT WITH JAPAN TO SURGE TO HISTORIC HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan is
expected to increase to US$18 billion this year, the highest level in
history, the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA)
estimated on Monday.</P>
      <P>CETRA researchers said their surveys show that Taiwan's exports
to Japan have consistently sustained a two-digit decline over the
past 12 months, with a 25 percent drop registered for July.</P>
      <P>In the same month, Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan had
accumulated to US$10.5 billion since the beginning of this year, the
experts said.</P>
      <P>They attributed the growing deficit to drops in Japan's consuming
expenditure which have continued for 18 months. The serious
depreciation of the Japanese yen was also blamed.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan suffered a trade deficit of US$17.3 billion to
Japan, according to CETRA statistics.</P>
      <P>To try to reduce this enormous deficit, the officials said that
the Ministry of Economic Affairs has mapped out plans to increase
exports to Japan, especially electronic products, computers and
telecommunication products, metal, financial services, mechanical
products, plastic goods, furniture, household appliances, bicycles
and their parts and components, toys, and sports equipment.</P>
      <P>Japan is Taiwan's second-largest trade partner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACCUSATIONS AGAINST MERCEDES-OWNING POLICE REBUTTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Administration on
Monday rebutted an accusation leveled by a legislator that some
grassroots police officers might have used corrupt means to buy
expensive German Mercedes Benz cars.</P>
      <P>NPA spokesman Liang Chien-ming expressed regret at Legislator Hsu
Chung-hsiung's suggestion, saying it has smeared the image of the
police and dealt a blow to police morale.</P>
      <P>Liang said that a NT$1.4 million Mercedes Benz "should be within
the reach of everyone in Taiwan" as car dealers usually offer
three-year zero interest to buyers. In addition, he said, considering
economic margins, a Mercedes is a good choice.</P>
      <P>Police supervisors usually take heed if their subordinates begin
running an expensive car, Liang said, adding that as part of efforts
to stem corruption, policemen's' assets are checked at the end of each
year.</P>
      <P>The authenticity of the statistics released by Hsu was also
questioned. Liang said that Hsu's statistics show that the number of
police-owned Mercedes in Kaohsiung city stand at 53, when according
to him, the figure is "only 19."</P>
      <P>In a written news release issued later, the NPA said that
according to its own statistics, police officers in Taiwan own scores
of Mercedes and over 100 BMWs.</P>
      <P>Quoting a survey conducted by Kashide Taiwan, Hsu said in a press
conference held earlier in the day that of the some 80,000 policemen
around the island, 767 drive Mercedes.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that for a grass roots police officer who earns between
NT$50,000 and NT$60,000 per month, it is almost impossible to buy a
Mercedes E220 worth NT$2.3 million without another source of income.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's "pragmatic" policy toward Taiwan
will not be affected by US President Bill Clinton's "three noes"
statement on Taiwan made during his recent visit to mainland China,
David Mulroney, director of the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei, said
on Monday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Mulroney, who arrived in Taipei to
assume his new post two weeks ago, said that his country's China
policy is a "made in Canada policy," and that Clinton's "three noes"
statement will not change substantially Canada's relationship with
Beijing or any other government in the region.</P>
      <P>Clinton's "three noes" statement made clear that his
administration will not support Taiwan independence, "two Chinas," or
"one China, one Taiwan," or Taiwan's entry to any international
organization that requires statehood for membership.</P>
      <P>Responding to an interviewer's question, the 43-year-old Canadian
representative in Taipei said: "We maintain a one-China policy.
Within that, there is much we can do."</P>
      <P>"For example," he said, "in terms of our relationship with
Taiwan, we are cognizant of the realities of the situation locally.
And we try to ensure that whatever we do is for the benefit of the
people in the region and contributes to the ultimate peaceful
resolution of the (Taiwan) issue."</P>
      <P>In his view, he said, Canada has maintained a successful
"pragmatic" policy toward Taiwan because it is "always seeking to
develop a relationship within the limits of a clearly defined
policy."</P>
      <P>Mulroney pointed out that Canada has been supportive of Taiwan's
participation in the Asia Pacific Economic forum and of its accession
to the World Trade Organization, although it does not back Taiwan's
effort to rejoin the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"By and large, we support Taiwan's participation that fits in the
overall criteria of our policy," he said.

    <HEADLINE>PROJECT PLANNED TO EXPAND DOMESTIC DEMAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman P. K. Chiang of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), on Monday
presided over a ministerial meeting to discuss a project aimed at
expanding domestic demand.</P>
      <P>The draft project, which will focus on how to strengthen public
investment on the one hand, and how to promote private investment on
the other, will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for further
discussion at a meeting scheduled for Thursday.</P>
      <P>Public investment is estimated to reach NT$187.3 billion(US$5.4
billion), and private investment might go up to more than NT$54
billion, giving a total of NT$241.4 billion (US$6.95 billion) for the
two-year project, up from the original NT$200 billion.</P>
      <P>Chiang stressed that the project is needed to cope with the
impact of the Asian financial turmoil which has greatly reduced the
Republic of China's export surplus. He said he expects the project
will improve the health of the ROC's economy, help maintain long-term
economic growth, and be conducive to the Asian economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD chief, the Asian region's economic
stability will depend very much on development in Indonesia, Japan,
and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chiang expressed his hope that the new Japanese Diet, or
parliament, will soon pass new laws to help stabilize or even bring
about a recovery in its stock and foreign exchange markets. He said
he believes these measures will be helpful not only to the Japanese
economy, but also to the whole Asian economy and the stability of
mainland China's renminbi.</P>
      <P>The CEPD estimated that the implementation of the project will
contribute about 0.23 percent to Taiwan's economic growth this year
and about 0.67 percent next year. This boost would push Taiwan's
economic growth rate in 1998 to about 5.03, the lowest since 1985.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Finance Minister Wang Yung-chou reiterated after
the meeting that his ministry will give its full cooperation in
raising funds for the implementation of the project, while Finance
Minister Paul Chiu said the ministry will enhance the implementation
of loans to first-time house-buyers if necessary.</P>

      <P>The families of the victims of last year's
Lincoln Mansions collapse will appeal on Tuesday to the Executive
Yuan for its help in obtaining compensation from the construction
company which built the ill-fated apartment blocks.</P>
      <P>One of the organizers of the event said that the Taipei County
government has failed to help them seek compensation, which is why
they are switching their appeal to the central government on the
first anniversary of the disaster.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 18, 1997, four five-story buildings in Taipei County's
"Big Lincoln" community, built on steep mountain slopes, collapsed
after being hit by a landslide caused by Typhoon Winnie, claiming the
lives of 28 people and injuring another 50.</P>
      <P>However, according to a written news release issued by the Taipei
County government, the local government has taken action by freezing
the 268 lots of land owned by the constructor, Lee Chung-hsien.</P>
      <P>It also said that among the 28 victims, the families of 25 have
already reached compensation agreements with the construction
company. Those who have not made a deal with the company have
received comfort money and funeral subsidies.</P>
      <P>As for the question of compensation for property losses, 70
percent of the house owners have already reached agreement with the
construction company, and a final agreement is expected to be reached
after negotiations with the loaning bank.</P>

      <P>The accord between the United States and
Taiwan on Taipei's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
will help Beijing's bid to join the global trade body, according to
reports from the Geneva-based world trade body on Monday.</P>
      <P>The WTO report quoted a trade official as saying the bilateral
deal struck between Washington and Taipei a week ago will not result
in Taiwan's gaining entry to the WTO ahead of Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The US-Taiwan bilateral accord will be beneficial in speeding up
negotiations on China's WTO entry," the report quoted the official as
saying.</P>
      <P>Beijing has long insisted on political grounds that mainland
China must enter the trade-governing body before Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most WTO members have tacitly accepted Beijing's stance, despite
criticism that it makes Taiwan a hostage to the slow pace of trade
liberalization by the less open mainland.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's negotiations are dragging as the United States
and other key WTO members balk at Beijing's insistence on keeping
high tariffs on major industrial products, and at the narrow scope of
its liberalization of the financial, agriculture and distribution
sectors.</P>
      <P>The WTO report said that as of May, only nine of the mainland's
36 trading partners had concluded bilateral entry negotiations, while
Taiwan has to complete bilateral WTO talks with just the European
Union, Canada, and Hong Kong.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The cost to Australia's Medicare of
acupuncture treatment reached US$10 million in 1996 as more general
practitioners are turning to the traditional Chinese treatment, the
Sydney Morning Herald said Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite little evidence that acupuncture is effective, 15 percent
of the country's general practitioners applied for Medicare rebate
for the treatment. The number is believed to be a conservative
estimate of the total use of the technique.</P>
      <P>Professor Paul Komesaroff from the Department of Medicine at
Monash University in Melbourne said the effectiveness and risks of
acupuncture have not been sufficiently studied.</P>
      <P>Acupuncture can damage nerves, blood vessels, the chest cavity, 
the lung, and the spinal cord, he said, adding that if needles are
not properly disinfected, they can cause infection, even hepatitis or
HIV infection.</P>
      <P>Regulation of acupuncturists and other practitioners of
traditional Chinese medicine will be introduced from 1999 in Victoria
and could be adopted nationally after a Victoria committee recently
stated that such regulation can protect the public.</P>
      <P>Colleges of traditional Chinese medicine will be assessed and
reputable ones accredited under the same proposal so that people can

on Monday initiated a boycott of Northwest Airlines, and called on
the island's residents not to fly with the US-based carrier.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in Taipei, the foundation announced more
than 20 charges against the airline relating to what it described as
the company's deliberate disregard for its customers' health.</P>
      <P>One of the complains was brought by the Chen family, a foundation
spokesman said. The spokesman elaborated that four members of the
family took a Northwest Airlines flight from Taiwan to the United
States in mid-July.</P>
      <P>Chen told the foundation that although seated in the non-smoking
cabin, their seats were immediately adjacent to a smoking area.
During the flight, his two-year-old granddaughter could not stop
coughing and experienced difficulty breathing because of second-hand
smoke, Chen said.</P>
      <P>His repeated requests for a change of seats were rejected, Chen
said, adding that his granddaughter was later diagnosed with

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's investment climate rating has
advanced to the world's second best, next only to Switzerland's, a
senior official said on Tuesday, quoting the latest survey released
by Swiss firm Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI).</P>
      <P>"Taiwan tied Singapore at second place in the newly released
BERI investment climate and business profit opportunity rating,"
said Lin Neng-jong, director of the Industrial Development and
Investment Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>"This is the best ranking Taiwan has ever received in the annual
BERI survey," Lin said, adding that in all previous BERI polls,
Singapore consistently preceded Taiwan in the global rating.</P>
      <P>Lin said the advance indicates that amid the Southeast Asian
financial turmoil, Taiwan's healthy economic fundamentals and
investment climate have won the recognition of professional
international market research institutions.</P>
      <P>The latest BERI report also forecast that Taiwan's investment
climate will remain the world's second best next year. "The forecast
manifests that Taiwan is a low-risk investment area," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Lin cautioned local business people to exercise
prudence in making investments in Southeast Asia because most
countries in Asia have seen their BERI investment climate ratings
downgraded significantly. Southeast Asia has been one of the most

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday
confirmed that Taiwan's first case of dengue hemorrhagic fever this
year had been reported.</P>
      <P>The patient, a 47-year-old woman from Taipei, checked into a
hospital in late July after returning from a trip to Thailand, DOH
officials said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable
Disease Control, said the patient's symptoms included small
hemorrhagic spots on her skin, accumulation of liquid in the thorax,
and platelet count decrease.</P>
      <P>The patient has received treatment and is now fully recovered,
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Since 1994, 21 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been
reported in Taiwan, of those cases, one patient has died, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The DOH also announced another four cases of dengue fever have
been reported, bringing the total number of cases this year to 56,
or a sharp increase compared with 23 cases during the same period
last year.</P>
      <P>The patients -- two men in Taipei and a married couple in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan -- all contracted the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The "millennium bug," often referred to as
the Y2K, will likely pose major safety problems in the aviation
industry as its computerized systems could be effected, the Civil
Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) of Australia said.</P>
      <P>In a letter to pilots and airlines in Australia, CASA's director
of air safety Mick Toller said airline operators have not taken the
warning seriously.</P>
      <P>He said computerized systems, including hardware and software
used for aircraft control displays, navigation, communications,
engine controls, flight controls and loading of flight data, could be
hit by the bug.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday quoted Toller as saying, "By
now you ought to know that some systems with embedded computer chips,
and some computer programs, will either shut down or malfunction on
January 1, 2000."</P>
      <P>"This is not a media beat-up, but the considered opinion of the
most informed authorities on the subject. It is the responsibility of
senior managers and directors of aviation companies to ensure that
computer-based equipment that affect safety will not be compounded by
the changeover to the year 2000," he said.</P>

staged another round of protests on Monday, demanding the Indonesian
government to guarantee that the Chinese in that country not be
targeted in any form of atrocities.</P>
      <P>The demonstration, which coincided with Indonesia's Independence

Consulate General, shouting slogans to express their anger over the
attacks against Chinese people during May's rioting in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>In a written protest to the consulate general, the group demanded
that Jakarta uncover the truth behind the rioting, bring to justice
all those who committed or were behind the atrocities, provide
compensation for losses sustained by ethnic Chinese, offer medical
treatment to the injured, compensate the families of the deceased,
and institute legislation to protect the lives and property of the

    <HEADLINE>ROC STILL HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR KOO-WANG MEETING: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said on Tuesday it still holds high expectations for a planned
visit to mainland China this fall by C. F. Koo, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>"Even though some unexpected incidents occurred between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait recently, we still hope Koo's planned
mainland trip will proceed smoothly," said MAC Chairman Chang
King-yuh.</P>
      <P>Koo, Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing, is scheduled to
make a landmark visit to mainland China this autumn, during which
time he is expected to meet with Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS).</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MAC, which oversees SEF operations, has not ruled
out the possibility of including political issues into the agenda
for the proposed Koo-Wang meeting.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said, Taiwan still hopes that issues related
the rights and interests of people on both sides of the strait will
be addressed first.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Chang said, the MAC is hopeful that SEF Vice
Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow will travel to mainland
China to discuss with his ARATS counterpart the itinerary for Koo's
mainland trip as well as the agenda for the planned Koo-Wang
meeting.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say Taiwan's basic stance on cross-strait
dialogue is that any topics can be discussed, but those related to
people's rights and interests should be given the priority.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that Koo's planned mainland trip will mark
resumption of institutionalized SEF-ARATS dialogue and usher in a
new era in cross-strait relations," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The chief mainland policy planner also urged Beijing not to
deliberately downgrade its contacts or exchanges with SEF.
"Otherwise, cross-strait relations will never make headway," Chang
stressed.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang met for the first time in Singapore in April 1993.
During that historic meeting, the two sides signed several
agreements to lay a framework for institutionalized contacts and
dialogue between SEF and ARATS.</P>
      <P>The second Koo-Wang meeting was originally scheduled for
the autumn of 1995, but a landmark visit to the United States in
June that year by ROC President Lee Teng-hui angered Beijing, which
suspended the meeting and launched a series of war games and missile
tests to try to intimidate Taiwan. Beijing viewed Lee's US visit as
a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Secretary-General John Chang of the ruling
Kuomintang said Tuesday that changes in the KMT's Central Standing
Committee members will be modest.</P>
      <P>The party will hold its second plenary session of the 15th
Central Committee at the Taipei International Convention Center Aug.
22-23.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, participants will listen to reports on
government and party affairs, discuss the election campaigns for the
year-end elections, and reshuffle the Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Chang confirmed that Lee Huan, an appointed Central Standing
Committee member, has tendered his resignation and President Lee
Teng-hui, in his capacity as the KMT party chairman, has accepted it.</P>
      <P>Chang said changes to the Central Standing Committee members will
not be major, but final decisions have yet to be made.</P>
      <P>The KMT Central Standing Committee has 33 seats, including 16
appointed seats and 17 elected seats.</P>
      <P>The appointed members are chosen based on their representative
role in society. They include Premier Vincent Siew, Presidential
Adviser Wu Poh-hsiung, National Assembly Speaker Fredrick Chien,
Examination Yuan President Su Shui-teh, Legislative Yuan President
Liu Sung-pan, Presidential Secretary-General Huang Kun-huei, National
Security Council Secretary-General Ding Mou-shih, Defense Minister
Chiang Chung-ling and Taiwan Governor James Soong.</P>
      <P>Several presently elected members may not be in the running this 
year, sources said. One such example is Yeh Chin-feng, former
Minister of the Interior, who now works in the party.</P>
      <P>Others who may leave the policy-making body of the party include
Tai Tung-yuan, president of the National Taiwan University Hospital,
who offered his resignation; Hsieh Lung-sheng, deputy speaker of the
National Assembly, who is seriously ill; and James Chu, former
minister of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, who was sent
overseas and may not be able to resume his work.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY MEMBERS TO DEFEND CLEAN PRIMARIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A New Party member who seeks a party
nomination in the year-end legislative election on Tuesday initiated
an "anti-illegal mobilization alliance" calling for more party
members to defend clean primaries.</P>
      <P>Lee Sheng-feng, who seeks nomination as a legislative candidate
in Taipei County, said members of the alliance should pledge not to
get involved in any form of irregularities in manipulating the
outcome of primary elections such as offering money, gifts, free
banquets or free trips to potential voters.</P>
      <P>Alliance members are also not permitted to seek assistance from
other political parties or any conglomerates to help them win in
primary elections which select candidates for the legislative, and
Taipei and Kaohsiung city council elections. The primaries are not
restricted to only party members, but are open to all registered
voters.</P>
      <P>Lee said so far, over 20 New Party members have joined the
alliance, adding that alliance members will launch joint campaigns to
drum up support for themselves in an effort to fight against possible
irregularities by other candidates.</P>
      <P>Rumors of bribery have been rampant since the party's primary
elections started on Aug. 1. To show its determination to eliminate
any form of vote-buying, the New Party on Monday revoked the
qualifications of five candidates to run in the primaries.</P>
      <P>A New Party primary monitoring committee announced that the five
candidates, including incumbent Taiwan Provincial Assembly deputy
Sung Ai-ko, were reportedly involved in "improper mobilization" in
the primary elections. After careful investigations, the allegations
proved to be true, the committee said, but it refused to describe
what actions were deemed improper in order to protect the informers.</P>
      <P>The committee, headed by Legislator Chen Kuei-miao, also decided
that because Huang Lin-chien, who was one of the five, committed more
serious violations, his case will be forwarded to the party's
anti-corruption committee to decide if he will be expelled from the
party.</P>
      <P>According to the committee, after it announced on Aug. 10 that
the party would offer a reward of NT$1 million (US$28,800) to anyone
reporting cases of bribery in the primary elections, the party has
been swamped with bribery reports.</P>
      <P>After a six-hour marathon session, the committee determined that
of all the reported cases, only four could be confirmed, three
through credit information firms that the party contracted to help it
investigate and collect evidence against bribery accusations.</P>
      <P>The New Party was founded in August 1993 by a group of
disgruntled Kuomintang members who broke away from the ruling party
to protest against its "undemocratic practices."</P>

    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington and Beijing authorities have
agreed to meet later this month for talks aimed at repairing a
fractured maritime relationship that threatens to disrupt trade, the
World Trade Organization said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are set to begin in Beijing on Aug. 24 and will come
less than two weeks after the US Federal Maritime Commission (FMC)
launched an investigation into the mainland's shipping policies and
port practices. The outcome of the investigation could lead to
sanctions imposed against the US' fourth-largest trading partner, the
Geneva-based trade organization said.</P>
      <P>The independent shipping watchdog agency said it received
complaints from federal agencies and the US maritime industry about
the mainland's unwillingness to open its container shipping markets.</P>
      <P>In what promises to be a busy two weeks, the US maritime
delegation headed to Beijing will first visit Tokyo for a round of
discussions on a dispute similar to the one heating up with China.</P>
      <P>The FMC imposed a temporary US$100,000 fine last year on all
Japanese container ships entering US ports after determining that
Japanese port practices were anti-competitive. The Beijing meetings
are considered the more urgent of the two negotiations.</P>
      <P>A 10-year-old bilateral shipping agreement between the United
States and the mainland is set to expire Sept. 15. The pact would
have expired June 15 but was extended by three months.</P>
      <P>US-China maritime relations hit rock bottom in March with the
sudden collapse of a market-opening deal struck in December. That
pact was designed to benefit the mainland's state-owned shipping
line, Communist China Ocean Shipping Co., and two top US container
ship operators, Sea-Land Service Inc. and APL Ltd.</P>
      <P>Beijing pledged to give Sea-Land and APL freer access to mainland
ports and to allow Sea-Land to proceed on the joint development of a
major terminal in Tianjin, one of two main northern China ports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COUNCILOR'S FUNERAL SERVICES HELD IN KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Southern  Taiwan, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Funeral services were
held Tuesday for Lin Ti-chuan, the late Kaohsiung City councilor who
was drugged to death by her abductors during a botched kidnap in
mainland China late July.</P>
      <P>Lin, 32, a member of Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), was accidentally killed by an overdose of drugs
administered while she was being held by her captors in mainland
China's northeast city of Haicheng.</P>
      <P>Lin's body was flown back to her hometown in Kaohsiung from
Beijing via Hong Kong on Aug. 8. Some of her family members and
colleagues who traveled to the mainland went through labored
negotiation with authorities to have her body returned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan, and Premier
Vincent Siew all sent funeral tablets and scrolls with accolades to
commend the late councilor. Some 1,000 people, including DPP
heavyweights and officials from the Kaohsiung city government,
attended the services.</P>
      <P>Lin and her Kaohsiung businessman boyfriend, Wei Tien-kang, were
reportedly abducted by five mainland Chinese men in Dalien upon their
arrival in the northeastern city on July 27.</P>
      <P>According to mainland authorities, four of the five suspected
kidnappers have been apprehended. The fifth, Li Guangzhi, who is said
to have been the mastermind behind the kidnap, is still at large.</P>
      <P>The arrested suspects said Li ordered Wei's kidnapping to force
him to repay a debt he owed to Li. The two victims were abducted by
the four men, taken about 200 kilometers north to Haicheng City, and
hidden in an empty apartment.</P>
      <P>Wei and Lin were injected with an unknown drug which may have
been heroin, and fell in and out of unconsciousness. Lin later
reportedly experienced difficulty breathing and turned pale on July
29. She was rushed to a Haicheng hospital, where she was declared
dead on arrival. The four suspects then fled.</P>
      <P>Wei regained consciousness during their absence and managed to
escape and notify local public security authorities of the incident.</P>
      <P>Wei, who stated that he loved Lin, said he was sorry that Lin's
first mainland trip resulted in such a tragedy. He could not attend
the funeral as he was technically taken into custody by the Haicheng
public security authorities for questioning about the alleged kidnap
and murder.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung businessman, distressed at being kept under house
arrest, told Taiwan media through telephone conversations Monday that
he would take "radical" action if the mainland authorities continue
to prevent him from returning to Taiwan. He said he was a victim, not
an accomplice, in the kidnap.</P>
      <P>One of the rising stars of the DPP, Lin made her debut in
politics at the age of 28. A political maverick, Lin was dubbed "the
little chili" for her spicy interpellation style.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A grand funeral for late Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lu Hsiu-yi was held in Panchiao,
Taipei County on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Many senior government officials, including President Lee
Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan and Premier Vincent Siew, as well
as DPP heavyweights, attended the funeral to pay tribute to one of
the most prominent and respected politicians in Taiwan's opposition
camp.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-fan, Control Yuan President
Wang Tso-yung, and Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh also
attended, as well as thousands of Lu's supporters from around the
island.</P>
      <P>Observers said the presence of President Lee and so many other
central government officials illustrated the DPP's growing political
strength. The pro-independence party now controls more mayoral and
county magistrate positions than the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Lu, a three-term lawmaker and a vocal proponent of Taiwan
independence, died of lung cancer on Aug. 6 at the age of 57.</P>
      <P>The funeral rites began with a performance of French composer
Gabriel Faure's "Song of Pathos" by the Formosa Egret Symphony
Orchestra, which was founded with the support of Lu and his wife, a
musician.</P>
      <P>A posthumous citation, which was issued by President Lee
and lauded Lu for his contributions to education and Taiwan's
democratization, was read at the funeral.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, director of the Bureau of Social Affairs under the
Taipei City Government, gave an emotional and sentimental resume of
Lu's life story.</P>
      <P>Describing Lu as a sage with a historian's perspective and
vision, Chen recounted the scholar-turned-lawmaker's dedication to
academic study, promotion of Taiwan's democratic reforms, love for
his family, and contributions to the DPP.</P>
      <P>"Lu was a man of action. He regarded politics as a career, a
serious undertaking," said Chen, one of only a few influential DPP
female politicians.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that although Lu had left this world to begin
"another form of existence," his passion, straightforwardness,
courage, moral stature, and optimism, will live in the hearts and
minds of all his family and friends forever.</P>
      <P>Lu, who earned a doctoral degree in political science from the
Sorbonne in Paris, taught at Chinese Culture University and National
Tsinghua University before entering politics in 1989.</P>
      <P>He also served a three-year prison term from 1983 through 1986 on
charges of sedition for his promotion of Taiwan independence. At the
time, Taiwan was still under martial law and advocacy of independence
was taboo.</P>
      <P>It was during his time in jail that Lu's hair turned pure white,
prompting him to take the sobriquet "The Egret," after the snowy
white crested wading bird common in rural Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A witty, humorous man, Lu was a key opinion leader in the
Legislative Yuan. His profound knowledge, resourcefulness, cultured
manner, and taste for the arts, helped him win a great deal of
respect and admiration from his legislative colleagues and from the
island's media.</P>
      <P>The funeral procession extended several kilometers as
thousands of Lu's supporters, including many taxi drivers,
escorted Lu's coffin to the crematorium where Lu's body was
cremated.</P>
      <P>The DPP held an overnight vigil on Monday to pay tribute to one
of its most popular standard bearer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NORTHWEST AIRLINES PLEDGES TO IMPROVE FLIGHT SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US-based Northwest Airlines pledged on
Tuesday to improve its services, starting with the implementation
from Aug. 1 of a total smoking ban on all its flights.</P>
      <P>A statement released by the carrier indicated that while the
company is sincere in its desire to resolve every customer complaint,
it will consider filing suit if cases of deliberate defamation are
uncovered.</P>
      <P>The statement stressed that Northwest, the first foreign airline
to establish itself in Taiwan, has been operating here for 48 years.
All of the company's services and flight operations follow US Federal
Aviation Administration regulations, and are monitored by the
administration.</P>
      <P>The statement reiterated the company will seek a satisfactory
resolution to the latest charges leveled by dissatisfied customer Wu
Pei-min, and that it hopes to retain the goodwill of local consumers.</P>
      <P>Wu's lawsuit against Northwest will soon come to trial. The case
has drawn wide attention since it is the first case in Taiwan against
businesses which have failed to implement a comprehensive ban on
smoking in public places, which include the skies above the island.</P>
      <P>Wu says his youngest daughter, a one-year-old baby, was diagnosed
as suffering from contact bronchitis, an ailment linked to passive
smoking, after being a victim of second-hand smoke for several hours
during a Northwest flight to San Francisco from Taipei on April 2.</P>
      <P>He further says that his wife and two other daughters also
suffered from the smoke during the entire flight trip, although they
had been seated in a non-smoking cabin, but adjacent to a smoking
area.</P>
      <P>Wu sued the carrier in late July for compensation of NT$11.76
million (US$338,000). He describes the lawsuit as an action against
Northwest Airlines' ignorance of Taiwan's smoking ban, and for its
compromising of the health of his children.</P>
      <P>Taiwan enacted tough anti-smoking legislation last September.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Northwest was the subject of a boycott initiated by
Taiwan's anti-smoking John Tung Foundation, which urged the island's
residents not to fly with the company.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held in Taipei, the foundation unveiled
more than 20 other complaints similar to the Wu case.</P>
      <P>The campaign has won the support of a number of leading welfare
and human rights organizations on the island, including the
Consumers' Foundation, the Chinese Association for Human Rights, and
the Child Welfare Legal Foundation.</P>

      <P>The seventh Taiwan-Philippines
ministerial-level economic cooperation meeting kicked off in Manila
on Tuesday, chaired jointly by Republic of China Economic Affairs
Minister Wang Chih-kang and Philippine Trade and Industry Secretary
Jose Pardo.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at the opening ceremony, Wang said the ROC is
more than willing to share its development experience with friendly
nations, and is not reluctant to help neighboring governments to
stabilize their finances and revitalize their economies.</P>
      <P>Wang also lauded Philippine President Joseph Estrada as a
sagacious leader, saying that under Estrada's capable leadership, the
Philippines' economy is sure to recover quickly.</P>
      <P>For his part, Pardo praised Taiwan for its ability to remain
relatively unscathed by the Asian financial crisis. He said he hopes
that Taiwan, whose economic growth enjoyed an enviable 6.8 percent
growth last year, will continue to strengthen trade and investment
ties with the Philippines so as to help the Southeast Asian nation's
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Pardo said he hopes to see the four panel discussions on trade
and industrial cooperation, investment in tourism, agriculture, and

      <P>A group of 19 Taiwan legislators is
scheduled to leave for Tokyo on Aug. 24 in an effort to defend
Taiwan's interests prior to mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
September visit to Japan, Legislative Yuan sources said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has decided to release a position paper on
Thursday to make known its concerns about Jiang's upcoming trip,
which may have an outcome harmful to Taiwan's interests, said
Legislative Yuan Vice President Wang Chin-ping.</P>
      <P>The position paper will carry statements using stronger language
than that used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), as the
paper reflects the opinions of the parliament, rather than the
government, said Wang.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Lee visited the Legislative Yuan on
Tuesday, bringing with him a copy of a proposed MOFA position paper
to be used by the legislators as a reference when they are drafting
their own position paper.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Legislative Yuan paper will mainly call for Japan
not to make any commitment during the summit between Jiang and
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi that may result in the
undermining of the interests of the 21.5 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During their two-day stay in Tokyo, members of the supra-party
Legislative Yuan mission will meet with Sadanori Yamanaka, chairman
of the Japan-ROC Dietmen's Council, Liberal Democratic Party
heavyweights, members of Japanese opposition parties, and academic
and media opinion leaders in Japan, said Wang.</P>

interests of the Republic of China during the visit of mainland
China's President Jiang Zemin in September.</P>

a meeting in Tokyo in which they decided to submit written statements
to the Japanese Diet, the Prime Minister's Office and other
ministries.</P>
      <P>In the statement, the leaders called for no Japanese support for
the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan voiced by US President Bill
Clinton during his recent visit to mainland China. They also urged
the Japanese authorities not to make any compromises during the talks
with Jiang which might harm the friendly Taipei-Tokyo relations.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that China is now governed by two
political entities -- the ROC and the People's Republic of China --
and that the ROC can contribute greatly to the international
community if it is allowed to join international bodies.</P>
      <P>The statement also urged Japan to keep the Taiwan Strait covered

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tokyo is reportedly finding it difficult to
codify the "three noes" policy with regard to Taiwan in joint
official documents with Beijing, the Nihon Keizo Shimbun reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Jiang Zemin's scheduled visit to Japan in
September has turned up the pressure for Japan to commit to the
"three noes," which refers to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations in which
statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>How Japan will respond to the mainland's request will become the
focus of Jiang's visit to Japan. Beijing is expecting Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi to at least throw verbal support behind the
"three noes," even if Tokyo does not give its written support for the
policy in a bilateral joint document expected to be signed during the
visit, the newspaper said.</P>
      <P>Both the United States and Japan are cautious about signing
formal documents with Beijing codifying their positions regarding the
"three noes" despite the fact that the two countries have expressed
their commitment to the policy to Beijing in the past, according to
the newspaper.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton spelled out his support for the "three
noes" at an informal roundtable meeting in Shanghai during his recent

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO RECRUIT MAINLAND CHINESE IC TALENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Northern  Taiwan,  Aug.  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should try to
recruit integrated circuit (IC) talent and specialists from mainland
China to boost its standing in the semiconductor industry, a US
industry executive said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Gerald Hsu, chairman of the Silicon Valley-based Avant
Corporation!, the third largest semiconductor designing company in
the world, said people's talent should transcend racial or political
barriers as the industry does not recognize such differences.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should follow the example of the United States
which allows high-technology corporations to employ up to 15 percent
foreign nationals. Talent from the mainland could help beef up the
island's IC-designing capabilities, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu was speaking on global development trends in IC design at an
international seminar held at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park. He said the IC industry, which is gradually becoming a
three-in-one industry comprised of IPR (intellectual property
rights), EDA (electronic designing automation) and IC design
manufacturing, is poised to become one of the most important
high-technology industries in the world in the coming decade.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who visits more than 1,000 semiconductor operators around
the world annually, said he has high expectations for the long-term
development of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan, which he
foresees to be one of the last winners in a complete reshuffle of the
industry worldwide as a result of the current global stagnation.</P>
      <P>Compared to the United States, which has the strongest human
resources of the semiconductor industry, Taiwan is rich in capital
but has insufficient support machinery and facility industries, Hsu
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan registered a modest 4 percent
growth in its exports to the United States in the first half of this
year, ranking third among the four Asian Dragons, according to
statistics released by the US Department of Commerce on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The DOC tallies show that Taiwan exported US$15.8 billion worth
of merchandise to the United States between January and June, marking
a 4 percent year-on-year rise.</P>
      <P>Compared with the three other Asian Dragons, Taiwan's growth
rate far lagged behind South Korea's 19.1 percent and Hong Kong's
9.8 percent. Taiwan only preceded Singapore which saw a 4.9 percent
decline in its exports to the United States during the six-month
period.</P>
      <P>According to DOC tallies, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of
US$6.63 billion with the United States for the January-June period,
up 16.2 percent from the year-earlier level. During the six-month
period, Taiwan's imports from the United States increased 9.7
percent compared with the same period of 1997.</P>
      <P>The same statistics show that Taiwan is now America's seventh
largest trade partner and sixth largest source of its trade deficit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan became the eighth largest overseas market of
US-made automobiles, down two slots from last year's rating.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported US$117 million worth of cars from the United
States in the first six months of this year, marking a 56 percent
drop from the year-earlier level. The plunge was attributed to
significant depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar against the
greenback as well as a slowdown in Taiwan's economic growth.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Taiwan also imported US$25 million worth
of trucks and vans from the United States, in addition to US$39
million worth of US-made auto parts and components.</P>

      <P>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has
vowed to stabilize local financial markets and maintain current
interest rates, despite a new wave of economic turmoil from Asia.</P>
      <P>RBA officials said the central bank spent A$2.6 billion (US$1.63

depreciated against the US dollar as a result of the Asian financial
crisis and the plunge in the Japanese yen.</P>
      <P>The officials said Australia's economic growth has slowed, and
that the second wave of the Asian crisis has forced it to downgrade
its gross domestic product to between 2 percent and 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>They also said that Australian exporters have switched to new
non-Asian markets that are unaffected by the Asian regional crisis.</P>
      <P>One major worry, however, is a rise in the unemployment level.

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON'S ADDRESS, AN END TO HIS PROBLEM OR START OF A CRISIS?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's admission to
the American people that he had an "inappropriate" relationship with
Monica Lewinsky could either mark an end to a seven-month saga or the
beginning of a political crisis.</P>
      <P>In its editorial headlined "Clinton Takes Responsibility" on
Wednesday, the Sydney Morning Herald said, "The most important
question is whether it marks an end to something that has gone on far
too long or the beginning of an even deeper descent into a
debilitating political crisis."</P>
      <P>"The US political system is a model of a free and open democracy.
But in this affair the central forces -- the political parties, the
media, the 'moral majority' -- within American democracy have
produced a situation where the original cause is so out of proportion
to its broad political effects the world stands amazed," the
paper said.</P>
      <P>The editorial noted that Clinton's admission could bring possible
offenses against him which are being investigated by independent
prosecutor Kenneth Starr. At the core is whether Clinton tried to
convince Lewinsky and others to lie, obstruct justice or tamper with
witnesses.</P>
      <P>In an editorial headlined "Mr. Clinton's Desperate Performance"
on Wednesday, the Australian said, "Central to whether US President
Bill Clinton is impeached, is not whether he had sex with Monica
Lewinsky, nor perhaps that he lied about it, but whether he tried to
obstruct justice by getting her to alter her story, asked her to hide
evidence or attempted to buy her silence by trying to get her a job."</P>
      <P>"The President has scarcely been hypocritical in condemning
adultery in others while conducting it himself. But undoubtedly Mr.
Clinton's actions have damaged further his poor reputation of
personal morality, while putting a cloud over the acknowledged
achievements of his administration," the paper said.</P>
      <P>"His address to the nation played to an audience that wants to
put Monicagate behind it; that wants the US to concentrate on doing
what it does best -- being the biggest and brashest country in the
world," it added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank on Tuesday
approved a loan of US$140 million to mainland China for the
construction of a railway in Guizhou Province.</P>
      <P>The project is expected to help boost employment and reduce
poverty to one of the mainland's six poorest provinces. Over 92,000
people, or about 40 percent of the people living in the area, will
likely benefit from improved living conditions and the 20,000 new
jobs projected. The construction will also offer such basic social
benefits as health coverage, education and communications network.</P>
      <P>The 121-kilometer railway project aims to connect Liupanshui to
Baiguo and is a part of Beijing's efforts to improve its railway
system, considered one of the major constraints to efficient,
sustained economic growth.</P>
      <P>The ADB loan will finance 37 percent of US$381 million project.
Guizhou Shuibai Railway Corporation and the State Development Bank
will provide the remainder of the financing.</P>
      <P>The ADB loan will be financed from ADB's ordinary capital
resources at an interest rate determined in accordance with the
bank's pool-based variable lending rate for US dollars. Repayment
will be made over 25 years including a grace period of five years.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  18 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thomson Bankwatch, the world's largest
bank rating agency, announced Tuesday the downgrading of the
short-term local currency debt rating of Chinfon Bank of Taiwan from
LC-2 to LC-3.</P>
      <P>The bank rating agency said in a report that Chinfon Bank's weak
overall performance in a more difficult market environment was the
reason behind the downgrading.</P>
      <P>Chinfon Bank was converted into a commercial bank in 1994 from
its previous status as a trust and investment company. It has since
experienced some difficulty in maintaining a satisfactory performance
and been plagued by weak asset quality and profitability as well as
low liquidity levels, the agency indicated.</P>
      <P>The bank's overdue loan ratio was around 8 percent in the fiscal
year 1997, one of the highest levels in the country, the agency
reported. In addition, overdue loans were estimated at a huge 60
percent of total loan loss reserves and equity.</P>
      <P>Chinfon Bank had low, worse-than-average liquidity ratios in the
fiscal year 1997 and its deposit growth was mainly pushed by
interbank deposits which are a less stable funding source than
customer deposits, the report said.</P>
      <P>The bank posted excessive exposure to the broad property sector,
but aims at reducing it in the future and expanding its exposure to
manufacturing industries, Thomson Bankwatch reported.</P>
      <P>The bank rating agency provides research on over 1,000 financial
institutions in more than 94 countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The distinction between developed and
developing countries will no longer be measured by which has more
roads or skyscrapers but by which has more Internet users or data
transmission lines, a telecom executive said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Claudine Simson, vice president of Canada's Northern Telecom,
told a conference of the Association of Commonwealth Universities in
Ottawa that with the world increasingly turning to a knowledge-based
economy, countries that do not make relevant skills training a
priority will find themselves among the "info-poor."</P>
      <P>"There is a real danger when so many countries do not have
adequate 'infostructure.' Their people cannot connect with the rest
of the world. They cannot participate in the global economy. And this
is creating a new form of poverty -- information poverty -- and the
gap is widening," she said.</P>
      <P>Conference data showed that industrialized countries are home to
84 percent of the world's mobile-phone users, 91 percent of all fax
machines, and 97 percent of all Internet host computers.</P>
      <P>Simson said universities have to make a concerted effort to
provide high-tech training to their students so there will be an
adequate labor force available for the burgeoning digital economy.</P>
      <P>Distance learning is one of the new concepts that universities,

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China official in
charge of cross-strait affairs said here on Monday that Taiwan is
doing its best to push for a second meeting between the top
negotiators on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-ping, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), reiterated that Taiwan stands firm on its
policy that Taiwan and mainland China must continue their exchanges,
despite the chill which has descended on bilateral relations
following the recent kidnap-murder of a Taiwan city councilwoman in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman, who flew into San Francisco earlier on
Monday from Los Angeles, made the remarks while answering questions
at a seminar on cross-strait ties. Tseng Ching-yuan, director of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco, together with
more than 50 academics, attended the seminar.</P>
      <P>Lin added, however, that it depends on mainland China's attitude
whether or not the second meeting will take place this fall as
scheduled between Koo Chen-fu, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
chairman, and his mainland Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan, chairman
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Lin called on mainland China to forswear its Cold War ideology in
its dealings with Taiwan, because it adversely affects Taiwan
people's feelings toward the mainland, and hinders the process of
China's unification.</P>
      <P>He admitted that mainland China's drive to push Japan into
emulating the United States by declaring support for the "three noes"
regarding Taiwan will result in greater pressure on the island.</P>
      <P>But Lin asserted that Taiwan will not deviate from its policy of
continued exchanges and negotiations with the mainland. Time will
prove this policy correct, he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing may believe that the international situation is in its
favor, and refuse to lessen its efforts to isolate Taiwan in the
international community, Lin analyzed. He pointed out that such an
approach will only further hurt bilateral ties and serve to
illustrate that Beijing's policy contradicts its stated goals.</P>
      <P>Lin, who formerly taught at Georgetown University in Washington,
D.C., said that in the wake of US President Bill Clinton's recent
visit to mainland China, Washington-Beijing ties have reached a point
that makes it hard for them to see any major breakthroughs in the
near future.</P>
      <P>The two countries are more likely to devote their efforts over
the next two years to resolving disputes over human rights, trade
friction, and weapons proliferation, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNA INTERVIEW WITH DAVID MULRONEY, DIRECTOR OF THE CANADIAN TRADE OFFICE IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: How do you feel so far? What are you going to do in the future
to promote the bilateral relationship between Taiwan and Canada?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: Well, so far I feel very excited and positive about my
mew responsibilities and about living here in Taipei. I arrived here
with my family two weeks ago. So I am still a relatively new comer.
But we have been very impressed by what we've seen, not just the
dynamism of downtown -- I think we expected a little bit of that --
it certainly lived up to our expectations, but also the natural
beauty of the surroundings and the city -- the mountains, the
backdrop. We were very impressed by that. We've been up to
Yangmingshan. So it's going to be a very enjoyable and interesting
place to live professionally. Although we have been busy -- we had a
delegation of MP's in, we had Canadian business people, and we've had
Canadian cultural performers coming in this weekend. So it's a very
active place to promote Canadian interests.</P>
      <P>My own objectives are tow-fold. I think that the impression
of Canada in Taiwan is very positive. But I think it can be expanded
on, and that he job will take a long time and a lot of efforts. But
it really is one of the basic jobs of this office. And that is to say
that not only is Canada a big country and it's a beautiful country,
with the mountains and variety, and it's a friendly country, but it
is also a technologically sophisticated country. It has technologies
that are of interest to Taiwanese entrepreneurs. It is a
multi-cultural country. It is a diverse country in terms of its
cultural performances. It is a country with high-quality educational
services. So not just Canada of the pictures you see, but we'd like
to create a new image of Canada which is even more interesting.
Perhaps the image is not a widely recognized one -- that's our
responsibility to convey that.</P>
      <P>Similarly, I think that for Canadians they need to study and
see how quickly Taiwan is changing. Because Taiwan is changing so
quickly, inevitably perceptions will lag behind a few years. We'd
like them to realize the spirit and entrepreneurship in Taiwan, the
kind of technology in Taiwan that is advancing, and the opportunities
for collaboration between Taiwanese investors and Canadian investors
perhaps at third markets. Certainly Canadians are taking note of the
fact that Taiwan has not been unaffected by the Asian problems, is
surviving and handling the situation much better than most of its
neighbors. And that realization will lead people to think why is that
the case. And I think they will come back to look at the fundamentals
of the economy, the number of very innovative and flexible smaller
companies, the soundness of the financial sector. So we think we can
also encourage Canadians to look for new opportunities in Taiwan
toward a two-fold communications challenge. I categorize the
relationship as positive.</P>
      <P>We look at our trade -- it's currently at about 5 billion
Canadian dollars. Yesterday, in addressing our parliamentarians,
President Lee Teng-hui said that is not enough. That's right. I think
we can do more. There is beginning of a two-way investment. But again
we can agree to do more there. And we are working very hard through
our trade section to bring venture capitalists from Taiwan to Canada
to look for opportunities, and to bring Canadians investors here to
look for opportunities. We can do more of that.

      <P>We have a people-to-people exchange that brings 100,000
Taiwanese visitors to Canada. We'd like to see that increased. We'll
be expanding our visa issuing capacity here. As you can see, we have
some space constraints in the office we are in. We have now secured
the budget to expand the size and also to hire more people, so we can
facilitate things there.</P>
      <P>We have a Canadian education center that is already
introducing Canadian schools, Canadian education to prospective
students from Taiwan. We're very enthusiastic about that. The office
has already mounted some road shows that are taking the message out
to other places. We want to do even more of that, because we think
that Canada not only offers its benefits in attempts of having
high-quality universities coast to coast, but it also offers an
attractive living environment. If you are sending your most precious
possessions, that is, your children, overseas to universities, I
think that parents can feel at ease knowing they are going to Canada,
knowing they are going to cities like Vancouver, Toronto, London,
Montreal or Halifax. So we have a good story to tell there.</P>
      <P>As far as cultural exchanges are concerned, I think we made a
very good start. And there is even more we can do tomorrow night. For
example, we have a concert of Canadian performer who is increasingly
well-known in Taiwan. We have other projects we are looking at. We
see Canadian performers come here and also see Taiwanese performers
go to Canada. That again helps to contribute to the broadening and
growth of awareness of what each place is really like. Is it a job
you can do in six months? No, it's not a job you can do in six years.
You must continually -- continually work because there are so many
competing interests for both Canada and Taiwan, for example. The US
is obviously a large, attractive and dominant cultural force and
business presence. And that's good, but that's means we have to work
even harder to say: when you look at northern America, don't just
look at the US. Take a look at Canada, too. So, this office has been
working very hard. And we will continue to do that.</P>
      <P>Q: You mentioned trade, economic, cultural,
people-to-people exchanges. How about expansion of exchanges in the
political area, such as high-level visits between Taiwan and Canada?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: What we look at when we look at the visits and
exchanges is a question of substance where we can advance key issues
in those areas and priorities, like economic exchanges and cultural
exchanges, and visits should serve that purpose. They should also fit
in with the overall context of our policy, our international policy.
And where we can do that, we support such policy. And I think we have
an exchange now that really is mutually beneficial, but is consistent
with our policy.</P>
      <P>Q: President Lee Teng-hui said yesterday when meeting with
Canadian parliamentarians that there are still trade barriers on both
sides. What concrete measures are you going to take in order to
eliminate various barriers? Could you be more specific on how you are
going to do more?

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mulroney: I think the best single way of eliminating any existing
trade barriers is for Taiwan to exceed and take up all the rights and
responsibilities of WTO membership. We did talk about this a little
bit yesterday. Where does Canada stand on this? Well, we support
Taiwan's accession to the WTO as an important economy, and it makes
obvious sense for this to happen. We have been very close to
achieving an agreement with Taiwan. We reached this point last fall,
and we only left a few issues to be resolved until we finally sign
the agreement.</P>
      <P>We also had the understanding that in any other negotiations that
Taiwan had with other contracting parties of the WTO, any special
provisions will be done on a MFN basis, meaning everybody will enjoy.
So, where we, for example, made progress in areas like financial
services, specifically private banking, those benefits would apply to
all WTO members. So we weren't just doing it for Canada -- of course,
that was one dimension -- we were doing it in the spirit of the
WTO. Subsequently, we lost ground on some of those issues. There are
some agricultural issues, there is the issue of private banking. We
lost ground. We weren't able to see the results we thought we would
see. And in addition, when Taiwan concluded its agreement with the
US, there was a provision allowing American suppliers early access --
pre-accession access -- to the market here for certain meat products.</P>
      <P>What we are saying is: we would like to conclude the agreement,
which means meeting the undertakings that we agreed on in the fall.
And we are disappointed that in the negotiations with the US, they
were given the special one-on-one deal. And I should be very clear on
this. We are not asking for some special benefits for Canadians only.
What we are saying is that we believe that the spirit of the WTO is
such that there should be uniformity and a level playing field. And
we've asked to sit down again, so that we can quickly resolve the
issues that are outstanding. We really do think we need to resolve
them before we sign the agreement. I'm confident we can do this, and
in discussions with the appropriate authorities here to make sure
that that can happen. So, we're disappointed that we haven't signed
already, but we are confident that we can bring our negotiators back
together and discuss this issue quickly, and we can resolve them.</P>
      <P>Q: Rumors have said that Canada will be the last one to sign the
WTO deal with Taiwan. Is that true?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: No, not true. We want to sign it as soon as we
settle these issues, because, as I said, we support Taiwan's
accession. We think it's important. But we really do. These issues
are important to our exporters, but they are also important because
that's what the WTO is all about. It's about a level playing field,
it's about transparency, and it's about the same advantages applying
to all. So there is a point of principle here that I think we have to
make. And I think other contracting parties share those views.</P>
      <P>Q: Every relationship has its ups and downs. Can we say that when
the Maersk Dubai (ship) case happened, that was the time when the
bilateral relationship between Taiwan and Canada was down. How do you
evaluate the relationship at present. Can we call it a good time? Or
can we say it's somewhere right in the middle?

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mulroney: I would say it's a good time. And I would say also that
if we look at the Maersk Dubai case, people worked very hard to find
a solution; that the most important consideration was the judicial
review, an examination to see whether alleged criminal acts had
indeed taken place; that this be brought before the appropriate court
of law. And I think the result that prevailed which saw the sailors
returned for trial or prosecution here in Taiwan was the appropriate
result, and the best result in the interests of justice. For that to
happen, there was dialogue; there was, I think, a degree of
understanding achieved. So I don't think that as a bad point in
relationship. I think it shows the vitality of the relationship.</P>
      <P>Right now, in any relationship, there are going to be
some disagreements and irritations. You look at the Canada-US
relationship. It's tremendously positive, but we often have
disagreements on trade issues, for example. This is the nature of
relationships. I think our relationship with Taiwan -- if you look at
the number of exchanges I outlined at the beginning -- the size of
the trade, the growth of investment, people flying back and forth --
you have to categorize it as very positive.</P>
      <P>Q: Do you expect the Dubai case to have any new
developments after the Filipinos get their citizenship in Canada?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: Well, they were allowed to remain in Canada on
compassionate grounds, but we are simply awaiting the results of the
prosecution in Kaohsiung. And we have always said we are willing to
furnish evidence that was collected in the course of the judicial
review in Canada, should that be required by the authorities. So we
simply await results from Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Q: You mentioned the Canada-US relationship. People in Taiwan are
curious. They are sensitive about the "three-noes" statement by US
President Bill Clinton. Will that have any impact on Canada's China
policy?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: Canada's China policy is a "made-in-Canada" policy.
It (the statement) does not substantially in any way change Canada's
relationship with China or anywhere in the region. We maintain a
one-China policy. And within that, there is much that we can do, for
example, in terms of our relationship with Taiwan. We are cognizant
of the realities of the situation locally, and we try to ensure that
whatever we do is for the benefit of people in the region and
contributes to the ultimate peaceful resolution of the (Taiwan)
issue. So I think we have been pragmatic in terms of always seeking
to develop a relationship within limits of a clearly defined policy.
And I think we've been successful to date.</P>
      <P>Q: One of the "three noes" is that the US will not support
Taiwan's entry into any organization for which statehood is required.
What is Canada's position?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: Canada is supportive of Taiwan's participation in
organizations like the WTO and like APEC. Other cases we have not
been able to support, such as the UN application. But by and large,
we support Taiwan's participation in fora that fit within the
criteria of our policy. But that being said, there has been much that
we can do, and we have encouraged Taiwan's participation in fora where
that is not an issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: On the people-to-people exchange, will the Canadian
government consider giving visa-free treatment to Taiwanese tourists?
 Mulroney: First of all, the most important thing is, people should
be able to travel to Canada as quickly and easily as possible. And I
think our office issued 140,000 visas last year. We offer very quick
service -- normally 24 to 48 hours. So we are confident that we are
not unduly holding people up.</P>
      <P>Why do we impose a visa? I think the main problem is that
there have been attempts by people -- not Taiwanese, but from outside
of Taiwan to use or misuse a Taiwanese passport to travel to
countries like Canada. We've had numerous cases recently where people
had obtained Taiwanese passports fraudulently and attempt to
illegally enter Canada. Normally they obtain this by first obtaining
an identity card. My understanding of the situation is the passport
is very difficult to counterfeit or obtain illegally; the identity
card is a little bit easier to obtain. And because we have this
concern about the illegal entry into Canada by people from outside of
Taiwan, we have had to maintain the visa waiver. We are in discussion
with the authorities here. We talked about enhanced security
measures, and I think if we solve that problem, we go a long way
towards solving the visa issue. But that is an issue that has still
remained.</P>
      <P>Q: Are those people from mainland China that use forged ID to get
passports? And how many of them are we talking about?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: I don't have precise numbers. But I think it's over 100
within the last year, and primarily from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Q: What was the local authorities' response?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: My understanding is that the identity card is under
review and there will be new measures to ensure it's more secure. But
that's going to take some time.</P>
      <P>Q: What kind of role do Taiwanese immigrants play in Canada?
Are they worried about anti-immigrant sentiments Taiwan immigrants are
now facing in Australia?</P>
      <P>Mulroney: Before I left Canada -- I have been living in Toronto
-- I stopped in Vancouver and met with groups of entrepreneurs who
recently arrived in probably five or six different groups. We sat
down and I chatted with them about their experiences, how they
thought about Canada, what it was like to come to Canada, and some of
the services and things we might be able to provide before they
leave. I can tell you categorically everything I heard in my own
experience is that it's very positive. You have seen Vancouver.
Toronto is equally multicultural, because so many Canadians have come
from other countries. They are very very welcoming, because they also
see the success and contribution that the Taiwanese immigrants have
made. And that is undeniable. It's a positive experience.</P>
      <P>We're conscious of the fact that we are sort of the
first Canadian -- the window with a doorway on Canada. So from the
moment they come here, we are trying to create the most positive
impression and I think that's something that continues right through
to their arrival in whatever city they go to. So all the stories I've
heard were positive. And think the prevailing sense in Canada is
highly positive.

call on here in Taipei, but I also want to get out and see other
parts of Taiwan and meet people because we have to take our story out

    <HEADLINE>VIAGRA SAID RISING TO LOCAL POLITICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  southern  Taiwan,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The anti-impotency drug
Viagra has emerged as a new campaign tool in the southern county of
Tainan, even though the "small blue pill" has not yet been legally
marketed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local political sources say many of those who intend to run in
the year-end legislative elections in this agricultural constitutency
are cashing in on the recent worldwide craze for Viagra to boost
their electoral bids.</P>
      <P>Although the elections are still more than three months away,
campaign activities have been gradually heating up. The ruling
Kuomintang and the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
have nominated a total of 11 candidates to vie for the nine regional
legislative seats up for grabs in the county, while 14 other hopefuls
have also expressed the intention of joining in the race. Against
this background, competition is expected to be very fierce.</P>
      <P>It has long been a common practice in local society for political
candidates to present gifts to community leaders and other
influential figures as part of their campaign strategies.</P>
      <P>Gift-giving is an art, and it requires wisdom to choose suitable
gifts. Over the past few years, red wine has become the most popular
and welcome campaign booster. However, the popularity of wine seems
to have diminished, to be replaced by Viagra as the most favored
vote-getting gift.</P>
      <P>Political sources say both KMT and DPP candidates have asked
their friends and supporters in the medical community to help them
smuggle Viagra into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One DPP candidate for the upcoming elections was quoted as saying
that Viagra has proved to be a useful "advance deployment" for the
year-end elections. "Response from recipients has been fervent and
uplifting," he said.</P>
      <P>The candidate further said Viagra has become a symbol of a
person's influence or clout in local politics. "With a Viagra tablet
in your hand, you will attract much more attention than if you are
wearing a big diamond ring," he said.</P>
      <P>Viagra is also an effective tool for forging ties with political
heavyweights. "A sense of familiarity wells up when you exchange
views or information about Viagra with them."</P>
      <P>Some local politicians have said that if the KMT wants to win a
majority in the legislature, it should not belittle the importance of
the tablets. "It should instead legalize imports of Viagra as soon as
possible to ensure a year-end victory."</P>
      <P>Sex and politics have been described as the "drug of choice" for
many men. From a psychological standpoint, the DPP candidate said,
Viagra might well emerge as the best popularity riser of all.</P>
      <P>There have been a wide variety of campaign gimmacks in the past,
ranging from performances on the back of trucks by scantily-clad
dancers, to entertaining potential supporters in clubs or bars.</P>
      <P>Vigara seems to have replaced all of these, perhaps heralding the
arrival of the "fast food" age in local politics.</P>

      <P>Australian insurance firms will not cover
any claims for losses incurred by the millennium bug and a battle
appears to be looming between these companies and their clients.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Council of Australia has issued over 500 million

companies will not cover any losses or claims from the bug also known
as Y2K.</P>
      <P>An earlier global survey indicated that losses from the Y2K could
exceed US$600 billion. In Australia, the losses are estimated at
several billions of dollars.</P>
      <P>The warning seeks to absolve insurance companies of direct
responsibility for Y2K claims. It in effect moves the insurance
liability up the purchasing chain to vendors and manufacturers,

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH DOWN SLIGHTLY IN JUNE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's economy dropped slightly in
June from May amid the Asian economic crisis, which hit local share
market and the non-residential building sector.</P>
      <P>The leading index of economic activity produced by Westpac
Banking Corp. and the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and
Social Research (MIAESR) showed that economic growth fell by 0.2
percent in June from May.</P>
      <P>This translated into an annualized growth rate of the index down
from a revised reading of 3.3 percent in May to 2.9 percent in June.</P>
      <P>The figures indicated that the result of the June decline was
largely due to the decline in Australian share market and the drop in
the non-residential building approvals recorded in June from the
previous month.</P>
      <P>"The economies of the Asia Pacific region are likely to remain in
recession for the rest of the year, although the composite Asian
Pacific leading index suggests a trough may be near," the MIAESR
report said.</P>
      <P>"Whilst the growth rate of the leading index has fallen by only
0.4 percent, the important message is that the index is now on a much
lower growth path than last month," Wespect's general manager Bill
Evans said.</P>
      <P>He said the leading index of inflation in Australia also fell to
4.9 percent in June from 5.1 percent in May. "This is the lowest
level of the index since January this year, indicating that
inflationary pressures remain subdued," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS EXPLAIN REASONS OF FLOODS IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 19 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The floods devastating mainland China's
Yangtze basin may be an act of nature, but deforestation and
extensive land development have also played a hand, conservationists
and water experts said.</P>
      <P>An official account of the damages caused by the floods so far
include over 2,000 people killed, 13.8 million rendered homeless, and
11 million acres of the nation's cropland destroyed.</P>
      <P>The transportation of both goods and people has also been
disrupted by the closing of roads, rail lines and docks. The overall
effect on the Chinese economy will be felt for many months, Lester
Brown, president of the Washington-based WorldWatch Institute,
predicted.</P>
      <P>The conservation expert noted that Beijing is treating this
disaster as an act of nature, and indeed, floods during the monsoon
season from June through September in southern China are a regular
occurrence. However, there is also a human hand in this year's floods
in the form of deforestation and extensive land development.</P>
      <P>Brian Halweil, WorldWatch staff researcher and a specialist in
water resources, noted that the Yangtze basin is home to 400 million
people, making it one of the most densely populated river basins on
earth. This density puts intense pressure on the land.</P>
      <P>To begin with, the Yangtze River basin, which originates on the
Tibetan Plateau, has lost 85 percent of its original forest cover.
The forests that once absorbed and held huge quantities of monsoon
rainfall, which could then percolate slowly into the ground, are now
largely gone. The result is a much greater runoff of water into the
river, said Halweil.</P>
      <P>The construction of buildings and roads in the basin is
increasing at a staggering pace. With the average household in
mainland China consisting of fewer than four people, a population of
400 million means 100 million housing units. And land hunger is
forcing more and more homes to be built on the river flood plain.</P>
      <P>The water resources expert added that the extent of factory
construction also defies the imagination. Although there is no
precise data on the size of the industrial workforce in the basin, a
rough estimate would be at least 50 million. With the average factory
in the private sector employing fewer than 100 people, this means
half a million factories.</P>
      <P>Each factory needs a warehouse to store raw materials coming into
the factory and for the finished products while they await shipment.
Each factory must also have a road connecting it with the rest of the
country. Collectively, these homes, factories and roads cover a vast
area, further reducing the capacity of the land to absorb rainfall.</P>
      <P>At the global level, Brown noted, the human influence on the
floods is less direct but no less real. The global temperature during
the first seven months of this year was the highest of any comparable
period on earth. Furthermore, the month of July was the warmest month
since record keeping began in 1866.</P>
      <P>Higher temperatures mean more evaporation, more intense storms,
and more rapid snow melt. All three can be contributing to the
floods. While there is no way of conclusively linking global warming
to specific weather events, the likelihood that they are linked has
grown with each passing year in which higher temperatures are
accompanied by more extreme weather events.

    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>That higher temperatures mean more evaporation is certain. And
when more moisture goes up, more comes down. Where it comes down is
less predictable. But the Yangtze basin may well be one of the areas
receiving some of the additional rainfall.</P>
      <P>Another likely effect is more intense monsoons -- the result of
seasonal warming over the continents as summer unfolds. As
temperatures climb over the land, air rises, pulling moisture-laden
air from the oceans inland. The higher the temperature over the land,
the stronger the monsoon, according to Brown.</P>
      <P>Higher global temperatures are also leading to increased snow
melt. "We don't know with certainty whether the temperature has risen
this year in the snow-covered regions that feed the upper Yangtze,
but, given the dramatic rise in the global average in recent months,
it likely has," said the conservation expert.</P>
      <P>With the international community unable to agree on a meaningful
effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, rising atmospheric levels
of this greenhouse gas promise even higher temperatures in the future
with the potential for more evaporation, more rainfall, and even
stronger monsoons.</P>
      <P>While the Yangtze flood may be the worst in 44 years, Brown said,
"We can expect even worse floods in years ahead."</P>
      <P>If the basin adds another 100 million people as projected over
the next few decades, China will need to build another 25 million
homes.</P>
      <P>As industrialization continues at a rapid pace, factory and road
construction will also continue, further reducing the area of land
that can absorb water and increasing the amount that will ultimately
flow into the Yangtze, added Halweil.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, INDIA TO FORGE INVESTMENT GUARANTEE PACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to sign an investment
guarantee agreement with India later this month to further bolster
economic ties between the two countries, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Neng-chung, director general of MOEA's Industrial Development
and Investment Center, confirmed that he will lead a Taiwan mission
to New Delhi at the end of this month to meet with Indian officials
to sign the agreement.</P>
      <P>Lin said a department director of the Indian Economics Ministry
surnamed Kumar was instrumental in the bilateral investment guarantee
pact. Kumar discussed the initiative with MOFA during his visit to
Taipei last year.</P>
      <P>India, formerly a closed market, took to liberalizing its economy
after adopting a free-market policy in 1991.</P>
      <P>Although two-way trade between India and Taiwan has been
insignificant in the past, it posted an increase of 30 percent last
year compared to the year-earlier level amounting to US$1.21 billion,
with Taiwan's exports to India totaling US$549 million and imports at
US$662 million.</P>
      <P>As of June this year, Taiwan investment in India totaled about
US$36.1 million.</P>
      <P>India will be the 18th country to sign an investment guarantee
agreement with Taiwan. Costa Rica and Guatemala are also planning to
sign similar pacts with Taiwan, said Lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC AMBASSADOR SPEAKS ON GOVERNMENT'S MAINLAND POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By J.J. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China continues to ban
direct links with mainland China for the sake of national security
and the welfare of the people, Loh I-cheng, former ambassador to
South Africa said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Loh, leading an ROC academic delegation, was speaking at the
Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard University in
Boston. He was responding to professor Roderick MacFarquhar's
question of why Taiwan was dragging its feet in establishing the
three direct links -- trade, postal and transportation -- with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Loh said President Lee Teng-hui's "go slow, be patient" policy
toward investing in the mainland aims to keep the root of enterprises
on the island so that the lifeline of Taiwan's economy will not fall
into the hands of the mainland.</P>
      <P>He also said Beijing's promotion of its "one country, two
systems" model for unification was to lure Taiwan into its fold, and
is itself a contradictory and unworkable idea.</P>
      <P>Professor Leng tze-kang of National Chengchi University said
Beijing's proposal of establishing the three direct links have
economic as well as political concerns, and the ROC government has to
respond cautiously.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should not stall on the issue of direct links, professor
Joseph Fewsmith of Boston University suggested, but instead engage in
serious talks with Beijing.</P>
      <P>In response, professor Chiou Chao-lin of National Taiwan
University said Beijing has turned to the United States after failing
to pressure Taipei into such talks. The mainland is using its
relationship with the US to force Taiwan to the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>She urged the US not to cave into such pressure. Washington
should not decide the future of Taiwan through its talks with
Beijing, but maintain parallel relations with Taiwan to promote
positive exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-cheng of National Chung Cheng University suggested that
both sides of the strait could start with technical issues before
turning their attention to political issues.</P>
      <P>Loh and his delegation left Taiwan for the US on Aug. 11. Since
his arrival, he has met with US media such as the Boston Globe and
Christian Science Monitor, academic figures as well as members of
think tanks.</P>
      <P>The delegation visited New York and Washington D. C. before going
to Boston. Their next stop will be Los Angeles and they are due to
return to Taiwan on Aug. 24.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH WARNS AGAINST CHOLERA IN INDIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) on Friday
said those traveling to India should be on special guard against
cholera.</P>
      <P>Noting that New Delhi has recorded 534 cases of cholera in July,
up from 229 cases during the same period last year, DOH officials
urged Taiwan tourists to avoid eating raw food and to pay particular
attention to personal hygiene.</P>
      <P>The sharp increase in cholera could be attributed to water
shortages in New Delhi in July, resulting in problems in water
hygiene, they said.</P>
      <P>India's rainy season, which is between July and October in New
Delhi, is especially susceptible to the spread of malaria and dengue
fever, officials noted. The number of deaths from dengue fever
numbered over 500 in New Delhi last year, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials also urged the public to be vigilant against
mosquito bites when traveling in Southeast Asian nations. Those
feeling unwell and who are suffering from fever and rashes --
symptoms of dengue fever -- should seek immediate medical assistance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'SHI-TANG MEETING' A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The day-to-day affairs managers of
the two intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait must
meet as a matter of principle prior to a meeting between the
top leaders of the organizations, a visiting ROC official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, made the remarks after learning that the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) had invited Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China to
make a week-long visit to Beijing and Shanghai either on Sept. 15-21
or on Oct. 12-18.</P>
      <P>ARATS said in its Aug. 19 letter to its Taipei counterpart, the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), that SEF Chairman C.F. Koo is also
welcome to visit other mainland cities if desired. It further said
Koo can freely exchange views with ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan on
matters of mutual concern or issues either side is interested in
discussing.</P>
      <P>ARATS also said that if necessary, SEF Deputy Secretary-General
Jan Chi-horng may travel to the mainland again to put final touches
on Koo's itinerary.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Responding to ARATS' invitation, Lin said Taiwan still hopes that
the "responsible persons" of the two intermediary bodies -- namely
SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow and ARATS Vice
Chairman Tang Shubei -- can first meet to outline an agenda for the
much-anticipated Koo-Wang meeting.</P>
      <P>"This is a matter of principle that the high-profile Koo-Wang
meeting is preceded by a Shi-Tang meeting. Otherwise, we'll see a
scenario that mainland China unilaterally decides the levels and the
delegates for all future cross-strait talks," Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, Lin would not say whether a Shi-Tang meeting is a
prerequisite for the long-stalled Koo-Wang meeting. He simply said
that without a Shi-Tang meeting, it may be difficult for Koo to meet
his ARATS counterpart.</P>
      <P>Reports from Taipei quoted SEF officials as saying there are
practical reasons for holding a Shi-Tang meeting which would pave the
way for a summit meeting between the two intermediary bodies.</P>
      <P>Lin arrived in San Francisco earlier this week to attend a
seminar on the current state of cross-strait ties and Taiwan's
mainland policy. He said here on Monday that ARATS officials were not
fully authorized to discuss issues related to Koo's planned mainland
visit during their two meetings with SEF officials held earlier this
year.</P>
      <P>"The ARATS officials only brought with them 'several pieces of
paper and a pencil' and didn't show sincerity in discussing practical
issues," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>SEF is under the supervision of the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Lin left here for Vancouver, Canada Wednesday afternoon for a
speech tour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ABORIGINE YOUTHS CONQUER S.E. ASIAN PEAK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  central  Taiwan, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of 16 youths from
Taiwan's aboriginal Bunun tribe on Thursday scaled Southeast Asia's
highest peak, making them the youngest to successfully challenge
Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The mountain stands 4,095 meters above sea level and is located
in the northeast region of Sarawak and Sabah states.</P>
      <P>The 16 youngsters, aged between 9 and 13, erected a Republic of
China national flag on the top of Mount Kinabalu to mark their
achievement. Their leader John Wu, principal of the Tungpu Primary
School of Hsinyi Hsiang in Nantou County, also performed a
sun-worshiping ritual to express the group's exhilaration.</P>
      <P>The Bunun team arrived in Sabah's capital of Kota Kinabalu Monday
and proceed to climb the 3,300-meter Crocker Rang the next day. After
the one-day warm-up exercise, the young Bunun climbers scaled Mount
Kinabalu Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>This expedition follows the group's successful attempt last year
up Mount Jade, Taiwan and Northeast Asia's highest peak.</P>
      <P>According to team coach Wu Ah-hao, a Bunun tribeswoman in her 40s
and a trained athlete from the Taipei Physical Education College, the
youths are good hikers because of their Bunun blood. The Bunun
people, indigenous to Mount Jade and Taiwan's Central Mountain Range,
are brave people and are born athletes, she said.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the team, each member had to pass a two-week test
in steep hiking conditions in Tatajia, a 2,400-meter range of Mount
Jade. After the Tatajia test, the youths ran up the 2,881-meter Lulin
Mountain. Those who could not sustain the physical challenge failed
to make the team.</P>
      <P>Team leader Wu Hung-sheng, 12, said he wanted to challenge Mount
Kinabalu for his father, a Bunun mountain climber who died during a
rescue mission in Hsuehshan, a high-altitude mountain range in
central Taiwan several years ago.</P>
      <P>Other group members include Wu Li-wei and Wu Shih-wei,
11-year-old twin brothers, who come from a mountain climbing family.
Their grandfather carried the bronze statue of Yu You-jen, the late 
president of the Control Yuan, the ROC's highest watchdog agency, to
the top of Mount Jade where it sat until recently.</P>
      <P>Among the 16 youths, four are girls. Their gender by no means
makes them physically inferior to their boy peers, coach Wu said.</P>
      <P>The team is scheduled to return to Taiwan Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNA INTERVIEW WITH ROC DEFENSE MINISTER CHIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling of the
Republic of China on Taiwan said Thursday that Taiwan will
eventually serve as a good model for the development of the Chinese
nation in the future, but it has to strengthen its armed forces at
the present time.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks in an interview with the CNA on the eve
of the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Strait Crisis, which began on
Aug. 23, 1958.</P>
      <P>During the 44-day crisis, the People's Liberation Army of
communist China pounded the islands of Kinmen with 474,000 artillery
shells with a purpose to seize the islands and conquer Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The event marks the starting point of different economic
and political development on Taiwan and the Chinese mainland.
Taiwan's policy to develop an export-oriented economy and
constitutional democracy has led to economic prosperity and social
stability, while the series of disastrous social movements, including
the Great Leap Forward and the Great Culture Revolution, have
resulted in long years of social and economic turmoil on the
Chinese mainland, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's awakening to the reality and adopting the "reform
and openness" policy have clearly shown that all Chinese people
welcome democracy and freedom, and look forward to the improvement of
their living conditions, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"China will be eventually united under the principles of
democracy, freedom, and equitable distribution of wealth for all
Chinese people," he said, adding that Taiwan will become a model for
future development.</P>
      <P>Chiang said however that Beijing has never abandoned its attempt
to take over Taiwan by force, as can be seen from its missile
test-firing exercises in the Taiwan Strait in 1996 and its national
defense white paper issued earlier this year.</P>
      <P>"In order to avoid war, we can not ignore war. We have to learn
from it," he said.</P>
      <P>"We can not protect ourselves without strength," he stressed,
adding that "In order to safeguard our country we must build up a
defensive force strong to protect ourselves."

(By Flor Wang)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: On the occasion of 40th anniversary of the Aug. 23
bombardment of Kinmen, what activities will be sponsored by the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) to mark this historic memorial
day?</P>
      <P>A: First of all, I would like to point out that the
Republic of China has managed to stand upright since undergoing the
severe test of the ruthless bombardment which began on Aug. 23, 1958.</P>
      <P>Under the outstanding leadership of late presidents Chiang
Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo, as well as President Lee Teng-hui, the
country has grown and developed toward prosperity, wealth, and
happiness, creating an economic miracle-- the "Taiwan
experience"--which becomes the envy of the world. We can say that
the ROC's victory in the Aug. 23 battle was an important demarcation
point in Taiwan's development.</P>
      <P>To mark this historic memorial day, the MND began sponsoring
various commemorative activities starting from July 1. These
activities include: a national essay contest; a historical
exhibition; an art exhibition; and an academic seminar.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in memory of the officers and men killed during the
bombardment, and to commend their loyalty and bravery, the MND will
hold a series of memorial services from Aug. 20-22 and from Aug.
26-29 on Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the officers and men who took part in the
battle have been invited to attend the services, and to visit
military establishments on the island.</P>
      <P>The MND will also hold "completion ceremonies for the Aug. 23
battle monument" from Aug. 23 through September in Kaohsiung City,
Taichung City and Chungho City, to which representatives of the
officers and men involved will also be invited to attend. These
ceremonies will include the conferral of "Aug. 23 battle honor
badges."</P>
      <P>We hope that this series of commemorative activities will arouse
public consensus that there should be no distinction drawn between
patriots and protectors of the homeland, and that only through faith,
unity, and love of the country, can people enjoy victory and glory
together.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)
(By Ben Wu)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: Can you review and explian the Aug. 23 artillery
bombardment, and talk about your personal impressions and feelings?</P>
      <P>A: 1. The Chinese Communists suddenly launched a cluster of
artillery bombarments on the Kinmen and its adjacent islands at 6:30
p.m. on Aug. 23, 1958 in an attempt to destroy Kinmen with drum-fire
at a blow, and to invade Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Within 44 days from Aug. 23 to Oct. 6, the Communist gunners 
fired more than 474,000 shells at the island, for an average of
1,473 shells per aquare kilometer of the island. A total of 587
officers and men died in the battle (including three deputy
commanders of the Kinmen Defense Command, namely Chao
Chia-siang, Chang Chieh and Chi Sing-wen), another 2,016 were
injured, with signal corps suffered the highest ratio of casualties.</P>
      <P>A total of 80 civilians were killed, 85 heavily injured,
and 136 suffered minor injuries. Meanwhile, 2,649 houses were totally
destroyed and 2,397 were damaged, with Little Kinmen suffered the
heaviest damage.</P>
      <P>However, due to the far-sighted leadership of the late President
Chiang, and the composure of the armed forces of the Republic of
China, although nearly half a million shells dropped on Kinmen in 44
days, and many fierce naval and air battles took place. The morale
of the troops was very high, they become braver after each fight, and
with the successful delivery of supplies via the beach, the Chinese
Communists were forced to announce a ceasefire on Oct. 5, they
then changed their strategy, and begun shelling the islands on
alternate days, slowing down their attempt to "liberate Taiwan with
force". This battle basically assured the peace and stability of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>2. The Aug. 23 Taiwan Strait Battle 40 years ago has shaped
entirely different courses of development for Chinese people on
either side of the strait. Since that time, Beijing has actively
promoted the "General Line for Socialist Construction", and
practiced the "People's Communes", and later culminated in the
"Cultural Revolution," bringing bloody massacres and long-term unrest
to the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Taipei, on the other hand, chose the strategy of export-
oriented growth, promoted various construction projects, and
created the world-famous economic miracle. Because of the
implementation of nine-year of free education, the quality of
national human resources was raised and the local self-
government was enhanced, laying a good foundation for future political
development.</P>
      <P>3. After 40 years, when we review the important military
campaign which turned Taiwan from danger to safety, we know that
although the artillery fire has ceased, but Beijing still refuses to
renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Forty years ago, despite extremely poor material condition, the
entire nation was able to unite under a strong common cause. The
whole population--both military men and civilians, of one heart
and one mind, with no differentiation as to origin--was able to
resist a strong enemy and surmount the crisis.</P>
      <P>After 40 years, we now enjoy prosperity, social atability
and political democracy. But with the enemy still there, the people
have gradually forgotten the lessons of gunfire, and some are seeking
personal benefit, quite often over national interests.</P>
      <P>We should learn from the history that the best way to avoid war
is not to deceive ourselves and to overlook war, but to learn from
war and to turn the teaching of war into practical action of
military preparation for war. In this way, and with actual strength,
we can be confident that the enemy dare not launch an attack,
and the national security can be assured.

      <P>Q: We know the Aug. 23, 1958 artillery battle was a watershed for
both sides of the strait, can you talk about the
significance of and the enlightenment gained from the battle?</P>
      <P>A: The Aug. 23 Taiwan Strait military campaign was a
demarcation point in the development of both sides. Due to the fact
that all efforts by the armed forces and private citizens were united
for a common purpose during wartime, a stable and peace situation in
the Taiwan Strait was basically assured.</P>
      <P>However, from there, the Chinese Communists went on to launch a
series of political movements including "The Three Red Banners," "The
Big Backyard Furnace," "The Four Cleanups" as well as the 10-year
"Cultural Revolution." The series of errors and power struggles
resulted in a recession on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan has actively engaged in various reconstruction
projects and marched toward prosperity. For the past 40 years, the
"Taiwan experience" that we helped establish has become a marvel of
the world.</P>
      <P>Because at present China is under separate reign, there is no
so-called "one China." There is only a China with separate governing
heads. However, the government of the Republic of China -- which has
spared no effort in developing its economy and implementing democracy
-- will no doubt be the model of a future unified China.</P>
      <P>Under the present circumstances, Beijing has been forced to
change its policy to "reform and open," clear proof that the
improvement of people's living standard, desire for democracy and
freedom is not only a global trend, but also a common wish of Chinese
people on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>China should be unified, but such unification must be under a
system of democracy, freedom and equal distribution of wealth, a
system that takes care of the interests of all Chinese on one hand,
and on the other, follows a world trend.</P>
      <P>In the future, both sides of the strait should adopt a rational
and peaceful manner of interaction instead of war or conflict.
Beijing must renounce the use of force as a threat against Taiwan to
lay a good foundation for the development of a Chinese nation and
protect the welfare of the people on both sides of the strait. This
is what we should learn from the Aug. 23 bombardment.

      <P>Q: Do you think the Aug. 23 artillery bombardment has had any
impact on the development of the ROC's armed forces buildup and
national defense?</P>
      <P>A: The Aug. 23 military campaign has had a decisive impact
on both the survival and development of Taiwan, as well as the bright
future of China.</P>
      <P>In other words, if we failed in that military campaign, the
Chinese communists may have already "blood-washed" Taiwan and there
would not have been a "Taiwan experience" worthy of world envy.
Therefore, we can say the Aug. 23 military campaign in the Taiwan
Strait is a historic demarcation point of development for both sides
of the strait.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the bravery of the armed forces in their fighting, the
Taiwan Strait was able to maintain a relative peace after this
military campaign. Taiwan, with 40 years of stability, was able to
engage in various reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>However, since Beijing has not completely renounced the use of
force against Taiwan, the ROC's armed forces should look to the brave
performance during the Aug. 23 military campaign as their model, to
be more diligent in their training, to enhance their combat
readiness, to support the government, and to be a solid force in
safeguarding peace and stability in the strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, people from all walks of life in the country should
also clearly understand the circumstances of our nation and the
developing cross-strait situation. They should give more support and
encouragement to officers and men, and back up national defense
developments which will reinforce national defense. People should
also establish a consensus on national defense to assure our
security.

      <P>Q: Beijing has never abandoned its attempt to grab Taiwan by
force, as can be seen from its ballistic missile test-firing
exercises in the Taiwan Strait in 1996 and its national defense
white paper issued earlier this year. Do you have any comment on
this? Do you have any advice to the people of this country in this
regard?</P>
      <P>A: As it is well-known, the Chinese communists firmly believe
that "Political power comes from the barrel of the gun." They have
never abandoned the option of using force against Taiwan. The Chinese
Communist regime has long tried to achieve their goal of "liberating
Taiwan" by force, as can be seen from the series of military threat
against Taiwan and military actions against Taiwan troops on
Kuningtou and Tengpu islets in 1949, on Tadan and Erdan islets in
1950, on Yikiangshan islet in 1955, on Kinmen and Matsu in 1958, and
the three missile-firing exercises in the Taiwan Strait to
intimidate us in 1996.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing took the military actions in the name of
fighting against international imperialism, its real intention is to
take over Taiwan in one stroke. Therefore, the people of this country
have to heighten their vigilance.</P>
      <P>What I want to emphasize here is that we can not protect
ourselves without strength, and that in order to safeguard our
country we must build up a defensive force strong enough to protect
ourselves. To promote the concept of peace and help establish a
regional security system is also our long-standing goal, because it
is important to our national security.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we have to acquire adequate defensive weapons and
equipment from foreign countries and step up our research and
development efforts, although we have no intention to engage in
an arms race with mainland China. By doing so, we shall be able to
strengthen our national defense, avoid military conflicts, and
improve cross-strait relations for eventual national unification.</P>
      <P>I would call upon our people to give full support to the
government's plan to make our armed forces strong enough to protect
ourselves. We should rely on our own strength rather than hoping that
the enemy will not come to attack us.</P>
      <P>Q: Can you please elaborate on the nation's policy on military
buildup, and the program to build up a new generation of armed
forces?</P>
      <P>A: It is our present policy to carry out the government's
strategy of "keeping the situations in the Taiwan Strait peaceful and
stable." Therefore, our defensive warfare guidelines are based on the
strategy of "strong defensive posture" and "effective deterrance." On
this basis, we are actively building up a new generation of armed
forces, which will have "top efficiency" and "rapid response
capability." (MORE)</P>

      <P>Under the plan, we are modernizing our weapon systems for the
air, sea, and anti-landing defense forces in several stages.</P>
      <P>For air defense, we have produced Indiginous Defense
Fighters (IDF) and ordered other advanced jet fighters from the
United States and France. We have taken delivery of some of the
aircraft.</P>
      <P>We have already put into service some 80 IDFs, 50 US-made F-16
jet fighters, and 30 French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters. The
three types of aircraft will greatly upgrade our air-defense
capability.</P>
      <P>We have also deployed six locally-made Tienkung (Sky Bow)
surface-to-air missile systems and have received all of the improved
MADS air-defense missiles we have ordered. The project for the
improvement of 20 US-made Kawk ground-to-air missile sets has also
been completed. By doing these, we will be able to improve the
automation and integration features of our air-defense operations
step by step.</P>
      <P>For sea defense, we have commissioned six Chenkung-class
warships and six Kangting-class warships. The six Knox-class frigates
rented from the United States have been received. These warships
will be able to enhance the naval defense capability.</P>
      <P>For anti-landing combats, we have taken delivery of 240 M60A3TTS
tanks, about 40 AH-1W attack helicopters, and 20 OH58D search-attack
helicopters.</P>
      <P>In order to modernize our national defense force, we have made
great efforts in weapon research and development.</P>
      <P>We have been able to produce IDF warplanes and land-fired
Tienchien (Sky Sword) I missiles. We are producing Tienchien II and
Tienkung II missiles, and have already deployed Tienkung I missiles.
Hsiungfeng II anti-ship missiles have been installed for use on land
and warships.</P>
      <P>We are also doing researches for the development of low-altitude
anti-tactical ballistic missiles and other weapons to strengthen our
defensive forces. It is believed that our armed forces will have
"high efficiency" and "fast response capability" when our military
modernization project is completed in 2001.</P>
      <P>The four-year project, which will be completed in three stages,
will enable the government to reduce the number of military
servicemen from 450,000 to 400,000 and to make the armed forces
stronger and more efficient.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN MILITARY POSTMAN PROUD TO HAVE FULFILLED 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen  (CNA)
(By Ni Guo-yen &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Postman Dong Wen-chien considers it a matter of
pride that he was able to successfully continue delivering mail
during mainland China's 44-day bombardment of the Kinmen island group
40 years ago.</P>
      <P>At the tender age of 19, Dong began working as a military postman
in 1956. Two years later, on Aug. 23, 1958, mainland China launched a
massive bombardment campaign against the islands, and Dong found
himself an active participant in the historic battle. He dodged live
shells to deliver each item of mail to every addressee.</P>
      <P>In those days 40 years ago, everyone on the Kinmen islands was
dependent on the military for postal services -- civilians and
servicemen alike.</P>
      <P>Dong had to arm himself to the teeth to carry out his "mission
impossible" during the battle. Few other postmen can boast of having
to put on a steel helmet before going off to deliver letters by
bicycle.</P>
      <P>It was much like playing a game of life and death in those days,
a reminiscing Dong said. I had to duck dropping shells and avoid
falling into craters formed by the exploding bombs, he added.</P>
      <P>All the efforts were worthwhile, Dong said, particularly after
soldiers received letters from their families expressing deep
gratitude to the man who was able to deliver their messages.</P>
      <P>There were tens of thousands of letters and parcels which needed
to be delivered each day during the battle. And considering the
military postman's doctrine, which is that every piece of mail must
be delivered every day, Dong did an excellent job.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTER SATISFIED WITH FRUITFUL VISIT TO PHILIPPINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said on
Thursday that his just-concluded visit to the Philippines was
successful and fruitful.</P>
      <P>Wang said during his three-day visit to Manila, he managed to
meet with Philippine President Joseph E. Estrada for wide-ranging
talks.</P>
      <P>"Estrada told me that Taiwan entrepreneurs are welcome to invest
in the Philippines and that the Philippine government is determined
to improve the country's investment climate," Wang said.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Manila, Wang attended the an annual economic
cooperation conference between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"The two sides reached consensus on many points, including
cooperation in trade, agriculture, tourism and labor affairs," Wang
said.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the two sides signed a temporary admission of
goods agreement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC agreed to send foodstuff experts to the
Philippines in October to teach food processing technology. The
Philippines will send a fact-finding mission to Taiwan later this
year to study Taiwan's sugar-making and aquacultural technologies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Philippines has agreed to resume imports of
Taiwan pork, which was suspended since a foot-and-mouth disease
swept Taiwan's hog farms more than a year ago.</P>
      <P>The Philippines also agreed to hold a meeting with the ROC in
December to discuss possible amendments to the existing bilateral
aviation pact. "The Philippines has tentatively agreed to allow
Taiwan carriers to operate all-cargo flight services," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Philippines promised to revise its current law to
allow foreign investors to own industrial land in its territory.</P>
      <P>The Philippines has also agreed to more strictly screen personal
data of Philippine nationals to work in Taiwan and to work out
more reasonable standards for labor brokering fees.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the Philippines began to hold an economic cooperation
meeting annually in 1992. Substantive relations between the two
countries have since become ever closer. In 1997, Taiwan was the
Philippines' fourth largest trading partner, the ninth largest
investor and the third largest source of tourists.</P>
      <P>According to Philippine tallies, Taiwan poured a total of US$740
million in the Philippines between 1986 and 1997 for various
investment projects, making it the Philippines' fifth largest
capital source.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOREAN COMFORT WOMAN VISITS TAIWAN TO PROMOTE CAUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former South Korean comfort woman arrived
in Taipei on Thursday to inspect what may be the remains of a
military brothel run by the imperial Japanese army in northern Taiwan
during World War II.</P>
      <P>"Lee Yong-soo, 71, is scheduled to visit the site at an ROC Air
Force base in Hsinchu, some 60 kilometers south of Taipei, on
Saturday, to ascertain whether or not it really once accommodated a
Japanese military brothel," said a spokeswoman for the Taipei Women's
Rescue Foundation (TWRF), which is hosting Lee's visit.</P>
      <P>The visit is part of the foundation's efforts to push the
Japanese government to formally apologize for forcing a large number
of Asian women, including many from Taiwan, South Korea and the
Philippines, to work as sex slaves for Japanese military servicemen
during World War II, the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>Lee made a previous TWRF-sponsored trip to Taiwan last year for
the same purpose, but was denied access to the Hsinchu air base on
that occasion, the spokeswoman said, adding: "With the assistance
from New Party Legislator Hsieh Chi-ta, Lee will be able this time to
enter the Hsinchu air base to inspect the presumed brothel remains.</P>
      <P>"If the site is proved to be the remains of a Japanese military
brothel, we'll have more concrete evidence to pressure Japan into
making a public apology for its past sins and compensating the
surviving former comfort women, most of whom are now in their 70s and
live in solitude," the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>She further said that local women's rights activists are
encouraged by the publication of a United Nations investigative
report on the comfort women issue.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Japanese government forced more than
200,000 foreign women to become sex slaves during World War II. The
report demanded Japanese compensation for all the surviving victims.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the TWRF spokeswoman said the battle to force Japan
to apologize and provide compensation is far from over, as the
country remains unrepentant and recalcitrant despite the recent
release of the UN report.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said the TWRF will continue joining forces with
women's rights groups in other Asian countries to file lawsuits with
Japanese courts against the Japanese government over the issue.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government set up a private Asian Women's Fund in
1995 that has offered to compensate each former comfort woman with 2
million Japanese yen for her suffering. Many of the women, however,
have refused compensation unless it comes directly from the Japanese
government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MUSEUM OF HISTORY FORGES SISTER TIES WITH CATEDRA GAUDI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bridge between Taiwan and Spain was
formed with the establishment of a sister relationship between
Taipei's National Museum of History and Spain's Catedra Gaudi of the
Polytechnic University of Catalunya.</P>
      <P>Huang Kuang-nan, head of the Taipei museum, described the Catedra
Gaudi as a museum devoted to the preservation and promotion of
architectural art, the aesthetic spirit of Antonio Gaudi (1852-1926)
and architectural exchanges between the Eastern and Western worlds.</P>
      <P>Huang said at a news conference Wednesday that he hoped the
sister ties can open a door to the cultural and artistic interaction
between Eastern and Western architecture.</P>
      <P>He added that he hopes the "Art of Gaudi's Architecture"
exhibition, which opens Thursday at the national museum on Nanhai
Road, will inspire Taiwan people to improve their living environment
and raise concerns over the quality of public buildings.</P>
      <P>A total of 110 works, including architectural plans, photographs,
building models, furniture and components for a Gaudi-style building
will be used to illustrate different aspects of Gaudi architecture
during the one-month exhibition.</P>
      <P>In addition, experts from Catera Gaudi, one of the exhibition's
three sponsors including the Museum of History and the Chinese
Architects Association, will take interested members on tour of
Gaudi's curvaceous, colorful wonder-world in a three-dimensional
multimedia presentation.</P>
      <P>This is a particular treat as this type of presentation has never
been shown outside Spain, exhibition organizers said.</P>
      <P>The multimedia performance will systematically introduce and
interpret the unique Gaudi arts and their multifarious appearances
covering cubism, surrealism, expressionism, and constructivism, the
museum said.</P>
      <P>Gaudi, one of the world's most creative architects, built a world
that does not fall into any established academic art categories. He
drew inspiration from his observation of humans, animals, plants,
mountains and other forms of natural creation then implemented them
into the construction of buildings without straight lines or
completely plane surfaces because he claimed these "shapes" did not
exist in nature.</P>
      <P>Based on these ideas, Gaudi designed buildings with vivid colors,
curved surfaces, flowing lines and spaces. He also often used
diagonal supports resembling flying buttresses, which are external
wall supports popular in Gothic architecture.</P>
      <P>The best-known works of the architectural genius include the Casa
Mila, the unfinished hillside Park Guell, and the unfinished Sagrada
Familia in Barcelona which is probably the city's most famous
landmark.</P>
      <P>After dedicating 12 years of his life to realizing his biggest
and most inspiring construction project -- the Sagrada Familia --
Gaudi died at the age of 74 in a traffic accident. Only the facade of
the planned church was completed at that stage of construction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN ADOPTION OF CHINESE CHILDREN LIKELY TO RISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 20 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China and Australia have signed
an agreement making the Australian adoption of Chinese children
easier, the Sydney Morning Herald reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the paper's correspondent David Lague
reported that the mainland will open the doors of its orphanages to
Australians after Canberra dropped a regulation stating that children
adopted from overseas are automatically wards of the minister of
immigration upon their arrival.</P>
      <P>Beijing earlier objected to this regulation because it
effectively rendered the children stateless until authorities
recognized the adoption process.</P>
      <P>Many Australians are desperate to adopt children overseas
because of a shortage of available children for adoption in their
country.</P>
      <P>In 1971, the daily reported the number of kids for adoption was
close to 10,000, but the figure plummeted to only 700 in 1997 with
only 269 children coming from overseas. Most of them came from South
Korea, India and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Prospective adoptive parents have welcomed the news but they
warned the red tape plus a strong bias imposed by states and
territories in Australia could remain major hurdles for Australian
couples wanting to adopt kids.</P>
      <P>China has been a constant source of children adoption for the
United States, Canada and Western Europe, but no agreements have yet
been signed between these countries and the mainland. American
parents alone adopt about 4,000 children, mostly girls, each year,
the daily reported.

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE OF KINMEN HOPEFUL THEIR HOME WILL NEVER AGAIN BE BATTLEFIELD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen, the island group which has always
been shrouded in a veil of military mystique, is now being opened to
tourism, and its people are hopeful that their home will never again
be a battlefield.</P>
      <P>Following the recent increase in exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, real estate advertisements for property in Xiamen City, in
mainland China's Fujian Province, are now common in Kinmen's news
media. The coast of Fujian is just 2 kilometers from Kinmen at its
nearest point.</P>
      <P>Although it is not certain exactly how many Kinmen people have
bought houses in Xiamen, the number is without doubt fairly high, and
a development which would have been completely unthinkable 40 years
ago.</P>
      <P>The Chinese communists began a 44-day bombardment of the Kinmen
island group on Aug. 23, 1958. A total of over 474,900 shells were
fired on an area of some 150 square kilometers during the battle. In
the 20 years which followed, Kinmen was harassed by a total of over
977,000 shells containing communist propaganda, which were fired on
alternate days until 1978.</P>
      <P>The system of military administration on Kinmen was dismantled on
Nov. 7, 1992, when a civilian county council was formed, formally
bringing the people of Kinmen into the fold of democracy.</P>
      <P>This can be illustrated by the vociferous calls by the people of
Kinmen for their own "three mini-links" with mainland China, and
highlights the freedom of speech now enjoyed by the local people. The
so called "three links" refer to direct shipping, postal, and
business links across the Taiwan Strait, for which Beijing has been
pushing hard.</P>
      <P>The people of Kinmen want their own direct links with the
mainland, so that they can make the 40-minute boat trip to and from
the mainland without fear of arrest. The journey currently takes more
that 50 hours, as travelers must go via Taiwan and Hong Kong owing to
the lack of direct links between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, though, this issue can only be resolved by Taipei and
Beijing.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will sign an investment guarantee
agreement with India late this month, Economic Affairs Minister Wang
Chih-kang said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Neng-chung, director-general of the Industrial Development

will lead a delegation to India later this month and ink the accord,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The economics minister said the inking of the investment
guarantee accord with India is of great importance to bilateral ties,
as India has maintained closer relations with neighboring mainland
China over the past 40 years.</P>
      <P>Wang said the MOEA, in conjunction with the China External Trade
Development Council, has worked out an export expansion package
targeting several potential markets, including India.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics show that two-way Taiwan-India trade totaled
US$1.2 billion in 1997, up 30 percent from 1996. Taiwan exports to
India hit US$550 million last year, while Indian imports to Taiwan
reached US$660 million. Taiwan investment in India totaled about
US$36 million as of July 1997, focusing mainly on the textile,
automobile accessory, and chemical industries.</P>
      <P>Wang revealed that the MOEA is also seeking to clinch investment
guarantee pacts with South Korea, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica,

    <HEADLINE>US ROLE IN 1958 BOMBARDMENT OF KINMEN (PART I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States played a critical role
in both of the Taiwan Strait crises, one in 1958 and the other in
1996. Although the roles were different due to international
circumstances, the US wielded its influence through real military
power, playing the role of "guardian of peace." The US also opened
the doors for dialogue to prevent further conflict.</P>
      <P>During the 1958 bombardment on Kinmen, the ROC and the US still
had diplomatic relations. The US maintained a mutual defense command
in Taipei and the US Seventh Fleet also provided defense for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the US dispatched four destroyers from the
Mediterranean Sea to waters close to Taiwan. The aircraft carrier
"Midway" was also mobilized with the US Navy acting to protect
logistic missions. In terms of arms shipments, the US supplied F86
jet fighters, "Rattlesnake" air-to-air missiles, and eight-inch heavy
artillery to defend Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Nearly four decades later, the mainland Chinese conducted missile
tests in 1996 off Taiwan's southern and northern coastlines, followed
by "live-fire" air force and naval maneuvers, heightening the tension
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration first warned Beijing not to
misinterpret the situation. Later, the aircraft carriers "Nimitz" and
"Independence" as well as their escort battle groups were dispatched
to waters off Taiwan, marking the largest-scale deployment of US
naval forces in this region since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Shen Lyu-shun,
director of the Foreign Ministry's North American Affairs Department,
talked about the difference in the two Taiwan Strait crises.</P>
      <P>He noted that the 1958 bombardment of Kinmen happened during the
Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, and that the
ROC and the US still maintained formal relations at that time.</P>
      <P>During the two crises, Shen remarked, "The US had played the same
role as guardian of peace, and it's understandable that peace was
maintained through the display of real power."</P>
      <P>According to declassified top-secret documents from the US
Department of State as reported by Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper,
during the peak of the 1958 Taiwan Strait military clash, the US
military had considered using nuclear weapons against the mainland to
protect Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>That report said a memorandum by officials with the US State
Department indicated that should the Chinese Communists attack
Kinmen, Matsu, the Taiwan proper or South Korea, there would be a
need for the US to counterattack with nuclear arms. The targets of
such counterattack were Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Guangzhou.</P>
      <P>In fact, the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty covered only the
security of the Taiwan proper. The offshore islands, including Kinmen
and Matsu, were excluded from the perimeter. That was an apparent
flaw in the nation's defense.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Beijing's war-like actions prompted grave concerns
for the US and led to the implementation of the Formosan Resolution
that helped bolster the security of the outlying islands.

    <HEADLINE>US ROLE IN 1958 BOMBARDMENT OF KINMEN (PART II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In 1955, both houses of the US Congress passed a joint
resolution, authorizing the president to mobilize military power to
protect "related positions and territories" of Taiwan. Its purpose
was to supplement the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty whose
target was limited only to the security of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>But the US government was cautious over such a move, knowing well
that the joint resolution once implemented, might provoke the
mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>Some political observers said that judging from the declassified
documents from the State Department, the US government's analysis of
the 1958 Taiwan Strait crisis was "very accurate."</P>
      <P>The US predicted that mainland China would not likely invade
Taiwan or launch a direct attack against the outlying islands. The
most probable option was to form a blockade on the outlying islands
and to try to enforce an air blockade. That prompted the US to place
its focus on air defense and on logistic supplies for the outlying
islands.</P>
      <P>The situation on the Taiwan Strait worsened year by year, and in
1958, the ROC government hoped that the 1955 congressional resolution
would be implemented at an early date.</P>
      <P>This led then Foreign Minister George Yeh, who assumed his duty
at the end of August that year, to tell the American side that "the
security of Taiwan's outlying islands is closely connected to the
security of the Western Pacific region." His statement was strongly
considered by the US.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that then US Vice President Richard Nixon
once described Yeh's statement at a National Security Council meeting
as "very correct." And on Sept. 4, 1958, the US secretary of state
announced the implementation of the 1955 joint resolution.</P>
      <P>Seeing that the US had taken such a strong move, the Chinese
Communists decided to change their attitude and on Sept. 6 they
announced their plan to resume ambassadorial-level talks with the US.
That was the origin of the subsequent "Warsaw Talks."</P>
      <P>In his interview with the CNA, Shen Lyu-shun pointed out that
from the US responses during the 1958 and 1996 Taiwan Strait crises,
people could see a pattern developing in the US' handling of matters.
While showing its determination to maintain peace, it opened the
doors for a peaceful resolution of disputes.</P>
      <P>As Taipei and Washington had formal diplomatic relations in 1958,
about two months after the Aug. 23 massive shelling on Kinmen by the
Chinese Communists, then US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
flew to Taipei on Oct. 21 to meet with President Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>And because both countries had severed their formal diplomatic
relations, after the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, Ding Mou-shih,
secretary general of the National Security Council, held secret talks
in the US with deputy White House national security advisor Samuel
Berger. And at the same time, White House national security advisor
Anthony Lake held talks with Beijing's Vice Foreign Minister Liu
Huaqiu.</P>
      <P>William Perry, who was US defense secretary during the 1996
Taiwan Strait crisis, made private trips to mainland China and Taiwan
in 1997. He had also played a constructive role by proposing that
mainland China and Taiwan increase communications through an
unofficial "second channel" to reduce mutual misunderstanding and to
prevent the occurrence of clashes. (More)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Back in October 1958, when Dulles visited Taiwan for talks with
President Chiang Kai-shek, he also put strong pressure on Taiwan to
renounce the use of force against the mainland.</P>
      <P>Although the president did not bow to the pressure, in order to
give a friendly response to Dulles' suggestion, the ROC stated in a
Sino-American joint statement issued on Oct. 23, 1958, that returning
to the mainland to rescue the people was the government's sacred
mission. However, it pledged that this would be done not through
military force, but through Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the
People.</P>
      <P>Two days later, then mainland Chinese Defense Minister Peng
Dehuai announced Beijing's decision to implement an alternate day
shelling strategy, virtually marking the end of the bombardment of
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Taipei, Dulles also told Chiang that instead
of becoming a military-style country, Taiwan should strive to build
up its peace-loving image and to become the true inheritor of
traditional Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-shun said that during the 1958 and 1996 Taiwan Strait
crises, the US Congress provided powerful support for Taiwan, which
he described as very important.</P>
      <P>Shen, who was working for the ROC mission in Washington, D.C.
during the 1996 crisis, recalled that both houses of the US Congress
passed resolutions overwhelmingly in favor of the ROC at that time.
He said a retired congressional leader even called up the ROC mission
to show his support for Taiwan's democratization and offered to help
Taiwan overcome the crisis.</P>
      <P>Ever since the 1996 crisis, the international community has been
concerned about the probability of a reoccurrence of such a crisis
and of finding a way to prevent it.</P>
      <P>Some American scholars have even said that the chance of a
military clash in the Taiwan Strait is now higher that any time since
1979 because more and more people in Taiwan are seeking independence.</P>
      <P>But Darryl Johnson, director of the Taipei Office of the American
Institute in Taiwan, does not share that view. He said in an
interview with CNA that he does not think the chance of a new crisis
or military clash in the Taiwan Strait at the present time is any
higher than in the past.</P>
      <P>"We hope the (cross-strait) atmosphere will ease and improve.
That is the goal of President Clinton and of the US government," he
said.</P>
      <P>Johnson said that during Clinton's recent visit to mainland
China, he reiterated the US government's policy on arms sales to
Taiwan and its commitment to honoring the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Shen said he believes the United States will continue to address
the security of Taiwan and the Western Pacific under the terms of the
Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>From the standpoint of diplomacy, he said, the United States
hopes to maintain peace without resorting to military force if
possible, adding that it will continue to take precautionary steps to
prevent the reoccurrence of cross-strait crises.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan on Thursday approved a
NT$1.2955 trillion (US$37.334 billion) "domestic demand expansion"
project aimed at boosting domestic economic growth by expanding
public investment.</P>
      <P>According to the terms of the stimulus project, the government
will accelerate the implementation of construction budget bills for
fiscal 1999 and 2000, totaling NT$1.1018 trillion. In addition, an
extra NT$193.7 billion will be poured into public investment.</P>
      <P>In the field of private investment, the government will encourage
the private sector to invest in over NT$200 million-worth of
manufacturing projects, power plants, public construction projects,
industrial development projects in eastern Taiwan, leisure facilities
in western Taiwan, industrial-commercial compounds, and industrial
parks.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said in a press conference that as the

the government is obliged to introduce the two-year economic stimulus
project in order to revive the local economy.</P>
      <P>Siew said the most important task facing the government in the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Affairs Minister
Jason Hu said on Thursday that the government will closely watch any
change in Japan's position on the "three noes" regarding Taiwan, as
Japan seems uncertain on the issue.</P>
      <P>Citing information gained through bilateral channels, Hu said
Japan seems not to have made a final decision on whether it will
officially spell out support for Beijing's "three noes" demand during
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan early next
month.</P>
      <P>Calling on Japan not to yield to Beijing's demand and risk
damaging the interests of the region and itself, Hu said Beijing
should also understand that bullying Taiwan will only hurt
cross-strait ties, which will serve no useful purpose.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Japan's mass-circulation Sankei Shimbun reported on
Thursday that Tokyo has turned down Beijing's request to codify its
backing for the "three noes" in a bilateral official document to be
signed during Jiang's September visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>Citing an official with the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the
newspaper said in a front-page story that "Tokyo cannot accept
Beijing's demand, as signing a new document on the "three noes" will
create new principles for Japan in its dealings with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to the official, Taiwan-Japan relations, including
historical links, are different to the links between Taiwan and the
United States, and it is thus natural for Japan to have a different
policy toward mainland China than the United States.</P>
      <P>The official stressed that Japan has no intention of engaging
with Taiwan beyond the framework set our in the 1972 "joint
declaration" and the 1978 "peace agreement" inked by Tokyo and
Beijing. He added that Japan "fully understands and respects" that
Taiwan is an inalienable territory of mainland China, and that Tokyo
forswore its jurisdiction over Taiwan upon its surrender at the end
of World War II.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing expects Tokyo to codify its stance toward Taiwan
in the new bilateral document, the official said Tokyo, on the other
hand, wishes to use the two countries' "action guidelines" regarding
international issues as the framework for the new document, and
believes that it is unnecessary to mention its policy toward Taiwan
in this respect.</P>

      <P>Police on Thursday cracked down on a
baby-selling criminal operation in Taipei, arresting two women and
retrieving four babies.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip-off, police in the early hours of Thursday
morning arrested Fu Juei-chiao, 51, a nurse at a gynecology clinic in
Taipei, and Liao Pau-chu, 49, who served as a broker, or "white
glove," at their respective residences in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Suspicious account books were also found in both residences.
Based on information obtained from the account books, along with the
suspects' confessions, police wasted no time retrieving four babies
which had been sold -- two girls and two boys -- in Taoyuan and
Hsinchu counties. Their ages ranged between eight months and one
year.</P>
      <P>Fu was accused of selling babies at prices of between NT$400,000
and NT$500,000, as well as counterfeiting birth certificates to make
the babies appear to be the natural children of the buyers. However,
police said that more investigation will be needed to find out
whether or not the babies had been stolen from their natural parents.</P>
      <P>Fu denied all the accusations, saying she served only as a bridge
between families who wanted to adopt children and those who had
difficulties in raising their own children. According to Fu, "she was
helping people; she was doing good things."</P>
      <P>Police found that this is not the first time Fu has been involved
in the baby-selling business. Earlier this year, she received a

    <HEADLINE>ETHNIC CHINESE ALLEGEDLY CASTRATED IN INDONESIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
has instructed its representative office in Indonesia to collect
information regarding reports that a number of ethnic Chinese were
allegedly castrated during riots in that country in May.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who returned from a weeklong visit to
Paraguay on Wednesday, said that the representative office in Jakarta
has so far found no evidence to suggest there is any truth in the
unsubstantiated and unconfirmed reports, either from police or
medical records.</P>
      <P>However, Hu pointed out that the victims might have been too
afraid to report the cases, adding that the ministry's representative
office in Jakarta will make efforts to substantiate the allegations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Joko Mulayanto, representative of the Indonesian
Economic and Trade Office to Taipei, said that his government has
already set up a committee to look into the reports.</P>
      <P>Mulayanto told a group of legislators who came to the
representative office to express their concern over the reports, that
the committee is calling on the victims to come forward with their
stories, adding that he will report its findings to the ROC
government within the next few days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUTE LEAVES RECOMMENDED AS HIGHLY NUTRITIOUS VEGETABLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central Taiwan, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nutritional value of
Corchorus Olitorius, one of Asia's two jute plants which yield a
fiber used in making sacks and cordage, is as high as that of
ginseng, researchers announced.</P>
      <P>The plant's leaves are tasty and rich in calcium -- three times
higher than in spinach, potassium and other valuable minerals and
fibers, a horticulturist from the Taiwan Agriculture Research
Institute said.</P>
      <P>A recent Japanese inquiry into the C. Olitorius prompted the
institute to examine the plant further, said Shen Pai-kuei, a
horticultural researcher with the organization.</P>
      <P>Although C. Olitorius, which is indigenous to India and Burma,
was introduced to Taiwan from Thailand three years ago, it remained
commercially untapped until in recent months.</P>
      <P>Investigation into the mineral content rate in the C. Olitorius
leaves revealed that it was the highest among all other known
vegetables in Taiwan, which explains why the Japanese wanted its
seeds, Shen said.</P>
      <P>The plant, which favors warm and damp weather, can easily be
cultivated in ordinary land, even on salty and barren Penghu islands,
said Shen.</P>
      <P>The jute leaves can be harvested a month after the plant sprouts
leaves. It has dark green leaves seven- to 11-centimenter long, small
yellow flowers and small grayish-green seeds. The plant, which stands
some 150 centimeters high when fully grown, can yield another batch
of fresh leaves in 20 days. The harvest season extends for as long as
four months between early July and late November, said Shen.</P>
      <P>To prepare it as a dish, Shen recommended boiling the leaves
quickly for about a minute, then cooling it and serving it cold with
a sauce. It will taste equally good when it is cooked in egg soup.
Shen and his colleagues have even written a booklet of recipes for
the vegetable.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Qantas Airways, Australia's largest
airline operator, chalked up high earnings in the most severe market
conditions since the Gulf War in 1991.</P>
      <P>Qantas, one of the few international airlines which serves both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, announced Thursday a 20.6 percent
increase in its net profits for the fiscal 1997-98.</P>
      <P>Despite the Asian economic crisis and unprecedented fare
discounts, the Australian carrier reported close to A$305 million
(US$220 million) in profits.</P>
      <P>Qantas Chairman Gary Pemberton indicated that the airline would
not likely maintain last year's profit level in the current year,
which ends in June 1999.</P>
      <P>He attributed the possible lower profits to the continuing
volatility in Asia and pressure on air ticket prices as the
discounting battle continues unabated.</P>
      <P>Qantas, a publicly run company in Australia, has a fleet of more
than 120 planes. It set up a subsidiary -- Australian Asia Airlines
-- in 1991 to open air links between Australia and Taiwan, the first
since Canberra switched its recognition to Beijing from Taipei in
1972.</P>
      <P>This air link has helped boost two-way tourist industry relations
between Taiwan and Australia. In 1997 alone, more than 150,000
tourists from Taiwan visited Australia.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia seafood contains more omega-3
oils than fish from the Northern Hemisphere and is therefore
healthier, according to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organization (CSIRO) in Canberra.</P>
      <P>The latest study by CSIRO scientists showed that omega-3 is code
for the fatty acids that decrease the likelihood of a person
contracting heart disease, high-blood pressure and rheumatoid
arthritis.</P>
      <P>They said a joint study and an examination of nearly 200 species
of Australian fish by the CSIRO's marine research and division of
human nutrition shows that Australian seafood has between 10 and 100
times more omega-3 than beef, lamb or chicken, and is lower in
cholesterol, according to the Australian on Friday.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Peter Rothlisberg, a CSIRO marine scientist, as
saying that all seafood was good for people, but different types of
fish contained different types of oil in varying amounts.</P>
      <P>Mavis Abbey, a nutrition expert, was quoted as saying that
interest in fish-oil had been triggered by evidence that eskimos in
North America experienced a very low incidence of heart disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIVIDED CHINA IS A FACT UNDENIABLE, SAYS MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fact that China is divided is an
historic as well as political reality that is undeniable, said Sheu
Ke-sheng, spokesman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), on Friday.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the Chinese mainland has been governed by the Beijing
authorities while Taiwan, Penghu (Pescadores), Kinmen (Quemoy) and
Matsu have continuously been governed by the Republic of China
government. Over the past half century, the People's Republic of
China has never -- not for a single day -- exercised jurisdiction
over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Sheu made the remarks in response to a letter from mainland
China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).
The letter, which reached Taipei on Friday, said Beijing opposes
Taipei's intention to "espouse" that Taiwan and mainland China are
two political entities under separate rules, and that they are
"temporarily two Chinas."</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman said the ROC has continuously been a
sovereign country since its inception 87 years ago, and since 1949
two distinct political entities have existed on the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>ARATS, in its strongly worded letter to its Taipei counterpart,
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said SEF officials have never
been allowed to travel to the mainland to negotiate issues over the
welfare and interests of the Taiwan people in the past years, and
they will never be allowed to do so in the future.</P>
      <P>ARATS also blamed SEF for intentionally boycotting Beijing's
initiatives in pushing for discussions on Taiwan investment
guarantees and the interests of Taiwan travelers on the mainland by
insisting that the "jurisdiction" issue should be clarified first.</P>
      <P>Sheu stressed that the ARATS letter, apparently not friendly,
will not influence SEF's work to prepare for SEF Chairman Koo
Chen-fu's forthcoming visit to the mainland, probably in September or
October.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director-general of the Kuomintang's Mainland
Research Department, said the ARATS letter is aimed at manipulating
development prior to Koo's mainland visit so that ARATS and SEF will
begin with political talks instead of discussing technical issues.</P>
      <P>SEF prefers to first take care of technical issues before
handling political matters in its negotiations with ARATS.</P>
      <P>ARATS and SEF are intermediary bodies which are authorized by
their respective governments to handle exchanges in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Koo has been invited to visit mainland China in
September or October this year to meet his ARATS counterpart, Wang
Daohan, for a meeting. Koo and Wang met in Singapore in April 1993
for an ice-breaking rendezvous, which loosely established a framework
for regular talks between the two sides in the future.</P>
      <P>Koo was scheduled to meet Wang again for a second "Koo-Wang"
talks in 1995. The meeting was never realized as Beijing unilaterally
suspended talks after President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to
the United States in the summer of 1995, which Beijing viewed as a
move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN URGED TO TREAT TAIPEI, BEIJING ON EQUAL FOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Friday urged
Japan to extend equal treatment to the two political entities on
either side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that the Japanese government will face up to
the reality that China is now separately ruled by two political
entities and that Japan can treat the two entities on an equal
footing," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He made the appeal in a recent interview with the Japanese
monthly magazine "Bungei Shunshu."</P>
      <P>The president said the Republic of China has no intention of
interfering with engagement between Japan and mainland China.
Nevertheless, he went on, the premise is that such engagement should
not disrupt peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, nor should it
undermine the ROC's national interests or the security and well-being
of Taiwan's 21.8 million people.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Japan should simultaneously upgrade its relations with
the ROC while engaging with mainland China, he said.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say he thinks Japan has invited mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to make a state visit early next month
mainly to foster peace in Asia in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said he doesn't think mainland China accepted the
invitation in the same spirit. "Beijing is very likely to take
advantage of the event to pressure Japan to throw support behind its
`three noes' policy on Taiwan, and to exclude Taiwan from the
coverage of the US-Japan defense cooperation treaty.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that Japan can fully understand mainland China's
true intention," Lee said, adding that if Japan truly intends to
safeguard Asia-Pacific regional peace, it should forge closer
cooperative relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Noting that Japan has clearly explained its policy toward Taiwan
in the past, Lee said he sees no need for Japan to reaffirm its
stance on the Beijing-proposed "three noes" during Jiang's visit.</P>
      <P>"My personal view is that economics remains the main problem
between Japan and mainland China. I hope the Japanese leadership will
not do any nonsensical things during Jiang's visit," he said.</P>
      <P>He made special mention of the fact that US President Bill
Clinton's words in Shanghai in June were similar to those uttered in
talks between Jiang and former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto last September.</P>
      <P>Clinton said at a roundtable meeting in Shanghai on June 30 that
there will be no US support for Taiwan independence, no US support
for "two Chinas," or "one China, one Taiwan," and no US support for
Taiwan's membership in international organizations in which statehood
is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Lee said he thinks Clinton chose his words carefully.</P>
      <P>"There is a big gap between `no support' and `opposition.' I
think `no support' is a neutral phrase that complies with
Washington's `no involvement' or `no interference' stance on
cross-strait issues," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Turning to cross-strait relations, Lee said the key objective of
the ROC's mainland policy lies with maintaining peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait and forging mutual trust and positive
interaction.</P>
      <P>Based on these priority goals, Lee said, the ROC has never given
up its expectations of a resumption of cross-strait dialogue since
Beijing unilaterally suspended institutionalized bilateral
consultations more than three years ago.</P>
      <P>"Through our strenuous efforts, the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait -- Taipei's
Straits Exchange Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait -- have finally reached a consensus that SEF
Chairman C.F. Koo will make a landmark visit to the mainland this
fall," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The president further expressed his hope that institutionalized
cross-strait talks will be resumed soon so that the two sides can
exchange views and mend their differences, paving the way for better
cross-strait ties and contributing to regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>As for Taipei-Tokyo relations, Lee said he looks forward to
seeing Japan's academic, political and business communities gain a
deeper and more accurate understanding of Taiwan's developments in
political, economic, social, and various other fields, in order to
further boost bilateral friendship and cooperation for mutual
benefit.</P>
      <P>Given the rate at which younger people are joining the two
countries' political and business elite, Lee said, this younger
generation on both sides should reinforce contacts and engagements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FPG HEAD BLASTS `GO SLOW, BE PATIENT' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Taiwan-based Formosa
Plastics Group (FPG) on Thursday criticized the ROC government's "go
slow, be patient" policy toward investment in mainland China, saying
it has hindered Taiwan entrepreneurs doing business there.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman Y.C. Wang also said that because of steadfast
opposition from the government, the group has withdrawn from a
controversial power plant project in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province. The
FPG's stake has now been taken over by foreign investors from Japan,
Germany and Hong Kong, he added.</P>
      <P>But for the sake of his personal credibility, he himself has
maintained a "very small" personal stake in the project, he said.</P>
      <P>The FPG originally estimated that the US$3 billion power plant
would require US$2.3 billion-worth of syndicated loans. Three FPG
enterprises under the FPG -- Formosa Plastics, Nan Ya Plastics and
Taiwan Chemical &amp; Fiber -- would have contributed US$420 million, or
60 percent of the remaining US$700 million.</P>
      <P>Turning to a long-moribund project to build a naphtha cracking
plant in Haicheng, also in Fujian Province, Wang said this plan may
be resurrected.</P>
      <P>As far back as ten years ago, the FPG planned to build the plant
at a cost of more than US$6 billion, but the idea was shelved when
mainland authorities failed to meet Wang's financing and other terms.</P>
      <P>However, he also said that there are many other places in the
mainland that are worth investing in.</P>
      <P>Wang was reluctant to directly answer questions on when the FPG's
investment in the mainland would start again, only saying obliquely
that there are about 20 months left in the tenure of ROC President
Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>He also said that while Lee has made great contributions to the
democratic development in Taiwan, he had reservations about his
performance in other aspects.</P>
      <P>Wang, dubbed "the god of management" in Taiwan, also said there
are an estimated 30,000 or more Taiwan businessmen in the mainland,
and that a way must be found for them to band together in order to
protect their interests and maintain their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He suggested the idea of establishing special "zones" in the
mainland as a way in which Taiwan businessmen could better protect
their interests.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's processing industry has been unable to
maintain its momentum at home since about a decade ago, and has had
to move overseas.</P>
      <P>He said that it is better to invest in the mainland than in the
Southeast Asia, because the countries of Southeast Asia have adopted
liberal economic systems. Taiwan businessmen who invest in the region
will bring Taiwan's processing technology with them, which will allow
local manufacturers to learn and profit from Taiwan's expertise. This
will ultimately result in extra competition for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The mainland, by contrast, has adopted an econometric system, and
finds it is not easy to compete with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang, who arrived in New Jersey on Monday, was hosting a visiting
Fujian delegation led by Chen Mingyi, secretary of the Fujian
provincial committee of the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>Chen said in New York on Wednesday that the thermal power plant
has been going on according to schedule, but he did not say who the
investors are.</P>
      <P>Wang was slated to leave for Texas on Friday to brief Chen about
an FPG petrochemical plant there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOCUMENTS REVEAL CHIANG KAI-SHEK'S PLAN TO RECOVER M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Chang Fang-ming and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A series of documents recently declassified
by the US government have revealed that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek
had planned to recover five southern provinces of mainland China
during the height of the Vietnam War.</P>
      <P>Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun quoted a report from Washington, D.C. on
Friday as saying that the declassified documents disclosed that
Chiang proposed in 1965 that ROC troops should join US forces
fighting in Vietnam to stage an assault from Indochina on the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>The proposal, broached to then US Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara by the generalissimo's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who was the
ROC defense minister at that time, said the ROC troops could mount an
assault on the southern Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi,
Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan, with the objective of recovering the
five provinces once and for all.</P>
      <P>According to the documents, which focus on military and
intelligence information about Taiwan and mainland China between 1964
and 1968, Chiang Ching-kuo emphasized to McNamara that anti-communist
sentiment in the five provinces was the strongest among all the
provinces of the mainland, and that the generalissimo enjoyed a high
reputation among the people there.</P>
      <P>McNamara agreed to have the proposal studied, but the US Joint
Chiefs of Staff poured cold water on the plan, on the grounds that
such an assault would not work without direct American involvement in
the form of air and naval support, according to the documents.</P>
      <P>In addition, there was no concrete intelligence to indicate that
the people in the five provinces would support the ROC.</P>
      <P>In March 1967, then US President Lyndon Johnson also voiced
opposition to the Chiang proposal, saying that the "recovery of the
mainland" mission would trap Taiwan in a great dilemma, and trigger
the risk of greater destruction across the Taiwan Strait, the
documents said.</P>
      <P>The documents also disclosed that the US was aware of Beijing's
plan to conduct its maiden nuclear test on Oct. 16, 1964, and that
Washington proposed to Moscow that the two sides make a joint effort
to undermine the test. The proposal was apparently rebuffed by
Moscow.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR CONCERNED ABOUT US DEBT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will likely get into
trouble sooner or later due to its heavy foreign debt, Perng Fai-nan,
governor of the Central Bank of China, said in a speech Friday.</P>
      <P>The US is the world's top debtor with US$1.5 trillion in foreign
debt, Perng said.</P>
      <P>He remarked that the US dollar has continued to remain strong
since 1995, as the Japanese yen began its slide. This can be
attributed to the fact that the two countries were undergoing
different economic cycles, Perng analyzed. The US economy has been
booming with high interest rates, while Japan's economy hit bottom
with interest rates kept at a too-low level.</P>
      <P>Owing to the huge difference in interest rates, Perng went on,
Japanese capital rushed out on a large scale to buy US government
bonds and thereby contributed to the US dollar's stability.</P>
      <P>However, the bank governor added, the heavy demand against a
somewhat short supply of the greenback is a "very unhealthy
condition."</P>
      <P>Being the world's political, economic and military superpower,
the US can still attract credit from many nations and keep its
economy in a relatively prosperous state despite the fact that the US
is the top debtor in the world, Perng commented.</P>
      <P>After the European Union's euro makes its debut next year, he
added, it will supersede the deutsche mark as the hard currency and
will follow the suit of the US dollar as an option for investors
world-wide.</P>
      <P>What is worth noting, the governor said, is that as a result of
the integration of the European economy through the euro and the
integration of the North American economy through maneuvering of the
US, Asian countries will be pressured to further develop their
economies.</P>
      <P>All Asian countries should cooperate in advance to deal with the
emerging situation, otherwise the prospects will not likely be rosy,
Perng added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOURISTS TO BE BANNED FROM IMPORTING FRESH FRUIT FROM OCT. 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>From Oct. 1, tourists returning from
overseas will not be allowed to bring fresh fruit into the country,
the Council of Agriculture (COA) announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-lung, director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Quarantine under the COA, said that a number of insect pests and
plant diseases have been imported into Taiwan via unquarantined fresh
fruit brought in by local tourists, posing a serious threat to the
island's agriculture and ecology.</P>
      <P>Current laws allow travelers to bring up to two kilograms of
fresh fruit into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee called on the public to abide by the new regulation, adding
that some 20 bureau officials will be stationed at the Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport in northern Taiwan to help inspect
luggage for violations.</P>
      <P>Any fresh fruit found will be regarded as contraband and
confiscated, Lee said, adding that serious violations will invite
prosecution.</P>
      <P>Yang Pin-chih, agricultural professor at National Taiwan
University, said that the Mediterranean fruit fly and the Mexican
fruit fly are two of the biggest threats to Taiwan's fruit farmers.
If the Mediterranean fruit fly should invade the island, it would be
a major disaster, he warned.</P>
      <P>The apple snail, introduced from abroad to be farmed as a food
source, is a prime example of how introduced species can wreak havoc
on the island's ecosystem, Yang said. The voracious gastropods, which
attack rice plants, have few natural predators and breed rapidly.
Escapees have been very successful in virtually overrunning the
island's paddies.</P>
      <P>Each year the government spends some NT$160 million to keep down
the number of snails, and so far a total of NT$3 billion has been
poured into the work, to little avail.</P>
      <P>Yang also singled out the Brazilian turtle, the silver leaf white
fly, and the Asian palm weevil as damaging to Taiwan's agriculture
and ecology.</P>

      <P>Three more US-built F-16 jet fighters
arrived at an ROC Air Force base in the southern county of Chiayi on
Thursday, military sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters said in a news release that
the US manufacturer of the advanced fighters was originally
scheduled to deliver five F-16s to Taiwan, but one of the planes
developed engine problems on its flight from the United States to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The leader of the flight team ordered the plane to make an
emergency landing on the Japanese island of Okinawa, escorted by
another F-16, the Air Force Headquarters said.</P>
      <P>As the delivery was handled by the manufacturer of the plane,
Lockheed Martin Co., the Air Force Headquarters said it has asked the
company to offer a briefing on the cause of the incident.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China struck a deal with the United States in
1992 for the purchase of 150 F-16s as part of its military
modernization plan. Some 50 F-16s have so far been delivered to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC has also ordered 60 Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters
from France to replace its aging fleet and upgrade air defense
capabilities. The ROC Air Force has taken delivery of some 30 of the
Mirage fighters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNA INTERVIEW WITH GEN. HAU ON 8-23 BOMBARDMENT OF KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The communist Chinese bombardment of Kinmen
during the 44-day Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958 is one of the most
special cases of war in history, Gen. Hau Pei-tsun, former chief of
the general staff, said Friday.</P>
      <P>During the crisis, the troops of mainland China pounded the
islands of Kinmen with 474,000 artillery shells, but they failed to
seize the islands.</P>
      <P>Hau, who was the commander of the ninth division of the garrison
troops on Kinmen at that time, said in an interview with the CNA
that he believed Mao Tze-tung was then afraid of provoking the United
States into war with mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said he believed Mao's real intention to wage the war was to
test US determination to help defend Taiwan, because Mao hoped to
seize Taiwan by force sometime later.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's success in defeating mainland China in the crisis marked
the beginning of steady economic development and democratization on
Taiwan, Hau said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out three reasons for the bombardment of Kinmen,
which occurred at the height of the Cold War between the Soviet Union
and the United States.</P>
      <P>He said tension between the two superpowers in the Middle East
was very high at that time. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who
visited Beijing about one month before the bombardment, wanted to
divert US attention to the Far East by asking Mao to shell Kinmen,
Hau said.</P>
      <P>Mao, who had incurred the wrath of mainland Chinese people by 
initiating various disastrous social movements, such as the Great
Cultural Revolution and the Great Leap Forward, wanted to divert the
attention of the people to a conflict with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The third reason for the bombardment is Mao's intention to test
US determination to support Taiwan as mentioned earlier.</P>
      <P>Hau said US assistance and the use of US-made weapons, such as the
Rattlesnake air-to-air missiles, were important in winning the war.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC OPPOSES ANY FORM OF TERRORISM: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Friday that the Republic of China opposes any form of terrorism and
revealed that Washington briefed Taipei about its attacks on
suspected terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said it was usual practice for the United
States to report its anti-terrorist strikes to other countries
because such activity requires international effort.</P>
      <P>The ROC supports the US attack, Wu said, adding that the
international community should join forces to crack down on the
spread of terrorism around the world.</P>
      <P>Wu's comments come after US forces on Thursday attacked a
suspected terrorist base in Afghanistan and a chemical weapons
facility in Sudan which were allegedly involved in the deadly
explosions at the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.</P>
      <P>As to the security measures at the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT), the de-facto US embassy here, Wu said the AIT has maintained
close contact with Taipei authorities since the African embassies
were attacked. He added that local police have stepped up patrol and
security efforts in the neighborhoods of foreign embassies.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-huang, director of MOFA's West Asian Affairs Department,
said Afghanistan has been very unfriendly to Taipei since 1950 when
the Islamic country shifted diplomatic recognition to Beijing.
Currently, there are no ROC nationals in Afghanistan and two-way
trade between the two countries is limited, Chen noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On behalf of President Lee Teng-hui,
Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling on Friday paid his respects to the
officers, soldiers and civilians who were killed during the Aug. 23
artillery bombardment of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>On the approach of the 40th anniversary of the military campaign,
a public rites and memorial service, presided over by Chiang, were
held in Kinmen to commemorate those who died in the battle.</P>
      <P>The rites and service were held at the Martyrs Shrine on Taiwu
Mountain Public Cemetery, and the Kinmen County Social Education Hall
respectively.</P>
      <P>More than 900 people, including Vice Chief of the General Staff
Lee Chieh, Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Tang Yao-ming, Fukian
Provincial Governor Yen Chung-cheng, representatives of the officers
and soldiers who took part in the battle, and representatives from
all walks of life in Kinmen, participated in the ceremonies.</P>
      <P>The battle broke out on Aug. 23, 1958 when the mainland Chinese
forces launched a cluster of artillery bombardments on Kinmen and its
adjacent islets at 6:30 p.m. Over 470,000 shells were fired by the
mainland gunners within 44 days on a 150-square kilometer area.</P>
      <P>A total of 587 officers and men died in the battle and another
2,016 were injured. In addition, a total of 80 civilians were killed,
and 85 were seriously injured.</P>
      <P>The mainland's ambition to invade Taiwan was thwarted by the
steadfast armed forces of the Republic of China, and stability in the
Taiwan Strait was assured, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the artillery battle had a decisive impact on
Taiwan's future as people were given a choice between freedom or
slavery. He told the representatives of those who took part in the
military campaign that they earned the prosperity of the island
through the blood and sweat of their deceased loved-ones.</P>
      <P>The defense minister expressed the hope that the sound of
artillery shells on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will never be
heard again. Problems between the two sides can be solved with
patience and wisdom, Chiang added.</P>
      <P>"In this way, the commemoration of the Aug. 23 Taiwan Strait
Military Campaign can have a special significant and value, and the
battle can shine brighter in the first leaf under the cover of the
history", he said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of Taiwan telecommunications
officials, media executives and journalists left for the French
colony of Guiana in South America on Friday to watch the launching of
the Republic of China's first commercial satellite.</P>
      <P>"The satellite, dubbed ST-1, will be launched on Aug. 25 from the
Kourou Space Center in French Guiana aboard Arianespace No. 4 rockey
owned by Arianespace Co., a famous satellite launch company," said a
spokesman for the state-run Chunghwa Telecom Co.</P>
      <P>The 44-member delegation, composed of officials from the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and senior executives
from major local television companies and radio stations, is headed
by Chunhwa Telecom Chairman Chen Yao.</P>
      <P>The mission members also included officials from the Ministry of
National Defense and the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau,
both of them Chunhwa Telecom's big customers.</P>
      <P>The ST-1 satellite system, jointly owned by Chunghwa Telecom and
Singapore Telecom Ltd., will orbit 36,000 kilometers above the
earth, roughly above the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"Built by Matra Marconi Space Co. of France, the new satellite
will be launched into a geostationary orbit synchronized with 88
degree E," the Chunghwa spokesman explained, adding that the good
orbital location will help ensure that the satellite will enjoy high
elevation angles throughout Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Equipped with a number of advanced transponders, the new
satellite system is expected to be especially helpful to businesses
involved in remote communications, video and audio broadcasting, and
information transmission, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The new satellite cost a total of US$240 million, with Taiwan
and Singapore splitting the cost. The satellite system includes a
ground control station each in Taiwan and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's central control station is located on Yangmingshan in
suburban Taipei. Chunghwa Telecom has also constructed other ground
monitoring stations in Panchiao, Taichung, Kaohsiung and Fanshan to
ensure smooth operations.</P>
      <P>If the planned Aug. 25 launch proceeds smoothly, the new
satellite system will be able to operate at least 12 years in space.
Its actual life span can reach 13 years.</P>
      <P>The ST-1 satellite will have 12 C-band transponders and 16
Ku-band transponders. Its C-band coverage stretches from the Middle
East to Japan and Southeast Asia, including Taiwan, Singapore,
mainland China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Indochina and the Indian
Subcontinent.</P>
      <P>The Ku-band coverage is divided into two regions-- K1 and K2.
The K1 area focuses on Taiwan, Singapore, coastal mainland China,
the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia, while K2 provides coverage
of the Indian Subcontinent.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom and Singapore Telecom struck the joint-venture
deal in September 1995 based on the principles of equality and
reciprocity with an aim to meet the growing market demand and

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighteen activists detained by police in
Kinmen earlier Friday for violating a government ban by traveling 
directly to the mainland were released after a preliminary
interrogation by a prosecutor, police said.</P>
      <P>The activists were accused of violating the National Security
Law and the Statute Governing the Relations between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>The group was co-headed by Tsao Yuan-chang, a National Assembly
member, and Taipei County Councilor Kin Chieh-shou, both of whom
claimed to have played the role of pioneers of direct shipping,
trade and communications between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The group was aboard the "Hawaii No. 3" vessel. It left northern
Taiwan's Shenao port on Tuesday, bound for fishing grounds in the
seas north of the island. Shortly after setting off, the ship changed
its registered course, and headed directly for Xiamen in mainland
China's Fujian Province, according to police.</P>
      <P>The boat reached Xiamen on Wednesday. After a one-day visit, the
group left for the Taiwan-controlled island stronghold of Kinmen, in
a second attempt to travel directly across the Taiwan Strait without
going via a third country.</P>
      <P>However, they encountered ROC police patrol vessels near Kinmen.
Maritime police demanded to board the vessel, but were rejected,
whereupon the two sides became locked in a stalemate.</P>
      <P>The confrontation at sea lasted for around 20 minutes, until the
ship docked at Hsinhu. However, the activists continued to resist
police demands to board, and the standoff continued.</P>
      <P>Shouting for "three direct links" with mainland China, they were
echoed by more than 10 supporters on shore, led by National Assembly
member Lee Chu-fang of the opposition New Party.</P>
      <P>Kin said the "taboo-breaking" voyage was aimed at promoting the
"mini three links," which would allow direct commercial, shipping and
postal exchanges between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>He stressed that similar sailings between the two front-line
islands and mainland China have been going on unofficially for years.
Although illegal, it is no secret that Taiwan fishing vessels often
make direct sailings to mainland territory in order to save costs,
Kim said.</P>
      <P>He added that their action was taken only to highlight a fact
long ignored by the government.</P>
      <P>During the group's stay in Xiamen, Kim noted that they met with
ranking city officials. Kim and Tsao both belong to the New Party,
which strongly favors Taiwan's reunification with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The New Party is the smallest of the three main political parties
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Kuang-fu, a member of the radical Taiwan
Independence Party, on Friday filed charges against Kim and Tsao for
their "betrayal of Taiwan and collaboration with the enemy."</P>
      <P>He also urged New Party heavyweights Jaw Shau-kong and Wang
Chien-shien to issue a public statement condemning their members'
behavior.</P>

said Friday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Victor Ejercito, son of Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, visited the Cabinet-level COA Friday to exchange views on
bilateral cooperation in the fields of agriculture and fishery,
investment, as well as the flow of technology.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the COA agreed to provide the Philippines
with agricultural technological training and select some Philippine
agricultural enterprises to proceed with an experimental cooperation
program.</P>
      <P>Ejercito arrived in Taiwan Thursday to attend the 45th
anniversary of the Junior Chamber of the Republic of China in his
capacity as the president of the Junior Chamber of the Philippines.
He called on Peng Tso-kuei, chairman of the COA, Friday morning.</P>
      <P>The Philippines has been severely hit by the Asian financial
turmoil and needs foreign capital and technology to help it recover
industries and increase food production, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has experience in developing of agriculture and advanced
technology, and also has plenty of private capital. The island can be
a big help to the Philippines, Peng added.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC will push for more mutual visits by ranking
officials on both sides through agriculture and fishery relations.</P>
      <P>Peng also hopes that through the official dialogue channel, the
Philippines will improve its investment climate to encourage Taiwan's
agricultural enterprises to invest there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF NICARAGUAN LABORERS TO ENTER TAIWAN UNDECIDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Nicaraguan nationals to be
permitted to work in Taiwan will be decided by market demand, Council
of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Chan Hou-sheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Although Nicaraguan Labor Affairs Minister Wilfredo Navarro
announced in Taipei Thursday that the two countries had signed a
letter of intent with Taiwan agreeing to import 5,000 Nicaraguan
laborers, Chan said the two countries only discussed the content of
the pact and have yet to reach a final agreement on the actual
numbers.</P>
      <P>The market demand will determine the number, Chan said, adding
that the two sides are scheduled to ink a formal agreement in
October, which must be first approved by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsong-ming, director-general of the CLA's Employment and
Vocational Training Administration, said they will also have to take
into consideration the willingness of local employers to hire
Nicaraguans in determining the quota number.</P>
      <P>The government has put a freeze on the quota of foreign workers
permitted to the island. Currently, only those major public
construction projects worth over NT$200 million (US$5.7 million) can
bring in foreign workers on a case-by-case basis, Lin said. The quota
for each such project is about 500 foreign workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEWSMEN WITNESSED 1958 BOMBARDMENT OF KINMEN (PART I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 300 journalists risked their lives to
report to the world about Beijing's ambition to invade Taiwan during
the historical bombardment of the Kinmen islands by the mainland
forces beginning on Aug. 23, 1958.</P>
      <P>During the 44-day marathon shelling of Kinmen, a key island in
the Taiwan Strait protecting Taiwan and the Penghu islands, a total
of 587 officers and soldiers were killed. Other casualties included
the drowning of six Chinese and foreign reporters.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 26 that year, eight Chinese and foreign reporters
attempted to land in the midst of a battle via a Marine Corps landing
craft. Under heavy shelling, the vessel developed engine trouble as
it approached Kinmen's Liaolo Bay.</P>
      <P>The landing craft sank, and six of the eight reporters drowned or
went missing along with three crewmen. The six reporters who lost
their lives included Hsu Po-chiu of the Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News,
Wu Hsu of the China Daily News, Mr. Yasuda of Japan's Yomiuri
Shimbun, and Mr. Choe of the Korean Times. The two surviving
reporters were Yen Chung-tzo of the Young Warriors Daily News and Mr.
Okuto of Japan's Kyodo News Service.</P>
      <P>Despite the deaths, over 300 Chinese and foreign newsmen, with
their pens and cameras, had managed to report from the frontline the
aggressive actions the mainland Chinese forces were engaging in.</P>
      <P>Earlier then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev visited Beijing on
July 31 for talks with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. Both sides issued a
joint statement after their talks, and political observers sensed
that the stalemate situation in the Taiwan Strait was going to
undergo a change.</P>
      <P>Early in August that year, the Republic of China's Defense
Ministry disclosed that the Chinese Communists had deployed squadrons
of MiG jet fighters to the coastal airports in Fukien and Guangdong
Provinces. Flotillas of speed torpedo boats and boats equipped with
cannons had also been dispatched to Fukien's Santuao Base. Beijing
did not hide its intention of invading Kinmen and Taiwan's other
outlying islands.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 14, ROC Air Force's F86 "Saber" fighters shot down three
MiG-17 jets, while the navy sank four mainland Chinese cannon
vessels. It was then that the international news media began to turn
their attention to the Taiwan Strait, expecting the arrival of some
"big news."</P>
      <P>As expected, the Chinese Communists mobilized hundreds of
artillery to shell Kinmen from 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 23. That marked the
start of the 44-day bombardment of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Lo Chao-chun, who served as a photographer for the army at that
time, recalled that the first group of the scores of Chinese and
foreign reporters went to Penghu by warship on Aug. 28 that year,
waiting for chance to proceed to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>But owing to the massive shelling, these reporters could not
leave for Kinmen until Sept. 2 when they embarked for the island by a
landing craft.</P>
      <P>Good luck was not with them. When the landing craft reached
Kinmen's Liaolo Bay, it encountered sea battles between the two
warring navies.</P>
      <P>Only few reporters were able to land on the battlefield by
transferring onto small boats across rope ladders. Chang Chia-hsiang,
now chairman of the Chinese Television System, was one of them. He
was a reporter for the Young Warriors Daily News at that time.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For safety and security reasons, the ROC Defense Ministry and the
US military authorities in Taiwan stopped accepting applications for
newsmen to cover the news on Kinmen on Sept. 15. But the restrictions
were lifted on Sept. 24.</P>
      <P>C.C. Yau, a senior adviser to Reuters in Taipei, was among the
first group of reporters to land on Kinmen after the bombardment. He
said his group left Taipei's Sungshan Airport by a C46 transport at 4
a.m. on Sept. 24.</P>
      <P>The propeller-powered plane made a stop at Penghu and reached
Kinmen at 5 a.m. Shortly after the reporters disembarked from the
plane, the mainland Chinese forces resumed their massive shelling,
forcing them to run to the slope for cover.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, Yau said officers had told them that the air
force's F86 Sabers downed 10 MiG fighters over the Taiwan Strait. It
marked the world's first use of the air-to-air "Rattlesnake" missiles
in air battles.</P>
      <P>Hona Yee, now Taipei bureau chief for the Pan-Asia Newspaper
Alliance (PANA), was one of the few woman reporters to cover the
Kinmen bombardment. She worked for a photo news publication at that
time.</P>
      <P>She recalled that she was not able to join the first group of
reporters to Kinmen because the navy did not permit women aboard
warships. Her wish to cover the historical mission was realized after
authorities decided to take newsmen to the frontline in military
aircraft.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 26, the second group of Chinese and foreign reporters
went to Kinmen by a naval ship. Eight reporters were transferred to
an LVT landing craft when the ship sailed into Kinmen's Liaolo Bay.
Unfortunately, the vessel sank and six of the eight reporters lost
their lives.</P>
      <P>Yen Chung-tzo was one of the two survivors. In an interview with
the CNA he was reluctant to recall the incident. He said, "A
newsman's life is the same as that of a soldier. The difference is
the duties they have to bear."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Uri S. Gutman, the newly appointed Israeli
representative in Taiwan, arrived recently in Taipei to assume his
post, a source from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Gutman, who succeeds Acting Representative Akiva Tor, is the
first professional diplomat appointed by Tel Aviv to be its
representative in Taiwan, said Chen Kuo-huang, director of the
Foreign Ministry's Department of West Asian Affairs.</P>
      <P>Tel Aviv appointed its first representative to Taipei in 1993.
Gutman's two predecessors were both trade officials from Israel's
Ministry of Industry and Trade, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Gutman has said that in addition to continuing to bolster
bilateral business and trade links between Israel and Taiwan, he will
also further strengthen substantive exchanges in the fields of
environmental protection, science and technology, education and
culture, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The 39-year-old career diplomat has been with the Israeli Foreign
Ministry since 1989. He was appointed deputy consul in Israel's
consulate-general in Istanbul, Turkey in 1991, and has also served as
a liaison officer in the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, Sweden.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Tel Aviv forged a memorandum of understanding in June
on exemption of marine transportation income tax between Taiwan and
Israel. An executive protocol on temporary admission of goods is also
under discussion, paving the way for the two governments to sign an
agreement on the preferential treatment in the near future, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Israel totaled US$540 million in
1997, up a whopping 20 percent from 1996's US$430 million, according

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF REAFFIRMS NO CHANGE IN 'NO HASTE' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh reiterated on Saturday that there will be no change
in the government's "no haste, be patient" policy toward investment
in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The top mainland policy planner made the statement in response to
Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) Chairman Wang Yung-ching's fresh
criticism of the government's mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>Chang said Wang has every right to express his personal views or
opinions, adding: "I would not make any comments on the veteran
tycoon's opinions."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said, the government has its own policy which
cannot be adjusted simply because of criticism by a few people.</P>
      <P>"The `no haste, be patient' policy is based on our national
situation and relations across the Taiwan Strait," Chang noted,
stressing that there is a practical need for Taiwan to maintain the
policy since Beijing has never renounced the use of force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang said, a number of public opinion polls conducted
by both government and private institutions have consistently shown
that the majority of local people support the policy.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, Taiwan companies are banned from investing in
major infrastructure construction projects in mainland China, and are
also required to apply for prior government approval in cases where
the capital needed for a single investment project exceeds US$50
million.</P>
      <P>Without a green light from the ROC government, the FPG was forced
to withdraw earlier this year from a controversial thermal power
plant investment project in Zhangzhou in the southeastern mainland
province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman Wang said in New York on Wednesday that the group's
stake in the Zhangzhou power plant project has been taken over by
investors from Japan, Germany and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's largest private manufacturing group, Wang said, the
FPG is unlikely to defy the government's mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, the tycoon, known as "the god of management" in
Taiwan, doubted the government's wisdom in adopting such a policy.
"It's regrettable that the FPG has had to withdraw from the Zhangzhou
project, which I think would have been a good bet."</P>
      <P>Wang further said a long-moribund FPG plan to build a massive
petrochemical complex in Haicang, Fujian Province, may be revived
after President Lee Teng-hui's current tenure expires in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Wang declined to elaborate on the substance or the timeframe of
the Haicang project, only saying obliquely that there are only 20
months left in Lee's tenure as president.</P>

      <P>Drinking even moderate amounts of alcohol
may impair a women's ability to conceive, according to a new Danish
medical study.</P>
      <P>The results of the study, published on Saturday in the British
Medical Journal, have surprised doctors as it had previously been
thought that only heavy drinking had such an effect on women,

Australian general practitioners to place greater emphasis on
"pre-conception counseling" to encourage better health in women
before they become pregnant.</P>
      <P>The study followed 430 couples, aged 20 to 35, who were trying to
conceive for the first time. For six menstrual cycles, they were
surveyed about diet and lifestyle.</P>
      <P>The researchers found that women who consumed up to five
alcoholic drinks a week were less likely to have conceived than those
who did not drink at all.</P>
      <P>The more alcohol they drank, the less likely they were to have

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY SERVICE SYSTEM TO BE INTRODUCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A system is to be introduced to allow
conscripts with high technology educational backgrounds to perform
research and development service rather than military duty, the
Executive Yuan reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Defense Technology Service System (DTSS) will allow young men
from graduate schools or higher-level educational institutes to
continue their research careers without being interrupted by the
two-year period of compulsory military service, said Vice Premier Liu
Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>It will also help solve the personnel shortage problems
afflicting national and military research institutes, including the
Industrial Technology Research Institute, the military Chung-shan
Scientific Research Institute, and the Academia Sinica, Taiwan's
highest-level research institute, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The DTSS is another plan devised as an alternative to regular
military duty, and is part of an attempt to further reform the
nation's military services. The government introduced a selective
service system in April this year which allows conscripts to perform
community service rather than joining active-duty military units.</P>
      <P>The Excecutive Yuan on Friday convened a supra-ministerial
meeting on science and technology development, presided over by
Premier Vincent Siew. Participants included the ministers of national
defense, education, interior, and economic affairs, as well as the
head of the National Science Council and members of the Science and
Technology Advisory Group.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
formally broached the DTSS program for discussion among the relevant
government agencies.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Yuan T. Lee also voiced his support for
the proposal.</P>
      <P>Lee said the modern function of a national defense force is to
prevent war rather than to precipitate war, so there should be a
variety of ways in which young men can serve the country. The DTSS
would be a good option, he added.</P>
      <P>The DTSS is expected to be put into practice in the near future
as its implementation does not require new legislation. An amendment
to relevant administrative orders will enough to legitimize the
program, Executive Yuan officials said.</P>
      <P>Siew instructed Tsai Chao-yang, a minister without portfolio, to
lead a task force on the DTSS, which will be jointly implemented by
the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of National Defense.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM SIEW ATTACHES GREAT IMPORTANCE TO 'KOO-WANG' MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's reunification is an issue of two
competing systems and a lifestyle choice, Premier Vincent Siew said
on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taipei will continue to seek communication rather than
confrontation, and negotiation rather than hostility with mainland
China to improve cross-strait relations and create a climate which is
ultimately conducive to reunification, he added.</P>
      <P>Siew made the comments in his address to the second general
meeting of the 15th Kuomintang Central Committee in his capacity as a
KMT member who serves in a government post.</P>
      <P>He said he attaches great importance to the proposed "Koo-Wang"
meeting which is expected to be held in autumn, and he hopes that
negotiators from the two sides will sincerely exchange views to work
out agreements from differences.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu and Wang Daohan -- heads of the two intermediary
bodies, Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- met for
a landmark meeting in Singapore in April 1993 which laid a framework
for regular talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Their
meeting has since been called the "Koo-Wang" talks.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that Taiwan fully supports reunification with the
mainland under the principles of democracy, freedom and equality of
wealth.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan firmly opposes the "one country, two system"
formula which is controversial, anti-democratic and inequitable, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Taipei also steadfastly insists the fact that the Republic of
China is a sovereign country independent from the People's Republic
of China, and firmly opposes any bilateral or multilateral dialogue
or negotiations in the international community that may damage
Taiwan's interests, Siew emphasized.</P>
      <P>On the issue of local politics, the premier said he finds it
rewarding that his Cabinet has managed to successfully meet major
social and political challenges as well as severe tests in public
opinion over the past year. Siew assumed the premiership on Sept. 1,
1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOREAN COMFORT WOMAN VISITS REMAINS OF FORMER JAPANESE ARMY BROTHEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former South Korean comfort woman
confirmed on Saturday that the east wing of the Hsinchu Air Base in
northern Taiwan was the remains of a military brothel run by the
imperial Japanese army during World War II.</P>
      <P>Lee Yong-soo, 71, made the confirmation after an emotional
insepction tour of the site where she once worked as a sex slave for
Japanese military servicemen for about three years.</P>
      <P>The site now accommodates a three-story dormitory for ROC Air
Force officers and enlisted men stationed at the air base.</P>
      <P>A tearful Lee recalled that she was abducted from her South
Korean hometown by Japanese troops at a night in 1944 to work as a
sex slave.</P>
      <P>Lee was just 16 years old when she was sent to a brothel
owned by a Japanese air force suicide squad stationed at a place
completely strange to her.</P>
      <P>Lee said she didn't know where she was until a Japanese
suicide squad officer, surnamed Hasegawa, told her that the place
was named Hsinchu, a city in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee described her life in the Japanese military brothel as a
nightmare. She was confined to live in the brothel, a two-story
wooden house. As she was only allowed to move around in an area
within 100 meters in front of the brothel, Lee said she could only
remembered that there were lush fields and a small river near the
brothel.</P>
      <P>Lee broke into tears when she stood by the bank of the small
river that has often appeared in her dreams over the past 50 years.</P>
      <P>Lee, who managed to return to her home in Taegu in
southeastern Korea after Japan surrendered to the Allied Forces, said
she was grateful for being able to re-visit the site.</P>
      <P>"Although the I had bitter memories about the site, I hope the
discovery of the remains of the former Japanese air force brothel
will help pressure the Japanese government to confess to its past
sins of forcing a large number of foreign women to become sex slaves
during wartime," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say she will show the newly found evidence to the
Japanese government and join forces with other surviving former
comfort women to push Japan to make a public apology and compensate
all surviving comfort women, most of whom are now in their 70s and
live in solitude.</P>
      <P>Besides Lee, 14 other Korean women also worked as sex slaves at
the brothel. Lee said two of her "co-workers" were killed in an air
raid by the Allied Forces.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has never married because she felt bitterly ashamed of
her ordeal as a sex slave, managed to pass an examination and
enter a university four years ago to study international law and
Japanese culture and history.</P>
      <P>"I have entered the university in hopes that knowledge in these
fields will enable me to help other surviving comfort women cope with
their difficulties and to force Japan to apologize and provide
compensation," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Donning pure white Korean-style costume, Lee set up a
makeshift altar under a tree at the previous site of the Japanese
military brothel in memory of her first lover, Hasegawa.</P>
      <P>Hasegawa was one of the Japanese "suicide squad" officiers she
served at the Hsinchu brothel. Lee said she has fond memory
of Hasegawa. "He was a gentle, polite man. He was always kind to
me," Lee recalled, adding that she believed Hasegawa had sacrificed
his life during the war.</P>
      <P>Lee placed two dolls, both wearing traditional Korean wedding
attire, in front of the altar for a rite symbolizing her marriage to
Hasegawa.</P>
      <P>"I have regarded Hasegawa as not only my first lover but also my
husband over the past 50 years," Lee said. "I hope today's rite will
help ensure that I'll be able to live a happy life with Hasegawa in
the heaven."</P>
      <P>Lee arrived in Taipei on Thursday under the auspices of the
Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation. She last visited Taipei in August
1997. During that trip, she was denied access to the Hsinchu air
base. With the assistance from New Party Legislator Hsieh Chi-ta,
Lee managed to visited the site this time.</P>
      <P>According to a United Nations report released recently, Japan
forced more than 200,000 foreign women, mostly Asians, to become sex
slaves during World War II. The report demanded the Japanese
government to compensate all the surviving victims.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY TELLS TAIWAN TO TRUST US PROMISES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The promises made by the United States to
Taiwan prior to US President Bill Clinton's visit to mainland China
are trustworthy, ROC de facto ambassador to the United States Stephen
Chen said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that based on his experience in Washington, he believes
the United States will keep its promises. US officials had assured
Taipei that there would be no change in US policy toward Taiwan,
Taiwan's interests would not be sacrificed as a result of Clinton's
mainland trip and the US will continue its arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen is in Taipei to attend the second plenary session of the
ruling Kuomintang's 15th Central Committee.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the radio news program "Face the Public,"
Chen said the Taiwan public's concern over the "three noes" policy
spelled out by Clinton is understandable, but they should note that
the US government had made promises to Taiwan prior to the visit.</P>
      <P>The "three-noes" policy refers to no US support for Taiwan
independence, no US support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan," and no US support for Taiwan to enter any international
organizations which require statehood for membership.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui's comment that Clinton's stated support
for the "three noes" policy had a psychological influence on the
people in Taiwan was "quite accurate," Chen said. But, he added, the
statement was described by the US government as a repetition of its
set policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if the "three-noes" policy will damage Taiwan's efforts to
increase its international presence, Chen said the US government has
never supported Taiwan in its bids to enter any international
organization which requires statehood for membership.</P>
      <P>On Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations, Chen said Washington
should maintain relations with Taipei parallel to its relations with
Beijing. The US House of Representatives and Senate have passed
several resolutions in support of Taiwan, signaling that the US
Congress, or people across the United States, are sympathetic to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen also called on the people of Taiwan to have more confidence
in the country, saying that as an open, democratic, and free country,
the ROC's overall performance is definitely within the world's top
20.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Holding primaries may be risky but it helps
the party increase its interaction with constituents, New Party
Convenor Chen Kuei-miao said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The newly elected convenor said many people who did not have any
previous association with the party took part in the primaries, and
the social network established during the primaries will be important
to the party in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Chen took over the post from Chou Yang-sun, both of whom are
legislators, in a ceremony held in Hsinchu. The event also marked the
party's fifth anniversary.</P>
      <P>Stating that the party is determined to stem irregularities in
the primaries, Chen called on those seeking candidacy in the year-end
elections to defend clean primaries. Voters will go to the polls at
the end of the year to elect legislators as well as Taipei and
Kaohsiung city council members including a mayor in each city.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-shien, the New Party's Taipei mayoral candidate, said
although the primary elections may not be perfect and may have
somewhat damaged the party's image, the fact that they were held is
worthy of praise.</P>
      <P>Wang said he hopes that those who fail to win a nomination will
continue to fight for the party.</P>
      <P>The New Party is holding its fourth round of open primaries on
Saturday and Sunday. Rumors of bribery have been rampant since the
month-long primary elections started on Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>To show its determination to eliminate any form of vote-buying
including offering money, gifts, free banquets to potential voters,
the New Party on Monday revoked the qualifications of five candidates
to run in the primaries, one of whom was incumbent Taiwan Provincial
Assembly Deputy Sung Ai-ko.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NA SPEAKER URGES COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  22  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang should form a task
force to thoroughly examine options in parliamentary reforms,
National Assembly Speaker Fredrick Chien recommended Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a written report submitted to the second plenary session of
the KMT's 15th Central Committee, Chien called for a comprehensive
review of the assembly's "parliamentary" role and the functional
overlap between the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In the Republic of China, the role of parliament is jointly
filled by the National Assembly and the legislature in contrast to
Western political systems.</P>
      <P>However, amid recent political reforms, there have been calls for
the abolishment of the National Assembly to increase congressional
efficiency and to prevent conflict or a power struggle between the
two representative institutions.</P>
      <P>Most constitutional scholars and experts believe reform is the
best solution to conflicts in the existing parliamentary system,
Chien reported.</P>
      <P>Reforms governing the National Assembly should not effect it in
such a way that the pace of constitutional reforms is significantly
slowed down, the speaker said. One of the assembly's key functions is
to amend the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Abolishing the National Assembly would not eradicate the current
problems plaguing parliamentary operations, Chien said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that an effective congressional system, which suits
the society and adheres to the Constitution, can only be formed after
all issues are examined such as the nation's constitutional spirit,
political environment and political tradition.</P>

      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu on Sunday
criticized the Swedish government's refusal to issue a visa to Vice
President Lien Chan, calling the decision "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>Stressing that Vice President Lien does not have plans to visit

      <P>However, a ranking government official familiar with foreign

pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Stockholm University originally

some 50 kilometers from Jiayuguan, Gansu province, at around 4:40

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese people are expected to spend less
on overseas tourism this year, the Central Bank of China (CBC) said
on Monday.</P>
      <P>CBC officials estimate that only US$7 billion will be spent on
overseas tourism, the lowest amount in the past seven years.</P>
      <P>Since the government lifted the ban on overseas travel in 1979,
spending on overseas tourism has risen every year since, officials
said. The figure hit US$5 billion in 1991 and peaked at US$8.45
billion in 1995.</P>
      <P>For the past two years, the figure has remained at US$8.1
billion, showing the enthusiasm of local people for overseas tourism.</P>
      <P>The officials said the momentum for overseas trips lost its steam
after the onset of regional financial turmoil in the latter half of
1997 and after the devaluation of Taiwan dollar against the US
dollar, which made overseas travel to some destinations more
expensive.</P>
      <P>The officials said that overseas spending in the second quarter
of this year totaled US$1.69 billion, down US$441 million, or 21
percent, from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>But the officials said that though enthusiasm for overseas trips
has dampened, domestic travel has increased, especially after the
implementation of a five-day work week every other week, a policy
that went into effect this year.</P>

      <P>Bucking an upward trend of personal
computer sales in Latin America, Acer's market share in the area
shrank dramatically in the second quarter of 1998, according to the
latest report by Dataquest Inc.</P>
      <P>Latin American personal computer shipments reached 871,770 units
in the second quarter of 1998, up 9 percent from the same period last
year. Acer, however, lost ground in both market share and units sold.</P>
      <P>Compaq continued to dominate the Latin American PC market, with a
17.7 share of the market, followed by IBM's 9.9 percent. Acer managed
to maintain the No. 3 position with a 7.3 percent market share,
compared with an 11.4 percent share last year.</P>
      <P>Latin America benefited from increased shipments in the mobile
market, which grew three times faster than the desktop market.
"Better communications infrastructure, lower prices and a more
dynamic business culture are pushing notebook sales, which

      <P>The results of the poll, conducted by the Chinese Association for

      <P>The public was most satisfied with the Cabinet's efforts to
develop the economy (10.1 percent), followed by traffic network
construction and education efforts.</P>
      <P>Only 1.6 percent of poll respondents, however, said social order
has been greatly improved in the past year, while 18.7 percent said
there has been some improvement. Fifty-seven percent said the
island's social order is unchanged from a year ago, while 19.1 said
social order had deteriorated.</P>

teamwork demonstrated by Siew's Cabinet, while only 3.1 percent said
they had demonstrated poor teamwork.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI URGED TO LOWER VISA THRESHOLD FOR CHINESE-INDONESIANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese-Indonesian community leader on
Monday urged Taiwan to relax its visa restrictions for young
Indonesian females of Chinese origin, in turn making Taiwan a haven
for those fleeing sexual violence in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Hsu Nai-lu, secretary-general of the Chinese-Indonesian
Association in the Republic of China, said the nightmarish rapes,
assaults and killings of ethnic Chinese women during riots in May is
still lingering in Indonesia, and ethnic Chinese families with
daughters are still trying to send their children abroad, in some
cases to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would be the place where most Chinese-Indonesians sought
refuge if not for the difficulties in obtaining visas, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that most of the visas the ROC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs grants Chinese-Indonesians allow them to stay in Taiwan for
two weeks to two months, but cannot be extended. This is insufficient
to meet the needs of ethnic Chinese families with daughters, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu suggested that Taipei liberalize visa restrictions for
Chinese-Indonesians aged under 20 to allow them to study in Taiwan
and flee riotous violence in Indonesia. People in Taiwan need not
worry that the looser regulations would result in a loss of jobs to
Indonesian workers, as those admitted would be youngsters, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, defended
the current visa restrictions, saying the ministry has tried its best
to help ethnic Chinese women come to Taiwan since the riots erupted
in Indonesia in May.</P>
      <P>The ministry has granted visa extensions to ethnic Chinese from
Indonesia who have relatives in Taiwan and has quickly processed
visas for those who were physically or mentally wounded during the
rioting to allow them to seek medical help in Taiwan, the officials
pointed out.</P>
      <P>The number of young Chinese-Indonesians seeking to study in
Taiwan has increased by leaps and bounds since May, they said.</P>
      <P>Since early June, 58 young ethnic Chinese from Indonesia applied
to come to Taiwan to study. Before the riots, however, no Indonesians
or perhaps only one per month would apply.</P>
      <P>In addition, those seeking to come to Taiwan specifically to
study Mandarin -- all of whom must obtain recommendations from
ROC-related organizations -- increased in number from 24 in April to
34 in June and 118 in July, according to ministry tallies.</P>
      <P>Of the applicants, 80 percent were girls, the officials said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should step up its crackdown
on rings that sell teenage girls for prostitution, an official of a
woman's group urged on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-tung, section chief of the Taipei Women's Rescue
Foundation, made the call at a press conference held at the
Legislative Yuan to coincide with the third anniversary of the
implementation of regulations to prevent child and teenage
prostitution.</P>
      <P>Chen said that girl-selling rings have targeted girls, especially
aborigine teenage girls, from broken families or those who run away
from home, forcing them into prostitution throughout the island.</P>
      <P>Noting that many notorious masterminds of girl-selling rings are
still at large, he urged the National Police Administration (NPA) to
track them down as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the Prosecutor Office and the NPA to set up task
forces and cooperate with social workers to curb the teenage
prostitution trade.</P>
      <P>Responding to the requests by Chen, Ke Li-lin, chief prosecutor
under the Ministry of Justice, said that civic groups may not realize
the severe shortage of prosecutors in local district courts, adding
that it is hard for the ministry to form a task force at present.</P>
      <P>Participants in the press conference also included
representatives from the Garden of Hope, the End Child Prostitution
Association, and Legislators Chu Huei-liang of the New Party and Shen

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURE TO BE HIGH-END BUSINESS IN NEXT CENTURY: LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's agriculture, seemingly backward
compared with its other sectors, promises to become a major
money-maker because of high-end technologies that will be developed
in the next century, President Lee Teng-hui said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the fourth National Agricultural
Conference, Lee said Taiwan's agricultural sector is not a backwater
of the island. In fact, it may become a star business, making the
most money of all Taiwan's sectors.</P>
      <P>Lee, an agronomist who held a prominent post at the Joint
Commission for Rural Reconstruction, the predecessor of the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, said with the infusion of a
large amount of capital and state-of-the-art biotechnologies, the
agricultural sector is promising to regain the glory it enjoyed about
20 years ago.</P>
      <P>To survive severe import competition resulting from Taiwan's bid
to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), the agricultural sector
must accelerate modernization -- absorbing cutting-edge
biotechnologies -- and beef up its capitalization, which can be done
by collecting funds through the stock market, Lee noted. The more
agriculture-related companies that become listed, the more money the
agricultural sector will get, he said.</P>
      <P>Once the agricultural sector becomes a technology-oriented
industry with sufficient capital support, Taiwan can once again
become a major agricultural contributor to the world village as it
did two decades ago by successfully developing the "miracle rice" --
the Taichung No. 1 indica rice -- which helped Asia tide over a food
crisis, Lee said.</P>
      <P>More than 300 delegates from agricultural, academic, government
and law-making bodies are taking part in the two-day conference,
which is devoted to discussions mainly on Taiwan's WTO bid and its
implications, as well as the opening for sale of lands zoned for
agricultural use.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian Trade Council (Austrade),
similar to Taiwan's China External Trade Development Council (CETRA),
is overhauling its services to Australian exporters after being
criticized for poor services and high hosts.</P>
      <P>The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) in a report
scathingly attacked Austrade, which is engaged mainly in export
promotions of Australian products and helping Australian companies
invest abroad, because "it falls short of consistently high standards
and does not necessarily represent value for money."</P>
      <P>"The current approach to recovering costs does not assist
Austrade to evaluate effectively the cost-effectiveness of its
service-delivery activities. Also Austrade's approach to measuring
the export impact of its activities can be substantially improved to
reduce costs and increase reliability," the ANAO report said.</P>
      <P>Austrade Managing Director Charles Jamieson said his agency would
improve the delivery of its services to its clients, simplify its
pricing policy, step up staff training and boost awareness among
exporters of what benefits they could gain from the export promotion
agency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
Sunday night told Singaporeans that, acting together, they can "ride
out the storm" and secure a brighter future.</P>
      <P>"Steering through this storm to safety is Singapore's biggest

emphasized that it also needed the people's cooperation and support
and that they must organize themselves to prepare for increased
competition after the crisis.</P>
      <P>Goh's two-hour address centered on how the Singapore government
was responding rationally and realistically to its twin challenges of
handling relations with its neighbors and restructuring its domestic
economy.</P>
      <P>He told the nation what back-room work Singapore had done to help
Malaysia and Indonesia weather the regional crisis even though ties

    <DATELINE>Singapore, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore has helped Malaysia by holding
onto several billion ringgit in its foreign reserves even though it
knows the currency may slowly depreciate further, Singaporean Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong revealed in his National Day Rally address
Sunday night.</P>
      <P>The move was among several that Singapore has undertaken to help
Malaysia and Indonesia in their current crises, he said.</P>
      <P>Of the Malaysian currency, he said: "Had we sold them, the
ringgit would have depreciated further. In addition, we have
deposited some of these ringgit with Malaysian banks in Malaysia,
even though the interest rates are much less than we could earn by
leaving the ringgit offshore in Singapore."</P>
      <P>He made this point when he elaborated at length in his address on
the state of relations between Singapore and its two closest
neighbors.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Singapore's economy was intertwined with
those of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Goh noted that Singapore also has more than S$10 billion invested
in Malaysia, spread among 1,000 companies, while its banks have
another S$21 billion in loans in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Regarding Indonesia, he said that Singapore pledged US$5 billion
along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last November to
restore confidence and has also tried to help defend the rupiah.</P>
      <P>Singapore still has several trillion rupiah deposited with Bank
Indonesia, he added.</P>
      <P>It also has S$4 billion worth of investments in Indonesia, and
Singapore banks have made another S$4 billion in loans to that
country.</P>
      <P>Singapore was also giving humanitarian assistance to Indonesia,
Goh said. "Beyond that, our best and most practical contribution now
is not to finance Indonesia's budget deficit or food subsidies
through the IMF, but to help Indonesia re-start a part of its economy
which has stalled."</P>
      <P>Goh's remarks come at a time when Malaysia has accused Singapore
of sabotaging it during its period of difficulty, while Indonesian
President B. J. Habibie has described Singapore as being less than
friendly toward Indonesia.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than one year after its handover,
Hong Kong remains mainland China's window on the world and a contact
point with mainland China for the world, according to a new book by
an Australian journalist.</P>
      <P>"Comrades and Capitalists," written by Roman Callick, a
correspondent of the Australian Financial Review in Hong Kong, said
the future of Hong Kong is closely related to the economic
development of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's many markets retain a primary attraction for
Hong Kong, which was created as a result of the "China trade,"
Callick said.</P>
      <P>But demand in mainland China is becoming stagnant and is likely
to remain so for some time as mainland China undergoes a vigorous and
overdue reform of its financial structures while Beijing continues to
place a premium on lowering inflation, he said.</P>
      <P>"Within China, Hong Kong will still be regarded, for many years,
as somewhat exotic, even 'foreign,' and thus a place to which profits
are only grudgingly repatriated," he said.</P>
      <P>If mainland China's premier, Zhu Rongji, fails in his attempt to
modernize mainland China's economy, Hong Kong will face immense
difficulties, he said in his first book published by the University
of New South Wales.</P>
      <P>Some Hong Kong investors might then attempt to liquidate funds
held in mainland China, to re-apply them elsewhere. Such an outcome
would not be popular in Beijing. What would happen to Hong Kong's
massive container port? The Hang Seng Index would need to be
re-calibrated as a result of the likely marginalization of "red chip"
mainland stocks, Callick said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Palau,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A four-star tourist hotel jointly owned by
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang and one of the most influential families
in Palau was inaugurated in the capital of the South Pacific island
nation on Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the
KMT Business Management Committee, said the posh Outrigger Palasia
Hotel Palau symbolizes a big step forward in friendship between the
Republic of China and Palau.</P>
      <P>"In addition to its commercial value, we believe the
joint-venture project will help boost bilateral relations between our
two countries," said the economist-turned-business executive.</P>
      <P>The KMT, reputed as the world's richest political party with
assets worth more than NT$100 billion, controls an 80 percent stake
in the US$10 million joint-venture project. The remaining 20 percent
is held by Senator Alan Seid, a Palau political heavyweight who is
widely believed to become the country's next president.</P>
      <P>Given Seid's political clout, Liu said he is convinced that
substantive Taiwan-Palau relations and cooperation will make
significant headway following the opening of the new hotel.</P>
      <P>With beautiful maritime and underwater scenery, Palau has long
been one of the world's most popular diving, fishing and recreational
resorts. It has consistently attracted a large number of tourists
from around the world, particularly those from Japan.</P>
      <P>Liu said the annual return on investment in the Outrigger Palasia
Hotel will reach an estimated 15 percent and that the KMT will be
able to recover all of its capital investment in seven years.</P>
      <P>Liu recalled that the KMT promised to invest more in Palau when
construction of the new hotel began some three years ago. As the two
countries have not yet established formal diplomatic ties, Liu said
the KMT must hold discussions with the ROC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs before it launches new investment projects in Palau.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Palau Vice President Tommy
Remengesau said he is delighted to see the opening of the new hotel,
which he said will not only help promote Palau's tourism industry but
will also stimulate the country's overall economic development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Seid, who provided the land for Outrigger Palasia
Hotel, said he hopes the new hotel will operate smoothly and help
inspire more Taiwan-Palau cooperative projects.</P>
      <P>Located on Palau's largest island of Koror, Outrigger Palasia
Hotel has 165 guest rooms. From the hotel, it takes only a
five-minute drive to reach Palau's major diving and recreational
center. In the initial stage, the hotel will be managed by the
well-known Outrigger hotel management firm in Hawaii on behalf of its
owners.</P>
      <P>With a population of 15,000, Palau is 2,850 kilometers southeast
of Taiwan. It takes about three and a half hours to fly directly from
Taiwan to Palau. Taiwan's Far East Air Transport Corp. currently
operates four round-trip flights between Taiwan and Palau per week.</P>

      <P>The semi-official SEF faxed three letters to its Beijing-based

tourists. The letters also requested permission for one SEF official
to travel with the relatives of the victims to offer assistance.</P>
      <P>Although the request was rejected, Tsai Chin-mei, deputy director

on Wednesday for a five-day visit. It marks his third overseas trip
aimed at promoting "party diplomacy" since he assumed his current
post late last year.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting with influential figures of Japan's ruling
and opposition parties, the KMT's top day-to-day affairs manager will
also brief Japanese authorities on Taiwan's stance and policy on
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Tokyo, Chang, a former foreign minister, will
attend a seminar to be sponsored by the Asian Elite Society on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Asian Elite Society is a Tokyo-based private association
founded by Michio Ochi, a Japanese legislator and son-in-law of the
late Japanese Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda. The association's members
include elite individuals in political and commercial sectors in
major Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Chang will be able to exchange views with a number of influential
Asian politicians and senior business executives on a variety of
regional issues during the seminar.</P>
      <P>The KMT secretary-general will also meet with Yoshiro Mori,
general secretary of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and
other LDP heavyweights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Peng-jen, director of the KMT's Department of
Party History, is scheduled to travel to Japan on Thursday. Chen, a
Japanese affairs expert, is expected to meet privately with Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.</P>
      <P>Chen, an old friend of Obuchi, will brief the prime minister on
Taiwan's stance on cross-strait relations amid reports that Beijing
is lobbying Tokyo to announce its support of the so-called "three
noes" policy against Taiwan during mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's planned visit to Japan.</P>
      <P>Jiang was originally scheduled to make a state visit to Japan in
early September, but he announced the postponement of the trip Friday
due to the serious floods devastating many mainland regions.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" refer to no support for Taiwan independence, no
support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations in which
statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" came into the limelight after US President Bill
Clinton mentioned them at a roundtable meeting in Shanghai on June
30.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's pressure, Japan reportedly is still reluctant
to explicitly throw its support behind the "three noes" against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang's and Chen's Japan visits are part of Taiwan's efforts to
dissuade the Japanese government from yielding to Beijing's pressure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S MILITARY AGAINST NON-COMMERCIALIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's decision to separate business from the
military has recently become a topic of great interest among Hong
Kong's media. Some have indicated that stopping mainland China's
military from operating businesses would be similar to getting a drug
addict to stop taking drugs.</P>
      <P>Allowing the military to run businesses has been seen as Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's strategy to winning the hearts of the troops
and the support of the army. However, now that the military has
tasted the sweetness of profiting from commercialization, it has
become a practice very difficult to end.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year on July 11, the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) held an expanded
convention. Jiang, as CPC General Secretary, proposed the following
resolutions: military and police forces be prohibited from running
businesses; smuggling operations conducted by the military and police
forces be attacked; and decrease the number of troops.</P>
      <P>These three resolutions have been strongly opposed by armies
nation-wide, informed sources in the mainland said. A campaign was
even launched in major military regions and academies to openly
protest against the resolutions.</P>
      <P>The party committee secretary of the air force of the People's
Liberation Army complained that the commercialization of the PLA was
enacted into law by CPC Central Committee, State Council and CPC
Central Military Commission in May 1985, March 1989 and July 1992
respectively. How could a party committee secretary explain the
change to officers and the rank-and-file in such a sudden move, he
asked.</P>
      <P>In a democratic nation, it would be inconceivable that an army
would be permitted to operate commercial businesses. To make matters
worse, the mainland's army is also engaged in smuggling.</P>
      <P>US-based Business Week disclosed recently that the smuggling
activities conducted by mainland China's military has gone from
ordinary merchandise to rifles, ammunition and even Chinese-made arms
and missiles to Pakistan and Iran.</P>
      <P>Evidence indicates that Beijing is serious about stamping out
commercial activity and smuggling in the military. This may be
perhaps because Jiang envisions that corruption in the army would be
the prelude to the downfall of a regime.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MJIB GEARING UP TO FIGHT HK DRUG RINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) is gearing up to fight international drug rings,
particularly those based in Hong Kong, the United Daily News
reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted MJIB sources as saying that Hong Kong and Thai
drug rings have targeted Taiwan for expanding their illegal business
because contraband narcotics can fetch much higher prices on the
island than in many other places.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan does not produce any contraband drugs, while its demand
for narcotics has continued rising. With limited supplies,
local narcotics prices are four to five times those in mainland
China, Hong Kong and major Southeast Asian countries," an MJIB
officer was quoted as telling the paper.</P>
      <P>Attracted by lucrative profit opportunities here, the
officer said, major Hong Kong criminal rings are scrambling to
smuggle drugs into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, the official said, large Hong Kong criminal
rings, such as Sin Yee On and 14K triads, focused on controlling
the narcotics trade in that territory. As a result, only small Hong
Kong gangs or individual drug dealers had developed ties with their
Taiwan counterparts.</P>
      <P>"The situation has changed in recent years," the official said,
adding that the MJIB has intercepted several batches of narcotics
smuggled by members of the 14K triad, the No. 2 gang in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the 14K triad has been trying hard to
establish an islandwide drug distribution network here.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 9, the MJIB managed to bust a drug trafficking ring,
headed by Chan Wei Man, a member of Hong Kong's largest underworld
gang Sin Yee On.</P>
      <P>"It was the first time that the MJIB has discovered that even
the Sin Yee On triad intended to make introads into Taiwan's
narcotics market," the official said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that major Hong Kong gangs do not just want to
share a slice of the large Taiwan pie. "They intend to dominate the
Taiwan market by establishing their own distribution centers on the
island," the official noted.</P>
      <P>Other MJIB sources also said major Hong Kong triads seem to
have adopted long-term strategies to tap into the Taiwan
market.</P>
      <P>For instance, the sources said, Hong Kong drug trafficking
rings usually give attentive care to their members who are serving
jail terms in Taiwan. Some Hong Kong prisoners have even developed
close ties with Taiwan inmates with a view to help their gangs expand
drug sales netwroks here.</P>
      <P>The sources further said major Hong Kong gangs have even hired
retired Hong Kong police officers to help them smuggle drugs into
Taiwan as they have better skills to shun surveillance by Taiwan's
law enforcement officers.</P>
      <P>Among international drug traffickers, the sources said, those
from Hong Kong are the most difficult to pin down. Afrter the MJIB's
Taipei outpost managed to seize several batches of narcotics
smuggled by Hong Kong gangsters, major Hong Kong triads have now
moved their local oeprations centers from northern Taiwan to central
and southern parts of the island, the sources said.</P>
      <P>More worrisome is that mainalnd China may be using Hong Kong
gangsters to infiltrate Taiwan, the sources said, adding that a
member in the Chan Wai Man drug trafficking ring busted on Aug. 9
once worked for China Resources Co., a Hong Kong-based affiliate of
mainland China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.</P>
      <P>MJIB investigations show that Deng Deming once worked for China
Resources as a formal staff member for six years. It is worth
further probes why Deng, given his career backgrounds, had been
involved in cross-border drug trafficking, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Since the Chinese communists took control of the
mainland in 1949, China Resources have served as Beijing's major
information source in Hong Kong, the sources said.</P>
      <P>MJIB Director Wang Kuang-yu said earlier this month that
since Hong Kong reverted to mainland China's rule in July
1997, Beijing has used Hong Kong as a major conduit to collect
information about Taiwan's political, military and economic
conditions.</P>
      <P>"It has become yet another challenge for MJIB agents to detect
undercover communist spies when they bust drug trafficking rings
operated by Hong Kong citizens in the future," Wang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP  CHAIRMAN  NOT OPPOSED TO DIALOGUE WITH MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung, chairman of the ROC's main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that his ideal is
for Taiwan to become a democratic, prosperous, and independent
country.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in an interview with Newsweek magazine,
excerpts of which were carried in the Aug. 31 issue of the US-based
magazine which hit newsstands early this week.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that he does not oppose dialogue, or the
development of relations, between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Describing the campaign for Taiwan independence as good for both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, Lin said he believes that the mainland
will change, and that after 10 or 20 years of efforts on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait, mainland China will no longer deem it necessary
to take over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin-liang's campaign to
boost relations with the mainland, Lin said that this is Hsu's
personal stance, and does not reflect official DPP policy. Some DPP
officials feel that Hsu is moving too fast in his push for increased
engagement with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin said that there is a general consensus that Taiwan should
conduct dialogue and develop relations with the mainland, but pointed
out that the DPP has to prevent the mainland from taking the
opportunity to undermine the security of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also criticized mainland China's handling of the murder of the
party's Kaohsiung city councilor Lin Ti-chuan in northern mainland
China, saying that but for strong protests by Lin's family, the
mainland authorities might have turned down the family's request that
a DPP official accompany them to the mainland to identify the body of
their daughter.</P>
      <P>On a more personal note, Lin, whose mother and two young
daughters were killed 18 years ago at their home, said that he has
weathered the most painful period of his life. For him and his
family, the tracking down of the killer is not so important as a
resolution of the unsolved case to uphold social justice, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL TRAVEL AGENTS WARN OF POOR SERVICES IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sources from Taiwan's travel industry
warned of inadequate travel services in mainland China, adding that
people planning on traveling there should take extra care.</P>
      <P>The comments come after six Taiwan tourists were killed and eight
others injured in a car accident Saturday in a remote area of the
northwestern province of Gansu. The tourists were visiting Jiayuguan
City along the ancient trading route known as the "Silk Road."</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based travel agencies first began organizing trips to the
Silk Road seven years ago, said Wang Chi-han, vice chairman of the
ROC Travel Quality Guarantee Association and president of the
Changhan Travel Agency.</P>
      <P>It has emerged, along with Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province and
Jiouzhaigou in Sichuan Province, as one of the most popular tourist
destinations in the mainland among Taiwan visitors, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, about 13,000 Taiwan tourists traveled to the
Silk Road in 1997, up from the previous level of 5,700 in 1996. He
estimated that more than 20,000 Taiwan tourists will travel to the
Silk Road on packaged tours this year.</P>
      <P>Taipei Association of Travel Agents Chairman Chen Hsin-hao said
the number of Taiwan tourists participating on Silk Road tours this
year will grow by at least 20 percent as a result of a promotion
campaign by the Gansu travel industry in Taiwan earlier this year.</P>
      <P>However, Chen called on Taiwan tourists planning travel to the
remote region to be cautious because there are greater difficulties
in obtaining reliable transportation and accommodation along the Silk
Road route, especially during the summer peak seasons.</P>
      <P>The disastrous flooding currently effecting much of the
northeastern and eastern regions of the mainland have led many
tourists from around the world to shift their travel destinations to
along the Silk Road, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The ROC Tourism Bureau issued a warning for Taiwan tourists to be
more careful when selecting transportation vehicles and drivers while
touring the Silk Road after Saturday's accident. A tourism official
who had traveled to the region last year said this is especially
important as tours may take thousands of kilometers.</P>
      <P>The bureau also urged travelers to be more informed prior to
embarking on their trip as the quality of services and facilities is
uncertain. It also advised tourists to avoid traveling to the Three
Gorges and the flood-plagued regions.</P>
      <P>A mainland Chinese travel agency said the number of tourists
traveling to the Silk Road region so far this year has more than
doubled from the same period last year, making it very difficult to
hire a car or get a hotel room along the route.</P>
      <P>Many local businesses have been taken by surprise at the influx
and are reportedly unprepared for the number of tourists.</P>
      <P>A local travel agency based in Gansu said it has been very
difficult for travelers to reserve airplane and train tickets for
cities along the Silk Road, adding that there is also a shortage of
hotel accommodations.</P>
      <P>Major cities other than Lanzhou, Urumqi and Trupan along the Silk
Road in Gansu and Xinjiang Provinces are accessible only via road
transportation, making travel conditions even worse, the Gansu travel
agent said. Some areas do not even have tap water or flush toilets,
he added.</P>
      <P>Although Chen estimated that visits by Taiwan people to mainland
China will reach around 1.68 million this year -- up from 1.5 million
in 1997 -- tourists rather than business travelers will account for
the increase.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative delegation of various
political stripes left on Monday for Japan to express its concern
that Tokyo might voice a "three-noes" policy toward Taipei under
pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng, vice president of the Legislative Yuan and head of
the 19-member mission, said at the Chang Kai-shek International
Airport that the delegation has no intention of interfering with
Japan's engagement with other countries, but insists that Japan's
foreign relations should not influence the well-being and interests
of the 21.8 million residents of the island.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as far as he knows, Japan has never acknowledged
that mainland China has sovereignty over Taiwan, and stressed that
the delegation will not accept any announcement by the Japanese
government regarding a "three-noes" policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This policy, spelled out by US President Bill Clinton during his
trip to the mainland in late June, refers to no US support for Taiwan
independence, no US support for "two Chinas," or "one China, one
Taiwan," and no US support for Taiwan membership in international
organizations that require statehood.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin will visit Japan in the
coming months, when he is expected to ask Japan to exclude the Taiwan
Strait from the area covered by the defense cooperation between Tokyo
and Washington, Wang said. The delegation will express concern over
the issue and urge Japan to continue to play a key role in
maintaining Asia-Pacific peace, despite Beijing's pressure.</P>
      <P>The legislator said that the delegation also hopes the Japan
government will not agree to forge any kind of military cooperation
agreement with the mainland that will be seen as a "strategic
alliance partnership."</P>
      <P>The delegation is scheduled to return to Taiwan on Thursday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar has depreciated 20.1
percent since the beginning of the Asian financial crisis more than
one year ago, according to statistics released by the Central Bank of
China.</P>
      <P>Compared with June last year, Indonesia's rupiah has suffered the
biggest drop among the region's currencies, losing 70.89 percent, and
leaving it the weakest currency in Asia.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Thailand's baht has fallen 40.75 percent;
followed by Malaysia's ringgit with a 40.25 percent cut; the
Philippine peso, down 39.17 percent; the Korean won, down 32.01
percent; the Japanese yen, down 20.54 percent; the Singapore dollar,
down 19.19 percent; and the Hong Kong dollar, down 0.02 percent.</P>
      <P>The changes in Asia's currencies compared with December last year
are as follows:</P>
      <P>The rupiah, down 52.05 percent; the yen, down 9.42 percent; the
ringgit, down 8.06 percent; the peso, down 6.6 percent; the new
Taiwan dollar, down 6.24 percent; the Singapore dollar, down 4.95
percent; and the Hong Kong dollar, down 0.01 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the won and the baht went up by 29.78 percent and 12.86
percent, respectively, during the period.</P>
      <P>Taiwan foreign exchange dealers said that the statistics indicate
the Asia financial meltdown, which has battered most of the major
economies of the region, is showing signs of abatement.</P>
      <P>But they warned that with the recent worsening of Russia's
financial situation and the lingering pressure for the devaluation of
the yen, mainland China's renminbi, and the Hong Kong dollar, the
crisis is far from over. The US dollar continues to be the strongest
currency in the region's foreign exchange markets, the dealers said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOW TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN ARE COPING WITH ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has remained relatively unscathed by
the Asian financial crisis that began in Thailand in July last year,
largely because the public and private sectors have responded wisely
to the situation.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's businessmen are increasingly worried about the
approach of a second financial upheaval amid a seemingly unavoidable
global slump.</P>
      <P>Chen Fei-lung, chairman of Namchow Chemical Co., said in an
interview with CNA that he is pessimistic about Taiwan's future
economic prospects.</P>
      <P>He cited the following reasons as the basis for his gloomy
outlook:</P>
      <P>-- Many of Taiwan's small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
have moved their operations out of Taiwan to mainland China and
Southeast Asia in the past few years, greatly eroding the basis of
Taiwan's manufacturing sector;</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan has placed too much weight on the development of
high-tech industries, a policy which has begun to cause side effects
as it fails to make the best use of Taiwan's human resources, the
country's most important assets;</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan's stock market is likely to slip further amid the
uncertain global economic circumstances; and</P>
      <P>-- Non-economic factors, such as the wasting of funds in election
campaigns, and huge expenditure in social welfare, are dimming the
country's economic prospects.</P>
      <P>Namchow Chemical has invested NT$1 billion in Thailand.</P>
      <P>To avoid losses caused by the drastic devaluation of the Thai
baht, Chen said, his company has turned 90 percent of its production
in Thailand over to export. Only 10 percent of its output is
currently set aside for local consumption, and sales are mostly
transacted with cash so as to reduce the risk of bad credit.</P>
      <P>The company has also continued to increase its capital so that it
can increase its bank borrowing, with most of the new borrowing in
Thai baht rather than the strong US dollar.</P>
      <P>Tseng Huan-cheng, general manager of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp., said Taiwan has not been hit as hard as other
Asian countries in the financial crisis, mainly because of the
government's conservative monetary policy and the comparatively
healthy structure of Taiwan's industry.</P>
      <P>The devaluation of Japan's currency poses no major threat to
Taiwan's semiconductor industry, because most purchases from Japan
are quoted in US currency, he said.</P>
      <P>Although a large part of the industry's production equipment is
imported from Japan, Tseng said that following the recent economic
slump, many producers have put off their expansion plans in order to
reduce costs.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan has gained weight in the world's
semiconductor industry, and should strive for continued development
rather than relying on the failure of its foreign competitors.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the ruling Kuomintang's Business
Management Committee, said competitive and flexible management has
helped Taiwan's SMEs to weather the crisis.</P>
      <P>He added that the nation's huge foreign currency reserves and the
government's conservative financial policies have also served as
effective shields against the financial storm.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid over-dependence on the US currency and to avoid
the occurrence of a second financial crisis, Liu urged Asian
countries to consider the establishment of an "Asia Currency Unit"
(ACU) system under the Asian Development Bank (ADB).</P>
      <P>The ACU would be a single Asian currency for the whole region, in
the same manner as the European Union's new Euro. This would give the
Asian economy as a whole far greater power to resist the strength of
the US dollar.</P>

United States have the forces to use in such a crisis, according to a
new report by the US National Defense University.</P>
      <P>The report, titled "1998 Strategic Assessment: Engaging Power for
Peace," characterizes the People's Republic of China, India and
Russia as US security strategy "wild cards" that could influence a
best-case scenario in which other large powers are friends that share
responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The three nations also could shape a worst-case scenario in which
large powers foment instability, encourage proliferation and prepare
to challenge US military supremacy.</P>
      <P>Looking 20 years into the future, the report says the PRC is the
most likely of the three to become a threat to the interests of the
United States and allies it defines as "core states."</P>
      <P>The study outlines concerns about Chinese nationalism, economic
potential, and some inherently conflicting interests with Washington
that could pose a challenge to US forces over the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>"The gradual growth of Chinese power projection capabilities will
unsettle regional security and demand US attention, even if no
hostile Chinese intentions are evident," the report says.</P>
      <P>It adds that a showdown over Taiwan between the United States and
the PRC could materialize by 2018 and that the United States should
be prepared to meet that scenario.</P>
      <P>The report cites the PRC as a US security strategy "wild card,"
and categorizes Taiwan as a "core partner" which can help the US
shoulder security burdens.</P>
      <P>The report, which was published by the US National Defense
University's Institute for National Strategic Studies, has been
presented to US Army Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs

    <HEADLINE>DALAI  LAMA  AND  YOUNG TIBETANS SPLIT ON TIBETAN CAUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tibet's Dalai Lama is seeking autonomy
for Tibet through non-violent means, but many young Tibetans are
becoming impatient and want to resort to armed struggle to win
Tibetan independence.</P>
      <P>In exclusive interviews with the Dalai Lama and Tibetan leaders
in exile in India, Australia's Special Broadcasting Corporation (SBS)
reported a split between Tibet's spiritual leader and some young and
well-educated Tibetans.</P>
      <P>These young Tibetans have become impatient with the Dalai Lama's
approach to the Tibetan issue.</P>
      <P>The SBS reported that mainland China recently made a surprising
offer to the Tibetans in exile in India, saying they would be allowed
to return to Tibet if they gave up the independence movement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama is optimistic that the recent visit to
mainland China by US President Bill Clinton bodes well for Tibet.</P>
      <P>"China proper is becoming a more open society, with more freedom
of expression, and more and more Chinese, especially intellectuals
and some writers, openly criticize their own government policies," he
said.</P>
      <P>But some young Tibetans, and some older ones, want to resort to
armed struggle for the chance of returning to Tibet someday, the SBS
reported.</P>
      <P>Lhasang Tsering of the Tibetan Center for Advanced Studies in
India said: "Something negative has come from" the recent visit of
Clinton to mainland China, because he recognized Tibet as part of
China.</P>
      <P>"The US is on record as recognizing Tibet as an independent
country. Now who is he (Clinton) today to go against history and say
Tibet is a part of China?" he asked.</P>
      <P>A leader of the Tibetan Young Congress, a radical wing in India,
said many young Tibetans advocate full independence for Tibet. "It's
high time for China to have a dialogue (with us)," he said.</P>
      <P>However, the Dalai Lama advocates patience. He said positive
change "does not come next month or next year. I think positive
things are developing (in China)."</P>
      <P>But he said he understands the impatience and frustration of many
young Tibetans who want a resolution to the Tibetan problem.</P>
      <P>"But I feel if they look from a wider perspective, they will see
positive signs and the hope that is there," the Dalai Lama said,
adding that the rest of the world has the responsibility of bringing
mainland China into the mainstream of democracy.</P>
      <P>"It's wrong to isolate China, because the country has the
potential to become a world economic power," he said.</P>

      <P>TransAsia Airways, a domestic airline
company, might be forced to reduce its flight services from Tuesday
if a serious dispute between the airline's management and pilots
cannot be resolved.</P>
      <P>Expressing anger over a management decision to cut their pay,
representatives of the almost 70 TransAsia pilots which fly the
carrier's ATR turboprop planes announced on Monday night that all ATR
pilots will stop work from 11:00 p.m. on Monday.</P>
      <P>Pilot Chen Pei-chung said at a press conference that the company
notified them of substantial pay cuts on Aug. 5 without prior
consultation. The cuts reached a monthly average of NT$50,000 per
employee. Pilots' pay will be cut to NT$120,000 from NT$200,000,
while co-pilots will have their pay slashed to NT$80,000 from
NT$120,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said that four pilots were told they were to be
suspended without warning from Aug. 20. Meanwhile, the airline also
announced that several foreign pilots would be hired.</P>
      <P>Chen said that despite several rounds of negotiations between the
company and representatives of the pilots, the last of which was held
on Aug. 17, the airline's management refused to make any concessions,
claiming that "this is set policy and there is no way to change it."</P>
      <P>The airline's decision has caused negative psychological factors
in the ATR pilots, and has aroused panic, Chen said, pointing out as
the pilots are afraid their current anxiety might endanger flight
safety, they decided to stop working.</P>
      <P>Although TransAsia Airways, founded in 1951, currently has twelve
A321-131 and A320-231 jet planes as well as thirteen ATR 72-210A and
ATR 42-200 turbine propeller airplanes. The carrier operates 18
domestic flights each day flights each day, in addition to offering

      <P>Canada is taking the first steps toward
restoring diplomatic ties with Nigeria as the African country has
made some positive moves toward a more democratic system, a ranking
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy added, however, that
Canada has not yet made a final decision on whether to reopen its
high commission there.</P>
      <P>Canada cut off diplomatic relations with the African country two
years ago after its dictatorship executed several prominent
dissidents. Ottawa has since tried to lead an international boycott
of the military government, to little avail.</P>
      <P>Axworthy met with the Nigerian ambassador to the United Nations
and discussed Nigeria's commitment to a general election in March,
the establishment of an electoral commission, the release of
prisoners and the creation of more opportunities for trade unions.</P>
      <P>"There has been, we believe, a series of quite positive decisions
taken," Axworthy told a news conference.</P>
      <P>"We wanted to establish this diplomatic presence in Nigeria so we

      <P>Drug smuggling and environmental crime top
the list of organized crimes that have the greatest impact on
Canadian society, a government report said Monday.</P>
      <P>The study, released by Solicitor General Andy Scott, noted that
drug trafficking and abuse are costing Canadians billions of dollars
every year. It defined environmental crime as the improper storage
and disposal of hazardous waste.</P>
      <P>Economic crime, like securities and telemarketing fraud, costs
Canadians at least C$5 billion (US$3.3 billion) annually, according
to the report, yet it is low on the list of law enforcement
priorities.</P>
      <P>Between 8,000 to 16,000 illegal immigrants are smuggled into
Canada each year, and counterfeit products cost approximately C$1
billion annually, while money laundered in Canada may range from C$5
billion to C$17 billion a year, the report said.</P>
      <P>Scott announced the results of the report in a speech to the
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police in Edmonton.</P>
      <P>The study found that the impact of organized crime is wider than
has been estimated and goes beyond obvious consequences such as
violence and economic losses, to less conspicuous social,
environmental, health and safety damages.</P>

      <P>The launch of a Taiwan-Singapore owned
US$240 million "ST-1" satellite is on schedule to blast off Wednesday
at 7 a.m. (Singapore time) from Kaourou, French Guiana, the Straits
Times reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The ST-1 satellite, owned by Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom and
Singapore Telecom, will be launched by an Ariane-4 rocket built by
French-based Arianespace. It has passed all its pre-launch tests, and
nothing barring an act of nature will likely stop its flight into
space.</P>
      <P>Once in space, the satellite will be one of the most powerful
telecom satellites in orbit over Asia, providing telecommunication
and broadcasting services over most of the region.</P>
      <P>The 3.2-tonne geostationary satellite, built by the European
company Matra Marconi Space, will orbit at 36,000 km above Earth and
is expected to be in service for about 12 years.</P>
      <P>Preparations for take-off are at its final stages. The rocket
will be fueled only three hours prior to launch due to the explosive
nature of the liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel. A team of 100

      <P>The study found that pregnant women who smoke can pass on a

    <HEADLINE>INDEPENDENCE SAID ONLY CAUSE OF CONFLICT IN TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Strait is one of Asia's
remaining flash points but conflict will erupt only if Taiwan
declares independence, a new report on US military strategy said,</P>
      <P>Strategic Assessment 1998, published by the National Defense
University (NDU) in Washington, also predicted that Taiwan pressure
for new US arms sales will diminish over the next three years.</P>
      <P>This is partly due to the fact that Taiwan's armed forces have
just completed a procurement cycle, with the exception of air defense
systems, and it needs time to assimilate the new systems, the annual
report said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recently acquired 150 US-made F-16 and 60 French Mirage
fighter aircraft, six French Lafayette-class and seven US Perry-class
frigates.</P>
      <P>Another reason why arms sales would be reduced is the expected
resumption of talks between Taiwan and the mainland, the report said.
Cross-strait talks broke off after Beijing suspended a meeting
scheduled for July 1995 as a protest to President Lee Teng-hui's
visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>The 280-page document, produced by the NDU's Institute for
National Strategic Studies and published earlier this month, is the
fourth such assessment in as many years. The assessment does not
reflect government views but is intended to inform and influence
policy makers and academics.</P>
      <P>While discussing the challenges in the Asia-Pacific region, the
report said that the Korean peninsula and the Taiwan Strait remain
"the two most probable sites of conflict."</P>
      <P>Conflict in the Taiwan Strait is "probable only if Taiwan
declares independence," it said.</P>
      <P>Although the cross-strait problem is political and should be
solved by the two sides through negotiation, the report said the
United States is involved because the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979
requires Washington to provide the island with necessary material for
it to defend itself.</P>
      <P>The report added that, whatever the cause, "any US administration
would come under significant pressure to defend Taiwan were conflict
to occur."</P>
      <P>Given the likely resumption of cross-strait talks, the best
strategy for Washington is to continue to assert insistence on a
peaceful settlement by supporting dialogue and by using arms sales to
Taiwan to maintain the military balance across the strait.</P>
      <P>The United States might also use political channels to convey its
concern to Taipei about any unilateral attempt to alter the status
quo in the Taiwan Strait, said the report.</P>

      <P>Australia's leading beer maker reported
A$167 million (over US$105 million) in losses from efforts to enter
mainland China's beer market.</P>
      <P>Foster's Brewing Group said it would sell its interest in two

      <P>The write-down was offset by the A$480 million (US$300 million)

    <HEADLINE>TO AVOID CONFLICT, US MUST PROVIDE ROC WITH ARMS: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US arms sales to Taiwan would deter
Beijing from forcing its hand in the Taiwan Strait dispute and is
seen as the only way the United States can avoid getting entangled in
a war with the mainland, a policy analysis said.</P>
      <P>Ted Galen Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign
policy studies at the Cato Institute, wrote in his report that US
officials must at the same time make it clear that under no
circumstances will the United States intervene in a war between the
island and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Identified as an especially controversial aspect of President
Bill Clinton's June visit to China was his stated commitment to the
"three noes" policy with regard to Taiwan. The policy involves no US
support for an independent Taiwan, "two Chinas" or "one Taiwan and
one China," nor Taiwan membership in any organization for which
statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Despite the Clinton administration's insistence that US policy
had not changed following the president's statement, there was
widespread skepticism in both the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Clinton stopped short of accepting Beijing's position
that Taiwan is nothing more than a renegade province of the People's
Republic of China, the opposition not only to Taiwanese independence
but also to Taiwan's hopes for lesser forms of international
recognition confirmed a major change in Washington's position,
Carpenter added.</P>
      <P>Washington's position since 1972 had been that the United States
did not challenge Beijing and Taipei's assertion that there is one
China and Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>But Clinton went much further, signaling US hostility to the
possibility of an independent Taiwan or even Taiwanese membership in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Clinton's statement drew condemnation from the Republican
leadership in Congress and from sources as politically diverse as the
Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post. Parris Chang, a
Democratic Progressive Party member of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan,
bitterly accused Clinton of "selling out" Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although concern about the president's comments is justified,
such criticisms misidentify the primary danger arising from
Washington's policy shift, Carpenter noted.</P>
      <P>The real problem is that Clinton's policy has a built-in,
extremely dangerous contradiction. His statements in Shanghai
indicate that the United States now considers Taiwanese independence
an illegitimate option. This is a far cry from merely acknowledging
that most Taiwanese and mainland Chinese endorse the theoretical goal
of "one China."</P>
      <P>The implications of that change in language go far beyond the
escalation of US opposition to Taipei's bid to join the United
Nations and other international bodies. More tangibly, Carpenter
continued, Clinton's policy shift presages a reduction and eventual
elimination of arms sales to Taiwan -- as already suggested by
several East Asia experts who want Washington to mollify Beijing by
such measures.</P>
      <P>Yet the president also implied that Washington would intervene
militarily to defend Taiwan from attack. That "accommodationist"
approach combines the worst, most dangerous features of appeasement
and firmness, added the Cato analyst.</P>
      <P>Nearly as dangerous is the policy of all-out support for Taiwan
that many American conservatives suggest, Carpenter said. A US
security guarantee to Taiwan would lack credibility and, given the
emotional determination of mainland Chinese to pursue reunification,
could easily entangle the United States in a war with a nuclear-armed
power.</P>
      <P>That is all the more likely because enthusiasm for formal
independence is growing in Taiwan, and the United States would be
pressured to back that bid, the report added.</P>
      <P>The only solution, concluded Carpenter, is for the United States
to allow increased arms sales to Taiwan, thus enabling it to build a
self-sufficient defense and an effective deterrent to coercion by
Beijing.</P>
      <P>At the same time, US officials must make it clear to both Beijing
and Taipei that Taiwan is not a vital US interest and that under no
circumstances will the United States intervene in a war between the
mainland and Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC OIL PRICES TO BE LOWERED AGAIN WEDNESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
announced yet another oil price cut on Tuesday, reflecting slumping
crude oil import costs.</P>
      <P>Starting Wednesday, domestic prices for a variety of petroleum
products will be lowered by an average of 1.31 percent, a spokesman
for the state monopoly said.</P>
      <P>This is the fourth time since July that the CPC has offered an
across-the-board price cut for its products amid a downward spiral in
international crude oil prices.</P>
      <P>Altogether, the state monopoly has lowered its prices by a total
of 5.69 percent since July.</P>
      <P>Under current government regulations, the CPC is allowed to
adjust its prices within a range of 6 percent over three consecutive
months. Beyond this range, the CPC must obtain prior approval from
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA). If the CPC wants to cut
prices again in the near future, it must first secure a green light
from the MOEA.</P>
      <P>After Wednesday's adjustment, the retail price for premium
gasoline will drop to NT$17.4 (US$0.5) per liter from the current
NT$17.6, while fuel oil prices will be slashed by NT$74 per
kiloliter.</P>
      <P>The price for research octane number (RON) 95 gasoline will
decline to NT$17.2 from NT$17.4 and RON 92 unleaded gasoline will be
cut to NT$16.2 from NT$16.4.</P>
      <P>The price for high-grade diesel will fall to NT$12.4 from
NT$12.5, while normal-grade diesel will slide from NT$11.3 to
NT$11.2.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, prices for household-use and vehicle-use liquefied
petroleum gas will be cut by NT$0.18 and NT$0.1, respectively, per
kilogram.</P>
      <P>The CPC spokesman said the new prices were calculated based on
three criteria -- crude oil prices at NT$12.61 per barrel, a currency
exchange rate of NT$34.64 against the US dollar and the company's
annual profit target of NT$22.2 billion.</P>
      <P>With weak crude oil prices in the international market, CPC's
crude import costs dropped to an average of US$11.62 a barrel in
July, the lowest level in more than a decade.</P>
      <P>As a result, the state monopoly registered a pre-tax profit of
NT$4.1 billion for the month, or NT$1.87 billion over its target.
Against this backdrop, the CPC decided to further lower prices for
its products starting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The company first offered a 1.57 percent cut in prices for its
products on July 1, and again trimmed its prices by an average of
1.28 percent on July 22. On Aug. 12, it announced a further 1.53
percent cut.</P>
      <P>The CPC has conducted weekly reviews of domestic petroleum prices
since March in an attempt to have its prices fluctuate in tandem with
international crude oil prices and the local currency's exchange rate
against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Economic observers said the CPC's oil price cuts will help
maintain domestic price stability. Nevertheless, another state
monopoly, Taiwan Power Co., said it will not lower its electricity
rates because the latest CPC price cuts will have only a limited
effect on its power generation costs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING HAS NO RIGHT TO DICTATE TAIWAN'S ACTIONS: DPP HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung, chairman of the ROC's main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said on Tuesday that
Taiwan is a sovereign state and that mainland China has no right to
dictate Taiwan's actions.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to remarks made Monday by mainland's Taiwan
Affairs Office under the State Council that if Taiwan really desires
unification, it should not do four things.</P>
      <P>Foremost, Beijing asked Taiwan not to cite the "different social
systems" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as a reason to
refuse unification.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan should not promote the upgrading of its
combat capacity part; continue to promote its bid to join the United
Nations; or continue to refuse the establishment of direct links
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if mainland China really wants to unify with
Taiwan, it should not "run contrary to the course of unification," as
the people of Taiwan will not be intimidated, and bullying will only
arouse antagonism from the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, director of the DPP's Department of Chinese
Affairs, said that Beijing's views are not conducive to the upcoming
high-level meeting between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Yen responded to Beijing's four "should not's" with four of his
own: the mainland should not disregard public opinion in Taiwan;
advocate the use of force against Taiwan; impose its "one China"
principle as the prerequisite for the resumption of cross-strait
talks; or insist on political negotiations without regard to the
interests of the people.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan would use every peaceful means and possible
channel to communicate its position with the international community,
but the fact that Taiwan remains a sovereign state has not changed.</P>
      <P>No county, including the United States or mainland China, has the
right to interfere with Taiwan's actions, he said.</P>
      <P>Yen also said that it is unwise for Beijing to issue the "four
should not's" at a time when the world is calling for an easing of
tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES TOTAL US$83.6 BILLION IN JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China sat on US$83.61
billion in foreign exchange reserves at the end of July, the world's
third-largest such stockpile, the Central Bank of China (CBC)
announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The total represents an increase of US$321 million over the
previous month's figure.</P>
      <P>Since financial turmoil struck throughout Asia in the latter half
of last year, Taiwan's central bank has intervened in the monetary
market several times, dumping US dollars, which reduced Taiwan's
foreign exchange reserves and attracted widespread public attention.</P>
      <P>The Japanese yen's plunge last June resulted in devaluation
pressure on the New Taiwan dollar. In recent months, the CBC has
intervened in a very public way to prop up a sagging NT dollar. Such
intervention cost Taiwan US$1.16 billion in foreign reserves,
resulting in a balance of US$83.29 billion in June, a seven-month
low.</P>
      <P>The yen fluctuated less wildly in July, which in turn stabilized
the NT dollar.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said recently that the CBC did not use
a single dime in July to stabilize the foreign exchange rate, which
is the primary reason for the rise in Taiwan's foreign exchange
reserves.</P>
      <P>At the end of June, Japan's foreign exchange reserves totaled
US$205.87 billion; mainland China's, US$140.05 billion; and Hong
Kong's, US$77.9 billion, according to statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1 TAIWAN STUDENT KILLED IN CAR ACCIDENT IN TEXAS, 6 OTHERS INJURED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>One ROC student was killed in a car crash
in the southern US state of Texas on Monday and six other Taiwan
students were injured in the same accident, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The mishap took place in the northern Texas city of Amarillo
at 3 a.m. on Aug. 24 local time," MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said,
quoting reports from the Republic of China's representative
office in Houston.</P>
      <P>Wu said all the seven students aboard the crashed car were
studying at Texas A&amp;M University's Commerce campus. Six of them were
doing on master's programs and the remaining one was an undergraduate
student.</P>
      <P>The deceased student was identified as Chen Po-chang, Wu said,
adding that two of the injured, Tang Kuang-han and Yang Chih-ping,
sustained serious injuries, but they are in stable conditions after
receiving emergency medical treatment.</P>
      <P>The four other students, identified as Chen Yi-chun, Chiang
Hui-ying, Wang Pei-chen and Lou Wei-li, only sustained mild injuries
and were already discharged from the hospital, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The university's Chinese students association informed the ROC
representative office of the mishap shortly after its occurrence, Wu
said, adding that a staff member at the office has traveled to
Amarillo to help handle related affairs and express concern for all
the victims.</P>
      <P>In addition to ordering the Houston office to offer all
necessary assistance to the students, Wu said MOFA will help the
students' families secure travel papers in the shortest possible
period of time so that they can travel to Texas to care for their
children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRANSASIA AIRWAYS SLASH FLIGHT SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local air carrier TransAsia Airways was
forced to slash its flight services on Tuesday as a result of the
sudden resignation of 67 pilots.</P>
      <P>TransAsia spokesman Ho Chih-hwai said that the airline has had to
leave all thirteen of its ATR turboprop planes in the hangar, at
least until Friday, which is the deadline for the pilots to back down
and report for work.</P>
      <P>Beset by a serious dispute between the airline's management and
pilots over pay cuts, Ho said that the company's stance is firm,
adding that if the pilots insist on resigning, foreign pilots will be
recruited to fill the vacancies.</P>
      <P>A total of 90 flights will have to be canceled from Tuesday as a
result of the dispute, but Ho reassured passengers with reservations
that the company will arrange for them to take flights with
alternative carriers.</P>
      <P>Chang Chia-juch, vice minister of transportation and
communications and director-general of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration, called on Tuesday for the airline's management and
pilots to leave their negotiation channels open, and for each party
to make some concessions. Passenger rights should remain the highest
priority, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Although he said the ministry will not intervene in the dispute,
Chang pointed out that his ministry will look into claims that some
of the ATR pilots were placed on the resignation list without their
consent.</P>
      <P>Sixty-seven of the carrier's 72 ATR turboprop pilots announced on
Monday that they would stop working from 11:00 p.m. that evening to
protest against a management decision to drastically cut their pay.</P>
      <P>Pilot Chen Pei-chung said at a press conference that they
received unexpected notification of substantial pay cuts on Aug. 5.
The cuts amount to a monthly average of NT$50,000 per employee.
Pilots' pay will be cut to NT$120,000 from NT$200,000, while
co-pilots will have their pay slashed to NT$80,000 from NT$120,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said that four pilots were told without warning
that they were to be suspended from Aug. 20. Meanwhile, the airline
also announced that several foreign pilots would be recruited.</P>
      <P>The decision has caused negative psychological factors in the ATR
pilots, and has aroused panic, Chen said, pointing out that as the
pilots are afraid their current anxiety might endanger flight safety,
they decided to resign. Airline pilots are not allowed under Taiwan
law to go on strike.</P>
      <P>TransAsia Airways, founded in 1951, currently has thirteen ATR
72-210A and ATR 42-200 turboprop planes, as well as twelve A321-131
and A320-231 jet planes. The carrier operates 18 domestic routes, in
addition to offering seven international charter flights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC REPORTS MIXED MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH RATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's credit status is expected to
remain relaxed as the growth of the domestic money supply was stable
in July, although the three main indexes indicated mixed growth, the
Central Bank of China (CBC) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The broadly defined M2, which comprises cash in circulation,
checking accounts, demand and savings deposits, and quasi-money
(including time deposits and treasury bills), grew at an annual rate
of 8.34 percent in July, the highest year-on-year increase in the
past three months.</P>
      <P>However, the narrowly defined M1A, which comprises currency in
circulation and checking and demand deposits, dropped 1.46 percent in
July compared with the previous month. The decline represents a
27-month low, officials from CBC's Economic Research Department said.</P>
      <P>The M1B -- the M1A plus passbook savings deposits -- also dropped
0.98 percent in July, a 30-month low. The M1B is considered by some
economists the most effective gauge of Taiwan's credit status.</P>
      <P>Of the indexes, only the M2 posted an increase in July, which the
CBC researchers attribute mainly to less government savings and the
relatively low comparison base of one year ago.</P>
      <P>The annual growth rate of savings in major financial
institutions, including banks and post offices, stood at 7.82 percent
at the end of July, the lowest monthly year-on-year increase since
January. In comparison, the growth rate was 8.1 percent at the end of
June.</P>
      <P>Growth in bank lending and financial investments also slowed to
8.82 percent in July from June's figure of 9.72 percent. July's
figure is an eight-month low, the officials said.</P>
      <P>An anemic domestic stock market and Asia's financial crisis are
mainly responsible for the negative growth in the M1A and M1B indexes
in July, they said.</P>

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first reported case of locally
contracted dengue fever might have been caused by Aedes mosquitoes
that reached Taiwan among imported cargo, the Department of Health
(DOH) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of the Bureau of Communicable
Diseases under the DOH, said that the Kaohsiung City home and
workplace of the 28-year-old victim had been inspected, but no Aedes
mosquito breeding sites had been spotted.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that preliminary findings suggest that the Aedes
mosquitoes, the carrier of the sometimes fatal disease, had been
brought into the country along with imported cargo. The victim, who
works at Kaohsiung port, might have been bitten during the course of
his work, she added.</P>
      <P>However, the official said that the department has not ruled out
the possibility that the man might have contracted the infection
outside of Kaohsiung, as he visited a pear orchard in Pingtung County
in early August.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung health department has so far collected blood
samples from 104 residents living in the same neighborhood as the
victim, as well as blood samples from 60 of the victim's colleagues,
to see if any one else has caught the disease.</P>
      <P>The DOH revealed the case on Monday, saying that while the other
60 or so reported dengue victims had contracted the disease while
traveling in Southeast Asian countries, the Kaohsiung port worker has
not left the country within the past six months.</P>
      <P>The DOH said that the man was rushed to hospital on Aug. 11 for
dengue-related symptoms including skin rash, fever, headache, nausea,
joint pain and loss of appetite. However, the hospital did not report
the case to the DOH until Aug. 15.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEARLY 40% OF LOCAL PEOPLE SUPPORT TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of local people support
Taiwan independence, while about 80 percent give a thumbs down to the
Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems" unification scheme,
according to the results of a public opinion poll released on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,008 adult residents throughout the
island, conducted by the Rising People Foundation on Aug. 13-15,
found that 39.9 percent of the respondents think Taiwan should move
toward independence in the future, compared to 31.2 percent who said
Taiwan should reunify with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 15 percent of those surveyed said the status quo
should be maintained forever.</P>
      <P>Survey results also showed that 79.4 percent of the respondents
oppose the "one country, two systems" unification formula.</P>
      <P>If the ROC surrendered its sovereignty and jurisdiction of
defense and foreign affairs to mainland China and Beijing promised
not to interfere with Taiwan's internal and economic affairs, 80.7
percent said they oppose unification under such conditions. Even if
Taiwan were allowed to retain its own military, 71.7 percent said
they still couldn't accept such unification terms.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's future, 33.7 percent said they believe that
Taiwan's status quo can be maintained for more than 30 years; 9.5
percent said they think the status quo can be maintained for 20 to 29
years; 17.2 percent said they believe the status quo can be maintained
for 10 to 19 years; 13.2 percent said they think the status quo can
be maintained for five to nine years; and 4.4 percent said they
believe the status quo will change in less than five years.</P>
      <P>The same survey further showed that 61.9 percent of the
respondents see the need for Taiwan's top negotiator with the
mainland, C. F. Koo, to meet his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan,
this fall to discuss issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>As for the agenda for the much-anticipated Koo-Wang meeting, 80
percent said the two sides should discuss the possibility of signing
an investment guarantee agreement to protect the interests and
safety of Taiwan investors in mainland China, while 78.4 percent
said cooperation in fighting crime and mutual legal assistance should
be included in the agenda.</P>
      <P>Only 46.5 percent said issues related to Taiwan's future status,
unification or independence, should be discussed at the planned
Koo-Wang meeting.</P>
      <P>Asked if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were to hold
political talks, 37.6 percent said issues concerning Taiwan's
participation in international organizations should be included in
the agenda; 36.8 percent said the two sides should discuss a
mechanism to prevent cross-strait military confrontation; 26 percent
said the two sides should mull issues related to Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 61.5 percent oppose the proposal:
"Taiwan recognize it is part of China and promise not to declare
independence in 50 years, but agree to give up forever its attempt to
seek independence 50 years later, while Beijing promise not to attack
Taiwan in 50 years."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 75 percent of the respondents said they have never
been to mainland China, and 53.5 percent said if Taiwan were to
negotiate sovereignty issues with mainland China, the Taiwan
delegations should include representatives from all major political
parties here as well as professionals from related fields.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, a spokesperson for the Rising
People Foundation said there are no major differences in opinions
concerning Taiwan's future or cross-strait relations among local
people of different party affiliation or origin.</P>
      <P>"As far as Taiwan's future status and cross-strait relations
are concerned, no major differences exist between native Taiwanese

    <DATELINE>San  Salvador,  El  Salvador,  Aug. 24 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Salvadoran President
Armando Calderon Sol on Monday received a visiting ROC delegation led
by Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman P.K.
Chiang and Foreign Minister Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of officials from the CEPD and the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived here earlier that same day.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing the traditional close and cordial bilateral relations
between the two countries, Calderon expressed the hope that two-way
ties will be further strengthened through increased exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the major purpose of his visit to El Salvador is to
discuss cooperative ventures with five central American diplomatic
partners -- El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and
Guatemala -- on how to promote the economic development of these
countries.</P>
      <P>The CEPD chairman also reported to Calderon that the ROC
delegation and the foreign and trade ministers from the five central
American countries will hold an economic cooperation conference here
on Tuesday to discuss ways of realizing bilateral cooperative
projects.</P>
      <P>After a year of research following a similar meeting held last
year in Taipei, Chiang said that bilateral relations can be further
cemented in the areas of trade, investment, and tourism. He expressed
the opinion that the Republic of China and the five Central American
allies should clinch an agreement soon to accelerate their plans to
set up a joint free economic zone in Central America.</P>
      <P>Central America has emerged as an attractive investment prospect
following the year-long Asian financial storm, Chiang said, adding
that the ROC government has worked out a series of incentives for
Taiwan businesses interested in investing in the region.</P>
      <P>So far, three Taiwan firms have signed agreements to set up
strongholds in a Taiwan-invested industrial zone in El Salvador. If
they can begin their operations there by the end of this year, it
will create up to 5,000 job opportunities for local residents.
Another four Taiwan companies are also planning to move in, which
will create a further 12,000 job opportunities.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hu said that he found that El Salvador has made
noticeable progress over the past four years, adding that he now has
greater confidence in encouraging Taiwan businesses to invest.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the local press later the same day, Hu
called for a bilateral accord to avoid double taxation in order to
woo more Taiwan investors to El Salvador.</P>
      <P>According to the foreign minister, there are 14 Taiwan companies
currently operating in El Salvador, all of which are making a profit.</P>
      <P>Hu revealed that the Rebar Group, one of Taiwan's leading
enterprises, is planning to open facilities at the Taiwan-funded
industrial zone if construction of the complex can be completed by
November.</P>
      <P>Should the Rebar Group set up shop there, Hu said other Taiwan
businesses will undoubtedly follow, because Rebar is a respected
concern comprising banks, food and insurance companies, hotels, real
estate brokerages, and a cable television network.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that more hi-tech Taiwan businesses will
invest in El Salvador and help upgrade local industries.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Hu also visited Salvadoran Vice President Enrique
Borgos, who hailed Taiwan's economic and political prowess, and
expressed appreciation for the ROC government's willingness to share
its development experience with his country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BUSINESS LEADERS CALL FOR IMPROVED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Teng Chia-ling and Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan business leaders are urging the
government to help guide local enterprises in their efforts to
upgrade as soon as possible, in order to enhance their international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Since Thailand announced the adoption of a floating exchange rate
for the Thai baht on July 2, 1997, igniting a series of foreign
exchange rate battles in Southeast Asia, the financial turmoil has
spread like a plague from Thailand to the Philippines, Indonesia,
Malaysia, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has remained relatively unscathed by the
financial disaster, which the business leaders attribute to the small
government foreign debt, as well as the ability of it's small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to react quickly to change.</P>
      <P>Kao Ching-yuan, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, said in an interview with CNA that many Southeast Asian
countries, with high ratios of both foreign debts and bad accounts,
have been proven too weak to withstand the onslaught of the financial
firestorm.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, Taiwan's situation is different. Most of its
SMEs, which make up the majority of Taiwan's enterprises, are highly
capable of coping with changing situations, and are able to use their
own funds to adapt and surmount the crisis.</P>
      <P>Chu Chih-yang, honorary chairman of the Chinese National Research
Institute of Industry &amp; Commerce Construction, pointed out that the
SMEs, which account for about half of the total national output and
employ some 75 percent of the nation's workforce, are the mainstay of
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that close cooperation between SMEs and their
satellite plants, and the flexible use of their own funds, have also
helped prevent them from suffering excessive impact from the
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-ho, chairman of the research institute, noted that
another important factor that has helped minimize the influence of
the financial turmoil is the traditionally strict and conservative
management style prevalent in the country's SMEs.</P>
      <P>Tai Sheng-thung, chairman of the National Association of Small &amp;
Medium Enterprises, ROC, also pointed out that the SMEs, with more
than 30 years of business experience and production technology,
together with the prudent screening system employed by Taiwan's
financial institutions, have also helped buffer the economy.</P>
      <P>He added that the SMEs did not use excessive credit to borrow and
were therefore able to safely tide themselves over the difficulties
of economic recession.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the business leaders also expressed their hope that
the government will move one step further, and present concrete
measures to cope with the financial crisis and boost economic
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Both Wang You-theng, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce
of the Republic of China, and Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese
National Association of Industry &amp; Commerce, urged the government to
encourage private investment and promote industrial development in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koo said the stabilization of the political situation should be
the government's top priority in leading the nation's enterprises
through the financial storm. If the political situation can retain
long-term stability, he said, then foreign investors will naturally
have more confidence to invest in Taiwan, and the economy will grow
accordingly.</P>
      <P>Kao, Chu, Chen, and Tai were unanimous in their suggestion that
the government should: help enterprises to improve production
technology; provide a good climate for capital or fund raising; draft
related laws and policies; and implement government reconstruction.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, both government officials and
entrepreneurs should earmark more funds for research and development
of better technology and production techniques, instead of using
their capital for speculation. This, they said, will prevent Taiwan
from marching down the road toward a bubble economy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An increasing number of manufacturing
sector businessmen believe the country's economic development will
slow down in the second half of this year, according to a survey by
the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>The TIER survey, conducted in July, shows that 35.8 percent of
businessmen polled shared this pessimistic view, up from 26.3 percent
in a similar survey in June, while 21.4 percent expect a more active
economy in the latter half of this year than in the past six months,
down from June's 23.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The number of those who believe Taiwan's economy will not change
this year fell to 42.8 percent from the previous 50 percent,
illustrating general pessimism toward the island's future economic
development, TIER researchers said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The July survey indicates that most businessmen in the
manufacturing sector saw their output in July maintained at the same
level as June. However, they also had higher inventories, and
suffered decreasing orders and declining profits due to lower prices.</P>
      <P>These findings show that the recession is expected to
significantly slow Taiwan's economic growth, the TIER experts said,
warning that it will be difficult for the island to achieve its
target of 5.3 percent economic growth this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF REGRETS ARATS SNUB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
on Tuesday wrote another letter to its Beijing-based counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
expressing regret at being denied permission to assist Taiwan car
accident victims in northwestern mainland China.</P>
      <P>The semi-official SEF faxed three letters to ARATS on Sunday and
Monday, expressing its willingness to send a SEF official to the
mainland to offer help in the aftermath of a car accident on Saturday
in which six Taiwan tourists died and eight others were injured in
Gansu Province, said SEF Deputy Secretary-General Wu Hsin-hsing.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred in a remote area of Gansu Province, along
part of the ancient Silk Road.</P>
      <P>ARATS turned down the offer, saying that it would handle the
situation without any assistance from the SEF.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is regrettable that the SEF offer of help was rejected
repeatedly.</P>
      <P>In its Tuesday letter to ARATS, the SEF discounted the latest
ARATS response as contrary to the truth. The ARATS letter said that
SEF officials have never been allowed to travel to the mainland to
negotiate issues concerning the welfare and interests of Taiwan
people in past years, and that they will never be allowed to do so in
the future.</P>
      <P>The SEF argued that its officials have indeed traveled to the
mainland to help resolve problems arising from accidents in which
Taiwan visitors' lives have been lost and their property damaged.</P>
      <P>Wu said he does not understand why ARATS is denying this, or why
it has made an about-face and barred SEF officials from traveling to
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wu said he hates to see that a "gray area" exists with respect to
interaction and mutual assistance between the two intermediary
bodies, adding that this issue should also be included for discussion
in future negotiations.</P>
      <P>The SEF letter also requested ARATS to help the relatives of the
Taiwan accident victims, and make sure they are accorded the proper
treatment, that their opinions are respected concerning the handling
of the bodies, that the eight injured be given proper medical care,
that the cause of the accident be probed, that compensation be
discussed, and that Taiwan media personnel be given help when they
travel to Gansu to cover the story.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top economic planner said that
Taiwan has been better able to tackle the Asian financial crisis than
many other countries because it's financial and industrial
development policies are good and are properly implemented.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), made the remarks in a recent interview with the
CNA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will stimulate its domestic demand and encourage private
investment in order to tide over the financial crisis sweeping Asia,
he added.</P>
      <P>The following is the transcript of the interview:</P>
      <P>Q: The Asian financial crisis has devastated the economy of many
countries for a year. Taiwan has fared relatively well amid the
crisis. Can you please explain why?</P>
      <P>A: The Republic of China on Taiwan is one of the three countries
in the region that are able to achieve economic growth this year. In
addition, our currency depreciation is relatively mild, and our stock
market is rather stable, when compared with those of other Asian
countries. All of these indicate that our economy is rather healthy.</P>
      <P>I believe this is because our financial policy and industrial
development policy are appropriate.</P>
      <P>Because of trade surplus, we have accumulated a big amount of
foreign exchange reserves. And our foreign debts are almost nil,
when compared with those of many other Asian countries. This is
because we have enough savings for domestic investment, and because
we have steadily carried out our financial policy.</P>
      <P>In the past decade, we have successfully transformed our
labor-intensive industries into technology-intensive industries, as
can been seen from the vigorous development of our information
industry. As a result, our export trade and our economy have been
growing pretty well in the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>The economy of Singapore and Taiwan are rather healthy, because
the financial and industrial development policies of the two
countries are pretty good. Japan's economy is the second largest in
the world because of its successful industrial development policies.
But its financial policy has plunged its economy into deep recession.</P>
      <P>Q: Can you shed some light on the impact of the Asian financial
crisis on Taiwan? What factors will affect the recovery of the Asian
economy?</P>
      <P>A: Like flu, the financial crisis is sweeping all countries in
Asia. It reduces domestic demand, raises jobless rates, causes
currency depreciation, cuts investment, pushes up consumer prices,
and decreases imports.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan's export trade in the first seven months of
this year was eight percent lower than a year earlier. Fortunately,
our exports to Europe grew seven percent during the period, and the
exports to the United States and Central America increased one
percent. Our exports to Japan and South Korea reduced 25 percent
during the period, but it was caused by external factors. Exports to
Asia account for 50 percent of Taiwan's total export trade.

    <TEXT>
      <P>I believe the economic performances of Indonesia, Japan, and
mainland China are pivotal in the future stability of the Asian
economy.</P>
      <P>Political instability, drought, and high jobless rates are
hurting the economy of Indonesia, which may affect the pace of
economic recovery in other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Japan's jobless rates have climbed to 4.1 percent, and the
Japanese yen is still weak, after the country's financial policy
failed. The Japanese people's lack of confidence in the economy
was attributable to the Liberal Democratic Party's loss in recent
parliamentarian elections. The new cabinet appears to be unable to
solve the problems of bad loans and weak currency. The government
is now trying to revive the economy by cutting taxes and increasing
public spending.</P>
      <P>The economy and export trade of mainland China are being hurt by
the government control of foreign exchange rates. The control
has greatly reduced the import of many materials and semi-finished
products from Taiwan for processing in mainland China.</P>
      <P>We hope that the Japanese government will enact laws to
revitalize its stock and foreign exchange markets. It will benefit
Japan and other Asian countries, and help stabilize the currency of
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Q: What measures should the government take to maintain Taiwan's
economic development when the impact of the Asian financial crisis
is still lingering?</P>
      <P>A: Our trade surplus has reduced sharply. Its contribution to
our economic growth has dropped below zero. To make up the loss we
have to stimulate the domestic demand. We don't have to cut taxes to
stimulate consumption, because our domestic consumption is quite
normal. What we are going to do is increasing investment. We are
drafting a program to increase public investment by increasing
budgets and facilitate private investment by improving the investment
climate and helping investors overcome their difficulties.</P>
      <P>We plan to add more than NT$100 billion (US$2.9 billion) to our
government budgets in fiscal 1999 and 2000 to expand domestic
demand. We hope that, by doing so, we will also be able to improve
the condition of our economy and make the long-term development of
our economy possible.</P>
      <P>Q: What economic role is Taiwan going to play in Asia?</P>
      <P>A: We have brought forth a program for strengthening our
economic and trade cooperation with Southeast Asian countries. The
main points of this "going south" program is to increase financial
aid to Taiwan investors in these countries, establish holding
companies, and provide job training opportunities to the youths in
these countries. But our aids to these countries are rather little in
comparison with those from Japan.</P>
      <P>Certain business leaders of Taiwan will meet in September for
the establishment of a holding company, hoping that the company will
help revive the economy of Southeast Asian countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN'S ENUNCIATION OF `THREE NOES' UNACCEPTABLE TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of 19 Taiwan legislators met with
leaders of Japan's political parties on Tuesday to express concern
about mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's upcoming visit to
Japan.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with the Taiwan lawmakers, Yoshiro Mori,
secretary-general of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said he
fully understood their concern that the visit may result in an
outcome harmful to Taiwan's interests, and promised to pass the
concern on to the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin-pin, vice president of the Legislative Yuan and leader
of the delegation, said it would be unacceptable to Taiwan if Japan
codifies the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan that US President Bill
Clinton stated in Shanghai in late July.</P>
      <P>Wang said he told Mori that Japan should not succumb to Beijing's
request to exclude Taiwan from the US-Japan defense cooperation
program. Japan should continue to play the key role defending peace
in the Asia-Pacific region, and avoid to play into Beijing's hands to
forge a strategic partner relationship with mainland China, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, members of the supra-party Legislative Yuan
mission also met with leaders of other Japanese political parties for
talks of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>They met with Toshiko Hamayotsu, chief of the opposition Komei
Party, Takenori Kanzaki, chief of the New Party Peace, and Yukio
Hatoyama, acting secretary-general of the Democratic Party, Japan's
largest opposition party, as well as a dozen other members of the
same parties.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan lawmakers were also scheduled to meet members of the
Japan-ROC Dietmen's Council, a supra-party organization in the
Japanese parliament, on Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>Later in the evening, Sadanori Yamanaka, chairman of the
pro-Taiwan body and a former Japanese international trade and
industry minister, was to host a dinner in honor of the Taiwan
legislators.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) on Tuesday gave TransAsia Airways an ultimatum: Resolve its
latest management-pilot dispute by Friday or have its ART turboprop
flight concessions withdrawn.</P>
      <P>CAA officials issued the warning and also urged the carrier's
management to communicate with their pilots over the wage dispute.</P>
      <P>The officials stressed that no dispute can be allowed to
sacrifice the interests of customers.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the airline decided to slash the salaries of
pilots who fly ATR turboprop aircraft by a monthly average of
NT$50,000 (US$1,437) per employee.</P>
      <P>The cuts translate as reductions to NT$120,000 (US$3,448) from
NT$200,000 for pilots, while co-pilots had their pay slashed to
NT$80,000 (US$2,299) from NT$120,000.</P>
      <P>The cuts triggered a mass resignation on Monday night by the
company's 67 ART pilots after negotiations with management broke
down. Airline pilots are not allowed to strike under Taiwan law.</P>
      <P>The resignations forced the carrier to cancel 90 domestic flights
on Tuesday, causing chaos in the island's air traffic. Thousands of
passengers were forced to change their flight plans or endure long
waits at the country's airports.</P>
      <P>TransAsia executives remained firm on the pay cuts, and said the
company will simply hire foreign pilots if the local crews do not
withdraw their resignations.</P>
      <P>The flight suspensions will last at least until Friday, according
to the carrier which operates 18 domestic flights each day.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's weighted price index dropped 94
points to close at 6,814 Wednesday despite a government announcement
Tuesday of a four-point stimulus package aimed at propping up the
plunging stock market.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced that beginning on
Wednesday, four stimulus measures will be taken to help invigorate
the sagging Taiwan stock market which has shed more than 5 percent in
three days.</P>
      <P>Share prices tumbled 3.5 percent on the Taiwan Stock Exchange
Monday and 0.7 percent Tuesday, sending the market barometer below
the psychologically important 7,000-point barrier. This is having a
worrying impact on domestic consumption and economic growth, the
ministry said.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu announced in a news conference late
Tuesday that the percentage of guaranteed money required of
short-sellers -- those who sell "borrowed" stocks in the hope of
buying them back at cheaper prices -- will be raised from the current
70 percent to 90 percent of the stocks' initial prices.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Securities and Futures Commission will require the
board of directors and supervisors of listed and over-the-counter
companies to present affidavits proving that their ownership stakes
are not lower than the minimum government-stipulated levels.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the government will discuss with local securities
brokers and stock dealers why quite a few initial public offerings
and rights offerings this year have fallen below their original
offering prices, and jointly work out countermeasures.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiu said, the MOF will seek to determine why
domestic mutual funds have been selling stocks lately, particularly
Tuesday. Qualified foreign institutional investors and domestic stock
dealers, however, were not buyers Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Ting-wu, president of the China Development Corporation,
welcomed the four stimulus measures, describing them as a move
demonstrating the government's sincerity in helping invigorate the
stock market.</P>
      <P>Hu, however, said the long-term stability of Taiwan's stock
market will hinge on the development of the international financial
markets, particularly the US markets, and fundamentally financial
structures of the domestic listed companies rather than stimulus
packages.</P>

(By Herman Pan and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US agricultural exports to Taiwan and
the rest of Asia fell by an average 30 percent in the first half of
this year largely as a result of the region's financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>The latest US Agricultural Department statistics showed that
US$860 million worth of US agricultural products were shipped to
Taiwan in the first half of 1998, a 34.7 percent decrease from the
previous level of US$1.32 billion registered in the same period of
1997.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was America's fifth-largest agricultural export market,
lagging behind Japan, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea, but ahead of
the Netherlands, Hong Kong, mainland China, Germany, and Britain,
according to the same tallies. Shipments all declined to the top 10
countries with the exception of Mexico and Britain.</P>
      <P>Exports to mainland China dropped by 6.5 percent in value to
US$720 million in the January-June period, while shipments to Hong
Kong fell by 5.8 percent to US$746 million from last year. Export
value to Japan and South Korea dropped by 12.6 percent and 29.6
percent respectively in the first half of the year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, export value to member states of the Association for
Southeast Asian Nations plunged by an average 37.4 percent during the
same six-month period, ranging from a 56.4 percent slide to Indonesia
and a 23.2 percent fall to Thailand.</P>
      <P>According to the US Agricultural Department, America exported
US$26.4 billion worth of agricultural products in the first half of
1998, down 5.9 percent, or US$1.65 billion from last year. It
attributed the fall mainly to the dulling demand from Asian markets
as a result of the financial crisis which broke out about a year ago.</P>

      <P>The Australian stock and foreign exchange
markets remained under strong pressure Wednesday morning as share
prices and the dollar continued their decline.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was
checking prices in the London market Tuesday night as the slide of

      <P>In June, the RBA spent A$2.63 billion (US$1.64 billion) to
support the Australian dollar from falling at a drastic pace.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar was trading at 57.55 US cents in morning
trade, marginally higher than the 57.41 US-cent close on Tuesday.</P>

from Tuesday's close to 2,627.7 following a rise of 25.9 points.</P>
      <P>Analysts said as the markets were becoming more volatile, many

than in the past, leaving investors easily burned.</P>
      <P>A global economic crisis is at the center of concern as Russia is

    <HEADLINE>FLOWER PRICES SOAR AS CHINESE VALENTINE'S DAY APPROACHES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Chinese Valentine's Day nears, domestic
flower prices are soaring, with roses registering the steepest price
hikes, market sources reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chinese Valentine's Day, also known as Chi Hsi festival in
Taiwan, is celebrated on the seventh day of the seventh moon on the
lunar calendar and falls on Friday this year.</P>
      <P>Over the years, marketing and promotional efforts by retailers
have made the exchanging of gifts an increasingly common practice
among young couples.</P>
      <P>Flowers are perhaps the most popular gift item. Depending on the
type of flower and the color, flowers can represent different
messages. Red roses symbolize true love, and yellow roses represent
friendship. Lilies mean gaiety and red tulips are a declaration of
love.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Taipei Flower Marketing Co. show that
floral prices in metropolitan Taipei have picked up by 50 percent to
100 percent in recent days.</P>
      <P>A company spokesman said wholesale prices for locally grown red
and pink roses have surged to between NT$300 (US$8.62) and NT$500
(US$14.37) for 20 stems in the past week, up more than 60 percent
from a month ago.</P>
      <P>Prices for imported red and pink roses are between NT$550 and
NT$600 per 20-stem bouquet on the wholesale market, the spokesman
added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the spokesman said, the hikes in flower prices this
year are generally lower than last year's because of a domestic
economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, exotic purple roses were the most popular
Chinese Valentine's Day flower. A single stem of an imported purple
rose could fetch up to NT$500 in retail markets as the festival
neared.</P>
      <P>However, the spokesman said, the market situation has changed
this year, with a new species of green rose emerging as the
best-selling flower.</P>
      <P>"With unique white-green color shades, green roses have become an
instant hit since it was introduced to the local floral market for
the first time earlier this year," the spokesman said, adding that
wholesale price for a 20-stem bouquet of green roses now stands at
NT$1,500.</P>
      <P>Prices for other flowers have also risen with the advent of Chi
Hsi, the spokesman said. Prices for a 20-stem bouquet of locally
grown lilies jumped to NT$400 or NT$500 recently from about NT$250 a
month ago.</P>
      <P>The Chi Hsi festival is based on the romantic legend of two
star-crossed lovers -- the Cowboy (Altair in Western astronomy) and
the Weaving Maid (Vega).</P>
      <P>According to Chinese folklore, the two became engaged in a
passionate love affair and neglected their duties, upsetting the Jade
Emperor, the ruler of the Heaven and equivalent to the Almighty God.</P>
      <P>As punishment, the Jade Emperor permanently separated the couple
by placing a river between them. The two, however, were allowed to
reunite on Chi Hsi.</P>
      <P>On this particular day, the two would cross a bridge formed by
sympathetic magpies and share their experiences and feelings. Chi Hsi
is said to have been observed as Lover's Day since ancient time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND'S FLOOD TOLL SAID TO BE BIGGEST COVER UP SINCE CHERNOBYL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The death toll in mainland China's worst
flooding in 44 years may be one of the biggest cover ups since the
Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, Western experts said.</P>
      <P>Beijing authorities said the death toll will not exceed 4,200
despite the widespread devastation to homes and land.</P>
      <P>More than a quarter of mainland China's population has been
effected by floods that have ravaged river basins in the north and
south for up to three months. Flood control efforts have ensured that
casualties are kept to a minimum, the head of the China Flood Control
and Drought Relief Headquarters said.</P>
      <P>"There have been some casualties, but given that China has a
population of 1.2 billion and the sheer scale of the floods, the
figure is very, very small," Zhou Wenzhi told a news conference on
Tuesday. He said accurate figures on the dead toll and the cost of
flood damage were extremely difficult to calculate.</P>
      <P>Tens of millions of people are now said to be living on the tops
of dikes in rapidly deteriorating conditions. Chinese officials said
efforts are now being concentrated on ensuring that there is no
outbreak of disease among the homeless. The most serious health
hazards were the common cold, conjunctivitis, diarrhea and dermatitis
from prolonged exposure to water.</P>
      <P>The death toll will be much higher than the official figure, a
journalist was quoted by ABC's correspondent Jane Hutchisen as
saying. J. Becker said mainland Chinese government's attempt to play
down the extent of the damage was the biggest cover up since the
Chernobyl nuclear plant in the former Soviet Union leaked radiation
in 1986.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation from the Republic of China was
in Edmonton, Alberta Monday to attend the 15th Biennial World
Conference of the International Association for Volunteer Effort
(IAVE).</P>
      <P>Delegation leader and Minister of the ROC's National Youth
Commission Lee Jih-chu delivered the conference's first address which
included a message from ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The president said governments may be committed to tackling
crime, drug abuse, pollution and other social problems but they are
constrained by limited resources.</P>
      <P>"This is one area that volunteer organizations and individuals
can play an essential role by helping to secure a better life for the
inhabitants of this world," Minister Lee told the 3,000 delegates
from 87 countries including the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>She said although the ROC began to promote volunteer services
much later than many Western nations, the movement has gathered
momentum in recent years with the support of top government leaders
such as the president, vice president and premier. Now, there are
over 22,000 non-profit, non-government organizations are giving
volunteer service in Taiwan, she added.</P>
      <P>On average, about one-fourth of Taiwan's population has been
involved in volunteer service, and "this proportion is still
increasing," the minister added.</P>
      <P>The 18-member ROC delegation, which includes 14 civilian groups
leaders, is "here to learn and to share the experiences in rendering
volunteer service," she said.</P>
      <P>Lee also took the opportunity to promote Taipei's bid to host a
future world or Asia-Pacific IAVE conference. Hong Kong and India
have also shown an interest in hosting the next regional meeting. A
decision is expected in November.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADB SEEKING CAPITAL FROM AUSTRALIA TO HELP AILING ASIAN NATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Manila-based Asian Development Bank
(ADB) is attempting to raise US$625 million in capital from
Australian investors to help financially-strapped countries in the
region.</P>
      <P>Peter Balon, assistant treasurer of the ADB, recently met fund
managers in Sydney and Melbourne to discuss issuing up to A$1 billion
(US$625 million) in bonds, the proceeds of which would help
Indonesia, South Korea and other Asian countries in need of
assistance.</P>
      <P>Balon told the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday that
Australian representative at the ADB Eric Thorn made the suggestion
that Australia would be interested in supporting the funding.</P>
      <P>Canberra expressed support for the effort as it would boost
Australia's aspirations in becoming a regional financial center and
reconfirm the country's commitment to Asia.</P>
      <P>The ADB needs additional funds to support its involvement in
rescue packages organized by the International Monetary Fund for
Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The ADB ended last year with a funding outcome of almost US$6
billion compared with its target of only US$2.6 billion, which was
proposed before the Asian crisis began.</P>
      <P>"As a result of the fund requirements for this year expanding, we
wanted to expand on our investor universe -- in particular, working
with markets that we hadn't tapped in the past," Balon told the
daily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA, RUSSIA TROUBLES BODE ILL FOR ALL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The crisis situation in Russia and the
looming crisis in mainland China have major implications for the rest
of the world, the Toronto Star said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The major risk from Russia is global recession and deflation
while the risk from mainland China is devaluation, the daily's
economic editor David Crane wrote. Floundering economies in the world
now need to get back onto the growth path again, he added.</P>
      <P>Crane said the situation in Russia is especially alarming. Boris
Yeltsin's decision to bring back former Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin
represents a desperate bid by Yeltsin to cling to power as his
authority crumbles.</P>
      <P>There are also concerns that the new government will hold back
on economic reforms, delay planned steps to force Russian industry
and industrialists to pay the taxes they owe, and flounder with
accelerating inflation and a recession, he warned.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, mainland China's ambitious plans to restructure
money-losing state enterprises and a technically insolvent banking
system are in serious doubt, he said. Mainland China is not generating
the economic growth it needs to absorb the millions of workers who
will lose their jobs through restructuring.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Beijing's hopes of raising capital to finance
restructuring, through the listing of many more Chinese companies on
the Hong Kong stock exchange, have also been dashed by the sharp fall
in the Hong Kong exchange and its lack of interest in new issues,
Crane pointed out.</P>
      <P>While Beijing will not likely devalue its currency this year
unless the situation gets much worse, there are real fears it could
do so next year to strengthen its economy and create more jobs, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`THREE LINKS' ACTIVISTS INDICTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   26  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's public prosecutors-general
stressed on Wednesday that any infringements of the laws governing
the ban on direct links between Taiwan and mainland China will be
punished.</P>
      <P>Lu Ren-fa made the statement in response to Tuesday's indictment
of three lawmakers, who sailed from Taiwan directly to the mainland
Chinese port of Xiamen in Fujian Province without official permission
last Tuesday.</P>
      <P>National Assembly Deputy Tsao Yuan-chang, Taipei County Councilor
Kin Chien-shou and Jungho City township councilor Huang Hsi-lin, as
well as the skipper of the "Hawaii No.3" and his wife, two reporters,
and four activists advocating Taiwan sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais, a
disputed island group in East China Sea, were on Tuesday indicted for
violating the National Security Law and the Statute Governing the
Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment handed down by the Kinmen District
Prosecutor's Office, all 11, along with seven mainland Chinese
crewmen, allegedly planned to make a direct cross-strait voyage on
Aug. 18.</P>
      <P>The group, headed jointly by Tsao and Kin, had informed the media
in advance of their impending arrival from Xiamen on
Taiwan-controlled Kinmen Island on Aug. 20, and told waiting
reporters of their "mini three links" idea, the indictment said.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" calls for direct shipping, trade and
postal links between Kinmen and mainland China. Although the island
group is controlled by the ROC, it lies only two kilometers from the
mainland coast at its nearest point.</P>
      <P>Lu cited current laws which state that ships, aircraft, and other
transportation devices of the Republic of China should not navigate
to mainland China without official permission.</P>
      <P>Offenders risk a maximum three-year jail term, or fines of up to
NT$15 million (US$431,000), Lu warned.</P>
      <P>He especially rebuked the accused who serve in public positions
for allegedly setting themselves up as pioneers to defy the nation's
laws, stressing that justice will prevail and that convicted
offenders will be severely punished.</P>
      <P>However, Tsao defended the group's actions, saying they had never
planned to sail to the mainland, but were bound for the Tiaoyutais.
The ship was only forced to head toward Xiamen because of heavy fog,
Tsao said, adding that their advocacy of "mini direct links" with
mainland China was made on the spur of the moment.</P>
      <P>Kin, the skipper, and the "Defend the Tiaoyutais" activists
claimed that they had planned to sail to the disputed Japanese
islands to declare Taiwan sovereignty over them, but changed course
after being informed of a possible Japanese blockade.</P>
      <P>Their vessel subsequently suffered engine failure, prompting them
to seek assistance in Xiamen, Kin said.</P>
      <P>The two accused journalists concurred with this defense, saying
they were dispatched to report on the group's Tiaoyutais activity.
They claimed to be unaware of any plans to make the "taboo-breaking"
voyage, according to the Kinmen Prosecutor's Office.</P>
      <P>Kin had declared upon arrival on Kinmen that the voyage was aimed
at promoting the "mini three links" as a first step toward "three
direct links" between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>He explained that similar sailings have been going on
unofficially for years, saying it is no secret that Taiwan fishing
vessels often make direct crossings to mainland territory in order to
save costs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has prohibited direct shipping, commerce and communication
with mainland China for nearly 50 years since the two sides split
following the civil war.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC RED CROSS TO DONATE GOODS TO M'LAND FLOOD VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China said on Wednesday it will donate NT$20 million (US$574,713)
worth of goods to help relieve flood victims in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang Sung-mao, secretary-general of the Red Cross Society, said
the society has received NT$6 million in cash donations from local
residents as of the end of July for helping flood victims along the
Yangtze River.</P>
      <P>"We'll use the money to purchase rice, pharmaceuticals, quilts
and other daily necessities and medical supplies to help mainland
flood victims," Chang said, adding that the first shipment of relief
goods is scheduled to arrive in mainland China in early September.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ROC Red Cross Society will ask its mainland
counterpart to help dispatch relief products to various
flood-stricken provinces.</P>
      <P>Chang said the society will continue to woo local trade and
industry associations to donate money or goods to help mainland
flood victims on humanitarian grounds.</P>
      <P>Heavier than usual rains have caused successive waves of
flooding in many central and southeastern mainland provinces along
the Yangtze River as well as northeastern provinces along the
Songhua and Nenjiang rivers this summer that have killed more than
4,000 people and left millions homeless. Mainland China's state
media said recently that damage from the floods will surpass US$24
billion.</P>
      <P>The floods, which have affected 240 million mainland Chinese,
nearly a fifth of the country's population, could shave half a
percentage point off mainland China's economic growth this year,
Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency reported earlier this
month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve mainland Chinese poachers were
nabbed on a beach on the frontline island stronghold of Kinmen on
Wednesday, in a pre-dawn action by a joint police and military task
force.</P>
      <P>The "Sea Quell" task force, formed jointly by the military, the
military police, and the police, was established recently in response
to increasing concern by Kinmen residents who have been complaining
that mainland fishermen are raiding their offshore farms during the
night to steal shellfish.</P>
      <P>A police spokesman said the mainlanders, seven of them women,
will be investigated to find out whether they had any additional
motives for landing on ROC soil.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's operation was the first carried out by the new task
force.</P>
      <P>The arrested mainlanders all claimed to come from the fishing
village of Oucu, which is near the port of Xiamen in Fujian Province.
They said they were brought in two boats to Kinmen, where they were
supposed to collect shellfish at low tide and wait to be picked up
again at high tide.</P>
      <P>The poachers were later taken to Taiwan for further questioning.
They are expected to remain at a detention center for illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants before being repatriated, Kinmen police
authorities said.</P>

      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu said on
Wednesday he will ask the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to
investigate why stock prices have fallen despite a stimulus package
announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Buoyed by the new package, stock prices rallied when trading
began at 9 a.m. on the local bourse, but lost steam after 11:15 a.m.
The bourse ended up losing 95 points, to close at 6,814.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that the SFC will discuss the reasons for the
end-of-session fall with stockbrokers.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that among the Asian stock markets, only Japan and
Hong Kong were lackluster, he urged investors to have confidence in
Taiwan's sound economic fundamentals and financial structure.</P>
      <P>The four-point stimulus package announced by Chiu on Tuesday
comprised:</P>
      <P>-- a percentage increase from 70 percent to 90 percent of initial
stock prices for guarantee money required of short-sellers -- those

stock dealers why quite a few initial public offerings and rights
offerings this year have fallen below their original offering prices,

      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister
Jason Hu said on Tuesday that Taipei will enhance economic
cooperation with friendly Central American nations to help their
economic growth.</P>
      <P>Hu, who was visiting El Salvador to discuss cooperative
ventures with five central American diplomatic partners, made the
remark in an address at a seminar on how to share Taiwan's experience
in economic development with its Central American allies--El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>The nations of Central America, geographically located as a
springboard into South and North America, are endowed with cheap
labor, and well-suited to the development of agricultural, fishery,
and tourism resources, Hu said, adding that Taipei is willing to
provide whatever aid is necessary to assist their economic
development.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said he will suggest the creation of an
investment environment which can attract foreign capital, strengthen
export competitiveness, and boost tourism resources to attract
visitors from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taipei's assistance will be based around investment
in agricultural and fishery cooperation, and disclosed that Taipei
has sent a total of 77 agriculture, fishery, and handicraft
technicians, to provide assistance in Central America.</P>
      <P>He also revealed that the ROC government will set a 12-year
budget for the formation of a foundation for economic cooperation

      <P>In order to assist the development of the small- and medium-sized

consultation services, and that volunteer workers have also been sent
to Costa Rica, Honduras, and El Salvador, while discussions are under
way to send volunteers to Nicaragua and Guatemala.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE OF TAIWAN UNWILLING TO UNITE WITH MAINLAND CHINA: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung said on Wednesday that Taiwan should make clear to
mainland China when negotiators from both sides meet this fall that
the people here do not want reunification.</P>
      <P>Lin proposed that Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo
Chen-fu make a statement in this vein to his mainland Chinese
counterpart Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), when they meet in Beijing later
this year.</P>
      <P>Responding to mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent
remarks that "the question of unification with Taiwan should not
remain unsettled for too long," Lin stressed that unification will
take place only when the majority of Taiwan's people agree to the
idea. Beijing's leaders should therefore have second thoughts about
their unification policy, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the chairman of the pro-independence opposition
party, maintaining the status quo means that Taiwan will remain
separate from Beijing's rule, and as far as the DPP is concerned,
this means continuing moving toward its goal of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Secretary-General Chiu Yi-yen told reporters that
Beijing's top priority at the moment is fighting the flooding which
has devastated a large part of mainland China's northeastern and
northern regions.
 "Imminent unification with mainland China is impractical," Chiu
said, "because pressure for Taiwan to unite with the mainland is
coming at the moment from the international community rather than
from Beijing. A tough line from Beijing will not bring any new
pressure to bear on Taiwan," he noted.</P>
      <P>In the face of the upcoming second Koo-Wang meeting, Chiu said
that Koo, Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, should relay the
will of the Taiwan people to Wang, and tell the mainland bluntly that
Taiwan is unwilling to unite with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Chinese communists should discuss the issue sincerely and
openly with Taiwan if Beijing wishes to achieve its goal of
unification, he pointed out, adding that schemes to undermine Taiwan
will lead nowhere. "Resort to use of force will be an even worse
method of obtaining such a goal," he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) on
Wednesday reminded local travelers returning from Southeast Asia that
they must submit a health declaration upon re-entry to facilitate
control of the spread of contagious diseases.</P>
      <P>Wu Tsung-neng, director of the National Quarantine Service under

aboard direct flights from Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar, to fill out the health
declaration forms.</P>
      <P>"We have adopted the measure amid reports that an epidemic of
dengue fever is raging in Southeast Asia," Wu said, adding that 59
cases of foreign-originating dengue fever infections have been
reported in Taiwan so far this summer.</P>
      <P>Wu said all 59 cases originated in Southeast Asia, and that many
of them were tracked and confirmed with information provided in the

      <P>In one instance, health authorities earlier this month managed to
track three members of a single Kaohsiung family through information

      <P>"The family of three returned from Thailand on Aug. 11. They
reported in their health declarations that they had developed
symptoms of vomiting, fever and skin rashes before boarding their
return flight," Wu said. "Follow-up physical checkups confirmed that
all three had been infected with dengue fever."</P>
      <P>He added that the new regulation had also allowed the DOH's
National Institute of Preventive Medicine to detect a case of a
Taipei resident who became infected with diarrhea during a trip to
Thailand.</P>
      <P>Wu also cautioned that epidemics of contagious
gastroenterological diseases such as cholera and diarrhea are likely

      <P>A total of US$1.9 billion worth of
investments in Taiwan by foreigners and overseas Chinese was approved
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs during the first seven months of
this year, according to statistics released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>That figure represents a drop of US$690 million, or 26.85
percent, from the corresponding period one year earlier, although the

of the total value of approved investments.</P>

      <P>--The Central American nations, with political stability and open
market policies, have created favorable climates for attracting
foreign investment, trade and tourism development;</P>
      <P>--The possibility of agricultural, industrial and fishery
development within the region is likely to attract foreign investment

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai
said on Wednesday that he is looking for overseas agents to promote
Kinmen Kaoliang (sorghum) liquor worldwide.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is also chairman of Kinmen Distillery Co., noted that
the sale of Kinmen Kaoliang now accounts for 40 percent of the
county's annual revenue.</P>
      <P>He said that the distillery will award agent rights to such
regions as mainland China, Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe,
and North and South America.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's President Group was awarded the right to serve as Kinmen
Kaoliang's domestic agent for a period of two years, starting this
month.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen County-owned distillery currently produces 10 million
kilograms of sorghum liquor each year. In anticipation of Kinmen
Kaoliang making inroads into liquor markets throughout the world,
Chen is seeking partners to produce sorghum liquor especially for
export.</P>
      <P>The company's partners, Chen said, will handle the financing and
marketing aspects of the production operations, while the Kinmen
Distillery will provide its brand name, factory and expertise.</P>
      <P>Just as tobacco and wine producers have had to sell their
products worldwide to achieve sustained profits, Kinmen Distillery
must sell its product worldwide to bring more money into the county's
coffers, Chen said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first telecommunications satellite
was launched into orbit on Wednesday, prompting Chunghwa Telecom
President Lu Hsue-chin to break out the champagne to celebrate a new
era in Taiwan's telecommunications development.</P>
      <P>At a broadcast center stationed at a Chunghwa Telecom building in
Taipei, Lu and James Youdale, vice chairman of France's Arianespace,
the company responsible for carrying the ST-1 satellite into space,
watched the launch from a television screen.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom said the first trial of the new satellite will
take place in two months. If all goes well, the satellite will be
used to provide advanced telecommunications services and to deliver
improved communications between Taiwan and its offshore islands and
between Taiwan and the rest of the world, company executives said.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom and Singapore Telecom jointly spent a total of
US$240 million to build the ST-1 in 1995, with each party enjoying a
50 percent stake in the joint-venture.</P>
      <P>Equipped with 15 Ku-band and 14 C-band transponders, the ST-1,
designed and build by Matra Marconi Space, covers an area extending
from the Middle East to the Far East from its orbital position 36,000
kilometers above the Earth.</P>
      <P>Besides the construction of the satellite, the investment project
also entailed the construction of two ground control centers, one
each installed at Chutzihu in suburban Taipei and in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom has also set up facilities in Panchao, Taichung,
Kaohsiung and Fengshan to receive signals from the satellite,
according to the company.</P>
      <P>The ST-1 was carried into orbit by an Ariane 44P from Kourou,
French Guiana, at 7:07 a.m. Wednesday local time. It is regarded as
one of the most powerful telecom satellites orbiting over Asia.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Chen Yiao told CNA in Guiana that with

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMICS MINISTER OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ECONOMY (PART I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang
said that Taiwan's economy is very likely to begin to recover by the
end of next year, and that it is the proper time to stimulate
domestic demand and increase private investment now in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a recent interview with the CNA, Wang said he is optimistic
about Taiwan's economy because its economic fundamentals are good. He
predicted that private investment in Taiwan will grow 16 percent this
year, as compared to the 15.6 percent growth registered in 1997.</P>
      <P>The following is the transcript of the interview:</P>
      <P>Q: Taiwan is doing pretty well amid the current Asian financial
crisis. Why is Taiwan better able to weather the financial storm than
most other countries in Asia? How are we going to maintain our
economic development?</P>
      <P>A: Let us start from an analysis of our own qualities and the
outside environment.</P>
      <P>Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asian countries are in deep
financial crisis, mainly because their banking systems are suffering
from huge amounts of bad loans. Speculative land investments made by
Japanese enterprises in Japan and Southeast Asian countries have
further aggravated the situation.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, Taiwan's financial system is pretty healthy,
and the economic fundamentals are good. Last year, our economy grew
6.8 percent, private investment increased 15.6 percent, and industrial
production index rose 8 percent, while the inflation and jobless
rates were as low as 0.9 percent and 2.7 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Currently, we have about US$80 billion in foreign exchange
reserves, and our foreign debt is rather low. The foreign debts of
many neighboring countries have exceeded US$150 billion, which may
bring them a bad headache during a financial crisis.</P>
      <P>In addition, our small and medium enterprises are more active
and more competitive than those of many other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Q: You just mentioned the quality of Taiwan's small and medium
enterprises, which became obvious during the Asian financial crisis.
But they are now complaining about slow business and shortage in
funds. How is the Ministry of Economic Affairs going to help them?</P>
      <P>A: It is undeniable that the small and medium enterprises are
facing difficulties during the economic slowdown. Most of them are in
traditional business. Their ability to compete in the world market
tends to go down, when labor and land are getting more and more
expensive in Taiwan because of continuous economic growth. Under
these circumstances, they have only two ways to go. One is to move
their production lines to mainland China or Southeast Asian
countries, where labor and land are cheaper. The other way is to
upgrade their business to produce high value-added products.</P>
      <P>It takes money to go either way. The government has been
trying to help them get enough funds. For example, the Executive
Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and certain state-run
enterprises have set up special funds to help qualified applicants
upgrade their business or finance their research and development
programs. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ECONOMY (PART II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: The Ministry of Economic Affairs has attached great importance
to private investment projects of over NT$200 million. But the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has decided to
suspend its aid program for such investments. How is your ministry
going to finance such investments?</P>
      <P>A: This is a complicated issue. It involves several government
agencies. I am not in a position to make a comment now.</P>
      <P>Q: Does the Ministry of Economic Affairs have plans to tackle the
problems Taiwan businesses may face, if the renminbi is devalued ? As
you know, Beijing is under increasing pressure to devalue its
currency, because the Japanese economy is still in recession, and the
floods in central and northeast China have caused great financial
losses. The devaluation of the renminbi may cause a new round of
currency devaluations in Asia.</P>
      <P>A: Taiwan is not immune to any international financial crisis. The
devaluation of Asian currencies in the second half of last year has
caused the devaluation of Taiwan's currency and the sharp reduction
of its export trade.</P>
      <P>The devaluation of the Japanese yen and the financial loss
caused by the floods have put more and more pressure on Beijing to
devaluate its currency. In addition, the adjustment of its
currency value is subject to political intervention, because mainland
China is not a fully free economy. Therefore, the value of the
renminbi is relatively hard to predict. Taiwan businessmen have to
take precautionary measures against the possible devaluation of the
mainland Chinese currency.</P>
      <P>Q: The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and
Statistics of the Executive Yuan has revised down this year's
economic growth to 5.3 percent, a sharp decline from last year's 6.8
percent. Export trade declined substantially in the first half of
this year. Can you share with us your view on the economic recovery
in Asia and Taiwan, and on how to maintain Taiwan's economic growth?</P>
      <P>A: The Wharton Economic Forecasting Association (WEFA) of the
United States has predicted that Taiwan's economy will grow 5.2
percent this year. The two estimates are pretty close.</P>
      <P>The WEFA also forecast that the economy will grow 0.6 percent in
Japan and 1.2 percent in Singapore this year, while the growth rate
of Indonesia will be minus 13 percent. Almost all economies in
Asia are in recession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 5.3-percent growth is not bad, if compared to those of
other countries in the world.</P>
      <P>The Asian economy is unlikely to recover in the short term. The
demand for Taiwan products in the Asian market has declined,
defeating our trade promotion efforts. It is the proper time to
depend on our domestic market for growth.</P>
      <P>What we can do to stimulate domestic demand is to increase public
construction projects and facilitate private investments. The CEPD
and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are carrying out programs for
this purpose. It is estimated that the total amount of private
investments will increase 16 percent this year.</P>
      <P>I am optimistic about Taiwan's economy, which is very likely to
recover in late 1999 or early 2000. We should stimulate domestic
demand and increase investment at a time when the economy is in deep
recession. If we do so, we shall be able to meet the increasing
demands of foreign markets when the economy recovers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The financial crisis in Russia is
expected to have only a limited impact on the Republic of China because
of the relatively small amount of two-way trade between the two
countries, the Central Bank of China (CBC) predicted on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Russian President Boris Yeltsin has tried but failed to end the
crisis, in which the Russian ruble suffered its worst fall in nearly
four years on Tuesday, after Russia's government and central bank
devalued the ruble Aug. 17.</P>
      <P>A ranking official with the CBC's Economic Research Department
pointed out that the largest impact will be felt by European
countries, especially Germany, which has lent a lot of money to Russia.</P>
      <P>If the financial crisis continues to worsen, the official said,
the German mark will be the first to bear the brunt. Whether Russia's
crisis will prove contagious and infect all of Europe has been the
subject of much attention.</P>
      <P>But the official still foresees limited local effects from the
crisis, as two-way trade between Russia and the Republic of China is
limited, while no financial institutions in either country has branch
offices in the other.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Taiwan exported US$141.20 million worth of goods to
Russia while it imported US$1.63 billion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the ruble's continued slump, Taiwan
businessmen in Russia have become more cautious in their operations,
the semi-official China External Trade Development Council (CETRA)
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials noted that the ruble closed at 7.86 to the US
dollar Tuesday and that over the past 10 days the ruble has fallen
nearly 26 percent in value against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Whereas 55 percent of all consumer goods on the Russian market
were imported previously, the sharp depreciation of the ruble has
reduced by half that percentage.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials said that presently there are more than 20 Taiwan
businesses in Russia, selling such products as computers, shoes,
textiles and lamps.</P>
      <P>To avoid losses from the sharp fluctuations of the ruble, most
Taiwan businesses have adopted conservative and cautious attitudes,
they said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they are closely watching the
depreciation of ruble as it could destabilize the Deutche mark and

    <HEADLINE>BOFT CHIEF DENIES THREE LINKS ARE STEPPING STONES TO WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan on Wednesday denied news reports
that it would allow direct cross-strait trade, postal and
transportation links in return for being allowed to enter the World
Trade Organization (WTO) before mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We have never heard such a thing, nor have we discussed it
internally," said Lin Yi-fu, director-general of the Board of Foreign
Trade.</P>
      <P>Reports said that in order to "soften Beijing's stance" that it
be admitted into the WTO before Taiwan, Taiwan's economics and trade
authorities are considering the establishment of the three links in
exchange for Taiwan being allowed into the world trade body first.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has eagerly sought to establish the links,
Taipei has consistently rejected the proposal, citing national
security concerns.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which applied to join the world trade regulatory body in
1990 under the name "Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and
Matsu," has completed negotiations with all of the 26 WTO contracting
bodies that sought bilateral negotiations with the island and has
signed formal entry agreements with 23 of them.</P>
      <P>Of the three WTO members with which Taiwan has yet to sign an
agreement, the European Union is expected to sign a pact in
September, and Hong Kong has said that it would not be the last to
sign an agreement.</P>
      <P>A final agreement with the last remaining party, Canada, seems
unlikely at the moment because of its request that Taiwan opens its
door to Canada's exports of pork bellies, chicken meat and offal.</P>
      <P>Although Taipei has led Beijing in the race for WTO membership,
Beijing has long demanded -- with the support of many WTO members --
that it be admitted first.</P>

      <P>The latest round of negotiations between
TransAsia Airways and representatives of the local air carrier's 67
pilots who resigned earlier this week ended Wednesday night without
yielding any results, one of the participants said.</P>
      <P>Lee Chung-chien, chairman of the Pilots Association of the
Republic of China, said that both sides have reached a consensus in
the talks, but he refused to disclose the nature of the consensus.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, TransAsia reiterated its stance that the
Friday deadline for the 67 pilots who fly ATR turboprop planes to
back down and report for work will not be extended.</P>
      <P>Carrier spokesman Ho Chih-hwai, however, admitted for the first
time that both the airline's management and the 67 pilots who
resigned on Monday in protest against substantial pay cuts should be
blamed for the incident.</P>
      <P>Defending the pay cuts, which amount to a monthly average of
NT$50,000 (US$1,437) per pilot, Ho said that what the airline has
done is to "adjust the pay structure" of the pilots, not slash their
pay.</P>
      <P>Ho said that if the 67 pilots are willing to return to their
posts by Friday, their behavior during the past several days would be
forgiven. But two of the pilots -- Chen Pei-Chung and Wang Dao-lung,
who have represented the disgruntled pilots on many occasions -- were
suspended by the airline on Tuesday on the grounds that what they
have said and done have damaged TransAsia's image. Ho said that if
Chen and Wang wish to return to the airline, they must first undergo
an investigation.</P>
      <P>The resignation of 67 out of the carrier's 72 ATR pilots have
forced the airline to leave almost all 13 of its ATR turboprop planes
in their hangars, which means a total of 90 flights have been
canceled per day since Tuesday.</P>
      <P>TransAsia Airways, founded in 1951, currently has 13 ATR 72-210A
and ATR 42-200 turboprop planes, as well as 12 A321-131 and A320-231
jet planes. The carrier operates 18 domestic routes, in addition to

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTMENT AFFECTED BY RUBLE MELTDOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businesses in Russia have become
more cautious as the depreciating ruble tumbles at an alarming rate,
sources from the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's computer giant Acer Inc. and about 20 other Taiwan
corporations which maintain investments in Russia have already felt
the impact of the country's economic meltdown triggered by unstable
politics and questionable financial policies, said CETRA
Secretary-General Ricky Kao.</P>
      <P>Russia's troubled economy plunged to new lows as the currency
shed 10 percent of its value over the last few days to 7.85 rubles to
the US dollar. The battered currency has depreciated 26 percent
against greenback in 10 days.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials stationed in Moscow said with the ruble's
continued slump, market shares of imported commodities are expected
to shrink by half from the current level of 55 percent to about 25
percent, dealing a heavy blow to foreign investments and suppliers.
Those products expected to be mostly effected include foodstuffs,
footwear, television sets, refrigerators, automobiles, washing
machines and costume ornaments.</P>
      <P>Prices of personal computers and peripherals have skyrocketed and
some dealers have stopped offering quotations. Footwear dealers have
resorted to buying up US dollars for fear that they would suffer even
greater losses when the ruble drops further.</P>
      <P>The European Union is particularly concerned about the sinking
ruble as the deutsche mark has soared 69 percent to 7.6 rubles in
frantic trading in Moscow. Germany is the biggest creditor nation of
Russia with debts totaling US$60 billion, Kao said.</P>

      <P>The condition of one of the eight Taiwan
tourists injured in a car accident in mainland China is unstable and
critical, sources from Jiayuguan, a township along the ancient "Silk
Road," said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Mei-fang sustained several broken ribs and a ruptured lung
after a van transporting 14 Taiwan tourists was hit head on by a
truck on a highway near Qingchuan, about 50 kilometers from
Jiayuguan, Gansu Province, at around 4:40 p.m. last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Six Taiwan tourists -- five men and one woman-- as well as the

      <P>The US Pruco Life Insurance Company, which maintains an overseas

    <HEADLINE>MOFA WELCOMES CLINTON'S SUPPORT IN INTERNATIONAL ARENA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu and Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
on Thursday expressed its warm welcome to US President Bill Clinton's
reaffirmation of Washington's commitment to the Republic of China on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MOFA was responding to a recent Clinton letter to US Senator
Robert G. Torricelli (D-NJ) in which the president said the United
States will support Taiwan's membership in international
organizations that do not require statehood and will also find
appropriate ways for Taiwan's voice to be heard in those that do.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said the ministry was delighted to see
Clinton reaffirm that there were no changes in US policy toward
Taiwan in a clear, definite and steadfast manner after his June
25-July 3 state visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We welcome and appreciate Clinton's firm support for our
national cause," Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that some pro-Taiwan US lawmakers either jointly
or individually wrote to Clinton prior to his mainland visit asking
the president not to do anything that might undermine the ROC's
national interests.</P>
      <P>"After his return from the mainland, Clinton has written to all
those congressional members, assuring them that his administration
has done nothing unfavorable to Taiwan in its high-level engagement
with mainland China," Wu said</P>
      <P>He added that Clinton also assured those American lawmakers that
there will be no change in US policy toward Taiwan following his
mainland visit and that the US will continue to provide Taiwan with
sufficient defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act.</P>
      <P>"I will continue to develop our strong unofficial relations with
Taiwan and to assure Taiwan is provided the defensive weapons
necessary for it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability,"
Clinton said, adding that his administration was pleased to support
the Senate Resolution passed in June reaffirming US commitment to the
Taiwan Relations Act and calling on Beijing to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Clinton also told Torricelli that he made clear in his June 27
meeting with President Jiang Zemin of "our insistence that
differences between the PRC and Taiwan be resolved peacefully. That
was the message I conveyed as well when I ordered deployment of two
carrier battle groups to the waters near Taiwan in March 1996."</P>
      <P>"We strongly support cross-strait dialogue, but we do not intend
to mediate, prescribe the agenda, nor pressure Taiwan to negotiate
(with the PRC)," Clinton wrote in the letter dated Aug. 18.</P>
      <P>The history of the past quarter century provides evidence that
Taiwan has fared best when US relations with the PRC are on an even
keel and that Taiwan suffers when tensions in US-PRC relations rise.
"This paradoxical but clear relationship convinces me that
improvement in US-PRC relations over the last several years will
strengthen Taiwan's interests and security," wrote Clinton.</P>
      <P>Clinton further said he is pleased that Taiwan and mainland China
have moved closer toward resumption of a formal cross-strait dialogue
since his June visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>"I believe that this, along with continuing US support within the
framework I have outlined above, will best guarantee the future
security, prosperity and freedom of Taiwan," the letter concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION SATISFIED WITH JAPAN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The four-day visit by 19 Taiwan legislators
to Japan has helped to advance relations between Japan and the
Republic of China, said Wang Jin-pyng, vice president of the
Legislative Yuan and head of the visiting delegation, at a press
conference in Tokyo Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang said all the Japanese politicians and academic heavyweights
they have met have expressed support for Taiwan and Taiwan's
interests. Meanwhile, the knowledge and experience gained by the
delegation during their visit can be used to safeguard ROC national
interests, he noted.</P>
      <P>Defining ROC interests, Jao Ying-chi, executive director of the
Policy Coordination Committee of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang, said
Taiwan is an independent sovereignty that practices democracy. This
fact should be respected by the international community, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing continues to try to deny the fact and to
threaten to use force against the island, Jao said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has called for disputes between the two sides to be
resolved in a peaceful manner, Jao said.</P>
      <P>Democratic countries around the world should not allow Taiwan to
be isolated from the international community, Jao said, because his
country needs a place in the community to contribute itself.</P>
      <P>The delegation's visit was to call on Japan's leaders to respect
the interests and rights of the Taiwan people and to collaborate with
Taiwan to promote the Asia-Pacific prosperity.</P>
      <P>They also declared the Republic of China will never accept
Japan's codification of the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan voiced
by US President Bill Clinton during his mainland China visit last
July, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The legislative leader added that he has also urged Japan not to
succumb to Beijing's request to exclude Taiwan from the US-Japanese
defense cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with the secretary-general of Japan's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, Yoshiro Mori, Wang also said Japan should
not play into Beijing's hands and forge a strategic partnership with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers arrived in Japan on Monday and will return home
Thursday, except for Jao and a few others, who will travel to Bangkok
for a conference of the World Freedom and Democracy Alliance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR HITS 12-YEAR LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian dollar plunged to 56.1 US
cents at one point on Thursday, the lowest level since July 1986 when
it was traded at 57.1 US cents.</P>
      <P>The dramatic fall of the Australian dollar was attributed to the
free fall of the ruble after Russia's central bank gave up its
support of the currency.</P>
      <P>The ruble has lost over 40 percent of its value against the US
dollar in the last few months, and the Russian economy risks
collapsing further if nothing is done to stop the depreciating
currency, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Problems with the ruble follow the Asian economic crisis which
shows signs of deepening while Latin America and Eastern Europe are
now seen as the next victims of this global economic slowdown, they
added.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar closed at 57.32 US cents on Wednesday, down
0.68 US cents from Tuesday's close.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the foreign exchange market was in a panic as
investors dashed to unload the Australian dollar to cut their losses.</P>
      <P>They said despite the panic sentiment, the Australian dollar was
not in a free fall like the ruble. But the fall in the value of the
Australian currency, affected by falling international commodity
prices, is accelerating.</P>
      <P>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has not recently intervened
in the foreign exchange market, but it continues to monitor the
situation. In June the RBA spent A$2.63 billion (US$1.64 billion) to
prop up the Australian currency.</P>
      <P>"I expect the RBA will intervene if the Australian dollar is
heading toward a free fall in coming days or weeks," one analyst
said.</P>
      <P>If the current situation continues unabated, the Australian
dollar could fall to 55 US cents then fall further to 50 US cents in
coming weeks, analysts said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS CUTTING AUSTRALIAN INCOME, JOBS: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The effects of the Asian economic crisis
on Australia may continue for over a decade, economic experts said.</P>
      <P>Australia's national income is expected to drop by US$3.1 billion
or almost 1 percent, living standards will likely fall by about A$13
billion (US$8.13 billion) and unemployment will increase by about 0.3
percent, they said. Some analysts have not ruled out the possibility
of an economic recession in Australia.</P>
      <P>Five of Australia's leading economic modellers spent the last six
months examining the impact of the Asian crisis on the domestic
economy and found that the crisis would cut Australia's economic
growth by about 1 percent over the coming year.</P>
      <P>Peter Downes, a senior treasury official, said growth in gross
domestic product could fall by up to one percent as a result of a
short-term slump in Australia's exports in the first 12-24 months of
the Asian crisis. The loss of national income was equivalent to A$5
billion (US$3.1 billion).</P>
      <P>Chris Murphy, a former senior treasury official, said the main
cost to Australia would most likely be to income and not production.
Private consumption in Australia could drop by around 2.5 percent due
to the Asian crisis.</P>
      <P>The model of the Canberra-based Access Economics (AE) suggests
that Asia will be a big problem for the Australian economy in 1999.</P>
      <P>"The bottom line is that Asia will drag Australian growth down
below trend in the second half of 1998 and for much of 1999," AE
director Chris Richardson said. "The upshot is a loss to Australian
national income of around 1.2 percent in the year prior to the
Olympics, the equivalent of A$8 billion."</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders from a few Australian businesses,
trade unions, churches, and welfare groups recently showed their
support for immigrants.</P>
      <P>A joint statement was issued by the Australian Council of Social
Services, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Business
Council of Australia and religious leaders. It called for a renewed
commitment to a "tolerant, open, generous-hearted Australian
society."</P>
      <P>Former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who several months ago tried but
failed to issue a similar statement signed by four prime ministers,
was behind the initiative.</P>
      <P>The statement, issued on Wednesday, said more than four out of 10
Australians were postwar immigrants or the children of immigrants --
with more than half coming from non-English speaking backgrounds. It
also said immigration has enriched Australia's society and fortified
the national economy.</P>
      <P>"The statements, attitudes and policies of the One Nation Party,
including their opposition to an enhanced national immigration
program, simply do not recognize the demographic, social or economic
realities of our nation," the joint statement said.</P>
      <P>"They threaten Australian jobs by undercutting the growth that
flows from an open economy. They threaten both our internal cohesion
and our international reputation. They should be decisively
repudiated by all Australians," it added.</P>
      <P>The statement said Asia would remain fundamentally important to
the future economic welfare of Australians and that the signatories
believed they had the right and the responsibility to "express deep
concern at what is happening to Australia at the present time."</P>
      <P>David Oldfield, principal adviser to One Nation leader Pauline
Hanson, told reporters that the joint statement was "nothing more
than a political attack" and that its signatories were clearly
supporting multiculturalism and globalization.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's marriage rate has registered
a 100-year record low, and close to one in every two people will
never marry, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).</P>
      <P>ABS figures indicate an estimated 44 percent of men and 42
percent of women in Australia will never marry compared to 25 percent
and 26 percent respectively in 1977.</P>
      <P>The survey figures indicate that Australians have given up hope
of finding a committed, satisfying lifetime relationship, Australian
Family Association President Susan Bastick told the Sydney Morning
Herald.</P>
      <P>However, the number of Australians living in de facto
relationships jumped to 744,000 compared to 584,000 in 1991. About a
third of those in de facto relationships had previously been married.</P>
      <P>Bastick said there was more social support for people divorcing
than for those trying to work out their differences. Another reason
for the decline in marriages was because many people see others
divorcing and they do not want to put themselves in a position where
that would happen to them.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's overall domestic wholesale
trade index during the second quarter of this year was down 10.5
percent from its year-earlier level, the Singapore Department of
Statistics (DOS) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Excluding petroleum, the index fell 10.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Compared with the second quarter of last year, the overall
foreign wholesale trade index fell by 13.5 percent in the second
quarter.</P>
      <P>Excluding petroleum, the index slipped 13.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The sharp decline in the index was partly attributed to the 31.1
percent fall in the wholesaling of textiles, apparel and personal
effects, DOS said.</P>
      <P>Dealers trading in timber, paints and construction materials
continued to earn less during this year's second quarter with sales
down 21.4 percent compared with one year ago.</P>
      <P>Likewise, the wholesale turnover of electronic and electrical
components and industrial machinery fell 20 percent, while that of
petroleum and petroleum products was down 9 percent.</P>
      <P>General wholesale traders, however, reported a rise of 37.8
percent in earnings during the second quarter of this year, DOS said.</P>
      <P>As to foreign wholesale trade, DOS indicated that sales of food,
beverages and tobacco grew 25.4 percent, while all other wholesale
activities reported slower business. Hardest hit was the wholesaling
of timber, paints and construction materials, in which turnover
tumbled 44.8 percent.</P>
      <P>This was followed by the wholesale trade of textiles, apparel and
personal effects, down 31 percent, and office equipment, computers

    <HEADLINE>`KINGDOM OF BUTTERFLIES' LOSING ITS SUBJECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is losing its renown as the natural
habitat of a huge variety of butterflies, an environmental activist
warned on Thursday, blaming the situation on a combination of
factors.</P>
      <P>Chen Wei-shou, president of the Taiwan Butterfly Protection
Association, said the number of butterflies and the variety of
species to be found in Taiwan's most precious butterfly habitat --
the area around the southern Taiwan mountain township of Meinung --
have declined dramatically in recent years.</P>
      <P>Meinung Butterfly Valley in Kaohsiung County was discovered by
scientists to be home to numerous species of colorful butterflies
early this century, when Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule. The
valley entered the international limelight more than 10 years ago,
when footage of millions of brightly colored butterflies darkening
the skies was shown on television. Taiwan has since been reputed to
be the "kingdom of butterflies."</P>
      <P>Chen said that as recently as 10 years ago, visitors to the
valley could see throngs of butterflies, known locally as a "big
occurrence," three times each year -- in April, June and October,
respectively.</P>
      <P>"Such dazzling, magnificent scenes, however, have now become
history," Chen said, adding that the "big occurrence" now appears
only once a year, usually in October.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Chen said, the scale of the "big occurrence" has
dwindled substantially in the past few years.</P>
      <P>"In its heyday, as many as 113 butterfly species could be seen in
the valley, including some highly treasurable indigenous species,"
Chen said, adding that the number of strains now spotted in the
valley dropped to 80-plus three to four years ago, and further fell
to about 50 this year.</P>
      <P>Several rare species, such as Byasa febanus, Kaniska canace
drilon and Traides aeacus kaguya, have all disappeared in the
Meinung Valley, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the numbers have also declined drastically.
"In the past, one could see more than 20 million butterflies dancing
in the skies during a `big occurrence.' Today, however, the number
has shrunk to just slightly more than 100,000," Chen lamented.</P>
      <P>The dramatic decline is not only worrying local entomologists and
butterfly fans, it has also drawn concern from American and Japanese
environmentalists and academics, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Some Japanese and American experts have traveled to the Meinung
Valley to probe possible causes of the decrease in the number and
species of butterflies.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted several experts who attribute the decline to two
reasons: Climatic changes in southern Taiwan have resulted in a
blurring of the seasonal differences between the dry and rainy
seasons; and deforestation has deprived butterflies of their natural
and vital ecosystem.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, further studies are needed to determine
the exact causes of the disappearance of so many of the beautiful
creatures.</P>
      <P>Chen further called on the government to devote more funds and
energy to environmental protection and butterfly conservation.
"Otherwise, no butterfly can be seen in the Meinung Valley in the
not too distant future," he warned.</P>

      <P>A group of more than 1,000 employees of
Taiwan's provincial government on Thursday traveled to the Executive
Yuan to demand that their working rights be secured after the
downsizing of the provincial government by year-end.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators came all the way from the seat of the Taiwan
provincial government -- Nantou County in central Taiwan. Some 20
tourist buses took them to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall compound
in downtown Taipei on Thursday morning, from where they marched in
procession to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Holding placards and banners, the employees marched peacefully
for about an hour to the Executive Yuan, shouting slogans such as
"Support the Downsizing of the Provincial Government but Oppose its
Abolishment," "Abolishment of the Provincial Government is
Unconstitutional," and "Fight For Our Working Rights."</P>
      <P>Yang Chaur-shin, chairman of the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, and Wei Chi-lin,
director-general of Central Personnel Administration, came out of the
building to accept a petition from the marchers. Twenty provincial
government employees were also invited to have talks with the two
central government officials.</P>
      <P>The petition expressed concern that the central government's true
purpose is to abolish, rather than downsize, the provincial
government, and set out the provincial government employees' demands
for dignity, working rights and protection.</P>
      <P>It said the central government should not force them to retire or
dismiss them with severance pay, and demanded that their new jobs
should be in the same geographic areas as their current work
locations. The workers should not be forced to leave their families
to work in different areas, the petition said.</P>
      <P>Kuo Cheng-hsi, chairman of the "Taiwan Provincial Government
Employees Self-Rescue Alliance" and organizer of the event, said that
if the demonstration does not obtain a goodwill response from the

      <P>Pay talks between pilots with TransAsia
Airways and the carrier's management broke down on Thursday, and the
pilots announced that they had suspended negotiations with the
management.</P>
      <P>Chen Pei-chuan, representative of the 63 pilots who staged a
demonstration outside the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
headquarters to protest the carrier's plan to cut salaries, said they
decided to halt bilateral negotiations because the management refused
to back down on the decision.</P>
      <P>Sixty-seven of TransAsia's 72 French-Italian ATR turboprop pilots
resigned en masse late on Monday following the carrier's announcement
that ATR pilot salaries would be cut by up to 30 percent from next
month, to make up for operational losses of NT$8 million (about
US$230,000) in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Chen demanded that TransAsia make severance payments and issue
leave certificates to its pilots if the airline cannot avoid cutting
salaries.</P>
      <P>Only two of the 67 pilots returned to work on Wednesday after
TransAsia threatened to hire lower-paid pilots from the Czech

      <P>Meanwhile, CAA Deputy Director Chang Kuo-cheng said CAA has
demanded that TransAsia work out a new plan of operations before 8:30
a.m. on Friday, and explain its measures to deal with the situation.
If TransAsia fails to work out a reasonable plan by that deadline,
Chang said the CAA will cancel TransAsia's operating rights on 10
domestic routes.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the CAA will call a meeting on Saturday to discuss
punishments for TransAsia and for pilots found to have neglected
their duties, but he stressed that the CAA will not interfere in the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a blue light in
July, a sign of economic recession on the government's five-color
composite assessment system, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CEPD officials said that the first blue light in 26 months
came after three consecutive months of yellow-blue lights.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the blue light signals a need for the
government to adopt a powerful package to stimulate the economy.</P>
      <P>Under the five-color assessment system designed by the CEPD for
Taiwan's economic status, a blue light represents an economic
recession; a yellow-blue light indicates a slowdown; a green light
signifies steady growth; a yellow-red light means the economy is
heating up; and a red light represents an overheated economy.</P>
      <P>The ratings are determined according to nine major economic
indicators: export value; new export orders; industrial production;
manufacturing inventories; total employment outside the agricultural
sector; money supply; stock prices; the check default rate; and bank
lending to the private sector.</P>
      <P>The leading index also fell by 1.7 percent in July, or the second
highest drop since the Asian financial storm broke in mid-1997,
indicating that an economic recovery will be impossible this year.
Any chance of the recession bottoming out will not be likely until
the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-juei, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, said that the Asian financial crisis has caused Taiwan's
exports in the first seven months of this year to register negative
growth of 8 percent. With the economies of Southeast Asian countries
still in disarray, it will be difficult to boost the domestic economy
through exports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CEPD announced the result of a survey of domestic
manufacturers which shows that manufacturers have become more
pessimistic about the island's economic prospects.</P>
      <P>Twenty-seven percent of the respondents now think the economy
will deteriorate further, up from 25 percent in June.</P>

      <P>TransAsia Airways announced on Thursday
that it may suspend some of its domestic ATR flight services on
Saturday following a breakdown in pay talks with 65 of its pilots.</P>
      <P>A TransAsia executive said it will be hard for the airline to
operate its ATR flights this Saturday, as only four pilots are
available to fly the carrier's 16 flights scheduled for that day.</P>
      <P>The official noted that applications by any pilots who are
willing to return to work will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Of TransAsia's 10 domestic routes flown by its fleet of ATR
turboprop planes, the carrier will seek to maintain normal flight
services between the offshore islands of Kinmen and Penghu, but may
consider suspending four other routes, including two solely served by
the airline, due to a lack of manpower, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Suspension of flights over the past few days has seriously
affected the carrier's operations, with its average passenger load
dropping from 16,000 per day to around 7,500, the TransAsia executive
said, adding that the company will submit a new plan of operations
for the next three months to the Ministry of Transportation and
Telecommunications on Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Pei-chuan, representative of 63 of the pilots who
staged a demonstration outside the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) headquarters to protest the carrier's plan to cut salaries,
announced that they had suspended negotiations with management,
because it had refused to back down on the decision.</P>
      <P>Chen also presented a letter signed by 62 pilots demanding that
TransAsia either withdraw its salary cut plan before Aug. 31, or
immediately make severance payments and issue leave certificates to
its pilots in accordance with the law, as their contracts with
TransAsia are no longer valid.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) on Thursday urged government agencies
to fully implement an economic stimulus plan worked out recently to
expand domestic consumer demand.</P>
      <P>As the fallout from the year-long Asian financial crisis is more
serious than expected, and as the situation may further escalate, the
CEPD said the relevant government agencies must do their best to
promote the plan to help stimulate the local economy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the five-color assessment system designed by the CEPD
to gauge Taiwan's economy flashed a blue light in July for the first
time since June 1996, indicating that the local economy has entered a
recession.</P>
      <P>Citing data recently released by the Economist magazine, the CEPD
reported that the world's economic growth will slow this year to just
2.3 percent, down from the 3.6 percent recorded for 1997. It added
that the crisis-plagued countries of Southeast Asia will be unable to
recover from the current recession until 2001.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also pointed out that the European financial market may
become more volatile following the financial turbulence which broke
out last week in Russia, while mainland China may not be able to

    <HEADLINE>KMT SECRETARY-GENERAL VISITS JAPANESE COUNTERPART</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  27  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting high-ranking official from the
Republic of China's ruling Kuomintang met on Thursday with three
leading officials of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by ROC representative to Japan Chuang Ming-yao, KMT
Secretary-General John Chang visited his Japanese counterpart, LDP
Secretary-General Yoshiro Mori, to exchange views on issues of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Mori reminisced about meeting with late
President Chiang Ching-kuo when Chiang was president of the China
Youth Corps. Mori's subsequent remarks indicated that he has harbored
friendly feelings toward the ROC since a young age.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former ROC foreign minister, told Mori that if Tokyo and
Beijing sign a document that gives Taiwan a feeling that it is
further isolated in the international community, the stability of the
Asia-Pacific region might be adversely affected.</P>
      <P>Without specifically mentioning the "three noes" policy, Chang
was expressing concern that during mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to Japan in the coming months, Japan might enunciate
the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan under pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chang visited other LDP ranking officials --
Policy Affairs Research Council Chairman Yukihiko Ikeda, and
Executive Council Chairman Takashi Fukaya.</P>
      <P>Describing the conversations as "frank and constructive," Chang
said that he believed the meeting helped them gain a better
understanding of each other.</P>
      <P>Asked if he mentioned the "three noes" policy, Chang said that
the conversations covered topics including Jiang's delayed Japanese
visit and further engagement between Tokyo and Beijing. Chang said
that he has expressed clearly Taiwan's stance on the issue, adding
that the Japanese side promised to pass Taiwan's comments to Japanese
Premier Keizo Obuchi.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" policy, spelled by US President Bill Clinton
during his visit to mainland China earlier this year, refers to no US
support for Taiwan independence, no US support for "two Chinas," or
"one China, one Taiwan," and no US support for Taiwan membership in
international organizations that require statehood.</P>
      <P>Chang arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a five-day visit, his
third overseas trip aimed at promoting "party diplomacy" since he
assumed his current post late last year.

      <P>The families of six Taiwan tourists killed
in a traffic accident in mainland China's northwestern province of
Gansu will bring the ashes of their beloved ones home Sunday, the
Taipei Travel Agents Association (TTAA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the six victims were cremated Friday after a

      <P>The families, carrying the ashes of their beloved ones, will fly
from Jiayuguan, Gansu province, to Beijing for an overnight stay
Saturday. They are scheduled to return to Taipei via Hong Kong Sunday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>The six victims were part of a 14-member Taiwan tour group taking
part in the "Silk Road" tour of mainland China.</P>
      <P>The accident took place last Saturday when a van carrying the
group collided with a truck near Qingchuan, some 50 kilometers from
Jiayuguan.</P>

killed. Eight other Taiwan tourists were injured in the accident.</P>

negotiated with the mainland on compensation terms. Mainland
officials offered US$29,000 in compensation to the families of each

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER PUSHES FOR DOMESTIC INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang
said on Friday that it is high time to accelerate domestic demand and
investment.</P>
      <P>Despite indications of crises of confidence in economies at home
and abroad, Wang said he is still optimistic about Taiwan's economic
prowess, believing that the economy will pick up steam late next
year, early 2000 at the latest.</P>
      <P>"We should stimulate domestic demand and facilitate investment at
home when the economy is witnessing its lowest lows." By doing so,
the island's export sector will be in a position to take advantage
of a global economic recovery, once it begins, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Addressing a meeting with local business and industrial leaders
on strategic measures relating to the "Year 2000" computer problem,
Wang said he is confident that domestic investment will grow by more
than 16 percent this year, making it the prime mover behind Taiwan's
economic growth at a time when the exports are experiencing an early
winter.</P>
      <P>Wang said Taiwan's economy flashed a "blue light" in July -- a
rating in Taiwan's color-coded economic analysis index that indicates
a recession. The plunge in the Russian ruble, coupled with steep
falls in stock markets worldwide, have clouded global economic
prospects, he said, adding that a rebound is unlikely until late next
year.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, meanwhile, called for the government to take stimulus
measures to help the business and industrial sectors tide over the
current difficulties. The measures he recommended include lowering
bank interest rates, relaxing the credit market, stabilizing New
Taiwan dollar exchange rates and improving the efficiency of public
investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ARMS DEAL SIGNIFIES NO CHANGES IN US POLICY: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   28   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Defense's
announcement of a plan to sell US$350 million worth of defensive
weapons to Taipei indicates that there is no change in Washington's
arms sales policy toward Taiwan, military officials said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after the Pentagon announced on
Thursday that pending congressional approval, the United States will
provide Taiwan with a variety of military hardware, including 61
Stringer air defense missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, MK-46
torpedoes and related equipment and service.</P>
      <P>If the US Congress doesn't voice opposition to the plan within
the specified period of time, this will be the first
Taipei-Washington arms deal since US President Bill Clinton made a
high-profile visit to mainland China two months ago.</P>
      <P>"We welcome the Pentagon's move," said a spokesman for the
Ministry of National Defense (MND), adding that continued US sales of
defensive weapons related equipment to Taiwan will help maintain
peace in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Following Clinton's mainland trip, the Clinton administration
has on many occasions reaffirmed that it will continue to furnish
Taiwan with defensive weapons necessary to ensure the island's
security in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"The Pentagon's announcement marks a concrete US action proving
that there is not any change in the US arms sales policy toward
Taiwan in the wake of Clinton's June 25-July 3 mainland trip,"
said another MND official who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>Pending congressional approval, the Pentagon said the United
States will provide Taiwan with 61 dual mount Stinger missile
launchers, 728 missile rounds and associated hardware for US$180
million.</P>
      <P>The package deal will also include 58 Harpoon anti-ship missiles
to be mounted on Taiwan's US-made F-16 jet fighters and eight Harpoon
training missiles for US$101 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, The United States will sell 131 MK-46 torpedoes and
related equipment for US$69 million. The torpedoes will be used
by Taiwan's S-70 helicopters for anti-submarine warfare.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon said in a news statement that Taiwan intends to
use these weapons to maintain its air defense capability.</P>
      <P>It further said the proposed deal is consistent with US laws and
policy and will not affect the basic military balance in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>According to the Pentagon, the prime contractor for the Stinger
systems and torpedoes is Raytheon Systems Co. of Lexington,
Massachusetts; and the main contractor for the Harpoon missiles is
McDonnell Douglas Aerospace of St. Louis, now owned by Boeing Co.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Aug.   28   (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government has
substantially toughened the entry conditions for skilled migrants.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to CNA Friday morning, Immigration Minister
Philip Ruddock said that the changes will seek to maximize economic
benefits to Australia.</P>
      <P>"According to economic modeling commissioned by my department,
Australia will be some A$95 (US$60) per person better off as a result
of the greater focus placed on these categories of the Migration
Program," he said.</P>
      <P>He said a major change to the Independent and Skilled Australian
Linked (SAL) categories will be to establish minimum threshold
criteria for skills, age and English language ability to all
independent and SAL categories.</P>
      <P>"From July 1, 1999, all new applicants in these categories will
have to be less than 45 years of age, have vocational level English
and have a skilled occupation with qualifications recognized in
Australia," he said. "Establishment of minimum threshold will not
only do away with some anomalies in the current points test, but will
also enable us to introduce other factors more focused on obtaining
employment in Australia."</P>
      <P>The additional employability factors include five additional
points if the applicant's spouse also meets the threshold
requirements for skills, age and English language ability and another
five extra points if the applicant obtained his diploma, trade
certificate or degree from an Australian educational institution.</P>
      <P>Australia has set the immigration quota in fiscal 1998-99 at
68,000, unchanged from the previous year's level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR PLUNGES TO RECORD LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian dollar plunged to a record
low while the country's stock market opened about 100 points lower in
step with market declines in the United States and around the world.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar fell to 55.6 US cents in Friday morning
trade after closing at 55.9 US cents Thursday, the currency's lowest
value since it was floated in 1983. The previous low, 57.1 US cents,
was set July 28, 1986.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the All Ordinaries Index plummeted about 100 points
when the market opened Friday, and although it later regained some
ground, it was still down about 80 points by late morning.</P>
      <P>Dealers attributed the sharp fall to the dumping of the
Australian dollar by major foreign investors in Japan, the United
States and Europe, and they said they believe the dollar could fall
as low as 50 US cents.</P>
      <P>The dumping of the Australian dollar was sparked by concern that
Russia's economy is spiraling out of control. All trading in the
Russian ruble was halted on Thursday amid speculation that
international banks had suffered losses of US$50 billion from their
Russian exposures.</P>
      <P>Economists noted that countries in Eastern Europe and Latin
America were heading toward similar catastrophes.</P>
      <P>Financier George Soros confirmed that his hedge fund alone had
lost US$2 billion.</P>
      <P>Economists attributed the Australian market's Thursday plunge to
the ailing currency, which has been hammered by fears that economic
turmoil in Asia and Russia could impact Australia's domestic economic
growth, as well as global economic growth.</P>
      <P>"The fall in the Australian dollar reflects the fact that
commodity currencies are increasingly coming under pressure," said
Hugh Dougherty, a strategist with Merrill Lynch. "It is a case of
global events taking their toll on vulnerable currencies with the
effects impacting equity markets."</P>
      <P>"Until the Australian dollar stabilizes, investors will continue
to stand on the sidelines," said John Bowie Wilson, director of BNP
Equities Australia.</P>
      <P>Brokers said a quick solution to the current problems in
Australia's stock and currency markets is unlikely.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia, often described as "a lucky
country," is no longer a safe haven for stock and currency investment
as the country is being dragged down by collapsing economies in
Russia, Asia and elsewhere, economists said.</P>
      <P>In the past week, the Australian dollar and stock market have
been savaged by the economic and financial problems in Russia and
Latin America, which are the latest victims following the Asian
economic crisis, which struck in the second half of 1997.</P>
      <P>Economists said the United States has become a safe haven for
many investors, including those from Asia and other countries.</P>
      <P>Japan, now in a recession, is expected to find it difficult to
escape from its current mess, as its problems have been building for
years as a result of Tokyo's reluctance to reform its financial
sector.</P>
      <P>Australia's exports to Japan and other Asian countries account
for about 60 percent of its overall exports. Despite its efforts to
shift its exports to other markets, including the United States,
Europe and the Middle East, Australia cannot compensate overnight for
slowing sales to Asia, economists said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton has told a
senator that the United States will try to find appropriate ways for
Taiwan's voice to be heard in those international organizations that
require statehood for membership, even though the United States does
not support Taiwan's membership in such organizations.</P>
      <P>In his letter of Aug. 18, 1998, to Sen. Robert Torricelli,
a Democrat from New Jersey, President Clinton also assured that US
policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged, and that under the Taiwan
Relations Act of 1979, the United States will continue to provide
defensive weapons necessary for Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability.</P>
      <P>The full text of the letter is as follows:</P>
      <P>I appreciate your letter about Taiwan sent before my trip to
the People's Republic of China. Let me describe to you my discussions
on this important subject.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's development of a prosperous economy based on free market
principles, its emergence as our seventh largest trading partner, and
its adoption of a democratic system that protects fundamental human
rights are important achievements that benefit not only Taiwan but
the entire region.</P>
      <P>The policies of US Administrations over the last three decades
toward Taiwan and the PRC have helped create the atmosphere in which
democracy and prosperity in Taiwan have flourished. I am committed
fully to assuring that this successful record continue.</P>
      <P>Our policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged through the exchange
of presidential visits in the last nine months. I articulated
publicly and privately during my trip all of the core elements of
that policy. We have a "one China" policy based on the three US-PRC
Joint Communiques. Our strong unofficial relations with Taiwan and
our continued support for appropriate defensive arms sales to Taiwan
are based on the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>These documents establish the key principles that have guided
our policy for nearly two decades, including our firm expectation
that any resolution of differences between Taipei and Beijing be
exclusively by peaceful means, our arms sales to Taiwan, and our
policy of not supporting Taiwan independence, "one China, one Taiwan"
or "two Chinas," or Taiwan membership in organizations requiring
statehood for membership.</P>
      <P>We do, however, support Taiwan's membership in international
organizations that do not require statehood and will work for
appropriate ways for Taiwan's voice to be heard in those that do. We
strongly support cross-Strait dialogue, but we do not intend to
mediate, prescribe the agenda, nor pressure Taiwan to negotiate.
 None of these elements of our policy is new. Our adherence to the
Taiwan Relations Act and the three Joint Communiques has been
confirmed by each Administration since their enactment and
negotiation. Our "one China" policy has been explicit since President
Reagan confirmed it in a letter to General Secretary Hu Yaobang in
1982.</P>
      <P>Our position on Taiwan dates back at least to Henry
Kissinger's 1971 visit to China ad was put on the record by Deputy
Secretary Christopher in 1979 hearings on the Taiwan Relations Act
(the ruling party of Taiwan did not then and does not now support
independence for Taiwan either). Our position on "one China, one
Taiwan" or "two Chinas" dates back to the 1982 Joint Communique
negotiated by the Reagan Administration.</P>
      <P>Our expectation of a peaceful settlement is reiterated in each
of the Joint Communiques. And our support for cross-Strait exchanges
ad dialogue was first asserted by Secretary of State Shultz in 1987.</P>
      <P>I made clear in my meeting with President Jiang our
insistence that differences between the PRC and Taiwan be resolved
peacefully. That was the message I conveyed as well when I ordered
deployment of two carrier battle groups to the waters near Taiwan in
March 1996. My Administration was pleased to support the Senate
Resolution passed earlier this month reaffirming our commitment to the
Taiwan Relations Act and calling on the PRC to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>I will continue to develop our strong unofficial relations with
Taiwan and to assure Taiwan is provided the defensive weapons
necessary for it to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.
The history of the past quarter century provides strong evidence that
Taiwan has fared best when US relations with the PRC are on an even
keel and that Taiwan suffers when tensions in US-PRC relations rise.
This paradoxical but clear relationship convinces me that improvement
in US-PRC relations over the last several years will strengthen
Taiwan's interests and security.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that Taiwan and the PRC have moved further.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGES EARLY RESUMPTION OF SYSTEMATIC DIALOGUE CHANNELS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Friday presented four "should's" in a response to the four
"should not's" rhetoric issued by mainland China earlier this week.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said mainland China should:</P>
      <P>-- resume systematic dialogue channels at the earliest
opportunity, and face pragmatically the fact that there is separate
rule on either side of the Taiwan Strait;</P>
      <P>-- renounce the threat of force against Taiwan, and instead seek
to solve bilateral differences in a way that takes into consideration
the welfare of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and the
aspirations of the international community;</P>
      <P>-- adopt a more positive and constructive manner, without
imposing preconditions on negotiations; and</P>
      <P>-- try to seek appropriate resolution of issues of mutual concern
via existing channels.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council
said on Monday that if Taiwan desires unification and increased
exchanges with the mainland to promote cross-strait prosperity, then
it should:</P>
      <P>-- refrain from citing the different social systems on either
side of the strait as reasons for rejecting unification;</P>
      <P>-- not upgrade its combat capacity to incite belligerent
sentiments;</P>
      <P>-- cease its bid for membership in the United Nations with the
claim that the island needs a larger international presence; and</P>
      <P>-- not hinder direct trade, postal, and transportation links
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, or economic exchanges and
cooperation.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman and Spokesman Sheu Ke-sheng said that mainland
China's insistence on refusing to renounce the use of force, its
reluctance to face the political reality of separate rule, and its
unwillingness to launch political and social reforms such as
protection of human rights and promotion of democracy, have been the
basic stumbling blocks to improved cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS ON BOOSTING ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday instructed
government agencies to organize a task force within the next week to
promote domestic consumption and pump up Taiwan's sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>Siew gave the order during an inter-ministerial meeting aimed at
reviewing the government's economic stimulus programs and working out
the most efficient incentives to implement the plans.</P>
      <P>He urged more effort to be made to boost domestic demand and
stabilize trading in both the stock and currency markets, pointing
out that the government and private sector should concentrate their
strength to save the country from a crisis triggered by the regional
financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>The premier also instructed his cabinet ministers in charge of
economic and financial affairs to implement budgeted projects
immediately, to encourage the purchase of constructed buildings, and
to set up new regulations for private investment applications on
building power plants.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has initiated a compound stimulus package to
boost domestic demand which it is hoped will maintain Taiwan's annual
economic growth at the level of 5 percent to 5.5 percent this year
and next.</P>
      <P>However, whether or not the measures can be put into practice
effectively will depend on the government's efficiency and
determination.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a blue light, representing a recession,
in the latest government assessment for July. It is the first blue
light in 26 months, and follows three consecutive months of
yellow-blue, which signals a sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>The government has recently been forced to lower its economic
growth prediction to some 5.3 percent, a figure expected to fall
further if no effective steps are taken to stop the trend caused by
the year-long Asian financial turbulence which has now extended to
Russia.</P>
      <P>In response to the recession signal, the Central Bank of China is
said to be keeping a loose monetary policy aimed at guaranteeing an
abundant capital supply.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it has been reported that the bank is to open this
year's third meeting of its board of directors and supervisors in
mid-September to determine the best moment to adjust downwards the
reserve requirement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SECRETARY-GENERAL MEETS LEADERS OF JAPANESE OPPOSITION PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By F.M. Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A nation's importance should not be gauged
solely by the number of nations with which it maintains formal
diplomatic relations, Kuomintang Secretary-General John Chang said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for a five-day
unofficial visit, said that although the ROC maintains formal
diplomatic relations with only 27 nations around the world, it has
regional clout and importance in the Asia-Pacific region greater than
that wielded by two-thirds of the countries in the world.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a meeting with ranking officials of
the Democratic Party, Japan's largest opposition party, formed only a
year ago by a coalition of smaller parties.</P>
      <P>He met with Yukio Hatoyama, acting secretary-general of the
Democratic Party, and Yukihisa Yoshida, chairman of the Council of
Democratic Party Dietmen in Both Houses, for discussions on how to
bolster ties between the KMT and the Democratic Party, and to
exchange views on other issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Yoshida, who is scheduled to fly to Taipei for a visit on
Saturday, said Japanese should still be grateful to the late ROC
President Chiang Kai-shek for his leniency to Japan at the end of
World War II which prevented Japan from falling apart in the years
following the war.</P>
      <P>Yoshida also lauded the ROC for its ability to remain relatively
unscathed by the Asian economic turmoil.</P>
      <P>He expressed his party's grave concern about the "three noes"
policy toward Taiwan enunciated by US President Bill Clinton in
Shanghai in early July, and said his party will try its utmost to
render help to Taiwan whenever possible.</P>
      <P>In return, Chang thanked Yoshida for his support for Taiwan. He
said the ROC and Japan have long been inextricably linked, and still
maintain close ties despite the absence of formal diplomatic
relations.</P>
      <P>Chang and his group were scheduled to meet on Friday afternoon
with Sadanori Yamanaka, chairman of the Japan-ROC Dietmen's Council,
a pro-Taiwan supra-party organization in the Japanese parliament, for
talks on a wide range of issues.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police on the outlying island of Kinmen
cordoned off a beach on its northeastern shore on Friday after a
contractor found it to be strewn with mines.</P>
      <P>The contractor, who had been commissioned to build a breakwater
on the beach, found suspicious "lunch box-shaped" objects while he
was clearing the area with a bulldozer. After checking with troops
stationed nearby, the objects were found to be anti-personnel mines,
and the construction work was suspended immediately.</P>
      <P>Further inspection found the whole beach to be strewn with at
least 50 or 60 of the heavily corroded mines, which were almost
indistinguishable from rocks.</P>
      <P>Kinsha Township Government Secretary Chen Kun-ti said he still
had a vivid recollection of three local people who were killed after
inadvertently stepping on mines on the beach four decades ago.</P>
      <P>After cordoning off the beach, the police alerted the Kinmen
Defense Command to send a special mine-clearing squad to remove the
mines, but warned that with the passing of time and tides, the mines
may have moved from their original position.</P>
      <P>During the four-decade rivalry between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, the military has deployed thousands of anti-personnel
and anti-tanks mines on the frontline island's beaches to deter
invasions by mainland forces.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO JOIN AUSTRALIA'S FAST-TRACK VISA SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China nationals will be subject
to Australia's Electronic Travel Authority (ETA) fast-track entry
visa system from July 1, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Director-General Chu Chien-yi of the MOFA's Bureau of Consular
Affairs quoted Australian Immigration and Multiculturalism Minister
Philip Ruddock, who announced on Wednesday that Taiwan and Hong Kong
will join 29 other countries on the ETA fast-track visa system from
July 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>Chu said the ETA is a simple, fast and efficient way of providing
tourists and short-term business travelers with permission to enter
Australia.</P>
      <P>The system also includes pre-clearance for entry that reduces the
time needed to process passengers on arrival, Chu said, adding that
Australia will start to make necessary arrangements here in the near
future to pave the way for implementing the new system for ROC
nationals.</P>
      <P>The ETA is currently available to nationals of 29 countries,
including the United States, Britain, parts of Western Europe,
Singapore, and Japan.</P>
      <P>The expansion of the ETA system is expected to improve
Australia's ability to handle the expected rise in visitor numbers,
particularly in the run-up to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Chu
said.</P>
      <P>Chu also reported that the bureau has set up an emergency liaison
center to help ROC expatriates who need emergency assistance to get
in touch with ROC overseas representative offices.</P>
      <P>He said the bureau's visa office at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport has been serving as the emergency liaison center since it
became operational early this month.</P>
      <P>"We decided to set up the center mainly because the number of ROC
nationals traveling abroad has increased significantly in recent
years and many of them sometimes require emergency assistance," Chu
said.</P>
      <P>With the opening of the new center, Chu said, travelers abroad
who cannot get in touch with ROC overseas representative offices can
seek the center's assistance through their families or friends in
Taiwan. "The center will then help them contact our overseas
representative offices," Chu added.</P>
      <P>The center offers round-the-clock services, Chu said. Its
telephone numbers are (03) 398-2629 and (03) 383-4849.</P>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung, chairman of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), led party elite on a visit to the
Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research on Friday, to gain a better
understanding of mainland China's economic condition.</P>
      <P>As the financial turmoil which began in Asia in 1997 is now
sweeping the whole world, DPP leaders feel it is essential to develop
a better understanding of world economic affairs, especially those of
mainland China.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chiou I-jen, Financial Subcommittee
Convener Wu Nai-jen, Treasurer Ker Chien-ming, Director of the
Chinese Affairs Dept. Yen Wan-ching, and DPP legislators familiar
with economic affairs, were briefed by the Chung-Hua Institute on
mainland China's current economic situation.</P>
      <P>As economic topics have long been the DPP's weakest point in its
performance in the legislature, the DPP has recently been making
greater efforts in that field.</P>
      <P>Senior officials have contacted heads of enterprises in Taiwan,
such as Chairman of the Board of the Grand Commercial Bank Wu Li-pei,
and General Manager of I Mei Food Co. Gao Chih-ming, asking them to
serve as DPP advisers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DPP is also enhancing its knowledge of economic
affairs by recruiting new academic members, including Director of the
Institute of Economics Hu Sheng-cheng, Vice President of the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research Hong Te-sheng, and National Taiwan
University professors Chen Pou-Chih, Wu Chung-chi and Chang
Ching-hsi.</P>
      <P>However, the party's understanding of mainland China is still
superficial, remarked Financial Subcommittee Convener Wu.</P>
      <P>He added that the DPP is desperate to acquire in-depth knowledge
of the mainland's current and long-term problems, such as whether the
renminbi is to be devalued, the Yangtse River flooding, and the
problem of rising unemployment exacerbated by the selling off of
state-owned enterprises, as well as future industrial trends in the
mainland.</P>

      <P>Japan should add another "no" to the "three
noes" policy if it is forced by Beijing to enunciate the policy
toward Taiwan, former Japanese Premier Yasuhiro Nakasone proposed on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Nakasone said in a speech that whether or not Japan will follow
in the footsteps of the United States and spell out the "three noes"
policy has become a major concern for Taiwan, Japan's Sankei Shimbun
reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The former Japanese premier said that if enunciation of the
"three noes" policy becomes necessary during mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan in the coming months, Tokyo
should add another clause to the policy -- no support for the use of
force in solving cross-Taiwan Strait disputes.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" policy refers no support for Taiwan
independence, no support for "two Chinas," or "one China, one
Taiwan," and no support for Taiwan membership in international

    <HEADLINE>UNDERWORLD FIGURES URGED TO KEEP AWAY FROM POLITICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo on Friday
urged local gang leaders not to try to get involved in politics as
law enforcement authorities have geared up to eradicate money and
violence from the local political arena.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the call amid reports that some underworld figures
are preparing to take part in the year-end legislative elections in
hopes that electoral victory will help enhance their clout and
protect them from legal penalties for their criminal activities.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB)
has set up special panels to track capital flows of major criminal
rings, including sources of their capital. The MJIB will also recruit
and train volunteers to help track activities of major underworld
gangs.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Cheng said, the State Public Prosecutor General's
Office already set up a special task force in June to monitor and
investigate vote-buying activities.</P>
      <P>"The task force will cooperate closely with the MJIB, police
authorities and grass-roots law enforcement offices to stem
vote-buying," Cheng said, adding that all those who are involved in
vote-buying will be brought to justice.</P>
      <P>Cheng further said the anti-organized crime campaign launched by
his predecessor, Liao Cheng-hao, will never be ceased or scaled
down.</P>
      <P>"There will be no end to our fight against organized crime,"
Cheng said, pledging that the Ministry of Justice will make every
effort to prevent any gang leaders or underworld figures from
entering the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng said, the ministry has also intensified
surveillance to prevent ring leaders from sneaking back to Taiwan
from mainland China to disrupt social order or hinder the year-end
elections for the Legislative Yuan and for mayors and city councils
of Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Cheng cautioned those who intend to run in the Dec. 5
three-in-one elections to keep alert and avoid accepting cash
contributions from unidentified sources.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the call amid reports that mainland China may use
Taiwan gangsters hidden on the mainland to manipulate or sabotage the
critical year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Cheng further said three of the five people who were arrested
earlier this month for alleged involvement in cross-border drug
trafficking have complicated political backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Among the five detained drug traffickers, one was a local
resident, one came from Malaysia and three were from Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"The three Hong Kong passport holders all have complicated
family or career backgrounds," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The minister declined to elaborate on their background, but he
admitted that there might be "serious political motivations" behind
the drug trafficking deal, masterminded by Chan Wai Man, a member of
Hong Kong's largest criminal gang Sin Yee On.</P>
      <P>In the Aug. 9 raid, MJIB agents managed seized large
amounts of heroin, worth more than NT$100 million in street value,
which were smuggled by the Chan Wai Man group into Taiwan from Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the MJIB is still making in-depth investigations into
the case.
 According to press reports, one of the three Hong Kong drug
dealers used to be a ranking mainland Chinese public security
officer.</P>

      <P>Representatives from some 40 fishery

initiative that would eliminate tariff rates for fishery products by
2005</P>
      <P>The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's (APEC) Early Voluntary

Organizations.</P>
      <P>However, the EVSL agreement, proposed during the 1997 APEC summit
in Vancouver, requires products in nine sectors -- including fishery
products -- among APEC member countries to be subject to a zero
tariff rate by 2005.</P>
      <P>If Taipei goes ahead with the EVSL plan, it proves that the
government is not looking out for the interests of Taiwan fishermen,
Cheng argued.</P>
      <P>Wei Ker-ming, secretariat of the Board of Foreign Trade, urged
Taiwan fishermen to work out countermeasures to deal with the current
situation in which economic liberalization has become the trend
around the world.</P>
      <P>During an APEC meeting held this June in Malaysia, ministers
decided to implement the EVSL plan as soon as possible, as early as
next year. Concrete measures and details to carry out the package
will be worked out in an APEC ministerial meeting slated for
September.</P>
      <P>The United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada have all
expressed strong support for the EVSL package, while Taiwan, mainland
China, Japan and South Korea are more reserved about the plan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from the Republic of China and
Thailand on Friday pledged to establish the ROC-Thailand Lawmakers
Friendly Association in an attempt to boost "parliament diplomacy."</P>
      <P>Visiting ROC Legislator Rau Yin-chi and Thai Representative
Surasak Thiampraser signed the agreement which would increase the
exchange of visits, comments and information between lawmakers from
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Rau, who is leading the eight-member delegation, is also the
ruling Kuomintang's executive director of Policy Coordination
Committee. He said that at a time when the ROC and Thailand have no
diplomatic relations, parliament diplomacy will help enhance friendly
ties and understanding between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC Legislative Yuan has established similar associations
with their counterparts in the United States, Britain, Canada, Japan
and South Africa, Rau added.</P>
      <P>Krasae Chanwongse, who serves as vice chairman of Thailand's
Democrat Party, said during his recent visit to Taiwan he felt that
lawmakers from the two countries should strengthen their ties. As
relations between the ROC and Thailand have made great strides since
ROC representative to Thailand Stephan Hsu assumed his post years
ago, it is time that lawmakers from both sides further interact.</P>
      <P>ROC representative to Thailand said he was glad the long-expected
ROC-Thailand Lawmakers Friendship Association was finally
established, adding that he hopes the lawmakers from the two sides
can work toward realizing the goals of the association.</P>
      <P>The ROC legislative mission arrived in Bangkok on Thursday for a
three-day visit. They are scheduled to return to Taiwan on Monday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A non-partisan delegation composed of
National Assembly deputies is scheduled to leave for Japan on Sunday
to lobby for Tokyo's support ahead of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
visit there.</P>
      <P>The delegation will present Japanese opinion leaders with a
position paper explaining Taiwan's stance on cross-strait affairs. It
states that other countries should not make comments related to
cross-strait ties and urges Tokyo not to do anything which could
damage Taiwan's interests during the coming summit between Jiang and
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.</P>
      <P>Everyone in the Republic of China on Taiwan strongly believes
that the cross-strait dispute should be resolved peacefully and
rationally by the two sides on an equal footing, the paper stated. No
foreign country is in the position to make biased comments on issues
regarding "one China," "one China and one Taiwan," or "one country,
two systems."</P>
      <P>The position paper called on Japan to back Taiwan's efforts to
join international organizations and warned that Beijing may further
pressure Tokyo to sign a joint document on the "three noes" regarding
Taiwan. US President Bill Clinton was cited as an example as he
publicly declared his support for the "three noes" during his recent
visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Japan's support for Taiwan would be in Tokyo and Asia's best
interests, the paper said, adding that it hoped Japan would not
sacrifice its existing friendship with Taiwan for the sake of special
interests.</P>
      <P>The delegation is expected to meet with Sadanori Yamanaka,
president of the Alliance for Japan-ROC Friendship at the Diet, as
well as legislators from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the
Komei Party. The mission is scheduled to return to Taiwan on
Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR DOMESTIC INVESTMENTS TO INCREASE BY 73% IN 1998</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   28  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major domestic investment projects
scheduled for completion by the end of 1998 are expected to increase
73 percent from last year, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Major investment projects are defined as the projects each with
an investment value of over NT$200 million (US$8.69 million).</P>
      <P>Wang made the announcement after a Cabinet meeting on Taiwan's
finances and economy. He said major investment projects posted a
year-on-year growth of 89 percent in the first seven months of 1998
to NT$268 billion (US$7.76 billion), and was estimated to increase by
73 percent to NT$457 billion (US$13.24 billion) over the year.</P>
      <P>The figures did not include private investment projects below
NT$200 million (US$5.79 million) which are forecast to grow by 16
percent in 1998 in value.</P>
      <P>Domestic demand stemming from these projects will offset losses
in Taiwan's export industry as a result of the region's economic
crisis, and help stimulate the island's economic development, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>With expanding domestic demand in mind, Cabinet members decided
to establish an ad hoc panel to charter a course to boost the
island's economy.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew asked the Ministry of Economic Affaris
(MOEA) and the Council for Economic Planning and Development to work
out guidelines for the panel's operations within a week, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Siew also asked the MOEA to arrange meetings with local business
leaders so that he can exchange views with them on economic issues.</P>
      <P>Wang said the MOEA will consult with members of the local
business community before calling such gatherings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC OFFICIALS OPPOSE DEVALUATION OF NT DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) officials
expressed opposition Friday to further depreciating the New Taiwan
dollar to boost Taiwan's exports in an attempt to fuel its economy.</P>
      <P>Director General of Foreign Exchange Department Chou A-ting told
reporters that the contraction of Taiwan's exports lies more in the
shrinking of national incomes of Taiwan's neighboring states than in
the price of Taiwan's merchandise.</P>
      <P>If that is the case, further depreciation of the NT dollar would
not do much to boost the sale of Taiwan goods to people in
neighboring countries who have seen their purchasing power
substantially dwindle due to their shrinking income, Chou said.</P>
      <P>On the flip side, stabilizing exchange rates will encourage
investment at home and broaden domestic demands, Chou pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is affected more by the ups and downs of the US
market than that of Russia which is plagued by financial turmoil. A
slightly weakening greenback will ease the downward pressure on
currencies in most Asian countries, said Chou.</P>
      <P>CBC Deputy Governor Hsu Yi-hsiung shared Chou's views. He said at
a separate occasion on Friday that a monetary policy, of which the
foreign exchange rate is but a part, is not a panacea for all
economic and financial ills.</P>
      <P>There is no need to devalue the NT dollar because of Russia's
financial woes, Hsu said, adding that Taiwan-Russia trade only
accounts for 1 percent of Taiwan's total imports and exports.
Nevertheless, he said he would continue to monitor the global
economic situation closely and take appropriate measures accordingly.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) on Friday
urged Taiwan students in Russia and their family members to
temporarily stop remitting money to Russia or other countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the comment as money transferred into Russia at
present could be frozen by local banks. According to the latest
information, Russia has reportedly stopped the trading of foreign
currencies.</P>
      <P>The MOE made the call after Russia's financial turmoil saw the
ruble depreciate by 20 percent in the last few weeks. The drop in the
ruble has been blamed for the heavy losses seen in stock markets
around the world recently.</P>
      <P>The crisis has also left about 200 Taiwan students studying in
Russia, mainly in Moscow, in a very difficult situation. The MOE's
outposts and those of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Russia also
have encountered the same problem.</P>
      <P>According to the MOE, the foreign ministry is seeking to find
ways to channel money to ROC government outposts in Russia, and the
only option now is to keep US dollars in hand.</P>
      <P>The MOE urged Taiwan students in Russia to take extra care of
their personal safety and property as social order may worsen amid
the current wave of uncertainty.</P>
      <P>In the event of an emergency or any difficulties, the ministry
called on Taiwan students to contact its Moscow office at the
following telephone numbers 002-7095-956-3786; 002-7095-737-9246; or

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Secretary-General John Chang met
former Japan Defense Agency Director General Sadanori Yamanaka in
Tokyo on Friday to exchange views on Japan's relations with the
Republic of China and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yamanaka told Chang during their hour-long discussion that
Japan's policy toward Taiwan will remain unchanged not only in the
Diet, but also in the government.</P>
      <P>Yamanaka is president of the Dietmen's Council for Japan-ROC
Relations, a supra-party organization formed by 315 Diet members from
both houses to promote substantive relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past two days, Chang has held separate talks with ranking
members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Democratic
Party, Japan's main opposition party, to explain the political
positions of the KMT and those of the government.</P>
      <P>Chang said his initial impression was that Japan would stand firm
in its developing relations with mainland China. He told the Chinese
media that during his talks with Yamanaka, he fully expressed
Taipei's concern over Japan's relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said he believed Japan would not harm Japan-ROC relations when
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin makes a state visit to Japan
in the future.</P>
      <P>The KMT secretary-general said many Japanese lawmakers are
friendly toward the ROC and among the 20 Cabinet members, 13 belong
to the Dietmen's Council Japan-ROC Relations. Therefore, he felt
optimistic about Taipei's relations with Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Chang arrived in Tokyo on Aug. 26 at the invitation of a private
group comprised of elite politicians from Asia. He is scheduled to
return to Taipei on Aug. 30.</P>

      <P>Seven illegal immigrants from mainland
China were rounded up, while two others died and another two were
still missing after trying to sneak ashore in central Taiwan, police
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation found that the 11 illegal immigrants,
each of whom had paid 10,000 renminbi to a "snakehead," or smuggler,
boarded a vessel from a fishing port in Fujian Province, on Friday
night.</P>
      <P>By 3 a.m. on Saturday, the ship was close to the Taiwan port of
Wangkung, Changhua County. The illegal immigrants said that at that
point the boat's captain, fearing detection by ROC marine patrols,
asked them to swim ashore.</P>
      <P>However, because of their unfamiliarity with the surroundings,
and the strong currents in the area, they were swept toward offshore
commercial oyster beds.</P>
      <P>Six of the immigrants -- four men and two women -- clung to the
wooden spikes of the oyster farm and called for help until they were
noticed by a passing fisherman at 5:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>Police and coast guard officers later found a man and a woman,
identified as Zhou Jintu and Xu Shouhong -- who had drowned and had
been washed ashore, while another mainlander who had made it to shore
was later arrested.</P>
      <P>Police said they are still looking for the two missing illegals,
adding that the seven survivors have been sent to a detention center

      <P>The former personal secretary of One
Nation leader Pauline Hanson is moving to deregister the party,
saying she will seek a court injunction to block almost A$500,000
(US$312,500) in public funds from going into the party's coffers.</P>
      <P>Barbara Hazelton, a former close friend and confidante of Hanson,
said One Nation was never properly registered.</P>
      <P>She said she will seek an injunction in the Queensland Supreme
Court on Monday to immediately prevent the funds from being released
to the party.</P>
      <P>Hazelton's move has received full backing from prominent Liberal
Party parliamentarian Tony Abbot, who earlier asked his good friend,
Prime Minister John Howard, to condemn Hanson and put One Nation last
in the voting preference in the next federal election.</P>
      <P>Hazelton quit her job as Hanson's secretary after the June 13
election in Queensland, accusing Hanson's two advisers -- David
Ettridge and David Oldfield -- of manipulating One Nation and running
the party as a business instead of a political body.</P>
      <P>She told the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday that she hopes her
action will get "every member who thinks they belong to Pauline
Hanson's One Nation to actually find out just exactly what it is they
belong to."</P>
      <P>If Hazelton's move is successful, it will be a serious blow to
One Nation because the party will be unable to use the funds for the
next federal election campaign, political analysts said.</P>

GIGANTIC BALLOON CAUSES TROUBLE FOR CANADIAN AIR FORCE</P>
      <P>Ottawa, Aug. 28 (CNA) Canadian fighter jets scrambled over the
Atlantic Ocean to shoot down a potentially dangerous intruder, the
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>But the "bandit" managed to stay aloft, despite a hail of fire
from the two CF-18's, the national broadcaster said.</P>
      <P>"That's not a bad trick, considering the intruder is a gigantic
runaway helium balloon. The 50-story-high unmanned research station
lost navigational control over Saskatchewan on Monday, drifting
across the country and out over the Gulf of St. Lawrence," the CBC
said.</P>
      <P>It quoted Transport Canada as saying that the balloon posed a
serious hazard to airplanes, and that air traffic across the Atlantic
had been re-routed.</P>
      <P>The Department of National Defense said the cannon holes
inflicted by the fighters will bring the balloon down eventually.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE STILL INTENDS TO VISIT MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite recent squabbling over sovereignty
issues across the Taiwan Strait, ROC President Lee Teng-hui still
aspires to make a "journey of peace" to mainland China to pave the
way for China's eventual unification, a senior official said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office official, who preferred to remain
anonymous, made the statement in response to a newspaper report that
a mainland think tank is studying the feasibility of the leaders of
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait meeting in a neutral setting.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the think tank believes that a meeting
between Lee and his mainland counterpart, Jiang Zemin, will bring
about a major breakthrough in cross-strait relations, and may even
help Lee and Jiang share a Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, the official said Lee has consistently
endeavored to seek a breakthrough in the current cross-strait
impasse.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, he is doing so not for the sake of a Nobel prize,
but for the common interest of all Chinese people," the official
stressed.</P>
      <P>The ROC president mentioned in his 1996 inaugural speech that he
hopes to make a "journey of peace" to the mainland to set the stage
for cross-strait rapprochement. Lee has also expressed his desire to
meet Jiang in an international setting for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>"Even though current cross-strait relations have failed to
proceed as smoothly as expected, Lee's wishes remain unchanged," the
official explained.</P>
      <P>He further said that at the moment, the ROC government's highest
priority in cross-strait issues is that a long-planned autumn meeting
between C.F. Koo, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), and Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), can be held smoothly.</P>
      <P>"We also look forward to seeing cross-strait relations make
headway following the proposed Koo-Wang meeting later this year," the
official said.</P>
      <P>ARATS sent a message to SEF earlier this month, inviting Koo to
visit the mainland either in September or in October to meet with
Wang for talks on matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Government sources said the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which
oversees SEF operations, has tentatively decided to let Koo head a
delegation of SEF officials to visit the mainland in October for the
meeting with Wang.</P>
      <P>The sources said the MAC hopes mainland authorities will agree to
Taiwan's proposal that SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi
Hwi-yow visit the mainland prior to Koo's trip to set an agenda for
the much-anticipated meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT OFFICIAL REFUTES BEIJING'S FOUR 'SHOULD-NOTS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing leaders should stop addressing
Taiwan with a hegemonic attitude if they seek to improve bilateral
relations and realize the reunification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, a ruling Kuomintang official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Research
Department, made the remarks in response to four demands mainland
leaders made last week. Beijing's statement said Taipei should accept
the four demands or so-called four "should nots" if it is serious
about national unification.</P>
      <P>The four "should nots" are that Taiwan should not use differing
social systems as a reason to refuse unification with the mainland;
Taiwan should not continue to beef up its military strength; Taiwan
should not seek to develop international relations; and Taiwan should
not ban direct transport, postal and trade links across the strait.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's demands, Chang said Taiwan has never
refused to unify with the mainland. "Taiwan merely insists that
unification hinges on democracy on the mainland," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that Taiwan's unification with the mainland
is attainable only if Beijing were willing to carry out democratic
reforms.</P>
      <P>"We see few reasons why Beijing insists on adhering to a failed
communist system. Similarly, Beijing has no reason to expect a
democratic Taiwan to be integrated with a China which will remain
under communist rule," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>Regarding Beijing's demand that Taiwan suspend its effort to
boost its defense capability, Chang said Beijing should provide
incentives for Taiwan to cease to do so.</P>
      <P>"Beijing must renounce the use of force to reduce our security
concerns," the KMT official said, adding that there is only one
purpose for Taiwan to keep its military forces -- to defend itself
against a potential attack from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang further said if the cross-strait military balance were
sabotaged, the possibility of mainland China attacking Taiwan will
increase. "Such a scenario violates our goal of pursuing peaceful
unification of the two sides," he added.</P>
      <P>The mainland affairs expert also said there is little possibility
that Beijing's demand for Taiwan to discontinue its efforts in
expanding international relations will be met.</P>
      <P>Noting that diplomacy symbolizes a nation's sovereignty, he said
Taiwan must develop diplomatic relations and expand its international
presence to facilitate cross-strait dialogue on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, the key obstacle to direct cross-strait
trade, communications and transportation lies with Beijing's refusal
to recognize Taiwan's judicial authority.</P>
      <P>"Opening such links requires each party to recognize the other's
jurisdiction," he noted, adding that the two sides should sign a
peace treaty to end hostilities before the so-called "three links"
are established.</P>
      <P>The KMT official furtehr said maintaining peace in the Taiwan
Strait and promoting China's democratization are the party's ultimate
goals in forging cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Wu Hsin-hsing, a deputy
secretary-general of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation,
said mainland China's recalcitrant insistence on a "one country, two
systems" unification scheme based on its "one China" principle is a
major obstacle to cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Wu also urged mainland China to unequivocally renounce the use of
force against Taiwan to create a favorable climate for China's
peaceful unification under a free and democratic system.</P>
      <P>"I don't think the leaders of either side of the Taiwan Strait
will likely resort to the use of force in resolving cross-strait
issues. Against this backdrop, Beijing has nothing to lose in making
a public renunciation of the use of force against Taiwan," he
explained.</P>

      <P>TransAsia Airways will offer a total of 14
flights on five domestic routes on Sunday using its ATR turbo
aircraft, an airline spokesman said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>With the service of 18 pilots, the spokesman said, the carrier
will be able to offer one round-trip flight each on its
Kaohsiung-Kinmen, Taipei-Hualien and Kaohsiung-Makung routes, and two
round-trip flights each on CKS International Airport-Kaohsiung and
Taipei-Taitung routes.</P>
      <P>ATR flight services on other routes will continue to be
suspended, the spokesman said, adding that all the airline's Airbus
flights will operate normally.</P>
      <P>Airbus flights account for 70 percent of TransAsia's total daily
transport capacity. The company's Airbus planes can hold up to 13,000
passengers on its Taipei-Kaohsiung, Taipei-Tainan, Taipei-Kinmen,
Kaohsiung-Kinmen and Taipei-Makung routes everyday, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>A total of 67 TransAsia ATR pilots resigned en masse on Tuesday
to protest a major pay cut. Through negotiations, 13 pilots have
agreed to return to work.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) called a flight safety
evaluation meeting on Saturday to discuss the TransAsia
labor-management dispute.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, CAA Deputy Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng
said the administration will further investigate the case before
deciding on the punishment for both parties.</P>
      <P>Noting that the dispute has caused a near paralysis to the
island's air traffic in the last few days and seriously infringed on
passengers' rights, Chang said both parties should be penalized in
accordance with current regulations.</P>
      <P>As this was the first time that a labor-management dispute at a
domestic airline has so seriously effected passengers' rights, Chang
said the CAA must deal with the case with prudence and caution to
avoid setting a bad example.</P>
      <P>"We'll make further probes and studies before making a final
decision on the issue," Chang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Congress of Guatemala recently
adopted a resolution, showing strong support for the Republic of
China's bid to join the United Nations and other international
organizations.</P>
      <P>The resolution pointed out that the Republic of China (ROC) was 
established in 1912 as the first democratic republic in Asia and was
one of the founding members of the world body. The UN deprived the
ROC of its membership in favor of communist China by UN Resolution
No. 2758 at its 26th General Assembly, ignoring the legitimate
rights of the ROC and its people to join the world body.</P>
      <P>The UN resolution ignored the representation of the 22 million
ROC citizens in the world body, and in organizations
governing world health, environmental protection, education, and
culture. It is necessary to review the UN resolution, since the world
situations have changed greatly in the past 28 years, the resolution
said.</P>
      <P>The ROC has developed into a democratic country with a
popularly-elected government. It is also one of the world's major
countries in terms of trade and economic development. The ROC has
been a sovereign country since its establishment in 1912, although it
lost a lot of territory in civil war in 1949, the resolution added.</P>
      <P>The world community should review the ROC case and find a proper
way for it to join the UN, the resolution said. Proposals to let the
ROC join the UN in accordance with the "universal membership
principle" of the UN Charter deserve special attention, it added.</P>
      <P>The resolution said that the Congress of Guatemala supports the
ROC's bid to join the UN and the related world organizations.</P>
      <P>It also resolved to send the resolution to UN Secretary General

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indirect cross-strait trade via Hong Kong
totaled US$5.04 billion in the first half of 1998, down 7.7 percent
from the same period in 1997, statistics compiled by the Bureau of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) show.</P>
      <P>Indirect mainland Chinese exports to Taiwan via Hong Kong during
the first half of the year were off 1.2 percent from a year ago,
totaling US$820 million, while indirect Taiwan exports to mainland
China declined 8.8 percent to US$4.22 billion during the same
period, according to BOFT tallies. The imbalance left Taiwan with a
surplus of US$3.4 billion, down 10.5 percent from its year-earlier
level.</P>
      <P>Indirect cross-strait trade via Hong Kong registered the largest
year-on-year increase, 17.3 percent, in 1993, but the growth rate
dived soon after, falling to just 1.4 percent in 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition to the effects of the Asian financial crisis, BOFT
officials attributed the lower growth to increased transshipment
trade across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China agreed to open offshore transshipment
services in 1997, allowing vessels flying foreign flags to ship
cargo destined for a third country between Taiwan's southern port
city of Kaohsiung and Xiamen and Fuzhou, port cities in mainland
China's Fujian province. The agreement lowered cross-strait shipping
costs and allowed cargo to be shipped across the strait more quickly
than before.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's status as the major transshipment hub in indirect
cross-strait trade will continue to fade over time, BOFT officials
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BUSINESS LEADERS CALL FOR IMPROVED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan business leaders are urging the
government to help guide local enterprises in their efforts to
upgrade as soon as possible, in order to enhance their international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Since Thailand announced the adoption of a floating exchange rate
for the Thai baht on July 2, 1997, igniting a series of foreign
exchange rate battles in Southeast Asia, the financial turmoil has
spread like a plague from Thailand to the Philippines, Indonesia,
Malaysia, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has remained relatively unscathed by the
financial disaster, which the business leaders attribute to the small
government foreign debt, as well as the ability of it's small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to react quickly to change.</P>
      <P>Kao Ching-yuan, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries, said in an interview with CNA that many Southeast Asian
countries, with high ratios of both foreign debts and bad accounts,
have been proven too weak to withstand the onslaught of the financial
firestorm.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, Taiwan's situation is different. Most of its
SMEs, which make up the majority of Taiwan's enterprises, are highly
capable of coping with changing situations, and are able to use their
own funds to adapt and surmount the crisis.</P>
      <P>Chu Chih-yang, honorary chairman of the Chinese National Research
Institute of Industry &amp; Commerce Construction, pointed out that the
SMEs, which account for about half of the total national output and
employ some 75 percent of the nation's workforce, are the mainstay of
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that close cooperation between SMEs and their
satellite plants, and the flexible use of their own funds, have also
helped prevent them from suffering excessive impact from the
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-ho, chairman of the research institute, noted that
another important factor that has helped minimize the influence of
the financial turmoil is the traditionally strict and conservative
management style prevalent in the country's SMEs.</P>
      <P>Tai Sheng-thung, chairman of the National Association of Small &amp;
Medium Enterprises, ROC, also pointed out that the SMEs, with more
than 30 years of business experience and production technology,
together with the prudent screening system employed by Taiwan's
financial institutions, have also helped buffer the economy.</P>
      <P>He added that the SMEs did not use excessive credit to borrow and
were therefore able to safely tide themselves over the difficulties
of economic recession.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the business leaders also expressed their hope that
the government will move one step further, and present concrete
measures to cope with the financial crisis and boost economic
prosperity.</P>
      <P>Both Wang You-theng, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce
of the Republic of China, and Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese
National Association of Industry &amp; Commerce, urged the government to
encourage private investment and promote industrial development in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koo said the stabilization of the political situation should be
the government's top priority in leading the nation's enterprises
through the financial storm. If the political situation can retain
long-term stability, he said, then foreign investors will naturally
have more confidence to invest in Taiwan, and the economy will grow
accordingly.</P>
      <P>Kao, Chu, Chen, and Tai were unanimous in their suggestion that
the government should: help enterprises to improve production
technology; provide a good climate for capital or fund raising; draft
related laws and policies; and implement government reconstruction.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, both government officials and
entrepreneurs should earmark more funds for research and development
of better technology and production techniques, instead of using
their capital for speculation. This, they said, will prevent Taiwan
from marching down the road toward a bubble economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD CHIEF TALKS ABOUT TAIWAN'S ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top economic planner said that
Taiwan has been better able to tackle the Asian financial crisis than
many other countries because it's financial and industrial
development policies are good and are properly implemented.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), made the remarks in a recent interview with the
CNA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will stimulate its domestic demand and encourage private
investment in order to tide over the financial crisis sweeping Asia,
he added.</P>
      <P>The following is the transcript of the interview:</P>
      <P>Q: The Asian financial crisis has devastated the economy of many
countries for a year. Taiwan has fared relatively well amid the
crisis. Can you please explain why?</P>
      <P>A: The Republic of China on Taiwan is one of the three countries
in the region that are able to achieve economic growth this year. In
addition, our currency depreciation is relatively mild, and our stock
market is rather stable, when compared with those of other Asian
countries. All of these indicate that our economy is rather healthy.</P>
      <P>I believe this is because our financial policy and industrial
development policy are appropriate.</P>
      <P>Because of trade surplus, we have accumulated a big amount of
foreign exchange reserves. And our foreign debts are almost nil,
when compared with those of many other Asian countries. This is
because we have enough savings for domestic investment, and because
we have steadily carried out our financial policy.</P>
      <P>In the past decade, we have successfully transformed our
labor-intensive industries into technology-intensive industries, as
can been seen from the vigorous development of our information
industry. As a result, our export trade and our economy have been
growing pretty well in the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>The economy of Singapore and Taiwan are rather healthy, because
the financial and industrial development policies of the two
countries are pretty good. Japan's economy is the second largest in
the world because of its successful industrial development policies.
But its financial policy has plunged its economy into deep recession.</P>
      <P>Q: Can you shed some light on the impact of the Asian financial
crisis on Taiwan? What factors will affect the recovery of the Asian
economy?</P>
      <P>A: Like flu, the financial crisis is sweeping all countries in
Asia. It reduces domestic demand, raises jobless rates, causes
currency depreciation, cuts investment, pushes up consumer prices,
and decreases imports.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan's export trade in the first seven months of
this year was eight percent lower than a year earlier. Fortunately,
our exports to Europe grew seven percent during the period, and the
exports to the United States and Central America increased one
percent. Our exports to Japan and South Korea reduced 25 percent
during the period, but it was caused by external factors. Exports to
Asia account for 50 percent of Taiwan's total export trade.</P>
      <P>I believe the economic performances of Indonesia, Japan, and
mainland China are pivotal in the future stability of the Asian
economy.</P>
      <P>Political instability, drought, and high jobless rates are
hurting the economy of Indonesia, which may affect the pace of
economic recovery in other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Japan's jobless rates have climbed to 4.1 percent, and the
Japanese yen is still weak, after the country's financial policy
failed. The Japanese people's lack of confidence in the economy
was attributable to the Liberal Democratic Party's loss in recent
parliamentarian elections. The new cabinet appears to be unable to
solve the problems of bad loans and weak currency. The government
is now trying to revive the economy by cutting taxes and increasing
public spending.</P>
      <P>The economy and export trade of mainland China are being hurt by
the government control of foreign exchange rates. The control
has greatly reduced the import of many materials and semi-finished
products from Taiwan for processing in mainland China.</P>
      <P>We hope that the Japanese government will enact laws to
revitalize its stock and foreign exchange markets. It will benefit
Japan and other Asian countries, and help stabilize the currency of
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Q: What measures should the government take to maintain Taiwan's
economic development when the impact of the Asian financial crisis
is still lingering?</P>
      <P>A: Our trade surplus has reduced sharply. Its contribution to
our economic growth has dropped below zero. To make up the loss we
have to stimulate the domestic demand. We don't have to cut taxes to
stimulate consumption, because our domestic consumption is quite
normal.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian on Sunday
hailed the Mucha line of the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit System
receiving ISO 9002 certification, calling it an honor to both Taipei
and the entire island.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the certification to the hard work and
contributions from the entire staff of the municipally run Taipei

the French-built Mucha line is operating so smoothly now, having
experienced fires, derailments and other mechanical problems in the

System, which was officially opened to the public March 28, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Mucha line, Taipei's first mass rapid transit line, is the

      <P>Hsu, 58, said he was feeling better Sunday, but his condition has

      <P>Doctors have not yet decided whether to operate to remove the

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Alarmed by worsening economic turmoil in
Asia, Russia and elsewhere, Prime Minister John Howard on Sunday
afternoon set federal elections for Oct. 3.</P>
      <P>In an impromptu press conference in Canberra, Howard said he
called on the governor-general earlier in the day and recommended to
him that the House of Representatives be dissolved and the election
be held on Oct. 3.</P>
      <P>He said economic management would be the key issue in his bid for
a second term. "In the area of taxation, we have a plan for the
nation's future. Labor (Party) has a serious promise to buy votes."</P>
      <P>But Labor leader Kim Beazley said: "Mr. Howard does not have a
plan for the nation. He has a plan for a tax. A tax which would be
like a dead-head for our national economy.</P>
      <P>Howard, however, said the tax would strengthen Australia and
boost employment.</P>
      <P>Beazley is promising his own tax cuts worth A$5 billion (US$3.12
billion) for low-income earners and working families.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Howard was forced to announce an earlier
election than planned because of fears that continued economic
turmoil would cost Howard support.</P>
      <P>"Howard is worried by this scenario. The longer he waits for the
next election, the less support he will get as the economic agenda
will turn bad for him and make him more difficult to sell his
policies," one analyst said.</P>
      <P>The coalition government of Liberal and National parties under
Howard can afford to lose only 17 seats in the House of
Representatives.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Australian Democrats Party said it was worried by
this year's election because the One Nation Party would be fielding
candidates in both Senate and House elections.</P>
      <P>"If One Nation succeeds in winning a few seats at the House of
Representatives and to become a balance of power, it would be the
House of horrors," the Democrats leader said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S BUSINESS CONFIDENCE DROPS TO RECORD LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Business confidence levels in Australia
have slumped to record lows, said Prime Minister John Howard, who
also warned that the full impact of the Asian financial crisis is
expected to hit the country in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The index of business confidence, prepared by the Australian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), tumbled from 48.9 points in
the second quarter of 1998 to 39.9 points mid-way through the third
quarter.</P>
      <P>"Business is rightly worried about the trends and has judged that
the effect of the present high level of international instability
will lower growth," ACCI chief executive Mark Peterson said.</P>
      <P>"It could hardly be otherwise," he added.</P>
      <P>"The circumstances of the world economy reinforce the absolute
need that the economic foundations of Australia be as strong as
possible," Howard said.</P>
      <P>"As we look out an unfriendly -- even hostile -- economic world
around us, we are able to say that Australia has weathered that storm
remarkably well," he added.</P>
      <P>But Howard warned the worst was still to come in terms of the
full impact of Asia's ills on the Australian economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCIENTISTS SEE SLOWDOWN OF CFC-12 INCREASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>German researchers have discovered the
evidence of a leveling off in the growth of the ozone-depleting
chemical CFC-12 in the upper atmosphere over Europe, said Dr. Paul
Lehman, an atmospheric scientist at Australia's Bureau of
Meteorology.</P>
      <P>But Lehman told the Sydney Morning Herald that the total volume
of CFC-12, which is used in the refrigerator as coolant, is still
increasing. CFC-12 lasts longer in the environment than any other
ozone-unfriendly chemical and accounts for 30 percent of all CFCs in
the atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Inert in the lower atmosphere, CFCs undergo a chemical reaction
that produces ozone-destroying chlorine and bromine as CFCs rise to
meet the ozone layer -- 10 to 40 kilometers above the Earth, he said.</P>
      <P>"The level of CFC production and atmospheric loading is leveling
out, but there are a great lot of uncertainties with respect to the
ozone hole," he said.</P>
      <P>He said Australian experts have detected an increase in the
atmospheric levels of another chemical, halon-1202, which is also
strongly linked with the destruction of ozone.</P>
      <P>Australia is pressing to have halon-1202 included in the Montreal
Protocol agreement on the phasing out of chemicals destructive to the
atmosphere, said Dr. Paul Fraser, a scientist at the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Canberra.</P>
      <P>CFCs are responsible for 80 percent of ozone loss and halons for
the other 20 percent, Fraser said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC WARNS FOREIGN SPECULATORS NOT TO TAMPER WITH LOCAL UNIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) on Monday
warned international speculators not to set their sights on Taiwan,
saying they would be thoroughly routed if they attempt to attack the
New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>Chou Ah-ting, director-general of the CBC's Foreign Exchange
Department, aimed the warning squarely at US investor George Soros
after newspapers reported that Soros' Quantum and Quota funds seek to
destabilize Taiwan's financial market.</P>
      <P>Soros reportedly lost US$3 billion in the Hong Kong stock market
on Saturday following market intervention by the Hong Kong
government, which has accused Soros of trying to manipulating its
markets.</P>
      <P>Stressing the CBC's determination to combat international
speculators, Chou said the CBC is closely monitoring Soros' movements
in the local financial market and that an initial government
investigation has found no evidence to support the allegations that
Soros' funds are preparing to launch an assault on the NT dollar.</P>
      <P>Chou said the soundness of Taiwan's financial market makes it
impossible for international speculators to benefit from attacks on
the local currency. He added that speculators cannot obtain large
amounts of local currency -- a necessary prerequisite for launching
an attack -- since the CBC banned non-delivering forward trading on
May 20 of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S GOLD PRODUCTION HITS RECORD HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's gold production industry has
lost none of its luster even amid plunging global gold prices, as
increased production has enabled the industry to outshine its
competitors in South Africa and North America.</P>
      <P>Australia's gold production rose 6 percent in fiscal 1997-98 to a
record 318 tons from 1996-97 levels, brushing off both negative
market sentiment and falling global prices.</P>
      <P>"Gold production on an annual basis has continued to rise. The
industry is performing well despite the widespread negative market
sentiment over the past year," said Sandra Close, managing director
of the Melbourne-based mining consulting group Surbiton Associates,
told the Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>Gold prices plummeted to an 18-year low of US$276.50 an ounce on
Friday on fears of widespread selling from producing countries such
as South Africa, Australia and Canada.</P>
      <P>The slide was sparked by major hedge funds anticipating the sales
which were tipped in response to the commodity-based currencies of
the countries being crushed on world markets.</P>
      <P>Close said Australia's gold industry proved itself the most
efficient in the world and has largely avoided the massive shutdowns
and redundancies which have plagued the biggest producer, South
Africa and the second largest, North America.</P>
      <P>Australia ranks third in terms of gold production in the world
and exports its bullion to many countries, including Taiwan,
mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and other Asian countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, ISRAEL TO SET UP SCI-TECH COOPERATION FUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and Israel have
agreed to establish a cooperative fund to promote research in
sophisticated industrial technology, a visiting Israeli official said
on Monday.</P>
      <P>"The two sides are now negotiating technical details concerning
the proposed fund, including the amount and operational rules," Max
Livnat, senior deputy director-general of the Ministry of Industry
and Trade of Israel, said in an exclusive interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>If the proposal is realized, it will be the first cooperative
fund between Taiwan and Israel.</P>
      <P>"The fund will lay a solid foundation for the two countries to
cooperate in high-technology research and development," Livnat said,
adding he is convinced that both countries will benefit from the
project because they complement each other in many high-tech fields.</P>
      <P>Livnat, who arrived in Taipei on Sunday for an eight-day visit,
said Israel has promoted science and technology research cooperation
with other countries by setting up joint funds to finance R&amp;D
projects.</P>
      <P>"We have established sci-tech cooperative funds with the United
States, Singapore, Germany, France and the Netherlands," Livnat said.</P>
      <P>Among those funds, the US$110 million US-Israel cooperative
project is the most successful, he said.</P>
      <P>Livnat said the United States and Israel each contributed US$55
million to the fund and used interest income to finance high-tech
research and development. Board members of the fund meet twice a
year.</P>
      <P>"Over the past 20 years, the fund has managed to help nurture
many noted enterprises in both countries," Livnat said.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties between Taipei and
Tel Aviv, Livnat said he does not see any obstacle to the proposed
establishment of a joint Taiwan-Israeli fund.</P>
      <P>"We reached a conclusion, even if you don't have diplomatic
relationship, you can do a lot of things," he explained, adding that
he does not see any sensitivity in nonpolitical areas.</P>
      <P>Asked when the proposed Taiwan-Israeli fund can be inaugurated,
Livnat said the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel is expected
to make a final decision after details are worked out with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Livnat denied a newspaper report that he will
negotiate defense technology cooperative projects with Taiwan during
his current visit.</P>
      <P>"My visit has nothing to do with defense affairs. I am completely
not involved in any defense project," the senior Israeli official
stressed.</P>
      <P>Livnat went on to say he will take advantage of his current trip
to promote Taiwan investment in Israel.</P>
      <P>Noting that Israel is widely recognized as a technologically
advanced country, Livnat said Israel has signed free trade agreements
with the United States, the 15-member European Union, Canada, Mexico,
Turkey and many East European countries.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Livnat said, Israel can serve as a
bridgehead for Taiwan companies to tap into the Middle East and
European markets.</P>
      <P>Livnat also said his country welcomes Taiwan's participation in a
series of events to be held in celebration of Israel's 50th founding
anniversary. These include many large-scale trade and economic
conferences such as the Oct. 13-16 Prime Minister Economic Conference
and the Nov. 9-12 telecommunications technology trade fair.</P>
      <P>In addition, Livnat said a delegation composed of senior
executives of 28 Israeli high-tech firms will visit Taiwan on Sept.
16-17 to seek joint-venture partners.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Israel has grown steadily in
recent years. In 1997, Taiwan exported US$315.6 million worth of
products to Israel, and imported US$226.2 million worth of Israeli
merchandise.</P>
      <P>Livnat will visit Taiwan's major economic, trade and industrial
institutions and meet with senior ROC officials during his stay here.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL INVESTORS URGED TO STAY CALM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang and Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Wang Rong-chou on
Monday urged local investors to stay calm and confident despite a
string of slides in the domestic stock market.</P>
      <P>Attributing recent falls in the local bourse mainly to the
psychological impact of the Hong Kong market's recent plummet, the
vice finance minister called on investors to have confidence, and
said the Finance Ministry has instructed the Securities and Futures
Commission to closely watch movements by foreign speculators to
ensure fair and rational operations in the local stock market.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks following a slide of 185.81 points in the
local stock market on Monday. The weighted index, the local stock
market's key barometer, closed at 6,550.11.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong stock shares tumbled by more than 400 points on Monday
after government intervention over the weekend in a bid to foil
international speculators. The Hong Kong government, which accused US
investor George Soros of attempting to manipulate its market,
reportedly spent US$8 billion last Saturday in a frenzied buying
spree to prop up the Hong Kong stock market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, major Chinese-language newspapers in Hong Kong,
including the Oriental Daily News and the Wen Wei Po, carried
extensive reports on a decision by Taiwan authorities to ban sales of
Soros' Quota and Quantum funds on the island.</P>
      <P>The Oriental Daily News said the initiative will help Taiwan save
large amounts of foreign reserves to defend against Soros' attacks on
its currency, while the Wen Wei Po maintained its traditional support
of government crackdowns on illegal speculative trading.</P>
      <P>Dao Tung, an economic analyst with the Credit Suisse First Boston
(Hong Kong) Ltd., told CNA he believes that it will be very hard for
international speculators to attack Taiwan's financial markets as
they have in Hong Kong, because Taiwan's financial market is more
tightly controlled than Hong Kong's.</P>
      <P>"International hedge funds will find it very difficult to
destabilize Taiwan's financial market using the same methods which
they used in Hong Kong," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Addressing Taiwan's decision to ban local banks from selling
Soros' funds, Dao described it as a "natural" move following the
year-long Asian financial crisis, which he said has hit some emerging
markets in the region very hard.</P>
      <P>Those crisis-plagued countries, and even Taiwan, will undoubtedly
want to impose some restrictive measures on foreign capital movement
in their local markets, he noted, adding that "basically, one country
has the right to take measures necessary to defend its own financial
sector."</P>
