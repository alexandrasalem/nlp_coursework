    <HEADLINE>DPP UNDECIDED OVER BLUE-FREE POLLING</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  leadership Wednesday reached a
preliminary consensus on adopting strict measures to exclude the opinions of
non-supporters from the process to nominate candidates for at-large legislators
in the year-end election, party officials said.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee Wednesday discussed the recently heatedblue-
voter-exclusionissue. However, no resolution was reached that day and
controversy still flies over whether the measure should be applied to primaries
for constituency legislator and presidential elections, party officials said.</P>
      <P>The DPP has a primary system which takes into account both opinion polls
involving general citizens and voting by party members, with the former weighted
70 percent and the latter 30 percent. Concerned about the influence of
opposition-leaning voters on the polls that will determine who represents the
party in elections for presidential and legislative seats, the party last year
adopted a measure to limit the number of effective samples in telephone polls.</P>
      <P>According to the measure scheduled  to be enacted in the legislative election at
the end of the year, two questions are to be added to the questionnaire. The
first asks which political camp the interviewee favors -- thepan-greencamp led
by the DPP, or its opponentpan-bluealliance. Awrong answerto this question will
result in the questionnaire being discarded if the person surveyed then
answersNoto the following question: Would you, however, vote for a DPP candidate
this time if you believe he or she is a good candidate?</P>
      <P>Not satisfied by the previous policy designed to exclude only deep bluevoters -
namely diehard supporters of the blue camp, DPP lawmakers Chai Trong-rong and
Wang Shih-cheng recently initiated a proposal to exclude moreblue votersfrom
being counted in the nomination polls.</P>
      <P>The stricter version requires that the interviewees be asked whether they have
voted for candidates of the Kuomintang, the People First Party, or the New Party
in any of the pass three major elections: the 2004 presidential election, the
legislative election that year, and the 2005 county-level commissioner elections
or the 2006 Taipei and Kaohsiung City mayoral elections, depending on the
respondent's  constituency.  A  singleyeswould  void  the questionnaire.</P>
      <P>Proponents of the stricter version argue that it would enhance members' loyalty
to the party and strengthen solidarity within the party, while opponents say it
would distract centrist voters and make the party more inward-looking and
narrow-minded.</P>
      <P>Chai Trong-rong said Wednesday that the current system is unfair in that DPP
politicians who attack the party or President Chen Shui-bian enjoy higher
popularity ratings than those who defend the party and Chen.</P>
      <P>Those who are loyal to the party are unlikely to win support from blue voters in
the polling, he said.Lawmakers in the party will be eager to attack President
Chen if only to boost their polling numbers should the blue-exclusion clauses
not be established.</P>
      <P>Wang Shih-cheng had said he would withdraw from the party and run as an
independent candidate in the year-end election if the party fails to adopt the
strict blue-exclusion clauses.</P>
      <P>Yang Chiu-Hsing, Kaohsiung County Commissioner and a member of the DPP's central
standing committee, said the that an exclusion of deep blue voters is enough
andlight blueas well as swing voters should be included.</P>
      <P>As the year-end election will be the first under the single member constituency
system, in which each constituency elects only one lawmaker, the DPP will need
to attract more middle-of-the-road voters who has no strong party ties and tend
to choose from among the candidates, not according to party linesYang said,
responding to media queries before the committee meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-Shui, a DPP figure who quit his legislative seat in protest last
November over the party's inaction on corruption scandals, called the strict
blue-exclusion pollingridiculous.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP should be confident in its current course as the trend in recent
years has shown greater numbers of ballots cast for the party, adding that
strict exclusion will only lead to a shrinking of the party's base.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CONSENSUS REACHED ON EXPANSION OF CHARTER FLIGHTS: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have reached a consensus on expanding direct
cross-strait charter flight services and allowing Chinese citizens to take such
flights, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after a Beijing official in charge of Taiwan
affairs said earlier in the day that "all technical barriers" have been removed
to offering direct cross-strait passenger flights on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC official, representatives from the two sides have indeed
met recently to discuss both how to make cross-strait personnel and cargo
transport more convenient and the feasibility of expanding charter flights.
"Initial consensus has been achieved after extensive discussion," he
acknowledged.</P>
      <P>On pasenger flights, the two sides discussed how to expand the service target.
At present, only Taiwanese citizens are eligible to take direct cross-strait
charter flights on special festivals or for emergency or humanitarian purposes.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is determined to open its door to Chinese tourists, the official said,
the government is not opposed to expanding the charter flight service targets to
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>As to the frequency of direct cross-strait character flights, the official  said
the two sides have also reached a preliminary consensus, but he didn't elaborate
on the exact number of the flights to be allowed per week or the time intervals.</P>
      <P>While the two sides have agreed on allowing Chinese tourists to take direct
cross-strait charter flights, the official said they have not yet completed
talks on details regarding entry of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Noting that charter flights and opening to Chinese tourists are being dealt with
by different government departments, the official said the goal of allowing
Chinese tourists to come to Taiwan via direct charter flights will become a
reality when negotiations on both topics are completed.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, personnel from both sides are expected to meet again
before the Chinese New Year, which falls on Feb. 18, in the hope of finalizing
talks on certain contentious points.</P>

      <P>The U.S. State Department reiterated Wednesday that the Taiwan Relations Act
remains one of the basic guidelines for U.S. policy on cross-Taiwan Strait ties
and that the United States will fulfill its obligations towards Taiwan as
defined in the law.</P>
      <P>"It (the Taiwan Relations Act) still applies, and we still intend to live up to
our obligations, " State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said during a daily
press briefing, in response to a question on the issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the U.S. policy on cross-strait relations during a Senate hearing
Tuesday, John Negroponte, nominee for deputy secretary of state, said the United
States supports a "one-China" policy and sticks to the three communiques with
China but stopped short of mentioning the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>According  to Negroponte,  Taiwan's  plan to enact  a new constitution might
conflict with the U.S. policy.</P>
      <P>Asked if the State Department has tried to privately advise Taiwan to drop the
plan, McCormack said: "We have made very clear what our policy is, and it's no
different than what you have heard in public."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT LEE CLARIFIES STANCE ON TAIWAN'S FUTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
02/01/07  11:55:52
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui has clarified his stance on Taiwan's development
goal, saying Taiwan's urgent task lies in "normalization of its national
identity " rather than independence.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with cable TV channel TVBS Wednesday, Lee claimed that
he has never advocated de jure Taiwan independence because Taiwan is already an
independent sovereign country.</P>
      <P>"It's wrong to pursue independence now that Taiwan is already an independent
country. But it is still not a normal country. Its constitution does not
originate in Taiwan and is irrelevant to Taiwan's needs and situation," Lee
explained.</P>
      <P>He further said that what Taiwan needs most lies in making it a normal and
complete country, with rectifying its name and writing a new constitution
relevant to its unique circumstances and cultural and social context as its
daunting challenges.</P>
      <P>Lamenting that the country has become increasingly divided over the
"independence versus unification" debate, Lee said it's unwise to waste time and
energy on such a "false" issue.</P>
      <P>"It will do no good and is in fact very detrimental to Taiwan, " Lee warned.</P>
      <P>He further explained that since Taiwan is already democratized, with the people
electing their own government and top leader, time need not be wasted on
debating the issue of independence or unification.</P>
      <P>Claiming that bickering over the issue in the past few years has impeded
improvement of the people's livelihood, Lee said major domestic political
parties should shift their focus from such senseless squabbles to more
meaningful issues, such as economic development.</P>
      <P>Lee also rebutted criticism that the discord over the country's future was
fueled by his controversial definition of relations between Taiwan and China as
a "special state-to-state" relationship near the end of his 12-year presidency.</P>
      <P>The former president clarified that he has never characterized cross-Taiwan
Strait relations as "one country on each side" of the strait nor has he
advocated a so-called "two states" theory.</P>
      <P>"What I have said is that cross-strait ties are a special state-to-state
relationship. The word 'special' implies profound meaning," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He argued that Taiwan differs from China in many ways. "For one thing, the two
sides have different lifestyles. We in Taiwan can develop our own culture. We
don't want ethnic rifts which would hinder social progress," he added.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Lee also clarified his description of Taiwan's previous
Kuomintang (KMT) government as an alien regime. "That was because the KMT
government was not popularly elected. Under its authoritarian rule, people
didn't enjoy freedom and political rights. But gone are those days. We now have
freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly and freedom of
expression as well as democracy, and we need not highlight the sins or
injustices of that era anymore," he contended.</P>
      <P>Lee further clarified a Next Magazine report which said that he intends to visit
China. "The report is problematic and incorrect. I see no need for me to propose
a visit to China," he said.</P>
      <P>With China growing ever stronger economically and militarily, Lee said, Taiwan
has much to do by using the platform provided by the World Trade Organization
(WTO) which is one of the few international organizations that admit both Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's service industry has been hit hardest by the exodus of
manufacturing companies and the flow of investment capital to China over the
past decade, Lee said the government should craft a mechanism for capital to
flow back to Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>"As far as the economy is concerned, nothing should be unilateral or a one-way
track. Capital flow always needs a two-way track to facilitate balance," Lee
said.</P>
      <P>For this issue, Lee said, Taiwan must formulate a sound system and use the WTO
as a conduit for constructive economic exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on Chinese President Hu Jintao, Lee refrained from making
any comments.  He instead said he sees differences between Hu and Hu's
predecessor, Jiang Zemin, in their strategies toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"When Taiwan held its first-ever direct presidential election in 1996 as a
critical step toward democratization, Jiang ordered test-firing of missiles to
intimidate Taiwanese voters and adopted other saber-rattling strategies against
Taiwan. Such practices were not constructive, " he said, adding that cross-
strait issues should be addressed with a moderate approach and that Taiwan
itself should also think how to better deal with China with vision and
foresight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY TO HAVE 8 CONSTITUENCIES FOR LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City will be divided into eight constituencies for the year-end
legislative elections, according to the newly promulgated districting scheme.</P>
      <P>After many twists and turns, the Central Election Commission (CEC) managed to
secure 11th-hour compromises to complete electoral redistricting shortly before
the legal deadline Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Redistricting is necessary for the new Legislative Yuan elections because a new
"single-member constituency, two vote" electoral system will be adopted and the
number of legislative seats will be cut to 113 from 225 in line with a package
of constitutional amendments passed in 2005.</P>
      <P>According to the new districting blueprint, Taipei City's first constituency
will cover the Peitou administrative district and 13 boroughs in the Shihlin
district.</P>
      <P>The second constituency will be comprised of Tatung district and 38 boroughs in
the Shihlin district; the third constituency will include the Chungshan district
and 20 boroughs in the Sungshan district.</P>
      <P>The fourth constituency will encompass both the Neihu and Nankang administrative
districts, while the fifth constituency will cover Wanhua district and 21
boroughs in the Chungcheng district.</P>
      <P>The sixth constituency  will cover the Taan administrative district, and the
seventh constituency will contain the Hsinyi district and 13 boroughs in the
Sungshan district, while the eighth constituency will incorporate the Wenshan
district and 10 boroughs in the Chungcheng district.</P>
      <P>Taipei was among the 10 cities and counties where electoral redistricting was
not finalized until Wednesday. Six of them upheld the CEC-drafted redistricting
plans, including Taipei City, while disputes over the remaining four were
finally settled by way of lot drawing.</P>
      <P>The  opposition-controlled  Legislative  Yuan  approved  the CEC-drafted
redistricting designs for 15 cities and counties around the country before its
winter session concluded Jan. 19.</P>
      <P>As the next legislative elections could result in major changes in the domestic
political landscape, major political parties are reluctant  to surrender  even
the smallest  advantage,  making compromises difficult to reach.</P>
      <P>After grueling negotiations between Premier Su Tseng-chang and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng in accordance with legal provisions, decisions were
finally reached Wednesday evening that the CEC-drafted redistricting  blueprints
for six other cities and counties -- Taipei City, Taichung County, Taichung
City, Tainan County, Changhua County and Miaoli County -- will also be upheld.</P>
      <P>With Su and Wang's assent,  redistricting designs for the remaining four --
Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Kaohsiung City and Pingtung County -- were
determined by way of drawing lots based on versions presented by legislative
caucuses of individual political parties or versions previously worked out by
the legislature through consensus.</P>
      <P>Among them, Kaohsiung City will take up the redistricting plan fleshed out
through previous consensus; Taipei County will apply the blueprint initiated by
the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) ; Taoyuan County will embrace the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's proposal; and Pingtung County will adopt
the version agreed upon by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), the People
First Party (PFP) , the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) and the TSU.</P>
      <P>The southern port city of Kaohsiung, which is the country's second largest city
after Taipei, will be divided into five electoral constituencies, according to
the new districting scheme.</P>
      <P>Taipei County, the county's most populous administrative region, will be divided
into 12 constituencies according to the TSU-drafted blueprint.</P>
      <P>The northern county of Taoyuan will be subdivided into six constituencies
according to the DPP-initiated plan,  while the southernmost  county of Pingtung
will be divided  into three constituencies based on the proposal agreed upon by
the KMT, the PFP, the NPSU and the TSU.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the central counties of Taichung and Changhua will be divided into
five and four constituencies, respectively; and Tainan County and Taichung City
will have three constituencies each.</P>
      <P>Tainan City and the southern counties of Kaohsiung, Yunlin, Chiayi, Nantou and
Miaoli will each have two constituencies, while the remaining seven counties --
Yilan, Hsinchu, Hualien, Taitung, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu -- and three cities,
namely Hsinchu, Keelung and Chiayi, will each have one constituency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh expressed confidence Wednesday in his possible bid to
run for the presidency in 2008.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is in Washington D.C. to attend the National Prayer Breakfast on
behalf of President Chen Shui-bian,  told Taiwan reporters that he is an
outright optimist who has confidence in a lot of things, including his possible
presidential bid.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh said he has no plan to discuss with the U.S. side his
presidential visions during his current visit, because he has not officially
become  the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party's presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he will meet with U.S. officials during the trip to discuss issues
such as Taiwan's plan to reform its Constitution and the delayed arms
procurement package from the United States.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said it may be hard for foreigners to understand why Taiwan cannot place
national security before partisan differences, but a lot of things are not under
the government's control now that Taiwan is a democratic country.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Cabinet has tried very hard but failed to have the legislature
pass the budget for the arms procurement during the last legislative session and
that he will try to explain the matter properly to the U.S. side.</P>
      <P>During an interview with SET TV in Taipei Monday, Hsieh said he is seriously
considering whether to run for the presidency in 2008 and when to announce his
bid if he decides to do so.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he first needs to complete a tour of Taiwan's 23 counties and cities
to assess his own ability to shoulder such a great responsibility and to
evaluate his support among the people before making a decision.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has made developing renewable energy an important policy and set
a target of increasing the installed capacity of renewable energy in the country
to 12 percent of total production by 2020, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen
Ruey-long said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the development of renewable energy faces various
challenges, such as high production costs and technological difficulties, the
new policy will help Taiwan realize its goal of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and increasing the ratio of domestically-produced energy.</P>
      <P>The policy could also revitalize unplanted farmland and boost the development of
the biomass energy industry, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Public buses in southern Kaohsiung City have started using biodiesel, and the
government will select two more counties or cities in June to expand and promote
the use of biodiesel, he said.</P>
      <P>By 2008, all diesel sold on the market will be a blend containing 1 percent of
biomass diesel, with the content of biomass diesel expected to increase to 3
percent by 2010, he said.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks during a conference on the development of
renewable energy held by National Central University's Research Center for
Taiwan's Economic Development, the Grace T.H.W Group, and an economics
association.</P>
      <P>Sharing the experience of Brazil during the conference, Brazilian
parliamentarian Luiss Piauhylino de Mello Monteiro said Brazil started to
experiment with blending gasoline and ethanol in 1925, with the government
offering incentives such as tax cuts and production loans.</P>
      <P>According to Piauhylino, Brazil is now the world's largest producer and exporter
of cane-based ethanol, the world's largest consumer of fuel ethanol and the
world's third largest consumer of cane sugar.</P>
      <P>Every year, Brazil produces 15 billion liters of ethanol, exports 19.6 million
tons of cane sugar and 3.1 billion liters of ethanol, which generates 12 billion
reais (US$5.66 billion) in annual revenue for the country, he said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that Taiwan's donation of
US$5 million to Panama was part of the bilateral humanitarian cooperation
program and not an example of checkbook diplomacy as claimed by some media.</P>
      <P>Yeh Fei-bi, vice director general of MOFA's Department of Information and
Cultural Affairs, said the donation to the Panamanian first lady's office was
held in an open ceremony Jan. 17.</P>
      <P>She was responding to reports by a local newspaper, the China Times, which
quoted La Prensa, Panama's major newspaper, as saying that Taiwan Ambassador Hou
Ping-fu donated the sum to the office of first lady Vivian Ferenandez de
Torrijos via Panamanian First Vice President and Foreign Affairs Minister Samuel
Lewis Navarro Jan. 17, one week after President Chen Shui-bian and Panamanian
President Martin Torrijos Espino met at the inauguration ceremony of Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega Jan. 10.</P>

      <P>She noted that Lewis, while accepting the donation in a ceremony Jan. 17, said
that the money would be channeled into the nation's coffers in an efficient and

      <P>In a rather surprising move, Sung, who took up the health commissioner post on
Feb. 1, 2005, offered his resignation at a news conference called around noon
Thursday, saying that he "feels saddened" over Hau's punishing intervention in
the city's public health policies and "sees no turning point at which his ideals
can be realized under Hau's leadership."</P>
      <P>Sung, who holds a Ph.D. in immunology from Cornell University, New York, said
Hau's "arbitrary" decisions not to retain Taipei City Hospital (TCH) Director
Sun Jui-sheng and the firing of TCH Hoping Branch Superintendent Chu Da-cheng in
the wake of a diagnosis dispute that occurred at the Hoping branch late last
year, were completely unacceptable.</P>

city government meeting Wednesday for "negligence" over the allegedly  illegal
operation  of an after-childbirth confinement and convalescence center in
Taipei, and his demand for a "name list" of TDH officials in charge of related
affairs, were moves tantamount to measures adopted during Taiwan's "white
terror" era, Sung said.</P>

Anatomy and Cell Biology before joining the Taipei city government, asked Hau to
"find somebody smarter" to replace him.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, responding to Sung's surprising resignation, Hau said Sung's
move has indeed taken him by surprise. Hau said he respects Sung's decision.</P>

the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Secretary General Yeh Ming-shui made the remarks as he presided
over a meeting in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, at which representatives from
Taiwan and Japan took part. Japanese representatives had visited banana growing
farms at Chishan and Meinung, Kaohsiung a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that Taiwan exported US$3.29 billion worth of agriculture products in
2006, and Japan was one of its most important export markets, especially
regarding fresh fruits. Bananas have been a mainstay of Taiwan's exports to
Japan.</P>
      <P>But Yeh noted that Philippine bananas have a market share of around 88.5 percent
in Japan, which consumes around one million tons of bananas every year. The
Philippines' market share is followed by that of Ecuator, Mexico and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bananas from Taiwan enjoy a market share of only 1.4 percent in Japan, Yeh said,
showing that there is room for further growth.</P>
      <P>TAITRA has touted the unique flavor of locally produced bananas to the Japanese,
Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The council also hopes that local banana growers will pay attention to quality
control to reassure Japanese buyers and encourage them to increase their
purchases, he added.</P>

      <P>Many patients and their families wrongly believed that the patient should stay

recommended as it can aid in the recovery process.</P>

The institute also recommended that patients practice yoga for 20 to 60 minutes
per session, at least three times per week to boost their strength.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that exercise like yoga, tai chi, and constitutionals is similar in
essence, helping people to moderate their body's condition and improve health.

that Lee was only stressing that there is no need to fuel Taiwan independence
debate at the present stage because Taiwan is already an independent
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, Lee still harbors the dream of turning Taiwan into a normal
country through writing a new constitution for the country and changing its
official designation, and calls for joint efforts from all pro-independence
activists.</P>
      <P>The former president was only kidding when saying that he hopes to visit China,
and his call for an opening to Chinese capital was only part of his efforts to
reverse trends that have resulted in a steady capital flow to China, Tseng
explained, adding that Lee is deeply worried that continuous investment in China
will eventually hurt this country.</P>

      <P>Pigs with genes resistant to rejection have been produced in Taiwan and offer
the prospect of supplying organs for transplant into human bodies, a local
researcher said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tu chin-fu, chief of the Division of Biotechnology at the Animal Technology
Institute Taiwan, said his research team has developed pigs which carry
transplanted genes resistant to acute and severe acute rejection which are
common in organ transplants.</P>
      <P>Noting that thousands of people around the world who need organ transplants die
before suitable donors can be found every year, Tu said xenotransplantation may
offer an option to solve the shortage of donated human organs.</P>
      <P>Pigs, like baboon and chimpanzees, are close to human beings in physical
construction, but unlike the baboon and chimpanzees, they are not protected
animals, and therefore are promising suppliers of organs for human beings, Tu
went on.</P>
      <P>One of the major obstacles in transplanting organs between different species is
rejection, which leads to the failure of the alien organs in the new host body.</P>
      <P>However, Tu said, his team has succeeded in transplanting six genes which resist
rejection into the genome of the pigs.</P>
      <P>During a test designed to examine these genes' effective in human bodies, Tu
said his team circulated human blood into kidneys and lungs removed from such
pigs and found that the removed organs work quiet well.</P>
      <P>The success of the experiment has placed his team at the forefront of this field
in the world, Tu said. The next step for his team, Tu said, will be to develop
pigs which carry all of the six rejection-resistant genes and produce them in en
mass for widespread use.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA MAY DESTROY WORLD'S CHIP SUPPLY CHAIN IF IT ATTACKS TAIWAN</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese provocations against Taiwan could result in an extended disruption to
the world's chip supply chain, particularly as Taiwan is set to become the
world's leading manufacturer of DRAM chips in 2007, U.S.-Taiwan Business Council
President Rupert Hammond-Chambers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hammond-Chambers said the recent destruction of a satellite by a Chinese ICBM
renewed concerns over China's military intentions and its "peaceful" rise in
Asia. "It also drew the world's attention to potential flash points, including
Taiwan and the possibility that China would resort to using force to reunify
with the island, " he said.</P>
      <P>The missile test took place just prior to the release of the council's
"Semiconductor Report - Annual Review 2006, " which anticipates that Taiwan will
become the world's leading manufacturer of DRAM chips in 2007, Hammond-Chambers
noted.</P>
      <P>He quoted  the report in highlighting  Taiwan's  strategic importance in the
chip industry. Taiwan is home to the world's highest concentration of advanced
12-inch semiconductor fabrication plants.</P>
      <P>He also quoted data from Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry that
indicates that Taiwan is not only the leading producer of important
semiconductor technologies like DRAM,  but Taiwan companies are also responsible
for a significant share of global technology production, including approximately
82 percent of notebook computers, 98 percent of motherboards, and 72 percent of
LCD monitors.</P>
      <P>U.S. companies sourced an estimated US$73.3 billion of technology products from
Taiwan in 2006 alone, an 11 percent increase over 2005, he added.</P>
      <P>Hammond-Chambers said the global economy is increasingly reliant on the supply
chain synergies that run through Taiwan and its regional  partners.  "These
partnerships  produce  many of the technological products on which we have
become reliant, and which improve business productivity and empower consumers.
Present trends point towards Taiwan strengthening its position in certain key
sectors, particularly in semiconductors," he added.</P>
      <P>Hammond-Chambers  said the council is concerned  about the potential costs to
the United States if that critical supply chain is severed by "acts of god" such
as an earthquake like that which struck in 1999, or if provocative actions
undertaken by Beijing resulted in an extended supply chain disruption.</P>
      <P>Semiconductors are critical not only to commercial businesses, but also to
modern warfare, he said, adding that a reliable and robust supply base is a
crucial component of any country's modern military. This is true in particular
for the United States, as it relies on a single semiconductor manufacturer to
provide it with all of the chips it requires for national security, and where
additional supplies of chips must come from commercial sources, he said.</P>

French President Jacques Chirac said this week that if Iran had one or two
nuclear weapons, it would not pose a big danger, and that if Iran were to launch
a nuclear weapon against a country like Israel, it would lead to the immediate
destruction of Tehran. The remarks, made in an interview on Monday with The New
York Times, The International Herald Tribune and Le Nouvel Observateur, a weekly
magazine, were vastly different from stated French policy and what Chirac has
often said. On Tuesday, Mr. Chirac summoned the same journalists back to Elysee
Palace to retract many of his remarks.

Wall Street Journal: Wal-Mart Cuts Taxes By Paying Rent to Itself

As the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pays billions of dollars a
year in rent for its stores. Luckily for Wal-Mart, in about 25 states it has
been paying most of that rent to itself -- and then deducting that amount from
its state taxes. The arrangement takes advantage of a tax loophole that the
federal government plugged decades ago, but which many states have been slower
to catch.</TEXT>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is to establish a new facility in the
eastern county of Taitung, utilizing deep ocean water to cultivate high-altitude
vegetables, mushrooms and flower, MOEA officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The project comes after the successful application of deep ocean water to
bottled drinking water, cosmetics and aquaculture to further exploit the
business opportunity of "blue gold" -- a nickname for deep ocean water, they
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's recent destruction of a satellite with an intercontinental ballistic
missile was aimed at flexing its military muscles to the world and warning Japan
and the United States against tampering in the Taiwan issue, Deputy Defense
Minister Ko Cheng-en was quoted as saying Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ko was quoted in an interview with the Chinese-language Yazhou Zhoukan as saying
he considers China's development of anti-satellite weapons and its recent
demonstration of J10 fighters were targeted on the situation after a planned
meeting between the U.S. defense secretary and his Japanese counterpart and a
meeting between the U.S. state department secretary and her Japanese counterpart
-- the so-called "two plus two meeting."</P>
      <P>Ko said China's latest military actions were partly aimed at warning the U.S.
and Japan that should they intervene in a cross-Taiwan Strait conflict, they
will suffer the consequences.</P>
      <P>He noted that it was unusual for China's air force to conduct two large-scale
exercises near Shanghai in December, with even the airports in Shanghai closed
at certain points during the maneuvers.</P>
      <P>Although having expressed concern over the destruction of the satellite by a
Chinese ICBM, Washington was somewhat quieter than other major powers around the
world over the matter, Ko said, adding that it was probably because the United
States still needs Beijing's support over issues regarding the Iraq war, North
Korea's nuclear program and the Iran issue.</P>
      <P>Ko said China might intimidate Taiwan by firing anti-satellite missiles as a
result of Taiwan's political situation, particularly President  Chen Shui-bian's
reiteration  of his desire for a constitutional re-engineering plan, but added
that intimidating Taiwan was not the sole purpose of the recent missile
demonstration.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing has used many means to intimidate Taiwan in the past, including
conducting live-ammunition war games in the Taiwan Strait,  moving its guided
missile deployment and intensifying deployment of jet fighters in coastal areas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on a question of why the Republic of China military has not
demonstrated its strength over the past decade, Ko said the military has
restrained from flexing its muscles for fear of provoking Beijing or having its
actions misunderstood as efforts to seek independence.</P>
      <P>The military has also kept a low profile out of consideration for the stance of
the United States, upon which Taiwan relies for its weapons procurement, Ko
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO EARLY TO SAY WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM REDISTRICTING SCHEME: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA)
02/01/07  21:18:54
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Thursday that it is too early to say who will
benefit most from the redistricting scheme for the year-end legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks after media reports speculated that the redrawing of the 73
constituencies of the nation's 25 cities and countries  could mean more
polarization  of Taiwan's political landscape, with southern Taiwan, which is a
stronghold of the "pan-green camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), turning greener and northern Taiwan, which usually tilts toward the
"pan-blue alliance" led by the Kuomintang (KMT), becoming more blue.</P>
      <P>The premier said it is impossible to tell which camp will gain more from the new
scheme, saying that it will rely on the strength and efforts of the various
parties and candidates.</P>
      <P>The redistricting  was made necessary  because  of a 2005 constitutional
amendment that changed the electoral system for the seventh legislature to a
"single-seat constituency, two votes" from the present "multiple-seat
constituency" and that will see the legislature cut by half to 113 members,
including 73 regional seats from each constituency,  six seats for aborigines
and 34 for legislators-at-large.</P>
      <P>"The redrawing of the constituencies is crucial to each party and candidate, "
Su said, adding that this is why the redistricting work is so grueling and why
eight contentious cities and counties had to resort to a last-minute drawing of
lots.</P>
      <P>Su said that since Jan. 24 he had met with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-
pyng five times for negotiations to try to thrash out the differences over the
eight cities and counties, without success.</P>
      <P>The matter finally had to rely on the drawing of lots to choose from resolutions
floated by the Central Election Commission (CEC) , the Legislative Yuan and
various parties.</P>
      <P>Su expressed hope that all parties "if not satisfied with the result, can at
least accept it and then make the best efforts for the year-end elections."</P>
      <P>The redistricting scheme shows that 21 cities and counties, including  Taipei
and Taichung cities and Miaoli and Changhua counties, which were decided by lot
drawing, have followed the redrawing scheme worked out by the CEC.</P>
      <P>While Taipei County, which has the largest number of 12 seats due to its large
population, follows a proposal by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union,
Taoyuan County adopts a version from the DPP and Kaohsiung City uses a version
agreed upon by the Legislative Yuan. Pingtung County adopts a version proposed
by the KMT, the People First Party, the Taiwan Solidarity Union and the Non-
partisan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, faced with more competitive elections with greatly reduced seats, DPP
Legislator Chen Chin-jun said the DPP has to work with the TSU, saying that if
the TSU fields its own candidate in each constituency, it will impact the "pan-
green camp."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang estimated that the new scheme will be favorable to
the major parties and that the KMT, which currently controls 90 seats in the
219-seat legislature, will garner two-thirds of the seats.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Cheng Chin-ling said her party and the KMT will have to meet next
week at the latest to talk about fielding candidates, as the two parties will be
soliciting support from the same voters.</P>
      <P>In related development, Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun said he regretted
the result of the draw.</P>
      <P>Chu said the initial redistricting scheme sent by the county to the CEC was
based on Chungli and Taoyuan cities having the largest township-level cities in
one constituency each, while the final version has cut more than 10 boroughs
each from the two cities and has given them to other constituencies.</P>
      <P>But Hsu Chung-wen, director of the DPP's Taoyuan branch, was elated, saying that
the new scheme will finally break the KMT's traditional hold on the two cities
and that the DPP will be able to win half of the six seats in Taoyuan County.</P>

      <P>The foundation urged major fast food franchises, including McDonald's and
Starbucks, to take the lead in stopping the use of trans fatty acids, commonly
termed "trans fats, " in preparation of their food.</P>
      <P>Trans fats are created during an industrial process to transform natural liquid

restricted or banned all restaurants and food stands from using trans fats in
preparing fried foods.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials said McDonald's, Starbucks and Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlets in the United States have announced that they have stopped using trans
fats since November 2006.</P>
      <P>The foundation suggested that the government  should exert controls on trans
fats by requiring  foodstuff  producers and processors to state the quantity of

      <P>The Cultural Division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in New
York will hold the 2007 Test of Proficiency-Huayu (TOP) assessment of Chinese
proficiency, for beginner and basic levels in New York on April 15.</P>
      <P>Ethan Kuo, director of TECO Cultural Division, said Wednesday that non-native
Chinese speakers over 16 years-old are encouraged to take the beginner or basic
level test.</P>
      <P>The Test of Proficiency-Huayu is a standardized test developed by the Steering
Committee for the Test of Proficiency-Huayu, affiliated with National Taiwan
Normal University. Given that learning Chinese is becoming ever more popular,
and that Chinese learners may appreciate the opportunity to assess their
proficiency and receive credentials for the reference of educational authorities
or employers, the Republic of China's Ministry of Education has promoted the
assessment system overseas since December 2003.</P>
      <P>The TOP test is designed for Chinese learners at the beginner, basic,
intermediate, and advanced levels. As the test in New York will be the first of
its kind in the United States, TECO will start by offering tests only at the
beginner and basic levels.</P>
      <P>In general, non-native Chinese speakers familiar with at least 800 Chinese
characters, or having taken between 240 hours and 360 hours of Chinese language
lessons can try the beginner's test and those familiar with at least 1,500
Chinese characters or having taken between 360 hours and 480 hours of Chinese
language lessons can try the basic test.</P>
      <P>The test is open to people aged 16 years or older. TECO Cultural Division
expects 200 applicants each for the tests of beginner and basic levels.
Application forms can be downloaded from the website, found at www.edutwny.org.
All applications must be submitted by mail or in person to the Cultural
Division, Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York, 1 East 42nd Street,
6th Floor, New York, NY 10017 before March 15, 2007. In addition to the
application form, three photos, a copy of a valid passport or ID, and payment of
US$28 (for the basic level text only) should be included.</P>
      <P>Encouraging Chinese learners to take the opportunity to measure their Chinese
language proficiency, Kuo said that the Ministry of Education issued credentials
for basic, intermediate as well as advanced levels, which can be used as job
qualification references. For international students seeking Taiwanese
scholarships or applying for academic programs at colleges or universities in
Taiwan, the credentials  are accepted by increasing numbers of educational
establishments requiring Chinese proficiency.</P>

democratic era and one in the preceding KMT era, according to Yu.</P>
      <P>Lee in the democratic era shared the same aspirations as the DPP for Taiwan's
formal independence, to be backed up by a new and tailor-made constitution and a
change of the country's official designation, while Lee in the KMT's
authoritarian era had nothing in common with the DPP, he said.</P>
      <P>"To date, I still believe in Lee, who remains devoted to Taiwan's cause, " Yu
said, claiming that the Taiwan people "will not accept a politician or a
political party that forswears Taiwan's core values."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the TSU headquarters telephone switchboard was jammed with callers
wishing to voice their opinions of Lee's remarks, TSU Secretary-General Lin
Chih-chia said.</P>
      <P>The TSU will also keep collaborating with the DPP if the ruling party continues
sticking to its principles  regarding Taiwan's sovereignty, Lin added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MIXED RESPONSE TO EX-PRESIDENT'S REMARKS DENOUNCING INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>

      <P>Political figures from the ruling and opposition parties were mixed Thursday in
their reactions to the latest remarks made by former President Lee Teng-hui, who
claimed that he never backed Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Lee told Next Magazine, in its latest edition, that he hopes to visit China and
forswears Taiwan independence. The former president and spiritual leader of the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) also urged the government and the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to open up to Chinese capital and
tourists, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu expressed her "astonishment" when asked for her
opinion regarding Lee's denouncement of Taiwan independence. She then argued
that the public must judge a political figure's words and deeds over a long
term.</P>
      <P>In response to reporters' inquiries, Premier Su Tseng-chang insisted that Taiwan
is already an independent sovereignty, though he claimed that he was not fully
aware of Lee's remarks.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a stalwart in the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), however, said that Lee has always been consistent in his
stance regarding Taiwan independence and that Lee was never active in the
movement.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chiang, who once served as KMT secretary-general when Lee
was president and the party's chairman, doubted that the prime purpose of Lee's
denouncement of the Taiwanese independence movement was aimed only at fortifying
the TSU's position in domestic politics.</P>
      <P>This was by no means the first time that Lee has changed his stance regarding
major national issues, Chiang claimed, adding that Lee's statement highlights
the fact that independence is no longer supported by the mainstream of Taiwanese
society and that the cause will attract few voters.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, spokesman of the opposition People First Party (PFP) , accused
Lee of seeking to score political points with the interview. The former
president's changing attitudes only follow the various twists in his political
line, Lee Hung-chun said.</P>
      <P>Sheng Fu-hsiung, a former DPP legislator who is widely viewed as a moderate in
Taiwan's polarized politics, praised what he called the former president's frank
comments in the interview.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Sheng urged the public not to interpret Lee's
remarks negatively. He claimed that Lee was only opposed to unworthy politicians
scheming to manufacture an artificial confrontation by rehashing old issues.</P>
      <P>Sheng  hailed  Lee's pragmatic  attitude  toward  Taiwanese independence and
pointed out that it does not mark a departure from the ruling DPP's resolution
on Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>However, Sheng also called on Lee to provide the public with a clear explanation
for his changing attitudes on the independence issue by discarding his personal
concern for the TSU's future or the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Doing so will help the former president better dispel public misconceptions
about him and encourage social elites to join forces with him, Sheng said.</P>

      <P>Ballots cast in last December's Kaohsiung mayoral election will be recounted
beginning March 12, Kaohsiung District Court officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ruling received praise from Huang Chun-ying, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
mayoral candidate defeated by Chen Chu of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
by just 1,114 votes, or 0.14 percent of the total, and filed a lawsuit seeking
to nullify both the election and Chen's victory.</P>
      <P>"We trust the judiciary, " Huang said at a news conference, with his lawyer
adding that a recount is expected to overturn the Dec. 9 election result. Chen
said the same day that the court ruling was "unacceptable," claiming that Huang
did not offer sufficient evidence to merit a recount.</P>
      <P>Based on the 2004 presidential election recount, which found every polling
station had at least five controversial ballots on average, debatable ballots
across Kaohsiung City's 839 polling stations could be several times the narrow
margin -- in an election that counted more than 6,000 invalid votes, according
to the court ruling.</P>
      <P>Tu Yu-to, a court spokesman, said the complainant had reported nearly 100
irregularities involving nearly 100 polling stations.</P>
      <P>He said the court had started preparations for the recount and that 20 judges
will each lead teams that will include election affairs officials to conduct the
recount, which is estimated to take a week.</P>
      <P>In his lawsuit, Huang contended that Chen's camp not only violated election law
by continuing campaign activities after the 10 p.m. election-eve deadline,  but
also held a late-night press conference to spread a rumor to smear his name.</P>
      <P>The KMT candidate added that on the day of the election, even President Chen
Shui-bian made use of specific news media outlets to accuse him of vote buying
and to claim that even if Huang was elected, his election results would be
invalidated.</P>
      <P>Huang insisted that the DPP's false accusation against him was in disregard of
the electoral law and "apparently" influenced the results of the election and
caused his defeat.</P>
      <P>Huang has filed a separate lawsuit against Chen Chu's camp over the vote-buying
allegation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO REVIEW CARLYLE GROUP'S ASE BUYOUT BID</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will start to review a Carlyle Group's
proposed buyout of Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (ASE) after
completing consultations with relevant government agenices, an official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council called for
the Taiwan government a day earlier to swiftly complete the application process
for Carlyle Group's ASE acquisition bid.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, a non-profit association that groups companies
involved in business between Taiwan and the United States, said in a news
release that the potential deal highlights the ability  of Taiwan companies  to
attract  substantial  foreign investments, greatly benefiting Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>It also underscores the attractiveness of Taiwan's semiconductor market, which
the council has predicted will become the world's largest market for chip
equipment spending and for DRAM production in 2007,  due largely to new
partnerships  and a number of new investments, the press statement said.</P>
      <P>Responding to the U.S. council's comments, the MOEA official in charge of
investment affairs said the buyout application is still in the opinion-
soliciting stage.</P>
      <P>Once the opinion-soliciting process is finalized, the official said the MOEA's
Investment Commission will start to review the case and make a final decision.</P>
      <P>The Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, offered in
early January to purchase ASE, the world's largest chip packaging and testing
company, for approximately US%5.5 billion and take it private.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, the Carlyle Group's intention to
enter Taiwan's semiconductor market reflects the high caliber of Taiwan
businesses and a desire to link the U.S. and Taiwan -- arguably the two most
important semiconductor markets in the world.</P>
      <P>"It is important to move away from the notion that only semiconductor companies
can realize synergies through mergers and acquisitions in the semiconductor
sector. Private equity firms are also well positioned to add value for
shareholders, market sectors, and economies," the council said in its press
statement.</P>

      <P>Disgraced Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng left the United States
Wednesday along with his wife for Myanmar, reliable sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>David Ta-wei Lee, the Republic of China's representative to the United  States,
confirmed  the information,  saying that U.S. authorities twice informed his
office of the couple's departure Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting U.S. authorities, Lee said the Wangs departed Los Angeles 11 p.m.
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sources said the disgraced couple are heading for Myanmar. The sources,
however, would not elaborate on whether the couple left the U.S. out of their
own decision or under pressure from U.S. judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>As to whether the Wangs were leaving under the escort of U.S. law enforcement
officers, Lee said he is not in a position to comment or confirm any relevant
details.</P>
      <P>According to the informed sources, the U.S. authorities couldn't expel or
repatriate the Wangs because Taiwan's judicial authorities had failed to present
concrete criminal evidence involving the couple.</P>
      <P>The Wangs fled to China late last year after two of the group's 120-odd member
companies applied for insolvency restructuring. The fallout triggered a run on
the Chinese Bank, another of the group's affiliates. Subsequent judicial
investigations found that the couple and other family members and corporate
executives were involved in many suspected irregularities, including fraud,
embezzlement, breach of trust and insider trading.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANTED REBAR GROUP HEAD, WIFE ARRIVE IN SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his wife, who have been
placed on Taiwan's most-wanted list, reportedly arrived at Singapore's Changi
Airport Friday morning after leaving the United States the previous day.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been in close contact with
the Singaporean authorities and have been kept abreast of all the latest
developments surrounding the Wangs, who allegedly embezzled billions of dollars
in corporate funds before going on the lam.</P>
      <P>The Wangs fled to China late last year after two of the group's 120-odd member
companies applied for insolvency restructuring. The fallout triggered a run on
the Chinese Bank, another of the group's affiliates. Subsequent judicial
investigations found that the couple and other family members and corporate
executives were involved in many suspected irregularities, including fraud,
embezzlement, breach of trust and insider trading.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister  James Huang has canceled  all activities scheduled for Friday
morning and early afternoon to be ready for a possible repatriation of the Wangs
back to Taiwan during the day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CNA reporter stationed in Singapore reported that Taiwan's judicial
authorities and liaison officials posted in the city-state have been locked in
intensive negotiations with the Singaporean immigration authorities over the
Wangs' repatriation.</P>
      <P>The Singaporean authorities reportedly said Friday morning that there are no
reasons for them to take the Wangs into custody as the couple used authentic
passports and normal travel papers for their entrance.</P>
      <P>Besides,  since Taiwan and Singapore  maintain no judicial assistance accord,
the Singaporean authorities may not respond to Taiwan's request for the Wangs to
be repatriated, according to local law enforcement officials.</P>
      <P>If the Wangs are not repatriated back to Taiwan, it is possible that the
Singaporean authorities may send them back to the United States, according to
the officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, David Ta-wei Lee, Taiwan's representative to the United States,
confirmed Thursday that U.S. authorities had twice informed his office of the
couple's departure from Los Angeles at 11 p.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The U.S. officials said the couple were heading for Myanmar. They, however,
would not elaborate on whether the couple left the United States out of their
own decision or under pressure from U.S. judicial authorities, according to Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL GOVERNMENTS URGED TO INCREASE MANPOWER TO PREVENT CHILD ABUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
02/02/07  12:33:49

    <TEXT>
      <P>City and county governments should fill job vacancies at their social work
divisions in order to better protect children from abuse and provide them with
useful services to enhance their well-being, a Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the MOI implemented a special program last year to
offer direct financial subsidies to local governments for employing  more
trained  social workers  to help children experiencing difficulties or at high
risk of falling victim to violence or filicide-suicide.</P>
      <P>Besides providing 40 percent of the funds needed for recruiting up to 320 social
workers specializing in protecting children around the country from abuse, the
central government has also lifted unnecessary restrictions and cut red tape to
facilitate recruitment of trained social workers.</P>
      <P>After eight months of intensive efforts, the official said, a total of 303
qualified caseworkers have been employed in various cities and counties.</P>
      <P>However, the official said, 17 positions remain unfilled, with Hsinchu and
Changhua counties each having four vacant posts.</P>
      <P>Under the government's new "Mega Warmth" project, the MOI has also pledged full
financial support for local governments to employ more professional social
workers or caseworkers to help high-risk families, particularly those with
abused or neglected children.</P>
      <P>As of the end of January, the official said, 22 caseworker positions under the
"Mega Warmth" project remained unfilled, adding that the southern city of
Kaohsiung has six openings and that the northern county of Taipei has five
vacancies,</P>
      <P>"We hope local governments can speed up social work manpower recruitment so that
their social affairs agencies will no longer be understaffed and overworked and
can be better equipped to protect children from abuse and filicide-suicide, "
the official said, adding that city mayors and county magistrates should pay
more heed to child abuse problems in their districts and take active steps to
address them.</P>
      <P>According to tallies released by the Child Welfare League Foundation, 17
children died from abuse last year, and four more abused kids died last month
alone. If this year's rate continues -- four deaths in a single month -- it
would prove an even deadlier year for children, a foundation spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>The foundation has provided social services to 1,168 high-risk families since
2004. Amid an economic slowdown, the spokeswoman said, 71 percent of those
families were in financial straits, with 52 percent of the parents lacking basic
fiscal discipline and management skills. Worse still, 55 percent of parents were
battling chronic diseases, and 72 percent suffered from depression.</P>
      <P>The children growing up in those families were also not faring well. About 50
percent of the 2,000-plus children who the foundation cared for were
malnourished, and one-third of them were in poor health,  the spokeswoman  said,
adding  that the foundation's caseworkers have been working hard in the hopes of
making a difference.</P>

      <P>Mending and strengthening Taiwan's relations with the United States will be an
important mission of the next president of Taiwan, Premier Frank Hsieh said here
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Taiwan must maintain its credibility while dealing with the
international community, and this can be achieved through frequent
communication.</P>
      <P>Taking U.S. concern over Taiwan's plan to reform its Constitution as an example,
Hsieh said the key point in this issue is whether Taiwan has communicated
effectively with the United States and emphasized that "it is consistent with
the interests of the United States and of the world for Taiwan to practice
democracy."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Taiwan's democracy is a soft power with strong appeal to the
Chinese people and that Taiwan's success demonstrates that full democracy can be
achieved in Chinese societies.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who is in Washington, D.C. to attend the National Prayer Breakfast, made
the remarks in response to questions by Taiwan reporters after the event.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he is seriously considering whether to run for the presidency in 2008
and what he can do for the country if he is elected.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that one of the purposes of his U.S. trip is to listen to the
opinions of various sectors in the United States, Hsieh said the manners
displayed by U.S. politicians of different partisan affiliations at the National
Prayer Breakfast has demonstrated the idea of "reconciliation and coexistence"
that he advocates.</P>
      <P>Although the politicians might not agree with President George W. Bush, they all
stood up and clapped to welcome the the president's arrival, which strikes a
sharp contrast with the situation in Taiwan in which political rivals treat each
other as the enemy, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on former President Lee Teng-hui's recent remarks that "it's
wrong for Taiwan to pursue independence because it is already an independent
country, " which has drawn strong criticism from pro-independence supporters
that Lee is giving up on his pursuit of independence for Taiwan, Hsieh said he
thinks the main point that Lee was trying to convey is that "Taiwan has already
achieved independence."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said this point is consistent with his own belief and the stance of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the status quo of Taiwan is that it is a sovereign,
independent state, and the Constitution that was drafted under a "one China"
framework is a problem that the country is facing.</P>
      <P>Urging the public to pay more attention to the contribution made by Lee to
Taiwan's democratic development, Hsieh stressed that Lee played a crucial role
in turning Taiwan into a democratic nation with the least social costs.</P>
      <P>As to whether he has any plans to visit China before the presidential election,
Hsieh said he does not intend to do so in light of the distrustful atmosphere in
Taiwan politics, in which every politician visiting China is stigmatized as a
colluder with the Chinese communists.</P>

      <P>Popular kung fu novelist Jin Yong, whose knight-errant novels have been devoured
by Chinese people around the world, appeared at the Taipei International Book
Fair Friday to sign autographs for fans.</P>
      <P>In his first appearance at a book fair in Taiwan, the 83-year-old Jin Yong was
awaited by a long queue of fans aged from six to 70 seeking his autograph.</P>
      <P>Shanghai-born Jin Yong -- Hong Kong's most eminent man of letters whose real
name is Dr. Louis Cha -- signed some 400 copies of his novels over a one-hour
period.</P>
      <P>Jin Yong, who has written 15 best-selling martial arts novels, is in Taipei
mainly to meet his mentor at Cambridge University -- Dr. David McMullen -- who
is currently in Taiwan doing research at Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>He was also scheduled to dine with National Chengchi University (NCU) President
Wu Si-hua, who will tell him the NCU is preparing to confer an honorary
doctorate on him in recognition of his outstanding long-term contribution to
Chinese-language writing and literature.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, the last day of his visit, Jin Yong will accompany McMullen on a
visit to the National Palace Museum, to see a Sung-dynasty ceramics exhibition
and a special exhibition on loan from the British Museum.</P>
      <P>Jin Yong last visited Taipei in September 2005, when he attended a ceremony
marking the launch of the "Jin Yong credit card" issued by Taiwan's Yuan Liou
Publishing Co., which publishes most of his kung fu novels in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most of his martial arts novels have been adapted for film and television.</P>
      <P>The soft-spoken, quintessentially Chinese man is renowned not only as the author
of 15 kung fu novels but as a veteran reporter, publisher and political
commentator.  He founded the Ming Pao newspaper and its sister publications.</P>
      <P>He is considered one of the best and most prolific Chinese novelists of the
modern era. But his 15 novels, written between 1955 and 1972, are more than just
kung fu stories. Their pages burst with fantastic knight-errant tales of heroic
swordsmen and beautiful heroines, intermingling romance, tragedy and comedy with
Chinese and religious values.</P>
      <P>Universities around the Chinese-speaking world have formed Jin Yong fan clubs,
sponsored seminars or opened classes on his classic novels, in which, Chinese
readers can immerse themselves in their cultural heritage from the language,
calligraphy, art,  music, traditional costumes, cuisine and martial arts that
they find in the novels. Traditional Chinese culture, fantasy and history form
the colorful backdrops for his works.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve Ruey-long Chen said Friday that the ministry
is planning to change the name of Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) by adding
"Taiwan" at the front of the name.</P>
      <P>Chen said the name-change will be in line with the government's "name-
rectification" policy for state-owned enterprises to avoid people mistaking
Taiwanese companies for Chinese ones.</P>
      <P>It will also bring substantial benefits for the future operations of the state-
owned enterprises, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>He noted that as the name Taiwan Petroleum Corp. has already been claimed and
registered, the CPC will have to use another name. The CPC will become the first
state-owned enterprise under the ministry to highlight Taiwan in its name, he
added.</P>
      <P>The MOEA is also scheduled to announce next week whether other state-owned
enterprises under the ministry will also have their names changed.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian first instructed in December 2004 that the names of all
institutes that could be mistaken for Chinese institutes should be changed,
starting with state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan restarted the discussion on the matter recently and the
Central Standing Committee of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged
state-owned enterprises that have "Chinese" in their names to change their names
as soon as possible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) hailed Friday a
Kaohsiung District Court ruling that a vote recount is necessary for the Dec. 9
mayoral election in southern Kaohsiung city.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus members at a Legislative Yuan news conference said that
they are set to initiate a law revision at the legislature to legalize "an
automatic vote recount mechanism" to deal with similar cases in the future, as
is the case in most advanced countries.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court ruled that the recount should begin from March 12
following a month-long probe, after Huang Chun-ying, the defeated KMT candidate,
filed a suit with the court demanding that it nullify the election and
invalidate the victory of Chen Chu -- incumbent mayor of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Huang lost to Chen by a slim margin of 1,114 votes, or 0.14 percent of the total
ballots. There were more than 6,000 invalid votes in the election.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu said that the KMT legislative caucus will propose a
law amendment to allow for an automatic vote recount if there is only a
difference between 1 percent and 2 percent between election winners and losers.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Alex Fei said that a vote recount is required to serve justice
and safeguard democratic values, and he urged Chen to face the consequences.</P>
      <P>The Huang camp accused Chen's camp of making public a suspicious but unconfirmed
videotape on the eve of the election showing a man purported to be a Huang
supporter buying votes aboard a bus.</P>
      <P>Huang ascribed his election defeat to the release of the videotape and alleged

      <P>Some 290,500 square meters of land around factories and construction sites, or
an area equal to some 700 basketball courts, has been turned into parkland
around the country under a government-initiated project to green inner cities
and suburban areas, the Environment Protection Administration (EPA) reported
Friday.</P>
      <P>Since the greening project was launched in August 2006, 561 factories and
construction sites have signed up to take part in the project -- turning areas
or environment in their vicinity into park or green land -- as of the end of
December, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 561 factories and construction sites have also sponsored the
clean-up and maintenance of 1,724 km of roads around the country during the
period, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Water Resources Agency said a river conservation army was
established Friday to act as guardians of rivers.</P>
      <P>A total of 229 people will be recruited to join the river conservation army,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The pro-independence Taiwan Society released a statement Friday claiming the
urgency and necessity for Taiwan to continue its pursuit of independence in
order to make Taiwan a "true country."</P>
      <P>The statement appeared intended to reject a recent claim by former President Lee
Teng-hui that there is no need for Taiwan to pursue independence  because
"Taiwan is already an independent country."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, seeking independence is not only a "regressive" and
"dangerous" move that will downgrade Taiwan's status from a sovereign
independent state to a country that has not achieved independence, but also a
denial of Taiwan's democratic achievements.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to change its name, enact a new constitution and "seek membership
in the United Nations" to become a "normal country, "Lee argued.</P>
      <P>However, the Taiwan Society said Taiwan is only a sovereign, independent
"political entity" but "not a country."</P>
      <P>"This is not a self-degrading statement, but a cruel reality, " the group said.</P>
      <P>Recognizing this fact long ago, pro-independence forerunners in Taiwan ignited
the flame of Taiwan independence when the country was still under authoritarian
rule, the group pointed out.</P>
      <P>Claiming that democratization is a "sufficient condition" but "not a necessary
condition" to establish a new country, the group said democratization does not
automatically make Taiwan a country.</P>
      <P>"Democratization has only allowed the people of Taiwan to retrieve their
autonomy from an alien regime. The people of Taiwan must exercise their autonomy
correctly before they can turn Taiwan into a true country," the group said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has so far been unable to abandon the national title of Republic of
China or terminate the Constitution, Taiwan can only remain a "political entity"
that is struggling for its survival in the international community, it said.</P>
      <P>It said changing the name of Taiwan and enacting  a new constitution are steps
that will make Taiwan a true country and achieve the goal of independence for
Taiwan, adding that Taiwan must first become a true sovereign, independent
country before it can become a "normal country."</P>

      <P>Department of Health officials said Friday that food and agricultural products
with false labeling will be destroyed and the producers fined.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-lang,  an official from the DOH Bureau of Food Sanitation, made the
remarks at a press conference in which ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Lee Chen-nan revealed that ten of so-called "organic" vegetable soup
packs available in markets carried fake certification describing it as coming
from Japan.</P>
      <P>Several producers even claim their products can cure cancer, Lee added.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Food Sanitation Management Act, food labeling or

      <P>Local government health authorities can order companies withdraw illegal

destroyed if the companies fail to do so.</P>
      <P>Food labeling claiming medical effects could be fined between NT$200,000 and
NT$1 million, Chen went on.</P>

      <P>Law enforcement agents in Yunlin County seized 30 metric tons of tainted pork
believed to be from dead and diseased hogs during a late night raid on five
illegal slaughterhouses Thursday.</P>
      <P>The agents arrested a suspect at one of the locations in Yuanchang township and
were still trying to catch the ringleader and his accomplices who fled before
the agents arrived.</P>
      <P>The Public Prosecutor's Office in Yunlin County ordered the raid after receiving
tip-offs that the illegal ring was operating out of a shack in a village in
Yuanchang township.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the prosecutor's office said that in addition to 1,000 kg of hog
carcasses that were being butchered in the shack, law enforcement agents found
6,000 kg of frozen pork in a walk-in freezer.</P>
      <P>At four other locations, the agents seized more than 23,000 kg of frozen pork --
believed to be from dead and sick hogs.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the pork was apparently meant for the Luna New Year holiday,
when meat will be in big demand. The ring is believed to have obtained dead and
sick pigs at cheap prices from hog farms, which should have destroyed the dead
animals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The incidence rate of colorectal cancer has increased 43.5 percent during the
period between 1994-2003, according to a survey released Friday by the Bureau of
Health Promotion (BOHP).</P>
      <P>Every year there are more than 8,000 people diagnosed with colorectal cancer in
Taiwan on average, according to the results of the survey, which also indicated
that over 4,000 people around the country die every year from this form of
cancer.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Chu-chun, head of the BOHP team in charge of cancer control and
prevention, said that despite the high mortality that makes colorectal cancer
the third largest cancer killer in Taiwan, most Taiwan people having little
awareness of the disease.</P>
      <P>Citing data the BOHP collected from 29 hospitals around Taiwan in 2004, Hsiao
said that over 53 percent of the total colorectal cancer patients reported that
year were either in the second or third stage.</P>
      <P>The number of colorectal cancer patients diagnosed at its early stage only
accounted for 17 percent of the entire population of patients suffering from the
disease, lagging behind the ratio of 29 percent recorded by the U.S. National
Cancer Data Base in 2003, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>There were also relatively fewer colorectal cancer patients in Taiwan living
through the first five years since they were diagnosed than in the United
States, the BOHP official added, saying they found that most Taiwan people do
not have regular health checks, which poses a threat to Taiwan's efforts in
cancer control and prevention.</P>
      <P>The BOHP began a free stool test service in 2004 for people aged 50-69, but only
460,000 people have taken the test so far, according to the bureau, which
indicated that such a test, if done regularly, could reduce the mortality rate
of colorectal cancer by 18 percent- 33 percent.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou claimed Friday that his
name is clean and said that he looks forward to a fair judgment by the judiciary
in a case related to his alleged misuse of special municipal fees while serving
as mayor of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while answering questions from reporters after it was widely
speculated that the KMT chairman, who ended his eight-year mayoral term last
December, might be indicted by Feb. 9 on charges of embezzling the special
municipal funds earmarked for his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he is clean and that he only followed the Executive Yuan's
regulations in claiming reimbursement from the special mayoral discretionary
fund, Ma, however, said that he is unable to predict what will happen in the
future and added that he has made full preparations for all kinds of possible
scenarios.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is widely assumed to be the "pan-blue alliance's" best bet for the 2008
presidential election, also thanked the public for their concern over the case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was reported that KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, Ma's
predecessor, is very likely to serve as the party's chairman again if Ma steps
down from the party's top post over a possible indictment.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight, was reluctant to
comment on the issue, while Lee Hung-chun, a spokesman for the People First
Party (PFP) -- the KMT's ally in the opposition "pan-blue alliance" -- said that
his party will rally behind Ma and the KMT and called for a fair handling of the
case.</P>
      <P>But Lee said that the PFP will respect the KMT as to who will take over the
party's helm should Ma resign.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih cited a notification issued Aug. 5, 1981 by the
Ministry of Justice that he said proves Ma is innocent, as according to the
ministry, "half of the special funds allocated for government agency heads are
for their discretionary use and not subject to scrutiny by the relevant
authorities."</P>
      <P>Ma did nothing wrong with the funds, Wu claimed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui attempted to clarify Friday several contentious
points in a recent interview with a local magazine, claiming that reports about
his forsaking Taiwan independence are not true.</P>
      <P>Lee's explanation came in the form of an advertisement in the Liberty Times paid
for by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union, which sees Lee as its "spiritual
leader." The headline of the ad said: "Lee Teng-hui insists on rectifying the
nation's name, crafting a new constitution and establishing a normal country."</P>
      <P>The ad came in the wake of an interview carried by the Next magazine that quoted
the former leader as saying that "I'm not a supporter of Taiwan independence,
nor have I ever advocated Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>The interview dropped a bombshell on Taiwan's political scene, as Lee, who
floated a "go slow, be patient" policy regarding investment in China and defined
relations between Taiwan and China as "special state-to-state" during his 12
years of presidency that ended in 2000, has been nicknamed "the godfather of
Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Lee said there has been no about-face, as Taiwan is already a sovereign
independent country and there is no need to advocate the pursuit of Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has come a long way since the lifting of martial law in
1987 and the ending of the period of mobilization for the suppression of
communist rebellion in 1991, claiming that the popular presidential election in
1996 and the first transfer of power between two different parties in 2000 prove
that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent country.</P>
      <P>"Why should we engage in self-denial and backpedal for the pursuit of
independence?" he asked in the Next magazine interview.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan has to think about amending the Constitution, changing its name
and joining the United Nations for it to become a normal country, adding that
"this has been my long-standing stance."</P>
      <P>He also attempted to deny that he wants to visit China, saying that what he
actually said was that some people want to invite him to visit China, but "the
current situation is not suitable." Those who visit China, he claimed, have
"power or position in mind" and he added that he "won't do such a thing."</P>
      <P>On the economic front, in which he was asked about his remarks on introducing
Chinese capital to Taiwan, Lee said he was only trying to raise investment in
Taiwan and attract foreign capital.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan investment in China has continued to set new highs in
recent years. Statistics compiled by the U.S. State Department show that foreign
investment in China has reached US$560 billion and that Taiwan has accounted for
half of it, or 5.6 times the general budget of the central government for 2007.</P>
      <P>Even more alarming has been the one-sided situation, with Taiwan continuing to
pump money into China over the past two decades, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  economic doldrums are due to capital flight and overreliance on China,
resulting in the hollowing out of the industry, Lee claimed, adding that the

    <TEXT>La Repubblica: Ruling coalition defeated in Senate.

The ruling coalition suffered a setback in the Senate Thursday when a motion
introduced by the opposition on a controversial U.S. military base expansion
project was approved with a vote of 152 to 146. The government was left looking
embarrassed although the motion changed nothing in practical terms. It merely
approved the government's position on the expansion plan to which three extreme
leftist parties in the ruling camp had expressed their opposition.

      <P>Wanted Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his wife were allowed
to leave Singapore and head directly back to Los Angeles Friday after they
refused to fly via Taiwan, where they face arrest for corruption and
embezzlement.</P>
      <P>The couple arrived at Singapore's Changi International Airport earlier in the
day on their way from Los Angeles to Myanmar and immediately fell under close
scrutiny from the Singapore authorities, despite the absence of a judicial
assistance accord between Taiwan and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Through intensive negotiations between the two sides,  the Singapore immigration
authorities originally agreed to facilitate Wang's extradition by arranging for
the couple to fly a Singapore-Los Angeles flight that would include a stopover
in Taiwan so that they could be arrested by the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the couple refused to cooperate and demanded to return to the United
States on a direct flight to Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>The officials said a Dominican Republic passport held by Wang had been canceled
by the Dominican Republic government at the request of Taiwan and that he might
have problems entering the United States unless he has other passports.</P>
      <P>However, as Wang's wife Wang Chin Shyh-ying holds a U.S. passport and Wang
reportedly has a U.S. green card, it is still possible that the U.S. government
might allow Wang to enter the country based on "humanitarian reasons," the
officials said.</P>
      <P>They said Taiwan officials posted in Los Angeles will try to negotiate with the
United States authorities for the couple's extradition to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office officially accused the couple Jan. 12 of
violating the Securities Transaction Act and breach of trust over their role in
a series of financial scandals within the Rebar group.</P>
      <P>The couple, who fled to China immediately before the scandals broke and later
flew to the United States, was put on a most wanted list Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>The scandals came to light early last month after the Rebar group's China Rebar
Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for insolvency
restructuring, triggering a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEC DENIES HIGH NUMBER OF CONTENTIOUS VOTES IN 2004 ELECTION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC) officials denied Friday that as many as five
contentious ballots were found in each polling station on average in a recount
of the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The officials said the Kaohsiung District Court's claim of the high number was
far from the truth.</P>
      <P>They noted that there were 13,749 polling stations nationwide in the 2004
presidential election and that there were 40,570 contentious ballots.</P>
      <P>But in a recount ordered by the Supreme Court, those that were actually
calculated wrongly totaled only 3,955 votes, averaging 0.288 votes per polling
station.</P>
      <P>The officials said the number of contentious votes was high mainly because of a
change in the election rules that year that stated the stamp on a candidate had
to be confined to a rectangle on the top of the candidate to be counted valid.</P>
      <P>The actual number of incorrect ballots numbered only 3,955, with the remaining
36,615 the result of lawyers representing the two parties using their litigation
skills to argue that they were controversial when in fact they were not.</P>
      <P>They said the recount did not sway the election outcome, which saw President
Chen Shui-bian win by a little more than 25,000 votes against his rival, Lien
Chan of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The CEC made the statement after the Kaohsiung District Court granted a request
for a recount by defeated Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Huang Chun-ying of the KMT
in the Dec. 9 election, who lost to his rival Chen Chu by a mere 1,114 votes, or
0.14 percent of the total votes cast.</P>
      <P>The court ruling said that based on the 2004 presidential election recount,
which found that every polling station had at least five controversial ballots
on average, debatable ballots across Kaohsiung City's 839 polling stations could
be several times the narrow margin -- in an election that counted more than
6,000 invalid votes.</P>

      <P>The government aims to have Taiwanese-grown fruit take 20 percent of the one-
sixth domestic market share that imported fruit currently enjoys, within the
next three years, said the cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) Friday.</P>
      <P>Su Jia-chyuan, the COA Minister, declared the goal at a news conference to the
launch a campaign promoting homegrown fruits in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Annual fruit consumption in Taiwan creates a market worth around NT$70 billion,
and it's a pity that imported fruit holds one-sixth of the market, he said,
continuing that as Taiwanese fruit enjoys the advantages of high quality and a
good reputation, it should therefore be able to recapture some of the market
share now held by foreign products.</P>
      <P>The COA is assisting local governments of 15 major fruit-yielding counties to
set up a platform to promote the county's specialties and facilitate direct
orders from around the country, including online orders, officials said.</P>
      <P>They said the COA will also cooperate with farmers' associations and retail
businesses to set up sections to specially feature homegrown fruits in some 40
supermarkets country-wide, saying the strategy is to highlight  native products,
attract consumers' attention, and significantly boost purchases in the run-up to
the Lunar New Year, a period that traditionally brings a high demand for
agricultural goods.</P>
      <P>Su said Taiwanese fruits have faced fierce competition from abroad since the
country joined the Word Trade Organization, and the COA is making significant
efforts to persuade domestic consumers to buy local when shopping.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) refused to comment Friday about
a reported hope of former President Lee Teng-hui to visit China, saying that a
ban on travel to China is restricted to high ranking government officials and
agents involved in national security operations.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun made the remarks at a regular news briefing in
response to reporters' questions about a recent report by the Next Magazine that
Lee hopes to visit China and that he wants the government to open Taiwan to
Chinese tourists and capital.</P>
      <P>Lee, now the so-called "spiritual leader" of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) , also told the magazine that he never supported Taiwan independence
as Taiwan is already an independent sovereignty and there is no need for the
country to pursue formal independence.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the MAC will not comment on the issue as every individual in a
democratic society is free to air his or her views.</P>
      <P>In response to speculation that Lee has once again changed his attitude toward
Taiwan's future, TSU Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia said that Lee will clearly
explain his stance on the issue in the local media, including print media and
radio stations, in the coming days.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Lee will also take part in a TSU-sponsored concert in
commemoration of the 228 Incident to make his stance on the issue well known to
the party and the public.</P>
      <P>Many supporters of the TSU and Lee have called the party and relevant
organizations to protest over Lee's remarks in the Next Magazine.</P>
      <P>In an effort to assuage the public anger provoked by Lee's latest statement
about Taiwan's future, the TSU ran an advertisement in major print media Friday
in which it said that "the former president still insists on writing a new
constitution for Taiwan and on changing the country's official title to make it
a normal nation."</P>
      <P>To allow the public to gain a comprehensive understanding of the party's stance
and ideals in this regard, TSU lawmakers will increase their presence through
call-in programs and letters to newspapers, Lin said.</P>
      <P>It was also reported that many backers of the Association of Lee Teng-hui's
Friends at home and abroad were very disappointed with Lee's words and have
suggested disbanding their units.</P>
      <P>According  to an official  at the  association's  national headquarters, Lee is
not against Taiwan independence and everyone has "misunderstood" his remarks.
She said that many of Lee's backers have accepted her explanation and have
agreed not to dissolve their local branches.</P>

      <P>A total of 271 artifacts collected by the British Museum, valued at more than
NT$5 billion, will be exhibited in the National Palace Museum (NPM) from Feb. 4
to May 27, the NPM announced in a press conference Friday.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, "Treasures of the World's Cultures: The British Museum after 250
years", brings these historical relics from the U.K. to Taiwan for the first
time and will be a part of celebrations marking the reopening of the NPM, which
is entering its 80th year, NPM Director Lin Mun-lee said.</P>
      <P>"We are expecting a very exciting week. Following the Grand View, this
exhibition will be one of the most important events for the NPM this year," Lin
said. Grand View is an exhibition of painting, calligraphy and Ju Ware of the
Northern Sung Dynasty.</P>
      <P>The NPM has designed three different visiting plans with time spans of 30, 60
and 120 minutes to cover the top 10, 20 and 42 recommended artifacts, which
include items from different eras and regions of pre-history, Mesopotamia,
ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, early Europe, Medieval Europe and the
Renaissance. The display area, which is located in the Library Building, will be
separated into 13 zones, according to the time period and place of origin.</P>
      <P>Among the ten most notable items are The Unlucky Mummy wooden mummy-board, Queen
Puabe's Lyre, Statuette of Hermes, Bust of the Emperor Hadrian, Bust of
Antinous, and a cast gold pectoral of a chief or priest in South America.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is important for the British Museum not only because it takes
place in Taiwan for the first time, but also because the displayed items reflect
humanity's achievements from both the past and present, said Andrew Burnett,
Deputy Director of the British Museum.</P>
      <P>Starting from Feb. 3, the NPM will also be holding its first NPM Outdoors arts
festival. The festival has invited world-renowned performing groups, such as
Japanese national treasure "Noh Theatre, " and Ming Hwa Yuan Taiwanese Opera
Troupe, the Ju Percussion Group and the U-Theatre Group.</P>
      <P>Noh Theatre master Umewaka Rokuro will share with the public a suspenseful

      <P>The government remains in control of the situation surrounding wanted Rebar Asia
Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his wife, despite Singapore's move to
repatriate the pair back to the United States, according to a statement released
Friday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>MOFA Deputy Director General of Information and Cultural Affairs Yen Fei-pi read
a three-point statement at a press conference held by the MOFA to explain the
government's efforts to stop the suspects, who allegedly embezzled billions of
dollars in corporate funds before going on the lam, from fleeing to Myanmar.</P>
      <P>The statement first stated that the government had held accurate information
regarding the Wangs' movement before they boarded on a Singapore-bound flight in
Los Angeles Thursday, and had therefore successfully frustrated the couple's
attempt to flee to a third country.</P>
      <P>Second,  the  government  had conducted  negotiations  with Singaporean
authorities concerning the Wangs' case and provided them with all the relevant
information before those authorities decided to repatriate the couple back to
the United States, a decision which Taiwan respects.</P>
      <P>Third, the government is keeping the situation under control, and will continue
to apply all of its power to manage the issue.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government has been at a loss as to what to do during the
pursuit to nab the Wangs, Yeh answered that the Wangs would have been successful
in fleeing to Myanmar if the government were at a loss.</P>
      <P>The wanted couple arrived at Singapore's Changi International Airport Friday
morning after leaving the U.S. the previous day. They fled to the U.S. from
China late last year after two of the Rebar group's  120-odd  member  companies
applied  for  insolvency restructuring.</P>
      <P>The fallout triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, another of the group's
affiliates. Subsequent judicial investigations found that the couple, other
family members and corporate executives were involved in many suspected
irregularities, including fraud, embezzlement, breach of trust and insider
trading.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Taiwan's judicial authorities and liaison officials posted in the city-
state engaged in intensive negotiations with the Singaporean immigration
authorities over the Wangs' extradition.</P>
      <P>The Singaporean authorities said before the negotiations that there was no
reason for them to take the Wangs into custody as the couple had used authentic
passports and normal travel papers to enter the country.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, during his inspection tour of military facilities on a
front line islet, Friday criticized the opposition for blocking government
budget bills in the legislature and delaying the delivery of new arms to the
forces.</P>
      <P>Chen made his visit to Wuchiu, a small group of islets near Kinmen island with a
total area slightly over 1 square kilometer, to boost the morale of garrison
soldiers.</P>
      <P>Chen, in his address to the soldiers, stressed the importance of Wuchiu as
holding a key position on Taiwan's front line with China.</P>
      <P>He said the strategic value of Wuchiu is not just relevant to the place itself,
but to Taiwan's overall national security. He told them thatthe assurance of
Taiwan's national security and the safeguard of Taiwan's democratic system is a
cornerstone for the safety and stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He then pointed to the awkward situation encountered in dealing with arms
purchases and other government budgetary measures.</P>
      <P>Certain opposition party insisted on putting at the very top of the list the so-
called  'Organic Act of the Central Election Commission',  a highly politicized
and party-centric bill, and therefore obstructed the whole legislative agenda,he
said.</P>

bill and another couple of dozen bills, including the major arms purchases,
seriously hampering the forces' renewal of arms and again hampering military

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Prosecutor's Office decided Friday not to indict Kaohsiung Mayor
Chen Chu over allegations that she had made false vote-buying accusations
against her rival Huang Chun-ying on the eve of last December's mayoral
election.</P>
      <P>Huang, the candidate of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , asked prosecution
authorities to place charges against Chen and three campaign aides, after losing
the Dec. 9 mayoral election by a narrow margin, over what he called their
violation of the Public Officials Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the Chen campaign's presentation of a video at a late night
news conference ahead of the election allegedly showing vote-buying on a bus
returning from a Huang rally had seriously tarnished his clean image and hobbled
his chances of electoral victory.</P>
      <P>Huang claimed that the allegations were a plot of the ruling Decmocratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to win the election by smearing him.</P>
      <P>After extensive investigations, the prosecutor's office said in a ruling that
the vote-buying incident was not staged by the Chen Chu campaign.</P>
      <P>A careful scrutiny of the videotape presented by the Chen campaign indeed showed
that two men were giving cash to passengers aboard the bus and reminding them to
vote for Huang, the prosecution authorities said, adding that some individuals
aboard the bus were wearing the Huang campaign vests.</P>
      <P>It was understandable that the videotape would lead the Chen campaign into
believing that somebody in the Huang campaign was bribing voters with cash, the
prosecution said in the ruling.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the ruling said none of the four accused should be
prosecuted as they didn't purposely defamed Huang. "They were just telling facts
while presenting the video, " the prosecution ruling concluded.</P>
      <P>The three other accused were DPP Legislator Kuan Pi-ling, Chen Chu's chief
campaign manager Chen Chi-mai and her spokesman Hsiao Yu-jen.</P>
      <P>After learning of the prosecution's ruling, Hsiao said it is hoped that KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Huang Chun-ying can make a public apology over their
false accusation.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, during his inspection tour of military facilities on a
front line islet, Friday criticized the opposition for blocking government
budget bills in the legislature and delaying the delivery of new arms to the
forces.</P>
      <P>Chen made his visit to Wuchiu, a small group of islets near Kinmen island with a
total area slightly over 1 square kilometer, to boost the morale of garrison
soldiers.</P>
      <P>Chen, in his address to the soldiers, stressed the importance of Wuchiu as
holding a key position on Taiwan's front line with China.</P>
      <P>He said the strategic value of Wuchiu is not just relevant to the place itself,
but to Taiwan's overall national security. He told them that"the assurance of
Taiwan's national security and the safeguard of Taiwan's democratic system is a
cornerstone for the safety and stability of the Asia-Pacific region."</P>
      <P>He then pointed to the awkward situation encountered in dealing with arms
purchases and other government budgetary measures.</P>
      <P>"Certain opposition party insisted on putting at the very top of the list the
so-called  'Organic Act of the Central Election Commission',  a highly
politicized and party-centric bill, and therefore obstructed the whole
legislative agenda,"he said.</P>
      <P>He said the opposition's move"froze out the central government general budget
bill and another couple of dozen bills, including the major arms purchases,
seriously hampering the forces' renewal of arms and again hampering military
preparations, "a result he called" regrettable".</P>

      <P>Disgraced Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng and his wife, who face
arrest in Taiwan for their roles in a series of financial scandals within the
business group, returned to Los Angeles Friday after their attempt to flee to
Myanmar via Singapore was thwarted by the Singapore authorities.</P>
      <P>As both the Republic of China and Dominican Republic passports held by Wang have
been canceled, Wang was held by U.S. immigration authorities upon his arrival at
the Los Angeles International Airport.</P>
      <P>However, Wang's wife Wang Chin She-ying, who holds a U.S. passport, is not
expected to face any problems entering the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officials posted in the United States said they are still negotiating
with the U.S. authorities in the hope that Wang can be returned to Taiwan. The
two countries do not have an extradition treaty.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Minister of Foreign Affairs deputy spokeswoman Yeh Fei-pi said Taiwan
is maintaining close communication with the United States to try to make the
United States understand that Wang's case is not a simple immigration case.</P>
      <P>However, it is up to the United States to decide how it will handle the case,
and Taiwan will respect the decision made by the United States, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The Wangs, who have allegedly embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds,
fled to China late last year just before the scandal broke, from where they flew
to the United States.</P>
      <P>The couple departed from Los Angeles Wednesday for Myanmar via Singapore and
immediately  fell under close scrutiny from the Singapore authorities upon their
arrival at Singapore's Changi International Airport early Friday.</P>
      <P>Through intensive negotiations with the Taiwan authorities, Singapore originally
agreed to facilitate Wang's extradition by arranging for the couple to take a
Singapore-Los Angeles flight that would include a stopover in Taiwan so that
they could be arrested by the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the couple refused to cooperate and demanded to return to the United
States on a direct flight to Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>The Rebar scandals came to light early last month after the Rebar group's China
Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for insolvency
restructuring, triggering a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office accused the couple Jan. 12 of violating
the Securities Transaction Act and breach of trust and put them on Taiwan's
most-wanted list Jan. 15.</P>

      <P>The Council of Grand Justices (CGJ) will meet Feb. 13-14 to review documents
relating to President Chen Shui-bian's request for a constitutional
interpretation aimed at blocking the continuing trial of the "state affairs
fund" case in which his wife is a defendant, a Judicial Yuan spokesman said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Constitutional law scholars and experts will also be invited to the two-day
explanatory session to give opinions and views on the high-profile case
involving the head of state's immunity and right to confidentiality, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai filed the
interpretation request with the CGJ Jan. 25 on behalf of Chen in hope of
clarifying the constitutionality of the court proceedings of the "state affairs
fund" case.</P>
      <P>Cho also filed an injunction petition asking the Judicial Yuan to order the
Taipei District Court to immediately stop the trial and repeal its previous
ruling on opening supposedly "secret" files relating to the case.</P>
      <P>"The grand justices feel the need to collect more information and about the
issue, " the Judicial Yuan spokesman said, adding that the invitation of
academics to present their views and insights is in compliance  with  the
Enforcement  Rules  for the Law of the Interpretation Procedures for Grand
Justices.</P>
      <P>The spokesman  further said the convening  of the two-day explanatory session
does not necessarily mean that the CGJ will come to a conclusion on the case
soon.</P>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-jen, along with three former and incumbent senior aides at the
Presidential Office, is facing trial at the Taipei District Court after she and
Chen were named by a public prosecutor as "joint perpetrators" in an
embezzlement case involving the alleged misuse of the president's discretionary
"state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>In a lengthy document submitted to the CGJ Jan. 25, the Presidential Office said
the interpretation request is aimed at defending the constitutional status of
the presidency, maintaining the  democratic  system  and protecting  the
sanctity  of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Since the president  is protected  by Article  52 of the Constitution, the
statement argued that the court cannot ask the president to testify during the
investigation process and court hearing or to surrender secret documents or to
even hear the case. The president must also be entitled to litigation immunity
and cannot be prosecuted until his term expires, the statement added.</P>
      <P>It further said the Taipei District Court had infringed upon the president's
executive privileges and risked leaking state secrets by opening the secret
files relating to the "state affairs fund" case.</P>
      <P>Chen has denied any wrongdoing with regard to the special "state affairs fund "
and has claimed he has not lined his pockets with the fund. He has promised to
resign if his wife is found guilty in the first trial and has said history will
return justice to him and the judicial process will clear his name.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT CONSTITUTIONAL REFORMS IN TAIWAN: FORMER PREMIER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government appears concerned with constitutional  reforms in Taiwan and
has hopes Taiwan's government can always keep it informed of the latest
developments in this regard, former Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in response to media inquiries during a visit to Tidal
Basin, a scenic spot in Washington, D.C. Hsieh headed a delegation on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian that attended the National Prayer Breakfast held the
previous day.</P>
      <P>Asked in what way the U.S.  is concerned  about Taiwan's constitutional reform
plan, Hsieh said the U.S. government is skeptical whether Taiwan would honor its
previous promise on the issue.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he told U.S. officials that many things in Taiwan are not under the
government's control and that a lot of situations cannot be anticipated now that
Taiwan is a democratic country.</P>
      <P>In his view,  Hsieh said the two sides  should  increase communications so that
they can more easily predict each other's actions or reactions.</P>
      <P>He told reporters that it would not be proper for Taiwan to act differently from
the information it gave to the U.S. in advance. To his best understanding,
Hsieh said,  the U.S. government was "surprised" by Taiwan's actions on several
previous occasions.</P>
      <P>The U.S. authorities do not want Taiwan to deceive them, Hsieh went on, adding
that Taiwan should offer frank explanations to the U.S. side whenever it comes
up with new policy initiations that may cause U.S. concern.</P>
      <P>Although it is difficult to control the development of democracy, Taiwan's
leaders should refrain from "talking too fast" and should keep their promises,
Hsieh said, adding that when he returned to Taipei, he would inform the
government of his opinion on Taiwan-U.S. relations, which is that "the two sides
share same strategic interests but need to repair and strengthen bilateral
ties."</P>
      <P>Asked about U.S. concerns over Taiwan's delay in carrying out its plan to
purchase arms from the United States, Hsieh claimed that consensus has been
reached between the ruling and opposition parties on the issue and that the
legislature will pass a long-delayed arms procurement bill by March or April.</P>

      <P>More than 60 percent of Taiwan's office workers selected the high-tech Hon Hai
Group as their "dream" manufacturing company to work for, according to the
results of a survey released Saturday.</P>

country, had an error margin of 2.8 percentage points.</P>
      <P>In the service sector, the state-run Taiwan Power Company was ranked as the most
popular firm to work for due to its handsome bonus, followed by China Airlines

diversification in its operations in the last few years, was chosen as the most
popular finance firm to work for, followed by the Bureau of National Health
Insurance and Cathay Financial Holding Co.</P>
      <P>Wu Ruey-ying, deputy director-general of the 1111 data bank, said more and more
employees are choosing state-run firms as their dream companies to work for due
to the stability and the high salaries these companies offer, especially after
the recent financial crisis triggered by credit card debts and the run on the
failing Chinese Bank.</P>
      <P>By gender, 52.38 percent of the male respondents chose high-tech firms as their
first selection for new jobs, followed by government officials at 21.9 percent,
and medical doctors at 20.16 percent, while 26.35 percent of women respondents
ranked secretary or special assistant as their dream job, followed by public
relations workers at 23.97 percent, and entertainers or fashion models at 22.7
percent.</P>
      <P>Asked about their reasons for choosing a particular job, 52.22 percent said
personal interest was their top concern, followed by salary and welfare or added
value attached to the jobs.</P>
      <P>Wu suggested that office workers should be professional and progressive if they
want a good position in the job market.</P>

      <P>The difficulties in getting a fugitive tycoon back to Taiwan to face justice for
a series of scandals involving his business group have shown that there is still
room for improvement  in seeking mutual judicial assistance  from other
countries, judicial sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The sources made the remarks after the latest unsuccessful diplomatic and
judicial efforts to get Wang You-theng, founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group,
back to Taiwan from the United States. Wang was taken into custody by U.S.
authorities Saturday after his Taiwan and Dominican Republic passports were
invalidated through Taiwan's efforts.</P>
      <P>Wang first fled to China late last December shortly after the Rebar scandal
broke out, from where he later fled to the United States. Taiwan put him on its
most-wanted list in mid-January. He tried to fly to Myanmar via Singapore
Wednesday but was sent back to the U.S. Friday by the Singapore authorities for
lacking proper travel papers.</P>
      <P>The sources pointed out that Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations and
that it has to rely on taking part in international organizations to get
judicial assistance from other nations.</P>
      <P>Other channels include Taiwan's investigation agencies that cooperate with other
countries and Taiwan's judicial officials who cooperate with their foreign
counterparts through private exchanges.</P>
      <P>In terms of taking part in international organizations, they noted that Taiwan,
represented by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), has taken part in such
organizations combating money-laundering as the Asia/Pacific Group on Money
Laundering and the Egmont Group.</P>
      <P>On forging international cooperative relations, they noted that Taiwan inked a
mutual judicial assistance agreement with the United States in March 2002.</P>
      <P>They said the MOJ Investigation Bureau and the Criminal Investigation
Administration Bureau have in recent years forged informal cooperation ties with
their counterparts from other countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has established channels of communications with 70 law enforcement
agencies in nearly 50 countries, they said, achieving substantive  results in
the areas of information exchange and receiving alerts when Taiwanese criminals
are expelled from other countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also sent prosecutors to take part in meetings of the International
Association of Prosecutors since 2001. It is hoped that this will pave the way
for mutual judicial assistance someday.</P>
      <P>They said Taiwan currently has cooperative  relations with prosecutors from the
United States, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland and Macau, but added that the scope
needs to be expanded.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) legislators voiced
opposition Saturday to an announcement that the names of state-owned enterprises
will be changed to reflect the fact that they are Taiwanese rather than Chinese.</P>
      <P>The legislators expressed their opposition after Economic Affairs Minister Steve
Chen Ruey-long announced the previous day that two state-owned enterprises will
have their names changed.</P>
      <P>Chen said the name of the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) will be changed to CPC,
Taiwan, while the China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) will adopt the name CSBC,
Taiwan. The changes are in line with the government's name "rectification"
policy aimed at avoiding confusion with Chinese businesses, according to Chen,
who claimed that it will also benefit the future operations of the companies.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hsu Shao-ping said the name-change is part of the government's
efforts to cater to the supporters of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>"It has no substantial significance except squandering taxpayers' money," she
said, claiming that it does not come at an appropriate time "when the nation is
in economic doldrums."</P>
      <P>She said the KMT legislative caucus is mulling whether to boycott the general
budget of the central government for 2007, which failed to pass the previous
legislative session that ended January, the first time the legislature has
failed to pass the budget before the new fiscal year begins Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>She expressed discontent that the government, before the budget is even passed,
is thinking of spending unnecessary money, estimated at NT$70 million (US$2.13
million) for the CPC and NT$20 million for the CSBC according to estimates by
the two enterprises.</P>
      <P>Legislator Cheng Chin-ling, a PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said the
economic minister's claims that the name-changes will not cost a lot are aimed
at blurring the focus of the issue.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the nation's economy is "getting worse every day, " she asked why
the ministry does not put more efforts into boosting the economy instead of on
trivial issues that she claimed are irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the PFP agrees with the KMT in terms of reviewing the screening of
the government's budget.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Science Panel Calls Global Warming 'Unequivocal'

In a grim and powerful assessment of the future of the planet, the leading
international network of climate scientists has concluded for the first time
that global warming is "unequivocal" and that human activity is the main driver,
"very likely" causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950. They said the
world was in for centuries of climbing temperatures, rising seas and shifting
weather patterns X unavoidable results of the buildup of heat-trapping gases in
the atmosphere.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>UNIFICATION NOT KMT'S PRESENT POLICY GOAL: PARTY CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that promoting
unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is not the party's policy goal
at the present stage.</P>
      <P>Even the Chinese mainland doesn't make cross-strait unification its present
goal, Ma claimed in an interview broadcast on CNN International channel's "Talk
Asia" program.</P>
      <P>As to whether the two sides will unify in the future, Ma said nobody knows
whether there will be conditions or circumstances conducive to such a
development.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's future must be determined by its 23 million people out of
their own free will, Ma said that at the moment, the majority of Taiwanese
citizens opt for maintaining the status quo.</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on cross-strait relations, Ma said that economically,
China is an opportunity for Taiwan, but politically, it is a threat to Taiwan.
What Taiwan should do is to maximize the opportunity presented by China while
working to minimize its threat, Ma suggested.</P>
      <P>The Harvard-trained politician acknowledged that China is a security threat to
Taiwan as it has deployed 800 ballistic missiles aimed at the island.
Nevertheless, he said the Chinese mainland offers business opportunities for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Ma said cross-strait trade exceeded US$100 billion
last year, with China and Hong Kong accumulatively taking up 40 percent of
Taiwan's overall exports.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Ma also expounded on the KMT's stance toward cross-strait
relations. While the KMT, which originated in China and ruled Taiwan for more
than five decades until May 2000, accepts the "one China" principle, Ma said the
party insists on "separate definition" of China by the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>For the KMT, Ma said, "one China" refers to the Republic of China -- Taiwan's
official title. The Chinese mainland may not accept the KMT's "one China"
definition and likewise, the KMT could not agree to Beijing's defining "one
China" as the People's Republic of China -- the Chinese mainland's official
title.</P>
      <P>Ma said he believes the KMT-coined  "one China,  separate interpretation"
discourse is the best strategy for this extremely contentious and sensitive
issue. In his view, Ma said Taiwan need not challenge China's definition in this
regard and should instead simply shelve it for the moment.</P>
      <P>Ma, who ended his eight-year stint as Taipei mayor last December, is widely seen
as the KMT's best bet for the 2008 presidential election.</P>

      <P>Nearly 60 percent of health clubs in 12 randomly chosen cities and counties
around the country have failed building safety management inspection, a
spokesman for the Consumer Protection Commission (CPC) under the Executive Yuan
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>A total of 61 health clubs, gyms &amp; spas, or fitness centers in 12
administrative regions,  including Taipei City,  Taipei County, Kaohsiung City,
Kaohsiung County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City, Miaoli County, Hualien County,
Taichung City, Chiayi City, Yilan County and Keelung City, were examined, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The review covered building safety management, fire safety management and use of
standardized contract documents, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, 36 health clubs, or 59 percent of the total,  failed
building safety management inspection, while 25 percent, or 15 health clubs,
failed fire safety examination.</P>
      <P>Of those failing the building safety management inspection, 25 percent illegally
expanded their operation spaces; 15 percent failed to properly install emergency
exits; and 23 percent failed to apply for regular building safety inspection
with proper government agencies.</P>
      <P>Among those failing fire safety inspection, 11 percent were found to have
defective fire alarm equipment; and 13 percent failed to meet the requirements
in emergency lighting, emergency exit signage or evacuation facilities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 15 health clubs, or 25 percent of the total, were found to have not
used standardized documents in their contracts with clients. Among the 46 health
clubs that use standardized contracts, 33 failed to meet the stipulation set

      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official warned Taiwan's local travel agency
operators and tour guides Sunday from dealing in yuan, the Chinese currency.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said it is illegal under the nation's currency
law to buy or sell Chinese yuan privately, and called for travel agency
operators and tour guides to avoid such practices, especially now that the
Chinese New Year holiday is approaching and transactions in the Chinese currency
is anticipated to increase sharply.</P>
      <P>Liu said the MAC will collaborate with the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications to jointly control illegal transactions in
Chinese yuan in order to prevent possible currency irregularities from
occurring.</P>
      <P>Currently, only banking institutions, airports and seaports in the Taiwan-held
outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu are allowed to engage in exchanges of
Chinese yuan, Liu said.</P>
      <P>He added that between the time that exchanges in Chinese yuan were first
permitted on Kinmen and Matsu early last year and December 2006, about 228.11
million worth of Chinese yuan has been exchanged. Of that total, over 99.5
percent was bought or sold by Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed most of the large volume of transactions in yuan on Kinmen and
Matsu by Taiwan residents to speculation that the value of the Chinese yuan
might further appreciate, and to an increasing number of Taiwanese residents
traveling back and forth between Taiwan and China via Kinmen and Matsu.</P>

      <P>A local Chinese-language daily reported Sunday that Beijing has stepped up
contacts with Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , particularly
in the wake of the mayoral elections held in Taipei and Kaohsiung late last
year.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News quoted Lin Chong-pin, a professor with Tamkang
University's Institute of International Studies, as saying recently that
Beijing's Taiwan policy and strategy have changed drastically since Taiwan's
ruling DPP won the important mayoral election in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Lin said he sees that the Chinese authorities have begun to seek improved
relations with the DPP in all aspects and will no longer stake their approach to
cross-strait relations solely on Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang, according to
the daily's report.</P>
      <P>Lin added that the visit to Beijing by Chung Chia-pin, a former DPP deputy
secretary-general, in 2005 at the invitation of Beijing Union University was
just one of the examples underlining Beijing's attempts to improve relations
with the DPP.</P>
      <P>Responding to that report, DPP Deputy Secretary-General Tsai Huang-liang said
Sunday that the ruling DPP will not exclude the possibility of making contact
with Beijing or exchanging views with Chinese authorities on the premise that
they recognize Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Tsai's response echoed remarks made by DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, who said
recently that the ruling DPP will not shun contact, exchanges or dialogue with
Beijing so long as Taiwan's national interests, cross-strait peace and the
principle of equality are respected.</P>
      <P>The truth is, however, that exchanges between the ruling parties from the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait have yet to begin because Beijing continues to reject
government-to-government dialogue or negotiation with Taiwan, Tsai said.</P>

the Ministry of Education reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Of the 2006 foreign students, a total of 9,135 were in Taiwan to study Mandarin
at various language centers around the island, marking an increase of 953 over

      <P>Taiwan will donate funds for two health promotion projects in Burkina Faso, one
of its diplomatic allies in Africa, a spokesman for the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) in New York said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The two projects -- a trachoma prevention plan and a cooking oil plan -- are
jointly organized by the New York-based Helen Keller International (HKI), the
United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization, the spokesman
said, adding that the HKI will implement the two programs using funds donated by
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Andrew L. Y. Hsia, head of the TECO, will provide the funds to HKI President
Kathy Spahn on behalf of Taiwan's government during a reception to be held at
the TECO office in Manhattan next Wednesday, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The funds will include US$103,940 for the trachoma prevention project, the
spokesman said, adding that this donation represents the final installment in a
three-year project that began in late 2004.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has donated more than US$375,000 to the project aimed at combating
trachoma in Burkina Faso's Komandjari area by planting vegetables and fruits to
boost local residents' vitamin A intake, improving medical facilities and
promoting hygiene and good sanitary habits among school children.</P>
      <P>Trachoma is a highly infectious disease of eyes that is caused by bacteria and
is the second largest cause of blindness in Africa and Asia.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the success of the trachoma prevention project, the spokesman
said, Taiwan has decided to sponsor a cooking oil project in Burkina Faso from
2007. The project, which focuses on adding vitamin A to cooking oil to reduce
the risks of mothers and young children dying from malnutrition, will also be
implemented over three years at an estimated cost of US$300,000. Taiwan will
foot the bill, with the first-year donation set at US$128,952.</P>
      <P>The Helen Keller International (HKI) combats the causes and consequences of
blindness and malnutrition by establishing programs based on research on vision,
health and nutrition.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1915 by Helen Adams Keller and George Kessler, the organization's
mission is to save the sight and lives of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Keller was a deaf-blind American author, activist and lecturer. The woman, from
the small farm town of Tuscumbia, Alabama taught the world to respect people who
are blind and deaf with her outstanding career achievements and dedicated
services to the disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Official contacts across the Taiwan Strait in professional fields have increased
over the past year, although these contacts could not be characterized as
"close, " a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The MAC official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that over the past
year Chinese officials have become more willing to contact their Taiwanese
counterparts on issues in various specialized or professional fields, instead of
insisting on cross-strait contacts only in strictly private sectors.</P>
      <P>This  improvement,  he said,  is leading  developments  of cross-strait
relations in a healthier direction and is worthy applause and encouragement
since the effect of exchanges would be, and have been, limited were cross-strait
affairs tackled only via private channels.</P>
      <P>The official, however, declined to comment on local daily reports that Beijing's
Taiwan policy and strategy have changed drastically since Taiwan's ruling

Taiwan's agricultural exports to China, the establishment of a cross-strait
financial liquidation mechanism, the establishment of a cross-strait financial
supervisory mechanism,  to intellectual property rights protection,  mutual
judicial assistance, cross-strait crime-fighting and the signing of an
investment guarantee pact aimed at protecting Taiwanese citizens maintaining

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENT WRITER PUSHES FOR WOODLAND RESTORATION IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Welsh writer who has been a long time resident of Japan visited the Taipei
International Book Fair Sunday, where he expressed his hope that woodland
restoration can be achieved as successfully in Taiwan as in Japan.</P>
      <P>Clive Williams Nicol, 66, a writer, actor and Japanese citizen who has published
many books about wildlife and the environment in both English and Japanese, is
bringing new inspiration to Taiwan with regards to restoring woodlands by
putting his books on display at the book fair.</P>
      <P>On display at the fair are a number of his latest books -- all in Japanese but
translated into Chinese -- including "I Bought a Forest," "The Whisky Cat," and
"Tree."</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting his new books and delivering speeches at the Taipei
book fair, Nicol will also help Taiwan's NGOs in their efforts to restore
Taiwan's woodlands.</P>
      <P>Nicol,  who used to be a hunter  but is now a wildlife conservationist and
gourmet, said at the book fair that he was very much impressed with the
Taiwanese readers, whom, he described as totally different from those he found
in China.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan readers are friendly and enthusiastic, quite unlike the Chinese
people, who do not smile at strangers and who seem to have never seen birds or
butterflies.</P>
      <P>Noting that it takes time for a people to nurture the concept of environmental
protection and implement it, Nicol said he hopes that his books will help extend
the woodlands of Taiwan little by little, and that more Chinese-reading people
will contribute to efforts related to wildlife conservation and environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>Nicol was born in Neath, Wales, and from a young age expressed an interest in
wildlife and the environment. In 1958 he visited the Arctic circle to research
the Elder duck for McGill University. He also spent two years in Ethiopia
working as a game warden in one of Ethiopia's national parks. By the early 1960s
he was studying karate in Japan, and soon thereafter began to study Japanese at
Nihon University. He has lived in Japan since that time.</P>
      <P>Since taking up residence in Japan he has written many books and other literary
works. In 1980 he won the Japan Broadcasting Writer's Award for a television
drama written in Japanese. He also soon became an environmentalist activist, and
to this day travels both within and outside of Japan giving talks and lectures
on the environment, addressing issues such as deforestation and the preservation
of natural environments. He is particularly interested in restoring Japan's vast
woodlands, and due to these and other endeavors is quite famous in Japan.</P>
      <P>In the book, "Why I became Japanese, " Nicol wrote about how he obtained
Japanese citizenship. He now resides in a plot of forest land he owns in Japan
with his wife and two daughters.</P>

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui has reassured worried supporters he met with
Sunday morning to clarify recent controversial remarks he made concerning
Taiwan's national goals, said the head of a group supportive of Lee after the
meeting.</P>
      <P>The 'Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association' will not disband and will continue to
throw strong support behind Lee, Hwang Kun-hu, President of the association told
the press after Lee addressed cadres of the group and its pro-independence
allies in the Taiwan Solidarity Union and Taiwan Society.</P>
      <P>Hwang said Lee's insistence on Taiwan's sovereignty in his talk with the
participants in the breakfast meeting, held at a Kaohsiung City hotel, has
relieved them of their doubts and anxieties.</P>
      <P>Only cadres from eight out of the association's 21 local branches attended the
meeting amid rumors that several branches were to disband due to disappointment
with Lee, long dubbedthe godfather of Taiwan independence, who was quoted in
Next Magazine in late January as saying that he has never advocated Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Lee thereafter clarified his stance through a TV interview and a newspaper
advertisement, saying that Taiwan already has de facto independence and
therefore no longer needs to pursue it. He also reiterated that Taiwan needs to
rectify its name, craft a new constitution, seek membership in the United
Nations and become a normal country.</P>
      <P>However, his remarks still angered and disaffected some of his most enthusiastic
allies and supporters. Lee Shiao-feng, a historian prominent for advocating
Taiwan's national identity, said Saturday he decided to vacate his committee
seat with the Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association.  He said while  Lee's
explanation  about  Taiwan independence may be acceptable,  he cannot stand
thecomplete confusion of valuesapparent as Lee accuses President Chen Shui-bian
as corrupt while praising the Kuomintang Chairman Ma Jing-jeou as clean.</P>
      <P>Political commentator Chin Heng-wei also said the same day he would resign from
the board of Taiwan Advocates, a think tank funded by Lee Teng-hui, while Chet
Yang, secretary-general of the Taiwan Society said many members of the society
required sleeping pills or anti-hypertensive drugs to calm down following Lee's
comments.</P>
      <P>Hwang, however, said Sunday that while there are various opinions being
expressed across the political spectrum these days, the 'Lee's Friends'
Association' will remain firmly in place.</P>

Memorial Park in that county Saturday after a brief funeral.</P>
      <P>The funeral was held at a local funeral home at 11 a.m, where his family members

undertook training together with Yang at the University of California Los
Angeles in the later 1950s and defeated Yang to win the gold in the decathlon in
Rome in 1960. He recalled at the funeral his five-decade friendship with Yang,
which has become a legend among athletes.</P>

      <P>Amid recent controversy over his remarks on Taiwan's national goals, Former
President Lee Teng-hui said Sunday theTaiwan Independencedebate is a false one
used by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) to wrap their power struggle.</P>
      <P>Addressing a graduation ceremony of Lee Teng-hui Academy's southern Taiwan
branches, in Kaohsiung, he said extremist sects with the design to cut the
country's history off were formed within political parties after the transfer of
power in 2000.</P>
      <P>The anti-democracy force in the KMT betrays Taiwan's history of democratization
and aims to take back the power and rebuild a party-state system,he said, while
the extremist force in the DPP, just like their KMT counterparts, denies
Taiwan's achievement in democratization and says Taiwan is not yet an
independent country and is still in need of seeking independence.</P>
      <P>He said one of the two forces defines itself as seeking independence while the
other is engaged in counter-independence efforts with the Chinese communist
regime.Both attempt to utilize the false issue of Taiwan independence to provoke
a 'unification versus independence' conflict and to grab power out of it,he
said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwanese people have become the masters of their own country in the
1996 presidential election, when 75 percent of the votes went to him and the DPP
candidate, under Chinese missile threats.</P>
      <P>Lee saidthe old parties, old politicians and old parliament have turned a blind
eye to the real needs of the people.They are only causing problems instead of
solving them; they are dragging the country downward.</P>
      <P>If the two extremist forces are left unchecked and continue to split the people,
Lee said, it's very possible that one political force may collaborate with
outside force and help fulfill the Communist empire's ambition to annex the
democratic Taiwan, scraping the freedom Taiwanese people had fought hard to
gain.</P>
      <P>He said he is very worried over what policies China will adopt toward Taiwan
after its hosting of the 2008 Olympic Games and the 2010 World's Fair.Important
things are happening outside and affecting Taiwan but Taiwan is only keen on
internal struggles, he said,just thinking about this can make one shed tears.</P>

      <P>The Taipei International Book Exhibition 2007 lowered the curtain Sunday after

Sunday.</P>
      <P>Rex How, chief of the Taipei Book Fair Foundation which organized the annual
gala, dismissed the decline in the number of visitors this year as
insignificant, attributing it to the fact that this year's exhibition took place
in the leadup to the Chinese New Year Day when local people are busy with
ushering in the new year and it concurred with the national academic performance
examinations for senior high school graduates.</P>
      <P>However, How claimed the exhibition has developed into an regional event which
distinguishes it from book fairs in Beijing which cater mainly to publishers and
book fairs in Hong Kong which aim at promoting sells of books.</P>
      <P>In addition to publishing companies in Japan and South Korea that debuted in the
exhibition last year, How said, publishing firms in Southeast Asia were invited
to display their books in the exhibition this year,  a move aimed to reflect the
country's increasing immigrants from that region.</P>
      <P>How whose term as chief of the Taipei Book Fair Foundation ended with the close

    <TEXT>New York Times: In Washington, Contractors Take on Biggest Role Ever Without a
public debate or formal policy decision, contractors have become a virtual
fourth branch of U.S. government. On the rise for decades, spending on federal
contracts has soared during the Bush administration, to about US$400 billion
last year from US$207 billion in 2000, fueled by the war in Iraq, domestic
security and Hurricane Katrina, but also by a philosophy that encourages
outsourcing almost everything government does. Contractors still build ships and
satellites, but they also collect income taxes and work up agency budgets, fly
pilotless spy aircraft and take the minutes at policy meetings on the war. They
sit next to federal employees at nearly every agency; far more people work under
contracts than are directly employed by the government. enditem</TEXT>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense has agreed to remove all statues of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek from barracks around the country before Feb. 28, which
will be the 60th anniversary of the so-called 228 Incident, three lawmakers of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Citing a report issued last year by the 228 Memorial Foundation, DPP lawmakers
Chai Trong-rong, Sandy Yen and Hsueh Ling said in a statement the Chiang Kai-
shek was the main culprit behind the 228 Incident in 1947 when troops of the
Chinese Nationalist government crushed a revolt in Taiwan, killing thousands of
people.</P>
      <P>In memory of the incident, the lawmakers said that they asked the Ministry of
National Defense to remove the statues before Feb. 28 and that the ministry
agreed to their request.</P>
      <P>The statement also called for the renaming of the National Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall in Taipei as the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INT'L SYMPOSIUM ON SUNG DYNASTY CULTURE, ARTS OPENS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international symposium on Sung Dynasty culture and artifacts opened at the
National Palace Museum Monday with more than 40 scholars and art researchers
from home and abroad participating.</P>
      <P>The four-day international symposium is part of the ongoing high-profile
exhibition "Grand View: Painting, Calligraphy, Ju Ware and Rare Books from the
Northern Sung Dynasty" which the National Palace Museum has organized to mark
its official reopening on Feb. 8 after almost two years of remodeling.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the symposium, National Palace Museum Director Lin
Mun-lee said that arts, culture and the cultural development models from the
Sung Dynasty (960-1279) have tremendously influenced the world's cultural
development and that the collections of Sung Dynasty artifacts happen to be
among the most pivotal collections of the National Palace Museum, which is
considered the world's leading Chinese artifact museum.</P>
      <P>The scholars and experts from the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States,
Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan are expected to exchange views during the
symposium on Sung Dynasty artifacts and the trends of cultural development
during that period, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The three-month Grand View exhibition, which is scheduled to end March 25,
showcases a total of 42 paintings and 29 pieces of calligraphy dating from the
Northern Sung period (960-1127), as well as five Northern Sung paintings and
calligraphy works on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and
the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City.</P>
      <P>Also on display are Ju ceramic wares of the Northern Sung period, fired in the
early 12th century, which are renowned for the classical beauty of their warm
and glossy sky-blue glaze. Surviving pieces of Ju ware are extremely rare, with
less than 70 found in collections around the world today. The National Palace
Museum is fortunate to have 21, the most of any collection.</P>
      <P>Renowned for its impressive collection of art works of the Sung Dynasty, the
museum is putting its collection of Sung Dynasty artifacts in its entirety on
display for the first and possibly the last time due to the fragility of the art
works. The museum is known for its unique collection of some 654,500 imperial
art treasures brought to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 to
keep them out of the hands of the communists.</P>

      <P>Nauruan President Ludwig Scotty's current visit in Taiwan is mostly private in
nature, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Releasing a news statement concerning Scotty's visit the same day that he met
with President Chen Shui-bian, the MOFA said Scotty arrived in Taiwan Saturday
for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Although Scotty's trip is mainly for private purposes, his itinerary includes
meeting with President Chen, signing a memorandum of understanding on
cooperation in labor affairs with Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Lee Ying-
yuan, and inspecting the preparation work for the establishment of a Nauruan
embassy in Taiwan, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Nauru, which switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in July 2002, re-
established formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan on May 14, 2005 after Scotty
was elected president of the South Pacific nation.</P>
      <P>Scotty made an official visit to Taiwan in March 2006 and made a private
stopover visit in Taiwan between late August and early September the same year
on his way to Palau for the first leadership summit between Taiwan and its
Pacific allies.</P>
      <P>The stopover visit, which was not disclosed until Scotty had left, sparked
rumors that he engaged in some kind of "diplomatic extortion" of Taiwan during
the visit.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh, the ministry usually does not
release information concerning transit stops or private visits by heads of state
or government officials of its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>However, to avoid unnecessary speculation by the media this time, the ministry
is releasing some information about Scotty's private visit after obtaining his

      <P>The arsenic content in rice harvested on Taipei's Guandu Plain is negligible,
and the rice poses no threat to human health, an academic at National Taiwan
University (NTU) claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang  Tsun-kuo,  a  professor  in  NTU's  Department  of Bioenvironmental
Systems Engineering, said the average amount of arsenic in Guandu Plain rice has
been discovered to be just 0.2 ppm, even lower than the German standard of 1 ppm
for allowable arsenic content for grains.</P>
      <P>Under a contract with the Taipei City Environmental Protection Bureau, Chang has
led an NTU research team to conduct field research on the Guandu Plain, where
the team has discovered that of the 800 hectares of farmland, 123 hectares were
detected to contain arsenic levels above the national standard of 60 ppm for
farmland.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the high arsenic content in the soil on the Guandu Plain to the
fact that the farmland is irrigated by water from a hotspring valley located in
the plain's northern Beitou suburb.</P>
      <P>Arsenic content in earth or rocks found in the Beitou hotspring valley has been
discovered to be as high as 10,000 ppm, although the arsenic content in the
water is only 0.5 ppm, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said the arsenic "pollution" on the Guandu Plain is a natural phenomenon
resulting from geothermal  activity in the hotspring area.</P>
      <P>Noting that farmers in the Guandu Plain area have been using hotspring water
from Beitou to irrigate their farmlands for more than 200 years, Chang said that
no cases of black-foot disease resulting from arsenic-polluted water have been
reported in the Guandu Plain area in that time and that rice grown in the area
is not harmful to human health.</P>

      <P>Eleven doctors from Mongolia received certificates Monday marking the completion
of a six-month training course they undertook in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 11 doctors received training  in emergency  rooms and departments  of
internal  medicine,  surgery,  rehabilitation, ophthalmology, pharmaceuticals
and traditional Chinese medicine of Taipei Hospital  under the Department  of
Health,  located in Hsinchuang, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Addressing  a  commencement  ceremony,  Huang  Kun-chang, superintendent of the
Taipei Hospital, said Taiwan has helped train a total of 22 Mongolian doctors
since Taiwan's International Medical Training Center was established at the
hospital in late 2002.</P>
      <P>The center provided training for one Mongolian doctor in 2003, following by four
in 2004, six in 2005 and 11 in 2006, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Of the 11 Mongolian doctors who received training in Taiwan prior to 2005, one
has been promoted to be a deputy superintendent of Mongolia's major Central

department chiefs of state-level hospitals in Mongolia.</P>
      <P>The training program has not only helped raise the professional standards of
Mongolia's doctors but has also led Mongolia, which maintains no formal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, into supporting Taiwan in the country's bid to
enter the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health

that although much of the equipment she saw and used in Taipei Hospital are

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that he will
explicitly announce his 2008 presidential bid "at the right time."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a visit to the outlying county of Penghu as part of
his ongoing nationwide tour in his capacity as KMT chairman to gain an
understanding of public opinion since he stepped down in last December as Taipei
mayor following eight years in office.</P>
      <P>Ma has been troubled by the possibility that he will be indicted on embezzlement
charges over his alleged misuse of special municipal fees earmarked for his
discretionary use while serving as mayor of Taipei. It was widely reported that
the prosecution is expected to end its probe into the case and that Ma is likely
to be indicted by Feb. 9.</P>
      <P>Although Ma has been widely assumed to be the opposition "pan-blue alliance's"
best bet for the 2008 presidential election, KMT regulations require that a
party candidate must withdraw from elections if prosecuted.</P>
      <P>In response to a greeting from local KMT members who urged him not to abandon
his desire to take part in the next presidential election despite the possible
indictment, Ma thanked them for their support and said that he will announce his
presidential bid "at the proper time."</P>
      <P>Ma also met Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa and County Council Deputy Speaker
Lan Chun-i to exchange opinions on local party affairs.</P>
      <P>Ma promised that the KMT and its allies in the "pan-blue alliance" -- the People
First Party (PFP) and the New Party -- will jointly field the most qualified
candidates in December's legislative elections and the 2008 presidential race.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the KMT primaries for the coming legislative and presidential
polls are slated to kick off in early April. "Unity and reform are the party's
unchanged top priorities," he said.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" cannot afford to have another split if it wants to
outgun the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union in the coming elections, he said.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun called on the KMT and the PFP to collaborate  to
tackle future elections  and meet high public expectations based on their
cooperation framework, now that the two parties inked an agreement last month to
form a formal alliance.</P>
      <P>Should the two parties fail to exercise greater combat ability through the
establishment of the new alliance, it will definitely disappoint their many
supporters, Lee said.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Cheng Chin-ling said that she favors the idea of
fielding the two parties' common hopefuls in the December legislative elections
under the name of the alliance.</P>
      <P>The two parties must do their utmost to secure "pan-blue" victory in future
elections and no options should be ruled out, she said.</P>
      <P>Lee's and Cheng's comments came while answering  reporters' questions after it
was reported that KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih and his PFP counterpart Chin
Ching-sheng will begin this week discussing cooperative issues for the year-end
legislative elections.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Monday that the government will
continue to work on a contingency plan to get a fugitive tycoon back to Taiwan
to face justice for a series of scandals surrounding his business group.</P>
      <P>Huang was referring to Wang You-theng, founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group,
who was taken into custody by the U.S. authorities upon his arrival in Los
Angeles Saturday because his Taiwan and Dominican Republic passports were
invalid as a result of efforts by the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>Noting that a U.S. court hearing is expected to be held on Wang's case within a
week, Huang said it is inappropriate for the Taiwan government to comment on the
issue now that the case has entered the U.S. judicial process.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will respect the handling of the case by the U.S. judicial authorities
and will continue to keep tabs on developments and try to work out contingency
plans," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Wang first fled to China late last December shortly before the Rebar scandal
broke, from where he later fled to the United States. Taiwan put him on its
most-wanted list in mid-January. He tried to fly to Myanmar via Singapore last
Wednesday but was sent back to the U.S. last Friday by the Singapore authorities
as he lacked the proper travel documents.</P>
      <P>On reports that the government has spent lavishly on hiring top-notch lawyers to
fight the elite lawyer team expected to be hired by Wang, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said the government has hired professional legal
advisers and is seeking their views.</P>
      <P>Wang Chieh-yeh said that whether Wang will be able to enter the United States is
an issue for the United States to decide and that the Taiwan government has no
need to hire lawyers over that issue.</P>

      <P>The U.S. government expects a productive partnership with Taiwan on issues
concerning intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, the director of the
American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT's) Taipei office said Monday.</P>
      <P>Stephen M. Young made the remarks in an address to the opening of an IPR
protection workshop, a two-day event organized by National Chengchi University's
Graduate Institute of Intellectual Property, the Licensing Executive Society.</P>
      <P>In addition to Young,  several U.S. Department of Justice officials and judges
from Thailand, as well as Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin and professionals
from Taiwan's judicial sector also took part in the workshop titled "Meeting the
Challenges of IPR Protection in Taiwan and Beyond."</P>
      <P>Young praised Taiwan for its efforts to establish a new IP court and expressed
hope that judges and prosecutors in the district courts will have the resources
and training they need to deal with IPR-related cases.</P>
      <P>He also said the U.S. welcomes Taiwan's efforts that see the Legislative Yuan in
the process of reviewing legislation to regulate peer-to-peer file sharing, and
a plan to put forth legislation on Internet Service Provider (ISP) liability.</P>
      <P>Young said Taiwan's economic future depends on IPR, explaining that as Taiwan's
economy continues to evolve into "one of the most technologically advanced in
the world, " strong IPR protection and enforcement means more choices for
consumers, more opportunities for Taiwan businesses, and more jobs for Taiwan's
workforce.</P>
      <P>The workshop is supported by the U.S. Department of Justice/U.S. Overseas
Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training, as well as Taiwan's Judicial
Yuan,  the Ministry  of Justice and the Intellectual Property Office under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, according to an AIT press release.</P>

      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh, who has expressed confidence in his possible bid to
run for the presidency in 2008, suggested Sunday that the registration of
candidates for the Democratic Progressive Party presidential primaries be moved
ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, in Los Angeles after attending the U.S. National Prayer Breakfast in
Washington, D.C. on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian, said at a news
conference that he would voice no opinions about whether the DPP primaries
should be held earlier than originally arranged in May this year, but he
suggested that the primary registration be moved ahead of schedule. Registration
was slated for April.</P>
      <P>He said early registration will help sort out sooner who exactly is running in
the presidential primaries and give more time for inner party negotiation before
a DPP ticket is finalized.</P>
      <P>After the news conference, Hsieh delivered a speech titled "Taiwan Identity,
Reconciliation and Co-existence" at a dinner party hosted by the DPP's U.S. West
Coast Chapter in his honor.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who said during a recent interview with a Taiwan-based TV channel that he
is seriously considering running for the presidency in 2008 and when he should
formally announce his bid if he decides to do so, said he first needs to
complete a tour of Taiwan's counties and cities to assess his ability  to
shoulder  such a great responsibility and to evaluate his support base before
making a decision.</P>

      <P>Members of the indigenous community called Sunday for more attention to be paid
to the memory of Yang Chuan-kwang, Taiwan's legendary decathlete, also known as
the "Iron man of Asia," who died of a stroke in California recently.</P>
      <P>The remark came after Yang's funeral in the United States, where his wife and
children insisted that he be buried. A memorial service was also held
simultaneously at his hometown in Taitung County, eastern Taiwan, which few
people attended.</P>
      <P>Aboriginal Legislator Liao Kuo-tung of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), who

he hoped the government and the media will attach greater importance to the
"Iron man of Asia."</P>

attention on Hsu Wei-lun, a 28-year-old actress who died on the same day as Yang

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker raised questions about the effects of the Sexual Harassment
Prevention Act one year after it went into effect Monday.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, Huang Sue-ying of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party said there had been only 168 complaints filed under the law,
with Taipei City, Taipei County and Kaohsiung City accounting for 50 percent of
them, and nine counties reporting none at all, which the lawmaker claimed is
evidence that both the central and local governments have failed to raise public
awareness about the offense.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker also raised the question of the ability of employers to handle the
complaints, as only 37 percent of the complaints dealt by them were determined
as harassment, while 75 percent of complaints logged with police were determined
to be offenses.</P>
      <P>As the offenses prohibited under the act are often offenses also covered by the
Criminal Code, the Social Order Act or the Gender Equity Education Act, Huang
claimed it stirred up confusion among the victims of sexual harassment about
which law their case should be pursued under.</P>
      <P>In response to the last point of lawmaker's criticism, an official from Sexual
Assault Prevention Commission under the Ministry of the Interior said victims
can pursue their complaints via whatever law they like, although the Social
Order Act might provide them with recourse more quickly than the other laws.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU FIRM ON INDEPENDENCE, CLARIFIES EX-PRESIDENT'S REMARKS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) stands firm on its dream of
pursuing Taiwan independence and of making Taiwan a normal country through
writing a new constitution and changing its official title, TSU lawmakers said
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to TSU lawmaker Ho Ming-hao, the party has never deviated from its
pro-independence stance through a change of the nation's name and creating a new
constitution, although it calls for greater government attention to the people's
livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Ho's clarification of the TSU's standing came after former President Lee Teng-
hui, the party's so-called "spiritual leader, " said recently in two separate
interviews that there is no need for Taiwan to pursue formal independence
because it is already an independent sovereignty. Lee also claimed that he has
never backed Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks aroused strong criticism from supporters of the "pan-green camp"
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the TSU, with many of Lee's
supporters' clubs planning to disband.</P>
      <P>In a bid to dispel public anger over his comments, Lee invited pro-independence
backers to have breakfast with him Sunday in southern Kaohsiung city to clarify
his stance regarding Taiwan's future. He also said later the same day that he
will keep insisting on Taiwan's sovereignty and pursuing formal independence and
new constitution.</P>
      <P>Claiming that many grass-roots supporters have accepted Lee's explanation and no
longer doubt his position, Ho urged the DPP and pro-independence activists not
to attack the TSU or Lee over his statement, as the two parties need to continue
cooperating.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmaker Lo Chih-ming said that the party is determined to adopt a left-
leaning moderate path by sticking to the goals of stepping up Taiwan's
democratization and upgrading its economy.</P>
      <P>The DPP should also adopt a middle-of-the-road policy if it is afraid that the
TSU's policy change could sway its supporters to the TSU's fold, Lo said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Monday that
a relocation of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall at the heart of Taipei City
would require no revision of the law.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Gao Jyh-peng noted that the organic law of the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall administration does not stipulate the exact location of the hall.</P>
      <P>As such, the Executive Yuan need only reach a formal resolution on the
relocation at its floor meeting. The memorial hall could then be relocated to
Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan, the location of the temporary mausoleums of
Chiang Kai-shek, who died in 1975, and his son Chiang Ching-kuo, who died in
1988, Gao said.</P>
      <P>The current site of the CKS Memorial Hall could then be renamed the Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall, he added.</P>
      <P>He said the DPP Central Standing Committee invited Minister of Education Tu
Cheng-sheng to report at its weekly meeting last Wednesday,  in which Tu
suggested  the change and Premier Su Cheng-chang said the matter could be
studied.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan should pass a relocation of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall as soon as possible," Gao urged.</P>
      <P>He said that with the coming of 60th anniversary of the 2-28 Incident of 1947,
when troops of the Chinese Nationalist government crushed a revolt in Taiwan,
killing thousands of people, the government should form an investigation
committee to get to the bottom of the tragedy that continues to split society
today.</P>
      <P>If Chiang Kai-shek is confirmed to have been the perpetrator of the suppression,
there is no way the next generation should be educated to pay respects to the
killer, he said.</P>
      <P>The call for memorial hall relocation came after reports that the Ministry of
National Defense had agreed to remove all statues of the late president from
barracks around the country before Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs also announced last week a plan to change the
name of the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to "CPC, Taiwan," and that of the
Chinese Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) to "CSBC, Taiwan" as part of the government's
efforts to avoid confusing the state-run companies with Chinese ones.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties have accused the DPP of "ruling the nation with ideology"
in a bid to blot out the last vestiges of China's influence from the country.</P>

      <P>Customs authorities have recently cracked down on smuggling in central Taichung
county, and seized over 60,000 pear tree stems smuggled from China, which
carried buds and flowers to be used as grafts, customs officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Acting on tips, customs inspectors raided an illegal exchange of some of the
smuggled pear tree branches at the Tungshih town fruit and vegetable market, and
then discovered the rest of the smuggled plants at a warehouse run by a local
farmers' association.</P>
      <P>The inspectors found that all of the smuggled buds and flowers, weighted 600 kg
in total, are from premium strains, and provide sufficient material for local
farmers to raise grafted pears on about 50 hectares of orchards, the customs
officials said.</P>
      <P>However, when examined by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine, the smuggled pear tree stems were found to be hosting some virus-
carrying foreign insects, the officials said, noting that if the stems had been
grafted onto local trees, they would have badly affected the island's ecology.</P>
      <P>During the raid, a 40-year-old man suspected of illegal trading was arrested on
suspicion of involvement in the illegal trading of the smuggled stems. An
investigation into the case is underway.</P>
      <P>Grafted pears are one of major fruits grown in Taiwan, with farmers grafting
buds and flowers from pear trees grown in temperate areas like Lishan (Mountain
Li) in central Taiwan, or Japan, onto their plants to produce juicy and sweet
"temperate pears."</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court Monday appointed three temporary managers for the
financially troubled China Rebar Co. while it continues to review the company's
insolvency reorganization petition, filed last December.</P>
      <P>The court appointed a deputy manager of the Mega International Commercial Bank,
which is a major creditor of Rebar, a lawyer from the KPMG accounting firm and
an accountant as temporary managers.</P>
      <P>The court selected the three after consulting with the Ministry of Economic
Affairs and decided that they are professional and skilled in company
organizational affairs, a court spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>A self-help association formed by suppliers to the Idee Fashion Stores, a sister
company to the China Rebar, had proposed that Wang Lin-mei, general manager of
both Idee and China Rebar, be appointed as China Rebar's temporary manager on
the basis that she best knows what is needed, and is most able to stabilize the
company's operations.</P>
      <P>But the court rejected the association's proposal as Wang herself is suspected
of diverting Rebar's funds and is free only due to a NT$8-million bail release,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The Company Act stipulates that when a company's board of directors is unable to
function and such a situation is likely to cause damage to the company, the
court can appoint temporary managers at the petition of interested parties, or
the prosecution, to exercise the functions of the chairman and the board.</P>
      <P>The court's ruling came as a response to a petition by the district prosecutor's
office, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>China Rebar and the Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co., both subsidiaries of
the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, applied for insolvency protection Dec. 29. The
disclosure of the conglomerate's financial troubles kicked off intensive
investigations into a series of economic  crimes affecting  many of the group's
several dozen affiliates.</P>
      <P>The primary fugitive Wang You-theng, founder of the Rebar Group, is now being
held by the U.S. immigration in Los Angeles. His attempt to fly to Myanmar from
the United States failed last Saturday when the authorities of Singapore, his
planned transit stop, sent him back to the U.S. and Taiwan authorities then
invalidated his travel documents.</P>

When Sen. John E. Sununu (R-N.H.) saw reporters approaching him last week, he
took off in a sprint, determined to say as little as possible about a nonbinding
resolution opposing President Bush's troop-escalation plan, which is expected to
come before the Senate today.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Iraqis Fault Pace of U.S. Plan in Attack

A growing number of Iraqis blamed the United States on Sunday for creating
conditions that led to the worst single suicide bombing in the war, which
devastated a Shiite market in Baghdad the day before. They argued that the
Americans had been slow in completing the vaunted new American security plan,
making Shiite neighborhoods much more vulnerable to such horrific attacks. @@The
critics said the new plan, which the Americans have started to execute, had
emasculated the Mahdi Army, the Shiite militia that is considered responsible
for many attacks on Sunnis, but that many Shiites say had been the only
effective deterrent against sectarian reprisal attacks in Baghdad's Shiite
neighborhoods.

Wall Street Journal: Tired of Laughter, Beijing Gets Rid Of Bad Translations

For years, foreigners in China have delighted in the loopy English translations
that appear on the nation's signs. They range from the offensive ("Deformed
Man," outside toilets for the handicapped) to the sublime (on park lawns, "Show
Mercy to the Slender Grass").

Last week, Beijing city officials unveiled a plan to stop the laughter. With
hordes of foreign visitors expected in town for the 2008 Summer Olympics,
Beijing wants to cleanse its signs of translation nonsense. For the next eight
months, 10 teams of linguistic monitors will patrol the city's parks, museums,
subway stations and other public places searching for gaffes to fix.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CLA TO SIGN LABOR COOPERATION PACT WITH NAURU THURSDAY</HEADLINE>

      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Lee Ying-yuan will sign a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) with visiting Nauruan President Ludwig Scotty Thursday on
bilateral cooperation in labor affairs, a CLA official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official in charge of vocational training made the remarks after President
Chen Shui-bian said during a meeting with Scotty earlier in the day that one of
the purposes of Scotty's current visit is to sign a labor cooperation agreement
with the CLA to pave the way for importing laborers from Nauru.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Taiwan and Nauru are interested in cooperation in labor
affairs, the CLA official said the two sides have decided to sign an MOU
expressing their intention to forge cooperative ties in the field.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, the two sides have not yet discussed any details
regarding the introduction of Nauruan workers into Taiwan. The CLA has not yet
studied the feasibility of importing Nauruan laborers and the concrete measures
necessary for implementing such a policy, the official said, adding that future
developments in this regard will depend on whether both countries share similar
ends.</P>
      <P>Scotty arrived in Taipei Saturday for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Nauru, which switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in July 2002, re-
established formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in May 2005 after Scotty was
elected president of the South Pacific nation.</P>
      <P>According to President Chen, Nauru is now preparing for the establishment of an
embassy in Taiwan, which was one of the conclusions reached in bilateral talks
held during a leadership summit between Taiwan and its South Pacific allies,
including Nauru.</P>
      <P>Chen said exchange activities and cooperation projects between Taiwan and Nauru
have been proceeding very smoothly. Taiwan's technical mission in Nauru has
contributed much to agricultural and fishing cooperation between the two
countries and improvement of the well-being of the Nauruan people, he added.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China government agrees in principle some of the Philippines-
proposed new measures to protect its workers in Taiwan, but suggests it refrain
from interfering with Taiwan's internal administration  or encroaching  upon
Taiwan's administrative sovereignty, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) officials
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials  were responding  to media reports that the Philippine government
will implement a package of new measures from March, which include demanding
that Taiwanese employers provide their Philippine household servants with a
separate room for sleeping, and demanding that Philippine workers intending to
change employers should apply for approval with the Philippine representative
office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the process, the media reports said, the Philippine government will also
require Taiwanese employers to explain why the Philippine workers would change
employers.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC government has spared no efforts to protect the rights and
interests of foreign people working in Taiwan, the CLA officials said the
council respects the planned measures that will ask employers to provide a
single sleeping room to their Philippine household maids or family helpers.</P>
      <P>However, the officials said the CLA could not agree to the proposed measures of
requiring local employers to answer to the Philippine representative office's
questioning and Filipino workers applying for its representative office approval
before changing employers.</P>
      <P>Such measures, if implemented, would infringe upon Taiwan's administrative
sovereignty, the officials said, adding that it is a general international norm
and custom that labor importing country's legal provisions should be respected
in handling labor disputes.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the CLA as well as city and county governments around Taiwan have
had proper mechansims in place to handle labor disputes, including change of
employers, the officials said, the Philippine government should not try to
unilaterally interfere with Taiwan's labor administration or exercise of its
administrative sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Since labor rights protection is a universal value and one of Taiwan's top
policy guideline, the officials said the CLA will ask Taiwan's  representative
office  in Manila  to gain a better understanding of details of the Philippine-
proposed new measures and to negotiate with relevant Philippine agencies over
the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LARGEST YET HAUL OF CONTRABAND DRUG SEIZED ON KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
02/05/07  21:59:26</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Agents of the Bureau of Investigation seized, last month, 32,000 tablets of
Nimetazepam on the outlying island of Kinmen, the largest haul yet intercepted
in the mail from Taiwan proper, a bureau spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>A 48 year-old man, identified as Lu Hsing-huan, who is alleged to have tried
smuggling the contraband third-grade drug to Xiamen, in China's Fujian province,
through direct trade and shipping links between the two sides. Lu was arrested
Jan. 22 by investigating agents upon his arrival from Xiamen at the Taoyuan
International Airport near Taipei, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that a drug courier sought to export contraband narcotics
from Taiwan to China using the mini three links, the spokesman said, adding that
the illegal drugs have a street value of up to NT$6 million.</P>
      <P>Nimetazepam has reportedly become increasingly popular among Chinese youth -- in
addition to marijuana and ketamine -- prompting Taiwan drug dealers to seek to
smuggle the drugs into China to tap the strong demand there.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Kinmen's prosecutor was tipped off some six months
ago that Lu was planning to smuggle a large haul of Nimetazepam from Kinmen to
Xiaman by the Feb. 18 Chinese New Year, using direct transport  links between
the two sides.  Citing investigators stationed on Kinmen, the spokesman said
that Lu mailed the 32,000 tablets of Nimetazepam in three parcels from Taiwan to
Kinmen Jan. 3, from where he attempted to have the illicit drug smuggled into
Xiamen through the mini three links.</P>
      <P>Investigation shows that Lu flew from Taiwan to Kinmen the same day to arrange
smuggling channels to take the contraband substance to Xiamen. He flew back to
Taiwan later the same day and immediately transferred to Macau en route to
Xiamen, where he planned to take delivery of the three parcels himself.</P>
      <P>However, Lu was forced to fly back to Taiwan and was detained by agents Jan. 22
upon his arrival at the Taoyuan airport, after having waited in vain in Xiamen
for the arrival of the three parcels of Nimetazepam, which had been intercepted
by relevant authorities on Kinmen Island.</P>
      <P>Although Lu argued that he had no any idea that an unlawful drug was concealed
in the three parcels, the spokesman said, he was nonetheless sent to the Kinmen
Prosecutor's Office for further investigation.</P>

      <P>Taiwan repatriated Monday 152 illegal Chinese migrants, bringing the numbers of
those still in Taiwanese custody to a historic low, the National Immigration
Agency (NIA) said.</P>
      <P>The action followed the largest ever operation, which sent home 218 illegal
Chinese immigrants on Jan. 26. The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said the
repatriation of as many as 370 illegal Chinese immigrants in only 11 days is
encouraging.</P>
      <P>China has now become receptive to bringing home illegal immigrants,Liu Te-shun,
MAC vice chairman said Monday.This is not only good news for those Chinese who
want to go home for the Lunar New Year, but also a sign that China is finally
willing to face up to the problem and to take care of its citizens.</P>
      <P>China's past reluctance to accept the return of its illegal migrants to Taiwan
long disturbed Taiwan authorities. Delays in repatriation operations often
caused the number of migrants held in Taiwanese facilities to soar, with 1993
seeing a record of 5944 inmates in three asylums in northern Hsinchu, eastern
Ilan and outlying Matsu Island, according to NIA tallies.</P>
      <P>Now there are only 128 Chinese illegal immigrants in the asylums after Monday's
operation, the NIA officials said, adding that all of them had been implicated
in criminal cases, and therefore there are no inmates pending repatriation, and
this too is a record, officials said.</P>
      <P>The repatriation of Chinese illegal immigrants has been conducted through the
Red Cross Societies of the two sides, in accordance to a 1990 Kinmen Agreement.</P>

      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, deputy director of the National Security Bureau (NSB) , will soon
become the bureau's first civilian head.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office announced Monday that NSB Director Hsueh Shih-min will
be transferred to serve as a strategy adviser to the president and that the post
to be vacated following his job transfer will be filled by Shi. The personnel
reshuffle will take effect Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Up until now, the NSB, the country's top intelligence agency, has been headed by
senior officials with military backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Shi, a judge-turned-politician, will be the first non-military NSB chief when he
assumes office Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shi, who has a Ph.D. in law from National Chengchi University, had been a Tainan
and Taipei district court judge before joining the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) in the early 1990s. During his stints as SEF's deputy
secretary-general and later SEF secretary-general and vice chairman, Shi took
part in many important rounds of negotiations with Chinese officials to lay down
a framework for institutionalized engagements across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Shi later served as vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council which charts
Taiwan's policy toward China. When the Coast Guard Administration was
established in 2004, Shi became its inaugural chief, a post that provided him
with further opportunities to deal with the military and intelligence units.</P>
      <P>In February 2006, Shi was "demoted" to serve as NSB deputy chief. The unexpected
job transfer caused wide attention at that time. Shi has consistently kept a low
profile since then.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Shi's
"demotion" a year ago was actually an arrangement to prepare  him for taking up
a heavier  duty in the country's intelligence system.</P>
      <P>Many DPP lawmakers have expressed high expectations of Shi's new assignment,
expecting him to streamline the country's intelligence operations. They said
they are hopeful that Shi's promotion will mark a major step forward toward the
goal of having a civilian to lead the country's military.</P>
      <P>In contrast, opposition Kuomintang legislators, including Ting Shou-chung, were
skeptical about Shi's qualification and competence, saying they doubt Shi's
ability to head the county's mammoth intelligence and security system.</P>

      <P>Lee Chuan-tung, director-general of the MOFA's Department of East Asian &amp;
Pacific Affairs, also said that Nauruan Ambassador to the Republic of China
Ludwig D. Keke, who arrived in Taiwan recently, will present his credentials to
President Chen Shui-bian soon.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that since the two countries re-established diplomatic relations in

have been proceeding smoothly.</P>
      <P>After Nauru sets up the embassy in March, relations between the two countries

      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye expressed support Tuesday for the idea of
civilian control of the military, saying he hopes the goal can be achieved as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he has been discussing the issue with President Chen Shui-bian and
that he "can leave any time" if the president has found a suitable person to
replace him.</P>
      <P>Lee was commenting on recent remarks by President Chen that he hopes the
principle of civilian control of the military, which has not been realized in
the past seven years, can be implemented in the final year of his term.</P>
      <P>On the Ministry of National Defense's recent decision to remove the statues of
late President Chiang Kai-shek from military bases around the country, Lee urged
the opposition parties not to make a big deal out of what he called a "simple
question."</P>
      <P>Lee explained that the ministry is not going to destroy the statues but is only
relocating the statues to appropriate places, such as a museum.</P>
      <P>Noting that different opinions always abound in a democratic society, Lee said
there is no need for members of the opposition to squabble over the issue
because they can reinstall the statues when they come to power in the future if
they are unhappy with the decision.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, removing the statues has not undermined the military's respect
for Chiang, as the military still educates soldiers about Chiang's contributions
to Taiwan and follows Chiang's defense policy and his principles in dealing with
China.</P>
      <P>Calling Chiang the key perpetrator responsible for the 228 Incident of 1947 in
which thousands of people were massacred by Kuomintang (KMT) troops in the
suppression of a rebellion against KMT rule in Taiwan, legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have requested that the statues of the late
KMT leader be removed by Feb. 28 this year in memory of the 60th anniversary of
the incident.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the opposition KMT and People First Party have criticized Lee
for approving the DPP's request, saying Lee was currying favor with the DPP to
secure his position as defense minister.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislators claim the move is intended by the DPP to gain the
support of pro-independence voters in elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has provided criminal evidence against a fugitive
tycoon to U.S.  judicial authorities for reference, Vice Minister of Justice Lee
Chin-yung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said that he "could not confirm" media reports that prosecutors
recently went to the United States to communicate directly with U.S. officials
on the case of Wang You-theng, founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, who is
wanted in Taiwan for his suspected involvement in a series of fraud and
embezzlement scandals surrounding his business group.</P>
      <P>To get Wang back to Taiwan to face justice, the prosecutors also communicated
with the U.S. officials on possible ways of cooperation, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan put Wang on its most-wanted list in mid-January. He tried to fly to
Myanmar via Singapore last Wednesday but was sent back to the United States last
Friday by Singaporean authorities as he lacked the proper travel documents.</P>
      <P>Wang arrived in Los Angeles Saturday and was taken into custody by U.S.
immigration officials because his Taiwan and Dominican Republic passports were
invalid as a result of efforts by the Taiwan authorities. A U.S. court hearing
on whether Wang can stay in the United States will be held in one week.</P>
      <P>Lee said that to get Wang back to face justice will live up to the public's
expectations and that to enhance the U.S. understanding of Wang's involvement in
a series of scandals surrounding his business group is crucial to negotiations
with the U.S. authorities in getting him back to facilitate the probe.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the ministry is playing a dual role in Wang's case. First, the
ministry, based on the judicial assistance agreement signed between Taiwan and
the United States in March 2002, is communicating directly with the U.S.
judicial authorities, requesting assistance from the U.S. Justice Department.</P>
      <P>However,  Lee said that the ministry  has yet to receive notification from the
United States on sending officials to the country to deal with Wang's case.</P>
      <P>Secondly, many agencies under the Executive Yuan are dealing with Wang's case,
particularly the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is in charge of negotiations
with the United States, and the MOJ is serving as the legal adviser to the
Executive Yuan, providing views on legal counselling.</P>
      <P>Asked whether prosecutors have been sent to the United States or whether
prosecutors have traveled to the United States with foreign affairs officials,
Lee said he couldn't "confirm the matter."</P>
      <P>China Rebar and the Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co., both subsidiaries of
the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, applied for insolvency protection Dec. 29. The
disclosure of the two companies' financial troubles triggered a run on the
Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate, Jan. 5, as well as intensive
investigations into a series of economic crimes affecting many of the group's
several dozen affiliates.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will permit Chinese tourists
and cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights on weekends and holidays soon after
wrapping up bilateral negotiations, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan seminar sponsored by the legislative
caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , members of which suggested that
the government permit the opening as soon as possible after the coming Chinese
New Year -- which falls on Feb. 18 -- to help bolster Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Officials from relevant government agencies, including the MAC, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, the Ministry of the Interior and the Central
Bank of China (CBC) , as well as KMT lawmakers such as Tseng Yung-chuan, Lai
Shyh-bao, Alex Fei and Hung Hsiu-chu were present.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, bilateral talks on Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists,
cross-strait weekend and holiday charter flights, and the exchange of Chinese
yuan in Taiwan have made concrete progress and the MAC will allow the opening
soon after the two sides conclude negotiations.</P>
      <P>CBC Deputy Governor Hsu I-hsiung voiced the bank's support for allowing
renminbi-new Taiwan dollar exchanges in Taiwan as part of the government's

Chinese tourists will galvanize market demand for department stores, hotels,
shopping malls and office buildings.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's property prices still lag far behind those in other developed
countries, coming Chinese tourists with strong purchasing power are very likely
to target the local real-estate market, industry sources said.</P>

      <P>Sixty-seven percent of hair dye products sold on the Taiwanese market contain
p-phenylenediamine (PPD) , an irritating chemical that can lead to allergies and
even cancer, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the
Consumers' Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted on nine hair dye products purchased by the foundation
from cosmetics and beauty product stores in the Taipei area on Feb. 5,
foundation officials said.</P>
      <P>The survey found that six of the products contained PPD, and four of these did
not issue any warnings for consumers, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wan-sheng, a member of the foundation's medical disputes committee, noted
that PPD can trigger allergic reactions such as swelling, itching and rashes in
many people and result in a greater roughness and darkening of the scalp.</P>
      <P>Hsu advised people experiencing an allergic reaction to wash their hair every
day, warning that the problem can cause cell death of the hair follicle if it is
not dealt with properly over a long period of time.</P>
      <P>PPD can also damage blood cells in human bodies and hamper metabolism, which can
lead to anemia, breast cancer and bladder cancer, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Yu Kai-hsiung, secretary-general of the foundation, pointed out that Germany,
France and Switzerland have banned the use of PPD as an ingredient for hair
dyes, while Taiwan has set the concentration limit of PPD at 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Yu urged the government to require hair dye manufacturers to include relevant
warnings on the labels of their products and to stop using the chemical if there

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO ASK CABINET TO REMOVE GUARDS AT LATE PRESIDENT'S MAUSOLEUM</HEADLINE>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is expected to put forth a
proposal Wednesday recommending that Cabinet remove the military guards posted
at the mausoleum of late President Chiang Kai-shek, party officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Cabinet has no reason to continue to protect the mausoleum of
the "dictator", officials said the job of maintaining the mausoleum should be
taken care of by the offspring of the Chiangs, not the government.</P>
      <P>They said DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun will officially raise the proposal during the
party's Central Standing Committee meeting, when Academia Historica Curator
Chang Yen-hsien will brief the committee on an investigative report on who bore
responsibility for the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>The report, which was completed two years ago, pinpoints Chiang Kai-shek as the
key perpetrator for the incident that occurred in 1947, in which thousands of
people were massacred by KMT troops in suppression of a rebellion against KMT
rule in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The proposal to remove military guards from the Chiang's mausoleum will be yet
another move by the DPP to try to eliminate symbols of authoritarianism
associated with the Chiang from the country, and follows the removal of Chiang
Kai-shek's statues from military bases and a proposal to rename the Chiang Kai-
shek Memorial Hall as "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT BRIEFS PREMIER ON RESHUFFLING KEY POSTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
02/06/07  19:36:34
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian has explained
to him his reasons for reshuffling several key Presidential Office posts.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks one day after an announcement by the Presidential Office
regarding a swap of posts between Presidential Office Secretary-General Tan Sun
Chen and National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen.</P>
      <P>Other changes include the appointment of National Security Bureau Director Hsueh
Shih-min as a strategy adviser to the president and the promotion of Deputy
Director Shi Hwei-yow to Hsueh's post.</P>
      <P>Su said that "we have kept abreast of the personnel change. I expressed
appreciation to the president for telling me about his intentions in detail."</P>
      <P>But the premier added, "it is inappropriate for me to disclose the president's
intentions."</P>
      <P>Asked if the personnel change is aimed at preparing the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for the March 2008 presidential election, Su only said
that both Chiou and Tan Sun Chen have solid political backgrounds and that they
are capable of "shouldering great responsibilities."</P>
      <P>Chiou served in the posts of secretary-general to the Executive Yuan, the
Presidential Office and the National Security Council between 2000 and now,
while Tan Sun Chen served as legislator, Tainan county magistrate and foreign
affairs minister between 1992 and 2006.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislators said the new lineup, which will take effect
Wednesday, means that the DPP has taken up combat positions for the year-end
legislative  elections  and the March  2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, noted that President Chen
has relied on Chiou's resourcefulness in many ways, and that Chiou served as the
chief strategist in Chen's two presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Chiou's return to the post of secretary-general to the president, in which he
first served between January 2003 and May 2004, will assist the president in
dealing with many thorny issues, Ker said.</P>
      <P>He also said that Tan Sun Chen, who holds a Ph. D. in geophysics from Purdue
University, spent more than 20 years in the United States and has developed an
international perspective. He is also well versed in local and central
government affairs given that he served as both a magistrate and foreign
minister.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Hsin-nan also said that the president has made appropriate
adjustments, noting that Tan Sun Chen excels in administrative ability, while
Chiou, an adept who usually maintains a low profile, will be capable of
coordinating various factions before the upcoming  primaries  for the
legislative  and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators generally agreed that the president took the latest move
"out of concern with winning the elections."</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang said Chiou's new appointment means that the
president wants Chiou to serve as his chief strategist in the two major
elections ahead, and that the president's announcement last year that he would
loosen his grip on power and "delegate his executive power" was nothing but "a
joke."</P>
      <P>They were referring to the president's announcement last May that he would give
full power to Premier Su to control the Executive Yuan and refrain from meddling
with the affairs of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) amid rising
calls in both the DPP and the opposition for the president to take
responsibility for a series of scandals embroiling his family members and close
aides.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislators Hsu Shao-ping, Fai Hrong-tai and Lin Teh-fu speculated that
Chiou would resort to anything just to win the election, and his return to the
main strategic post for upcoming elections may mean that the president fears
that he will face persecution if the DPP loses in the 2008 presidential
elections in 2008.</P>
      <P>First lady, Wu Shu-jen, is currently one of the defendants in the "state affairs
fund" trial. The president was named along with his wife as a "joint
perpetrator" in the embezzlement of funds available for his discretionary use,
but is protected by constitutional immunity until he steps down in May 2008. The
president has consistently maintained his innocence in the case.</P>

      <P>The Pingtung District Prosecutor's Office on Tuesday released 11 suspects on
bail after law enforcement officers detained them a day earlier on charges of
selling tainted pork from sick and dead hogs.</P>
      <P>Environmental police busted the ring the previous day in Pingtung County's
Changchih township and in the city of Pingtung, seizing 5,500 kg of tainted
pork. The ring's members included seven people with a license to transport sick
and dead hogs for safe disposal, as well as several hired hands.</P>
      <P>The law enforcement agents found that the licensees had actually been butchering
the sick and dead hogs and selling the tainted meat to consumers.</P>
      <P>Police officers removed 5,500 kg of frozen pork, sausage and preserved pork from
a large walk-in freezer. Because the freezer was built 10 years ago, they
estimated that the illegal operation might have gone on for a decade and were
working to find out the ring's distribution network.</P>
      <P>The latest crackdown  in Pingtung  County  came after law enforcement agents in
Yunlin County, central Taiwan, raided five illegal slaughterhouses Feb. 1,
arresting one suspect and seizing 30 metric tons of tainted pork believed to
have been stashed to meet the increased demand for meat during the Lunar New
Year holiday.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Waste Disposal Act, those who ignore health concerns and
sell questionable meat from sick and dead hogs can be sentenced to a maximum of
five years in prison, plus a fine of up to NT$3 million.</P>

      <P>The Bureau of Investigation (BOI) announced Tuesday that police had seized more
than 100 kg of high-quality amphetamines and ketamine in the northern port city
Keelung, marking the largest volume of drugs that law-enforcing authorities have
ever uncovered in a single smuggling case.</P>
      <P>Earlier police arrested the main suspect, a man surnamed Chuang, at the Taiwan
Taoyuan airport on charges of smuggling and violating regulations on drug hazard
prevention and control, frustrating his attempt to flee to China, according to a
task force formed by the BOI to investigate the case.</P>
      <P>The task force indicated that the drugs, seized in two separate operations with
the first launched last July at a wharf warehouse along the coast of Keelung and
the other conducted Monday at a Keelung  Customs cargo container  center,
included  36 kg of amphetamines and 106.4 kg of ketamine.</P>
      <P>The street value of the drugs exceeds NT$100 million, and were the drugs
smuggled onto the island, they would be sufficient for use by 15 million people,
the task force said.</P>
      <P>The drugs were cleverly hidden in an "in-between" layer at the bottom of a cargo
container shipped from Guangtong Province, in southeastern China, the police
said, noting that since last July they have been watching a criminal ring
discovered to have schemed to smuggle goods, including foreign cigarettes, into

    <HEADLINE>KMT CENTRAL NOT IN FAVOR OF TAILOR-MADE CHANGE IN CLAUSE: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang's (KMT) central does not favor any regulation or clause changes
to serve one particular individual, main opposition KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at a news conference in response to reporters' questions
about speculation that the KMT's decision-making Central Standing Committee
(CSC) will modify a clause in a bid to enable KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to run
in the 2008 presidential election even if he is indicted on a graft charge.</P>
      <P>It was widely reported that the prosecution will indict Ma on embezzlement
charges by Feb. 9 over his alleged mishandling of special municipal fees
earmarked for his discretionary use while serving as mayor of Taipei from 1998
to 2006.</P>
      <P>As the KMT regulations require a candidate to pull out of any election if he or
she is indicted, it has been rumored that the powerful CSC is trying to revise
the measure to allow Ma, the party's most likely hopeful, to take part in the
2008 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT's CSC members were reportedly preparing to put forward a
motion at its weekly meeting the following day calling for approval of the
revised clause.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the party central does not encourage such a customized change, Su,
however, said that it is not in a position to meddle in any decision made by the
top decision-making CSC and that it was unaware of any such CSC plan.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker and CSC member Lai Shyh-bao, who is widely viewed as pro-Ma and who
maintains  close links with the KMT chairman, acknowledged that amending the
clause to bail out Ma would be controversial.</P>
      <P>But he claimed that it is necessary for the CSC to deal with it to avoid similar
politically charged cases in the future because the issue also involves many
other high ranking officials who receive special discretionary funds from the
government, Lai said, adding that he has no idea whether some CSC members have
endorsed the motion.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, some CSC members are in favor of changing the
party's clause to make "conviction" instead of "indictment" the bottom line for
any hopefuls seeking the party's nomination to run in future elections.</P>
      <P>Some CSC members were quoted by the reports as claiming that the KMT's clause
excluding indicted members from taking part in an election is invalid because it
goes against one of its platforms saying that "convicted party members are not
permitted to run in any election."</P>
      <P>Upon hearing this, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT heavyweight,
questioned how the party could fairly make amends to other party members already
banned from taking part in an election in the past due to the special clause.</P>
      <P>If the party approves the proposed modification to the clause, it has to weigh
how it could make it up to other affected members, he said.</P>

      <P>Scott Chen, vice president of Taipei Financial Center Corp. (TFCC), which owns
the world's tallest skyscraper, Taipei 101, said that "Damper dolls" and related
products will make their debut Feb. 8. In addition, Taipei 101 will develop a
series of Damper products promoting the beauty of Taiwan, adding that these will
be launched by March.</P>
      <P>The TFCC's assistant vice president Michael Liu said that Taipei 101 has
authorized a Japanese company to design and manufacture "Damper dolls, " which
are expected to generate profits though he declined to provide an estimate as to
how much.</P>
      <P>The mall views brand management as its top priority, Chen stressed, and
therefore will not open a chain of stores as do other local department stores.</P>
      <P>Noting that the mall recently spent nearly NT$20 million on the promotion of its
image by placing advertisements in international media, Liu complained that the
central and local governments have not created an environment attractive to
overseas tourists; as a result, Taipei 101's marketing efforts have produced
limited benefits.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, according to Liu, Taipei 101's observation deck brings in an annual
profit of between NT$300 million and NT$400 million.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that 40 percent of its customers are Japanese, while 50 percent are

      <P>Speaking at a national defense forum on East Asia's regional security held by
the National Defense Fu Hsing Kang College, Lee said Taiwan must maintain
adequate defense capability to prevent a war from occurring in the Taiwan

P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot PAC-III missiles from the United

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui has not changed his pro-Taiwan independence stance
and will take part in a special  activity  in commemoration  of the 228
Incident,  a pro-independence heavyweight said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ng Chiau-tong, head of the Hand-in-Hand to Safeguard Taiwan Alliance, made the
remarks at a news conference in which he said Lee remains firm on promoting
Taiwan independence and supports the idea of writing a new constitution and
changing the country's official title in order to make Taiwan a normal country.</P>
      <P>Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen and Chin Mei-ling, a Japan-based pro-
independence backer who once served as a national policy advisor to the
president, were also at the news conference to endorse Lee's stance.</P>
      <P>According to Ng, who met Lee for over an hour earlier in the day to discuss
controversy arising from Lee's remarks about Taiwan independence in recent days,
the former president has also promised to participate in the commemorative
activities slated to be held Feb. 28 to which President Chen Shui-bian will also
be invited.</P>
      <P>Ng claimed that Lee has never deviated from his pro-Taiwan independence stance
and called for the public's "continued support" for the cause.</P>
      <P>Lee told Next Magazine and the TVBS cable station the previous week that he had
never backed Taiwan independence and claimed that there is no need for the
government to pursue formal independence since Taiwan is already an independent
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Lee's comments stirred up strong criticism from pro-independence groups and
"friends of Lee Teng-hui" groups, prompting some of them to consider disbanding.</P>

      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT)  and the London-based Oxford
Business Group (OBG) will collaborate to make the Taiwan Economic Almanac
available around the world from June with the aim of helping European companies
become more acquainted with Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>ECCT Chief Executive Officer Guy Wittich and OBG Taiwan Director Karolien
Holsters signed an agreement Monday in Taipei City to seal the deal on their
cooperative venture.</P>
      <P>The almanac will be compiled by the OBG, which presently has 105,000 subscribers
and publishes economic yearbooks for emerging countries in Eastern Europe,
Africa and the Middle East, according to Holsters.</P>
      <P>She said Taiwan is the 25th country to be included on its almanac publishing
list, adding that South Africa, Jordan, Egypt and Malaysia are also on the list.</P>
      <P>Holsters said the group will station researchers in Taiwan for six to eight
months who will highlight the characteristics of Taiwan and make comprehensive,
in-depth reports on the economy. She estimated that a total of 65,000 copies
will be issued.</P>
      <P>She said that in the eyes of investors, Taiwan is a market with great potential,
adding that Taiwan's commercial advantage lies in sharing a common language and
culture with China, doing business with companies from the United States and
European countries, and yet remaining small enough for investors to deal with
easily.</P>
      <P>Wittich  said  foreign  investors  find a lot of business opportunities in
Taiwan, although he added that there is much room for improvement in its cross-
Taiwan Strait relations and politics.</P>
      <P>He noted that European enterprises fare quite well in the retail, traffic and
transport, and pharmaceutical industries in Taiwan, while Taiwan also has the
advantage of a better living environment than that of China.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the yearbook can help foreign investors explore  more
business  opportunities  in  Taiwan,  including non-traditional areas such as
tourism.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that strengthening Taiwan's democratic
system is its best defense against China's missile threat.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the president also acknowledged the need for Taiwan to upgrade its
military strength in the face of China's attempt to alter the Taiwan Strait
status quo.</P>
      <P>"China's military strength is growing exponentially, making it imperative for
Taiwan to upgrade its weaponry to maintain the military balance," Chen said
while meeting with a visiting delegation from Britain's Royal United Services
Institute for Defense Studies.</P>
      <P>Chen told his British  guests that China has outlined  a three-stage plan in
preparation for action against Taiwan. According to Chen, China will have the
readiness to respond to an emergency military conflict this year. By 2010, it
will be prepared to fight a large-scale war, and before 2015, it will achieve
the decisive capability to win a war. The development deserves grave concern, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chen further said China had already installed almost 1,000 missiles on its
southeastern coast targeting Taiwan. Since he took office in May 2000, Chen said
China had increased its total number of missiles targeting Taiwan from 200 to
988 by the end of 2006.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's military expansion and attempts to change the Taiwan

and military arsenal.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said Taiwan is committed to deepening its democratic system as
the best means against China's military threat.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has not improved its human rights records, Chen also asked

society in which men must pretend to possess what they really do not possess;
pretend to have plenty, when they have really nothing; and pretend to be in
affluence when they are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is
difficult to be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan is expected to post the 14th highest real salary increases in 2007 among
the world's 45 major economies, according to the results of an annual survey
released Tuesday by an international human resources organization.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by ECA International, forecast an average of 3.6 percent
in real salary increase -- a worker's actual salary increase after inflation is
taken into account -- for the Asian region in 2007, up approximately 50 percent
from 2006 and well above the global average.</P>
      <P>Among the 45 economies surveyed, the five highest real wage increases for 2007
are all expected to occur in Asia, with India topping the list with projected
real salary increases of 7 percent, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top-five list are Indonesia and China, with projected real

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES 10-YEAR PLAN FOR CRAFTING LONG-TERM CARE SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
02/07/07  12:30:34
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will spend more than NT$76.8 billion (US$2.31 billion) developing
a long-term care system over the next decade to deal with the challenges created
by the greying of the local  population,  Minister-without-Portfolio  Lin Wan-yi
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The plan has been incorporated into the "Mega Warmth" social welfare project
with an aim of offering long-term care aid to elderly people who require
assistance with daily activities, physically and mentally challenged people over
50 years of age, indigenous people aged over 55, and disabled elderly people who
live alone, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>It will be the largest social welfare program after the national pension system,
Lin said, adding that low-income families will receive full subsidies if needed
under the long-term care program, while middle-low-income families will receive
a 90 percent subsidy and regular families will be entitled to a 60 percent
subsidy.</P>
      <P>Noting that long-term care includes a variety of both medical and non-medical
services for the elderly and people with disabilities or chronic illnesses, Lin
said the ambitious program is expected to create some 60,000 new jobs.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Lin said that the local population is steadily
greying, with seniors accounting for 10 percent of the country's total
population this year. "This means more than 2.26 million people over 65 years of
age, with more than 200,000 of them needing different levels of long-term care
or assistance," he added..</P>
      <P>By 2016, Lin said, seniors will make up over 13 percent of the total population.
"By that point, the ratio of people aged under 14 will begin to decline, while
the elderly population will continue to increase, " he added.</P>
      <P>Changing demographics will make the need for crafting a long-term care system
even more critical than ever, Lin said, adding that what the elderly need most
is medical care, social care and economic security.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Lin said, Germany, Japan and the Netherlands have introduced
long-term care insurance systems to pay for long-term care services for the
elderly. Most other countries are using tax money to finance elderly welfare
services.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government will refer to Japan's 1994 "New Golden Plan" in forging
a comprehensive long-term care system for the elderly over the next decade.</P>

      <P>Taiwan imported 256.5 million Swiss francs (US$206.85 million) worth of watches
from Switzerland in 2006, making the country the 12th largest overseas market
for Swiss watches, according to tallies released Tuesday by the Federation of
the Swiss Watch Industry.</P>
      <P>The figure marked an increase of only 1.8 percent from the year-earlier level,
which was much lower than the growth rates of 22 percent recorded in 2005 and
12.2 percent recorded in 2004, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>The value of Swiss watch exports hit a new high of 1.37 billion Swiss francs in
2006, with luxury products remaining the main driving force of the industry.</P>
      <P>The export value of Swiss watches costing more than 3,000 Swiss francs jumped 27
percent in 2006, with their export quantity soaring 34.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Products costing below 3,000 Swiss francs saw their export value for 2006 remain
at a similar level as that for the previous year, while export quantity
increased marginally by 1 percent.</P>
      <P>The United States remained the largest overseas market for Swiss watches in
2006, importing 2.29 billion Swiss francs worth of watches from Switzerland
during the year.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong, which imported 1.95 billion Swiss francs worth of Swiss watches in
2006, was the products' second largest overseas market, followed by Japan, which
imported 1.27 billion Swiss francs worth of Swiss watches in the same year.</P>
      <P>China was the 10th largest overseas market for Swiss watches in 2006, importing
404 million Swiss francs worth of the watches during the year, up 14.9 percent

    <HEADLINE>OVER 1.2 MILLION PEOPLE CONSIDERED SUICIDE IN 2006: SURVEY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 1.42 million people around Taiwan thought about ending their own life
in 2006, with more than 410,000 actually attempting suicide, according to the
results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey on the mental health of the Taiwan people was conducted by the Mental
Health Foundation in November on 1,122 adults from cities and counties around
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the survey, the Taiwan people received a score of 82.63 points on their
general mental health, with 100 points indicating perfect mental health. The
score marked an improvement over the figure of 80.2 points in a similar survey
by the foundation a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The scores for the four major indicators used to calculate the overall mental
health of the people -- namely "mental and physical health, " "individual value,
" "life control" and "family health" -- also increased over the figures recorded
in the year-earlier survey, according to the private foundation.</P>
      <P>However, the results on the two survey questions on whether the respondent has
thought about committing suicide and whether the respondent has actually
attempted suicide have triggered concerns among experts at the foundation.</P>
      <P>Yang Tsung-tsai, head of the mental health center of Taipei-based Cardinal Tien
Hospital and convener of the foundation's team in charge of health indicator
affairs, said that based on the survey results, about 130,000 people around the
nation attempted suicide at least twice in 2006.</P>
      <P>"These people need care, " Yang said, noting that the survey results also
revealed that care shown by family and friends are crucial in maintaining one's
mental health.</P>
      <P>Yang explained that work-related and financial pressures as well as trouble in
intimate relationships are some of the main reasons leading people to consider
suicide, adding that people with the healthiest minds tend to be those that
share their thoughts with others.</P>

      <P>The details of the innovative "sugar chips" -- which have great potential for
industrial use as high-throughput diagnostic tools for the analysis of post-
translational protein glycosylation in disease states -- were published online
in the internationally-renowned journal Nature Protocols Jan. 31. They are also
scheduled to appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of
the United States of America Feb. 5.</P>
      <P>According to Wong, who is the most-cited chemist worldwide working in the area
of enzymes and who assumed the post of Academia Sinica president last October,
more than 80 percent of human proteins have sugars called glycoproteins attached
to them, and the process of protein glycosylation is known to play a central
role in mediating protein function in living organisms.</P>
      <P>Noting that altered glycosylation is often associated with inflammation  and
cancer  metastasis,  Wong said  the detailed correlation between glycosylation
and biological or pathological status may provide information for diagnosis and
treatment of diseases, particularly cancers.</P>
      <P>He added that by spreading a drop of human blood on the "sugar chip, " the
researchers can almost instantly determine what kind of cancer the patient is
suffering from.</P>
      <P>Wong, who has been a professor of chemistry with the Scripps Research Institute,
has pioneered work on the development of effective enzymes and the design of
novel substrates and processes for large-scale organic synthesis.</P>
      <P>The methods and strategies that Wong has developed have made possible synthetic
transformations that are otherwise impossible or impractical, especially in
areas vitally important in biology and medicine, and have pointed the way toward
new green methodologies for use in large-scale chemistry.</P>

      <P>Touting his idea of civilian control of the military, President Chen Shui-bian
said Wednesday there are numerous civilian candidates available who are
qualified to be minister of national defense.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that although he is reluctant to talk about his contribution to the
country, he has nurtured a lot of talent for the country over the past several
years.</P>
      <P>For example, there are "more than half a dozen" aspirants in the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party who are interested in running for the presidency in
2008, while there are "a truckload of" civilian candidates who are qualified to
be defense minister, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while presiding over a changover ceremony  in
which  Chiou  I-jen  was  sworn  in as the new secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, replacing Tan Sun Chen, who took over Chiou's previous post
of National Security Council secretary-general on the same occasion.</P>
      <P>Chen has recently appointed Shi Hwei-yow, deputy director of the National
Security Bureau, as the intelligence agency's first civilian head and expressed
the hope that the principle of civilian control of the military can be realized
in the final year of his term as president.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue Tuesday, Minister of National Defense Lee Jye said that
he hopes the goal can be achieved as soon as possible and that he "can leave any
time" if the president has found a suitable person to replace him.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The production value of the digital content industry totaled NT$341.2 billion
(US$10.37 billion) in 2006, up 17 percent from the previous year, according to
Industrial Development Bureau Director-General Chen Chao-yih.</P>
      <P>Of the figure, the production value of games software surpassed NT$20 billion
for the first time, representing a 10 percent increase over the previous year,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he presided over an award-presentation ceremony
Tuesday for the winners of a digital content competition that took place last
year.</P>
      <P>He said the purpose of the competition was to induce creativity and turn that
creativity into products and upgraded production values.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the competition, now in its fifth year, will serve as a
platform between digital content businesses and schools so as to introduce
school talent to the digital content industry.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Lin Feng-ching said the government had originally set
the production value of Taiwan's digital content at a projected NT$600 billion
by 2010, but he added that given the performance of the digital content industry
last year, the future development of the industry could be even more stunning.</P>
      <P>He noted that the main difference between the digital content industry and the
manufacturing industry lies in creativity, saying that future development will
center on animation and games, in the hope of making inroads into the
international market through TV and film animation.</P>
      <P>The government has in recent years put a great deal of effort into the digital
content industry as part of its "two-trillion, twin-star" program. "Two
trillion" refers to the production values of the semiconductor and imaging
display panel sectors reaching NT$1 trillion each while 'twin star" refers to
digital content and biotechnology industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMERS' FOUNDATION CALLS FOR CERTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR PORK</HEADLINE>

02/07/07  16:55:18

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation called for the government Wednesday to help build a
certification system for pork products amid reports that tainted pork from sick
and dead hogs has once again appeared in markets around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-hung said relevant government agencies'
efficiency is open to doubt, with illicit selling of sick and dead hogs to
consumers occurring every year since 2001 even though the matter has been one of
the top 10 consumer news items every year.</P>
      <P>Cheng said building a pork certification system is the only effective way of
curbing tainted pork sales, as the business is too lucrative to be ignored and
the penalties meted out by the government are too lenient.</P>
      <P>Since violators of regulations banning the sale of pork from sick and dead hogs
are usually released on bail of just NT$50,000, Cheng suggested that the
government impose heavier penalties on violators.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Luo Chiu-ying, a member of the Consumer's Foundation, said that to
counteract the marketing of tainted pork, consumers should avoid buying pork
from unknown sources or pork at prices much cheaper than street value.</P>
      <P>Buying pork products carrying the CAS label at supermarkets or hypermarkets is
also safer, Luo added.</P>
      <P>Luo said the foundation has found that only a small number of meat dealers have
been involved in the crime -- Taiwan people consume about 9 million head of hogs
each year, with about 30,000 head slaughtered every month -- and the latest news
report about the busting of a ring in the southern county of Pingtung indicates
that only about 20 to 50 sick and dead hogs have been sold to meat markets per
day recently.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung District Prosecutor's Office a day earlier released 11 suspects on
bail after law enforcement officers detained them Monday on charges of selling
pork from sick and dead hogs.</P>
      <P>A total of 5,500 kg of tainted pork was reportedly seized in a raid along with
the Pingtung ring, which included seven people licensed to transport sick and
dead hogs for safe disposal, as well as several hired hands.</P>
      <P>The latest crackdown  in Pingtung  County  came after law enforcement agents in
Yunlin County, central Taiwan, raided five illegal slaughterhouses Feb. 1,
arresting one suspect and seizing 30 metric tons of tainted pork believed to
have been stashed to meet the increased demand for meat during the Lunar New
Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Council of Agriculture's Animal Industry
Department said they will accelerate the installation of global positioning
systems (GPS) on vehicles contracted to transport sick and dead hogs for safe
disposal so that they can be monitored.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will also step up raids on unlicensed slaughterhouses
and  push  for the implementation  of a pork certification system, beginning
with supermarkets and hypermarkets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARSENIC LEVELS IN TAICHUNG AIR SOAR AFTER OPENING OF SCIENCE PARK</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The concentration of arsenic in the atmosphere in central Taichung City has
skyrocketed since the inauguration of the Central Taiwan Science Park, with a
reading of as high as 37 nanograms per cubic meter detected in certain spots in
the city,  according  to data  released  Wednesday  by the Taiwan Environmental
Protection Union (TEPU).</P>
      <P>The data included the results of monitoring conducted by the city's
Environmental Protection Bureau and another laboratory report obtained
independently by the union.</P>
      <P>The data shows that the arsenic concentration in the air surrounding the science
park soared from just 2.5 nanograms in 2005, when the park was still under
construction, to 31 nanograms in 2006, when some plants in the park had started
mass production.</P>
      <P>While researchers detected arsenic concentrations of up to 37.4 nanograms at
Tunghai University, another test conducted by the Environmental Protection
Bureau returned a reading of 27 nanograms.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the arsenic concentration in the air in the city's Hsitun district
registered 30 nanograms, much higher than the concentration recorded in even
severely polluted mining zones around the world.</P>
      <P>TEPU Chairwoman Hsu Kuang-jung noted that arsenic is a toxic substance that can
cause cancer and kill.</P>
      <P>The carcinogenic risk registers 0.001 percent when the arsenic concentration in
the air stands at 2 nanograms, increasing to 0.01 percent when the concentration
reaches 20 nanograms, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The TEPU demanded that National Science Council Chairman Chen Chien-jen and
Taichung City Environmental Protection Bureau Director Lee Li-teh step down to
take responsibility for the failure to prevent the pollution.</P>
      <P>The council should also present a resolution for the problem in 30 days and
punish manufacturers  responsible for the arsenic emissions, TEPU officials
said.</P>

the situation has improved since last October when a new set of protective
measures for foreign laborers were put into force.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, local governments are required to verify every case
involving firing, advanced termination of contract and repatriation of foreign
laborers and should assist in handling disputes between local employers and
foreign employees.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tsai said, special counters have been opened at major airports for
disgruntled foreign laborers, particularly those who feel their legitimate

to have committed any infractions.</P>

workers need not hesitate to voice complaints through legal channels.</P>

      <P>Prominent foreign dignitaries and curators, including former French Primie
Minister Michel Rocard, have been invited to attend a ceremony marking the
reopening of the National Palace Museum slated for Thursday, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Inviting some two dozens of foreign officials and museum experts to Taiwan to
witness the reopening of the National Palace Museum after the museum's nearly-
three-year remodeling is part of the Foreign Ministry's efforts to expand
Taiwan's influence in the international community via the cultural front,
ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>The invited guests -- also including Gambian Tourism and Cultural Minister
Angela Colley; Stephane Martin, curator of Museum Quai Branly of France; and
Emily J. Sano, director of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco -- are also
expected to pay a visit to the high-profile exhibition "Grand View: Painting,
Calligraphy, Ju Ware and Rare Books from the Northern Sung Dynasty" which the
National Palace Museum has organized to mark its official reopening Feb. 8.</P>
      <P>Culture and the cultural development models from the Sung Dynasty (960-1279)
have tremendously  influenced  the world's cultural development and the
collections of Sung Dynasty artifacts happen to be among the most pivotal
collections of the National Palace Museum, which is considered the world's
leading Chinese art treasures.</P>
      <P>The three-month Grand View exhibition, which is scheduled to end March 25,
showcases a total of 42 paintings and 29 pieces of calligraphy dating from the
Northern Sung period (960-1127), as well as five Northern Sung paintings and
calligraphy works on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and
the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City.</P>
      <P>Also on display are Ju ceramic wares of the Northern Sung period, fired in the
early 12th century, which are renowned for the classical beauty of their warm
and glossy sky-blue glaze. Surviving pieces of Ju ware are extremely rare, with
less than 70 found in collections around the world today. The National Palace
Museum is fortunate to have 21, the most of any collection.</P>
      <P>Renowned for its impressive collection of art works of the Sung Dynasty, the
museum is putting its collection of Sung Dynasty artifacts in its entirety on
display for the first and possibly the last time due to the fragility of the art
works. The museum is known for its unique collection of some 654,500 imperial
art treasures brought to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 to
keep them out of the hands of the communists and Mao Zedong's Red Guard.</P>

      <P>The global market for digital mandarin Chinese learning will be worth some US$60
billion in five years, officials from the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) predicted Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials urged Taiwan businessmen and companies to grasp the opportunity
of a rising Chinese-learning fad worldwide to make money out of the trend.</P>
      <P>The officials quoted a survey conducted by the Summer Institute of Linguistics
(SIL) International as indicating that among the world's 6,809 languages in use,
mandarin is currently the language with the greatest number of speakers.</P>
      <P>About 14.8 percent of the world's population, or roughly 885 million people,
speak mandarin as their mother tongue or second language, compared to 400
million people who speak English as their mother tongue or second language,
officials said.</P>
      <P>It was assessed that about 1 million mandarin teachers will be needed worldwide
to meet the demand arising from the Chinese-learning fad. Currently,
nevertheless, there are only about 100,000 mandarin teachers working.</P>
      <P>The evident shortages has resulted in a huge need for digital mandarin teaching
materials, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO NEW 'SUGAR PROBES' FOR CANCER SPREAD DEVELOPED</HEADLINE>

      <P>Researchers at Academia Sinica's Genomics Research Center have developed two new
"sugar probes" that can target abnormal proteins in cancer cells to facilitate
studies on cancer metastasis, academic sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The research team led by Academia Sinica President Wong Chi-huey, includes
postdoctoral research fellow Hsu Tsui-ling and staff at the Scripps Research
Institute in the United States.</P>
      <P>Scientists  have long known that proteins transmit genetic information from cell
to cell. If the protein responsible for relaying information related to cancer
metastasis can be spotted, then researchers might be able to stop the metastasis
by blocking the protein. However, there are tens of thousands of proteins in the
human body, making tracking a specific one like looking for a needle in a
haystack.</P>
      <P>However, Wong explained, the team has found that metastasis- related proteins
tend to combine with certain types of carbohydrates, so they made two probes out
of trehalose and sialic acid analog to "trap" the proteins.</P>
      <P>The team has also deployed agide compounds to mark those proteins combined with
the probes, facilitating the examination process.</P>
      <P>In the process, they discovered the protein, Wong said. However, further
analysis and research is needed to better understand its characteristics and the
therapy to stop the metastasis.</P>

      <P>An investigation by the Department of Health (DOH) of 1,148 meat suppliers and
vendors around the country has turned up no signs of pork from sick and dead
hogs, a DOH official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DOH mobilized every city and county health bureau from Feb. 1 to investigate
the meat suppliers and vendors,  including 240 pork-processing factories, 402
restaurants and 506 traditional market vendors.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Food Sanitation Director Cheng Huei-wen pointed out that it takes time
to find illegally butchered pork because the illegal slaughterhouses discovered
so far have produced only around 5,000 kg of pork, while around 2.8 million kg
is consumed daily.</P>
      <P>Restaurants near universities were the investigation's key point, but no
evidence of tainted meat was found.</P>
      <P>Cheng reminded consumers to check for the CAS logo on the skin of good quality
pork and to be aware of pork selling for extremely low prices or without skin.</P>
      <P>Those caught selling pork from sick or dead pigs face fines of between NT$30,000
(US$909) and NT$150,000, Cheng said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been communicating every day with the United States on the case of
Wang You-theng, fugitive founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, Republic of
China Representative to the United States David Ta-wei Lee said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while attending a party to mark the fifth anniversary of
the inauguration of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus, a pro-Taiwan group in
the House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan and the United States are cooperated closely on the case and
that both sides "have communicated daily on the case to exchange views."</P>
      <P>Asked when a U.S. court hearing on Wang's case will be set and how Taiwan
prosecutors traveling to the United States will cooperate with U.S. judicial
officials, Lee said only that the case "has entered judicial process, and that
it is not appropriate for me to comment on the case."</P>
      <P>Wang, wanted in Taiwan for his suspected involvement in a series of fraud,
accounting and embezzlement scandals surrounding his business group, is in the
custody of U.S. immigration officials.</P>
      <P>Taiwan put Wang on its most-wanted list in mid-January. He tried to fly to
Myanmar via Singapore last Wednesday but was sent back to the United States last
Friday by Singaporean authorities as he lacked the proper travel documents.</P>
      <P>Wang arrived in Los Angeles Saturday and was taken into custody because his
Taiwan and Dominican Republic passports were invalid as a result of efforts by
the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>In related development in Taiwan, prosecutors continued their probe into the
case, summoning nine defendants in detention for more questioning Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Fifty-one people related to the Rebar scandal have been listed as defendants so
far, 13 of whom have been detained. The number of people related to the case
barred from leaving the country has increased to 91.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun defended
Wednesday his proposed "desinicization moves" amid rampant speculation on why he
raised the proposals at this particular time.</P>
      <P>In response to the speculation on why he proposed a name change for some state-
run companies and a withdrawal of military guards posted at the mausoleums of
the late presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo now, Yu, displaying an
official document, argued that he asked in January 2005, while serving as
premier, that task forces be set up in relevant government agencies to promote a
name change of public enterprises that carry "China" in their titles.</P>
      <P>But Yu was reserved when asked by reporters whether it was his successor, former
Premier Frank Hsieh, who failed to continue carrying out the mission.</P>
      <P>Yu also ascribed the 228 Incident in 1947 to Chiang Kai-shek, whom pro-
independence activists say is the main culprit behind the tragedy, in which
thousands of Taiwan's elite were murdered by Kuomintang  (KMT)  troops in the
initial  stage of the KMT's authoritarian rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu was also reportedly planning to propose at the DPP's Central Standing
Committee meeting later that same day that the government remove all Chiang
statues from military barracks around the country and pull all military guards
stationed at the two late presidents' temporary mausoleums in northern Taoyuan
county.</P>
      <P>Yu will also ask KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to make a vow Feb. 28 that he will
stop paying his respects to the two late presidents at their mausoleums.</P>
      <P>Yu's series of proposals provoked criticism from the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" and stirred up allegations within the DPP, in particular from pro-
Hsieh lawmakers, as to whether his moves were aimed at outgunning other DPP
aspirants vying for the party's nomination to run in the 2008 presidential
election, including Hsieh, Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Wang Hsing-nan, however, voiced his support for Yu's proposal to
relocate statues of Chiang and his son, pointing out that many Taiwan people
have no respect for the two late dictators.</P>
      <P>Wang hailed Yu's statue relocation idea and argued that it is not the
government's obligation to finance the maintenance of the two Chiangs' tombs and
that providing finance in fact lacks any legal basis according to the law.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Cheng Yun-peng, a Hsieh protege, claimed that Yu should  first
quit  the chairmanship  if he wants  to start electioneering for the 2008
presidency.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that he agrees with the statue relocation idea but contended that the
DPP head should have discussed the issue with the Legislative Yuan and should
have allowed the Executive Yuan to make the announcement instead of the party
central.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT legislative caucus members accused Yu of seeking to cement "deep
green" voter support by airing the comments.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Hsu Shao-ping argued that both the military and honor
guards at the mausoleums must not be removed because they are one of Taiwan's
major tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Alex Fei urged Yu to "stop rubbing salt into wounds" by rehashing
these historic issues, and said that the DPP chairman did this to jockey for a
position in the DPP aimed at the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the
opposition People First Party (PFP) in the "pan-blue alliance, " accused the DPP
of attempting to launch a "cultural revolution" in Taiwan in a covert move to
"conceal its fear of declaring formal Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>Lee also blasted Minister of National Defense Lee Jye for "having no guts" in
yielding to DPP pressure and for having agreed to remove a total of 228 statues
of the two former presidents from military barracks on Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Cheng Chin-ling and PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung
demanded that Lee Jye immediately step down.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved an amendment to the Supplementary and Continuing
Education Law Wednesday that will prohibit cram schools from enrolling children
under the age of six.</P>
      <P>According to Cabinet officials, education of preschool children should focus on
health and ethical education and should be closely linked with family education,
and the amendment is designed at laying a sound base for the mental and physical
development of children.</P>
      <P>However, cram schools that offer children under six classes related to rhythm
and artistic training will not be included on the list of prohibited schools,
the officials added.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese parents tend to push their children from a very early age into various
cram schools to receive supplementary courses outside the formal education
system in a wide variety of subjects to prepare them for their entry into the
fierce job market.</P>
      <P>The tendency has resulted in a country swarming with cram schools and enviable
incomes for teachers in these schools -- plus a group of unhappy children.</P>
      <P>The amendment will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for approval, the officials
said, adding that once approved, violators will receive a warning to follow the
new regulations or face fines of between NT$50,000 and NT$200,000, with serious

      <P>According to SERI's report, Asian countries have shifted their focus from Japan

      <P>U.S. and Taiwan officials recognize that the U.S.-Taiwan Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement (TIFA) is "the best platform" for efforts to promote
cooperation between the two sides in the fields of trade and investment,
although they share differing opinions on the issue of a free trade accord
(FTA).</P>
      <P>A workshop on the proposed U.S.-Taiwan FTA was held Monday at the Brookings
Institute in Washington, D.C., with Richard Bush, director of the Center for
Northeast Asian Policy Studies of the think tank and a former chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan presiding over the talks.</P>
      <P>The event drew the participation of Eric Altbach, the deputy assistant U.S.
trade representative, and U.S.-Taiwan Business Council Chairman Rupert Hammond-
Chambers, as well as Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang, Taiwan's
Deputy Representative to the U.S. John C.C. Deng and Taiwan Thinktank Chairman
Chen Po-chih.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Shih voiced Taiwan's desire to forge an FTA, saying that
Taiwan needs to reinforce its cooperative relationship with the U.S.</P>
      <P>Chen said that while Taiwan faces political suppression by China in the
international society, economically the nation has also been seen to have an
increasing reliance on the Chinese market. The imbalance in both politics and
economics will damage the common strategic interests of the U.S. and Taiwan, the
economist warned, adding that an FTA would get rid of the imbalance.</P>
      <P>Chen urged Washington to realize the urgency of the issue.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chen's remarks, Deng said that the two countries need to take steps to
integrate resources in the U.S.-Taiwan cooperation mechanism and that with
Taiwan's great efforts to seek economic upgrading, it would be beneficial for
the U.S. to sign an FTA with Taiwan.  In response to the call, most of the
American participants pointed out that Taiwan is not listed among the countries
in the process of FTA talks with the U.S. trade and investment departments.</P>
      <P>While the United States has always believed Taiwan is motivated by political
need rather than economic interest in its bid for an FTA, the U.S. enterprise
sector has expressed hope that Taiwan first lift limitations against trade
between the two sides across the Taiwan Strait and push for direct cross-strait
transport links, the U.S. experts said, with Altbach suggesting that the two
nations concentrate their energies on talks under the TIFA.</P>
      <P>Altbach said there has been great progress in previous rounds of U.S.-Taiwan
TIFA talks in past years on many issues, including those concerning intellectual
property rights protection, agricultural trade opening, modernization of the
financial industry and pharmaceutical trading controls.</P>
      <P>The TIFA was signed between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States in 1994 to
resolve bilateral trade issues and enhance economic cooperation in the absence
of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>

representatives of Taiwan's six professional baseball teams.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, the premier instructed Finance Minister Ho Chih-chin to step up
the launch of the sports lottery, which is expected to help stem illegal
gambling on local professional baseball games and generate money to finance
domestic sports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the premier ordered the National Police Agency and the Bureau of
Investigation to take measures to prevent gangsters from interfering with local
professional baseball games again.</P>
      <P>There have been three baseball scandals involving organized crime in 1996, 2005,
and 2006, respectively, which have caused the number of people attending games
to drop from 1.05 million to 670,000 within the past five years, according to
Su.</P>
      <P>In addition, Su requested that Ho grant tax breaks to six business groups that
have long sponsored local baseball, while ordering  the Ministry  of Economic
Affairs to ask state-run enterprises to form a baseball team.</P>
      <P>In related news, Joseph Tsai, director-general of the Finance Ministry's
National Treasury Agency, remarked that despite the NCPFS's plan, the ministry
needs to further discuss with the Executive Yuan the establishment of
supplementary measures and a monitoring mechanism.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Military Wants More Civilians to Help in Iraq

Senior military officers, including members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have
told President Bush and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates that the new Iraq
strategy could fail unless more civilian agencies step forward quickly to carry
out plans for reconstruction and political development.

The complaints reflect fresh tensions between the Pentagon and the State
Department over personnel demands that have fallen most heavily on the military.
But they also draw on a deeper reservoir of concerns among officers who have
warned that a military buildup alone cannot solve Iraqs problems, and who now
fear that the military will bear a disproportionate burden if Mr. Bushs strategy
falls short.

Wall Street Journal: How One Man Riled The Emerald Trade

Walking through this city's historic emerald district last summer, Arthur Groom
was approached by a man who sidled up and flashed a fistful of white folded
papers containing cut stones.

Arthur Groom is stirring up a sometimes shady nook of the gem world by becoming
the first person to try selling branded, natural emeralds, just as De Beers did

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and his city government employees answered a call by the
Taichung Blood Center Wednesday for donors to help relieve its current blood
shortage.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government and the Taichung Blood Center jointly held a blood
donation drive in front of the city government after the mayor learned of the
shortage being experienced by the center.</P>
      <P>Hu was the first to roll up his sleeve to donate, leading fellow employees
waiting for their turn in a long queue.</P>
      <P>Hu told the donors that he was grateful that his wife's life was saved by an
emergency surgery that required a transfusion of 20,000 c.c. of blood after she
was seriously injured in a car accident in November last year.</P>
      <P>He said that he will be a "happy frequent blood donor" for the rest of his life.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Blood Services Foundation has pointed out that the Lunar New Year
holiday beginning on Feb. 17 is a period when blood centers throughout Taiwan
are dogged by blood shortages, which threaten the ability of hospitals to
perform surgeries and respond to emergencies.</P>
      <P>To cope with the crisis, the foundation and its blood centers have launched a
month-long blood donation campaign from Jan. 16 to Feb. 16.</P>
      <P>Experts at the foundation estimate that if everyone who is eligible to donate
blood did so twice a year, shortages at Taiwan's blood centers would become a
thing of the past.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the Netherlands Wednesday to grant visa-free
privileges to Taiwanese tourists to further boost bilateral civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call while meeting with Hans van Baalen, chairman of the Dutch
parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, who arrived in Taipei earlier this week
for a visit.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Chen said, substantive relations
between Taiwan and the Netherlands have been close and cordial. Two-way trade
reached US$6.6 billion last year, making Holland Taiwan's second largest
European trading partner after Germany.</P>
      <P>"There should much more room for bilateral trade to grow further in the years to
come," Chen said, adding that the Netherlands is also Taiwan's biggest investor
from Europe,  with accumulated Dutch investment in Taiwan reaching US$8.88
billion at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Baalen for his ardent efforts in the past years to help promote
friendly relations between Taiwan and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Among others,  Baalen initiated a resolution in the Dutch parliament in December
2003 on opposing the European Union to lift its arms embargo against China.
Through his strenuous effort, the resolution cleared the Dutch parliamentary
floor. In the following year, the Netherlands took up the E.U. presidency and
used its diplomatic leverage to prevent the bloc from removing its arms ban
against China.</P>
      <P>In October 2005, Baalen again used its political clout to have the Dutch
parliament pass a resolution throwing support behind Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Assembly -- the World Health Organization's governing body -- as an
observer.</P>
      <P>"Neither of these achievements came easily. We are grateful for your kind-
hearted assistance with our national cause, " Chen told Baalen during their
meeting at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is still ample room for Taiwan-Dutch ties to grow, Chen
galvanized Baalen to continue assisting in promoting substantive relations.
Tasks in this regard include pushing the Dutch executive branch to take concrete
actions to substantiate support for Taiwan's WHO bid, offer visa-free entry for
Taiwanese tourists and advocate the formation of a pro-Taiwan subgroup in the

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR ACTIVE STEPS TO STAMP OUT CHILD ABUSE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Relevant government agencies should pull out all the stops to stamp out child
abuse and enhance children's well-being, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks amid an increasing number of reports of child abuse cases,
including some shocking and horrifying child abuse and neglect fatalities, in
recent weeks.</P>
      <P>"It's sad and disheartening to hear one after another child neglect or abuse
case, " Su said, adding that the government cannot stand idly by while many
young children face the threat of abuse.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, up to 83 percent of child abuse fatalities
were committed by the children's own parents or their natural parents' live-in
lovers, and 73 percent of the victims were under 6 years of age.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Su said, the government has devoted a huge amount of funds
and manpower to addressing the child abuse issue. "But the continuing rise in
the number of reported child abuse cases indicate that our efforts are still not
sufficient, " Su said, adding that in the face of rapid social changes, relevant
government agencies should work even harder to protect children from falling
victim to violence or filicide-suicide.</P>
      <P>According to a Ministry of the Interior (MOI) report, 90 percent of child abuse
cases happened within families, and more than 50,000 children have been listed
for special attention as they live in families at high risk of violence or
suicide.</P>
      <P>An MOI official said the ministry will push for amendments to the existing
child welfare  law to require grass-roots  community coordinators to report
child abuse cases or high-risk families.</P>
      <P>The official said the ministry is also studying the feasibility of using funds
from the public-interest lottery to set up regional family welfare service
centers for disadvantaged  children  or high-risk families.</P>
      <P>"We are also considering  stopping  recruiting  grass-roots community
coordinators and using the budget to recruit trained social workers or
caseworkers to strengthen services for disadvantaged children from high-risk
families," the official added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu urged China Wednesday to
respond positively to Taiwan's call for cross-Taiwan Strait judicial cooperation
so as to clear itself of the reputation  of being a "paradise for Taiwanese
criminals."</P>
      <P>Wu noted that under the Kinmen Agreement signed by the Red Cross societies on
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1990, Taiwan has repatriated  a large
number of illegal Chinese immigrants and criminals.</P>
      <P>Although China has also repatriated more than 100 Taiwanese criminals over the
years, approximately 400 Taiwanese criminals are still hiding in China, and
Chinese authorities have no intention of helping Taiwan arrest them and send
them back, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, owing to the lack of any standards or system in dealing with
matters as such, Beijing usually bases its decision on whether to repatriate the
Taiwanese criminals on whether they have committed any crime in China.</P>
      <P>Citing the case of Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng  as an
example,  Wu said that Taiwan asked Chinese authorities to help track down and
repatriate Wang soon after he fled to China but that Beijing ignored the request
and even allowed Wang to leave China freely for the United States.</P>
      <P>As Beijing has no obligation to help Taiwan arrest criminals hiding in China
under the present situation, Taiwan has repeatedly called  for  the
establishment  of a cross-strait  accord  on crime-fighting cooperation, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is on a visit in the U.S. capital, made the remarks in response to
questions from Taiwan reporters.</P>
      <P>On China's effort to improve its international image ahead of the 2008 Olympic
Games to be held in Beijing, Wu said it is a positive development that China has
recently relaxed its news coverage restrictions for foreign media and allowed
the content of a book on democracy to be published in newspapers in the country.</P>
      <P>However, China has on the other hand stepped up its suppression of civil rights
activists and shown no improvement in human rights protection, Wu said.</P>
      <P>On the issue of allowing  Chinese  media outlets to post correspondents in
Taiwan, Wu said the MAC suspended permits for China's state-controlled Xinhua
News Agency and People's Daily to post correspondents in Taiwan two years ago
because they had repeatedly produced misleading reports about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While making the decision at that time, the MAC also asked Beijing to allow the
Chinese people to enjoy broader access to news reports by Taiwanese media, Wu
noted.</P>
      <P>Praising China for having made some progress in this regard recently, Wu pointed
out that news Web sites run by Taiwan's China Times and United Daily News,
which were blocked  by Chinese authorities in the past, are now accessible in
some areas of China.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MAC will restore the permits for the two Chinese media  outlets  and
even allow  more Chinese  media  to post correspondents in Taiwan if Beijing
removes its "blockade" against Taiwan media completely.</P>

      <P>Police said Chang has sold some 17 million such tablets through various

      <P>Chang, who sold cosmetics, is very familiar with marketing products through

      <P>The Cabinet will evaluate the feasibility of proposals put forth by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) regarding the pursuit of transitional justice
in the country, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he agrees that Taiwan, having achieved democracy through a peaceful
transition of power, needs to further deepen its democracy and address issues of
transitional justice by providing redress for those victimized during the period
of authoritarian rule and correcting historical truths that were distorted in
the past.</P>
      <P>However, as the proposals raised by the DPP involve not only the jurisdiction of
the central government but also of local governments and even the cooperation of
the people, the Cabinet will conduct a comprehensive review of the proposals
before deciding whether to adopt them, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Marking the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident this year, the DPP has
recommended that the government step up its effort in the pursuit of
transitional justice.</P>
      <P>The DPP has proposed that the country enact a law on transitional justice,
release a report on the truth behind the 228 Incident, eliminate the remnants of
authoritarian rule, and hold various commemorative events to mark the 228
Incident.</P>
      <P>Among the measures to eliminate the remnants of authoritarian rule, the party
has asked the Cabinet to remove military guards posted at the mausoleum of late
President Chiang Kai-shek, rename the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to "Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall" and rename all roads named after Chiang -- who is
considered the key perpetrator of the 228 Incident of 1947 during which
thousands of people were massacred by Kuomintang (KMT) troops suppressing a
rebellion against KMT rule in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As an eyewitness and a longtime observer of Taiwan's development over the past
30 years, British Museum scholar Jan Stuart told the CNA on the sidelines of an
international academic conference that she has been constantly amazed that it's
possible for Taiwanese identity and Chinese identity to coexist.</P>
      <P>Currently in Taiwan for the promotion of a British Museum artifacts exhibition
and an international conference on the art and culture of China's Northern Sung
Dynasty (xxx-xxxx) , the Asia Department keeper of the British Museum has also
been busy meeting acquaintances during his visit. And she hasn't needed a guide.</P>
      <P>Stuart, a U.S. citizen, speaks excellent Mandarin and is very familiar with
Taipei City because she lived in Taiwan for a total of one-and-a-half years on
two separate occasions in the 1970s and the 1980s.</P>
      <P>She visited Taiwan for the first time in 1976 "to see if studying Chinese in
Taiwan could be an option" and ended up staying for six months, living with a
well-educated couple in the Wanhua district of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>"We lived in an old community and a house with no hot water. It was the first
time I realized that people with the same education level enjoy different living
standards, " Stuart said, describing the experience as "culture shock."</P>
      <P>With her interest in Chinese culture growing, Stuart came back to Taiwan in 1982
and enrolled  in a National Taiwan University Chinese-language program, living
this time on Roosevelt Road for nine months. "I've been surprised to see how
fast Taiwan has changed as a country since that time," she told the CNA.</P>
      <P>Based on her experience and observations, Stuart presents a unique perspective
on Taiwanese culture and Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>There are many regions in China, such as Tibet and Xinjiang, that have distinct
cultures, Stuart said, adding that this is the reason why she thinks the
Taiwanese identity can coexist with the Chinese identity.</P>
      <P>"From the viewpoint of an outsider, "it's possible to be Taiwanese and Chinese
at the same time, " she said, adding, however, that she realizes it is not easy
to separate politics from culture, especially in Taiwan's case.</P>
      <P>Stuart said that she first fell in love with Chinese culture after seeing
Chinese paintings as a high school student and that her experience in Taiwan
facilitated her decision to pursue Chinese culture research as a career.</P>
      <P>Stuart obtained both her bachelor's degree and master's degree at Yale
University and worked in the field of Chinese culture studies thereafter.</P>
      <P>Specializing in art and culture from China's Sung Dynasty (960-1279) to the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1912) , Stuart worked in the Smithsonian Institute before joining
the British Museum three months ago. She is now based in London.</P>
      <P>In addition to scholastic research, Stuart enjoys "visual arts of every country
and form" as well as folk practices. During her time in Taiwan,  she spent
numerous  hours watching  outdoor  puppetry performances.</P>
      <P>"I enjoy observing how people live, " she said.</P>
      <P>A total of 271 artifacts collected by the British Museum valued at more than
NT$50 billion are being exhibited at the National Palace Museum in Taipei City
from Feb. 4 to May 27. This marks the first collaboration between the two
museums.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu on Wednesday called for stronger
alliance between the United States, Japan and Taiwan to bolster regional
security amid worries over China's recent flexing of its military muscles.</P>
      <P>During a speech delivered at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
think tank, Wu said China's Jan. 11 destruction of an old Chinese weather
satellite by a warhead launched from an intercontinental ballistic missile
"demonstrated that China has every intention of expanding its military power,
and even of trying to militarize space."</P>
      <P>The anti-satellite test "sent a signal that is very clear to any countries
concerned about a possible future conflict between Taiwan and China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>China's destruction of the satellite also posed a threat to U.S. efforts to
protect security in Taiwan and around the Asia-Pacific region, he asserted.</P>
      <P>Wu said this move proved the hypocrisy of a white paper issued by the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) last year which claimed that all of the military actions
of the PLA were aimed at spurring "peace."</P>
      <P>Besides the United States and Taiwan, China also had Japan in mind when it chose
Jan. 11 as the date for the test, Wu said during his speech. He said the test
coincided with a trip to Europe by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who
cautioned Europe's leaders that lifting an arms embargo against China could
threaten security in Asia.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that it came as Abe's conservative government upgraded the Japanese
Defense Agency to a full ministry, which raised worries about the state of
postwar pacifism in China's traditional rival, Japan.</P>
      <P>"We need to consider a possible stronger alliance between the United States and
Japan, and stronger and closer cooperation in security matters between Taiwan
and the United States in order to deal with a multipronged security threat in
East Asia," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu also stressed that Beijing has continued to strangle Taiwan's
activities in the international community over the past year -- in seven
incidents last year, Beijing tried to press Taiwan to change its formal
designations used in NGO organizations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would not be that active in pushing for the use of "Taiwan" as the formal
name of the country in the international community should Beijing relent in
pressing Taiwan over the issue, Wu asserted.</P>

Petroleum Corp., China Shipbuilding Corp., as well as various official documents
will no longer carry the term "China" or "Chinese" in their official titles to
distinguish from their Chinese counterparts, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The national name rectification campaign is a long-term policy goal of the
government, the first move towards which was changing the name of Chiang Kei-
shek International Airport to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, a move that
received a warm response from the public, Chen said, adding that most of the
Taiwanese people want to correct the name used to represent the country's public
companies.</P>
      <P>Although the president acknowledged that changing names for Taiwan's state-run
enterprises will entail some effort and costs, he argued that it is worthwhile
to do so because it will be helpful in building world-class brands such as
Nokia, Microsoft and Toyota among Taiwan's businesses.</P>
      <P>Chen's endorsement for the national name rectification campaign came one day
after ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun proposed at the
party's Central Standing Committee that a name change drive be launched
nationwide, starting with the names of public-run companies.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-yeh echoed Chen's call and said
that the ministry will continue working to have the word "Taiwan" added to the
nation's embassies and representative offices.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside rampant allegations that the name change drive is a politically
charged move, Wang urged the outside world to refrain from speculating the issue
and called it a necessary measure to avoid international confusion.</P>

      <P>Officials representing Taiwan and the Philippines signed a memorandum of
understanding Thursday aimed at bolstering bilateral exchanges and cooperation
on indigenous peoples' affairs.</P>
      <P>Antonio Basilio, resident representative and managing director of the Manila
Economic and Cultural Office in Taiwan, joined Wu Hsin-hsing, representative of
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines, at a ceremony held
to ink the MOU, which calls for closer cultural and economic exchanges and
cooperation of indigenous people between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Walis Pelin, chairman of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, and his Philippine
counterpart,  Jannette Cansing Serrano-Reisland, witnessed the MOU signing at
the ceremony, which was followed by performances of indigenous songs and dances,
all flavored with champagne.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Walis Pelin told a beautiful story about interactions
between indigenous peoples from Taiwan and the Philippines. Filipinos are
believed to be descendants of the various Austronesian-speaking migrants who
arrived in successive waves over some thousand years ago from Taiwan, and are
genetically most closely related to the Tao (formerly known as Yami) people now
living on Green Island located off Taiwan's southeast coast, he said.</P>
      <P>Twenty years ago, he said, a young Tao man ferried to Batan, in the Philippines'
northernmost island group to marry to a Batan girl, thereby reliving the close
relations  that the two countries' ancestors had maintained a thousand years
ago.</P>
      <P>Walis Pelin also disclosed that the Council of Indigenous Peoples had been
planning to sponsor some 20 Taiwan indigenous people to ferry to Batan in the
near future to again follow the path that Taiwanese ancestors followed when they
ferried to the Philippines a millennium or more ago.</P>
      <P>Thursday's MOU marked the fourth of its kind that Taiwan has signed with foreign
countries. Taiwan has signed similar pacts with indigenous groups from Canada,
New Zealand and Belize.</P>

      <P>National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) is aiming to develop the second generation
of electronic eyes, equipped with higher resolution and wireless power supplies,
sources at the Hsinchu-based university said Thursday.</P>
      <P>NCTU President Wu Chung-yu said that professor Liu Wen-tai at the University of
California, Santa Cruz, invented the first generation of electronic eyes.
However, their applicability remains limited, so Liu and NCTU have agreed to an
arrangement to expand their capacity.</P>
      <P>Wu said the new research team would bring together experts from both biomedical
science and electronic engineering.</P>
      <P>As for the current version, the device uses 16-pixel chips as artificial light
receptors. When implanted into the eyes, the chips serve as light receptors on
retina, enabling the visually impaired to regain partial vision.</P>
      <P>Seven patients that took part in the experiment at University of California can
now read alphabetical eye-charts and the outline of objects after undergoing the
procedures.</P>
      <P>However, the field of vision is confined and the chips are reliant on wired
power supplies, both of which limit its range of application, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Wu said the goal of the new team is to improve the device with 256-pixel chips
to offer greater vision and employ wireless or solar batteries as a power
source, thereby reducing the inconveniences of a hard-wired power supply.</P>

      <P>An English test touted to be the first developed in compliance with regulations
laid down by the Ministry of Education and the Common European Framework was
unveiled here by a private educational institution, the National Development
Institute (NDI) Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called to promote the examination system, Huang Chun-teng,
an associate professor in the Department of English, National Changhua
University of Education, and head of a panel of scholars responsible for the
development of the test, said the Global English Test (GET) is learner-centered
and action-oriented, and is thus designed to measure the exam-taker's ability to
communicate.</P>
      <P>Noting  that many English  tests available  on the market concentrate on gramar,
Huang said GET stresses the students' ability to use English in daily life.</P>
      <P>In the course of its development, Huang said, more than 16,000 students from 50
junior and senior high schools and universities took the exam between September
and December last year to help its developers to finetune the system.</P>
      <P>Citing the examination results of GET A2 level, which is the equivalent to the
English level of junior high school sophomores, Huang said freshmen from gifted
classes at junior high schools perform better not only than their counterparts
in regular classes, but also better than students from universities.</P>
      <P>Although the results may not reflect the whole picture of the country, Huang
said, it suggests that the English language has been taught as a study subject
rather than an applied skill, and as a result many local university graduates
cannot communicate in English while studying abroad.</P>
      <P>Stressing the importance of motivation in learning a foreign language, Huang
said young students -- except for those who are applying to schools overseas --
are not encouraged to take the examination because there is no point for them to
invest their time in it.</P>
      <P>The test, which ranks learners from beginner to superior, in six grades from A1
to C2, consists of a listening and reading section, and speaking and writing
section. The test for each section carries a fee of NT$550 (US$15.12).</P>

      <P>A 29-year-old man and his girlfriend were arrested for smuggling heroin from
Cambodia into Taiwan in the guise of chocolate, police reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Police seized more than 2,800 grams of high-purity heroin, with a street value
of NT$70 million (US$2.13 million).</P>
      <P>The man, surnamed Shih, and his 23-year-old girl friend, surnamed Huang, were
hoping to get through the inspection when air traffic at the Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport was thrown into chaos Wednesday night due to heavy fog.</P>
      <P>Police noted that they were carrying out monitoring operations over a fraud case
when they inadvertently discovered a drug smuggling ring that solicits those who
have no prior criminal record to work as couriers, or "mules."</P>
      <P>The couriers were asked to travel to such countries as Thailand, Vietnam and
Cambodia, and bring back the controlled substance.</P>
      <P>To evade detection, the heroin was coated with heavy layers of chocolate and
wrapped up in tinfoil paper, making it difficult to detect using X-rays or
sniffer dogs. But police were tipped off in advance and therefore were able to
catch the couple despite their ingenuity.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been communicating closely with the United States on the case of Wang
You-theng, fugitive founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh made the remarks after the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service announced that a court hearing will be set for 8 a.m.
Tuesday at Wang's detention center in Los Angeles (or midnight Wednesday Taipei
time).</P>
      <P>Wang said that Taiwan's representative office in Washington D.C. and its office
in Los Angeles have worked closely with the U.S. on the case and the ministry
has kept abreast of the latest developments.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also hopes to convey evidence against Wang to the United States, hoping
that the U.S. court will hand down a ruling favorable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also work closely with related U.S. agencies through the judicial
assistance agreement signed between Taiwan and the United States in March 2002,
Wang added.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Taiwan will respect the judicial process of the United States,
but will by no means sit by idly, stating that Taiwan will do everything
possible to facilitate the repatriation of Wang to face justice in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang is wanted in Taiwan for his suspected involvement in a series of accounting
frauds and embezzlement scandals surrounding his business group.</P>
      <P>Taiwan put Wang on its most-wanted list in mid-January. He tried to fly to
Myanmar via Singapore Jan. 31 but was sent back to the United States Feb. 2 by
Singaporean authorities because he lacked the proper travel documents.</P>
      <P>Wang arrived in Los Angeles Feb. 3 and was taken into custody because his Taiwan
and Dominican Republic passports were invalidated as a result of efforts by the
Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>Wang fled to the United States shortly after China Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food
&amp; Synthetic Fiber Co., two subsidiaries under the Rebar group, filed for
insolvency protection late last December. The revelations of the two
financially-distressed companies triggered a run on the Chinese Bank, another
Rebar affiliate, and a probe into the other subsidiaries of the group, which
turned up ever more irregularities in a snowballing scandal.</P>

      <P>A dozen people gathered outside the Taipei office of the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Thursday, requesting that the U.S. government extradite fugitive
Rebar Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislator Wang Tu-fa,
several members of Taiwan Association of University Professors (TAUP) displayed
slogans in both Chinese and English in front of the AIT office, appealing to
officials within to convey to the U.S. government the desire of Taiwan's people
to see Wangs brought home to face justice.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was taken into custody by U.S. immigration officials for traveling on
invalid Republic of China and Dominican Republic passports, has been put on
Taiwan's list of most wanted fugitives after beginning his fugitive tour with
his wife in early January.</P>
      <P>The tycoon is wanted by Taiwanese judicial authorities for his suspected
involvement in a series of crimes, including forgery, fraud, insider trading,
and embezzlement of corporate fund of his gigantic group.</P>
      <P>TAUP Chairman Tsai Ting-kuei expressed hope that the U.S. government will
extradite the Wangs based on the principles of democracy and the rule by law.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the United States is supposed to be in the vanguard of democracy
and the rule by law, and not a paradise for criminals on the lam, Wang Tu-fa
urged the U.S. government to help repatriate the Wangs to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The TAUP members had one small conflict with police, however, the protest ended

    <TEXT>
      <P>It would be a "painstaking task" for the China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) to
erase the company's Chinese name and repaint a new one on the huge Goliath crane
at the CSBC shipyard, which is the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia, a CSBC
official claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>In addition to having to use a "super-high" crane with a man-carrying cage for
the name-change job, it would cost at least NT$10 million to have the CSBC's new
Chinese name painted on the Goliath bridge crane, CSBC Vice President Wang Ko-
hsun claimed.</P>
      <P>Despite his complaints, Wang said the name-change idea -- from CSBC to "Taiwan
International Shipbuilding Corp." in Chinese -- is generally supported by
company management  since it is a set government policy and will help avoid
confusing the state-run company with a Chinese one.</P>
      <P>There will be little change in the company's new English name -- from CSBC to
CSBC Taiwan -- out of consideration for the company's convenience in operations
in international shipbuilding markets, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Wang said the name-change plan is expected to be passed smoothly at a meeting of
CSBC board directors to be held in Taipei Friday. The plan will then be referred
to a meeting of CSBC general investors slated for March 1 for final approval.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs also announced last month a plan to change the
name of the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to "CPC, Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The opposition  parties have accused the ruling Democratic Progressive Party of
"ruling the nation with ideology" in a bid to blot out the last vestiges of
China's influence from the country.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's export and import values reported double-digit increases in January --
up 17.9 percent and 23.8 percent respectively, from the same period last year --
to record levels of US$19.85 billion (NT$655.6 billion), and US$17.96 billion,
an official from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>This gave Taiwan a trade surplus of US$1.89 billion, Lee Li-shu, chief
statistician at the MOF, noted.</P>
      <P>However, both exports and imports are likely to see negative growth in February,
owing to the nine-day Lunar New Year holiday, Lee pointed out.</P>
      <P>January's export value was the second highest single-month value after last
September's US$20.1 billion, while the import value was the third highest, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the import of consumer products hit a new high for a single month
at US$1.52 billion, marking a strong contrast with the negative 2.3 percent
growth rate for the entire 2006, Lee pointed out.</P>
      <P>Kung Ming-hsin, vice president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) , attributed the strong performance of imports and exports in January to
the favorable international economic climate.</P>
      <P>Kung explained that the United States reported higher economic growth in the
fourth quarter than was widely expected, and oil prices have not been
skyrocketing, which have contributed to Taiwan's economic growth.</P>
      <P>According to MOF officials, January saw a high rise in the number of passenger
cars imported. At the same time, the import of vehicles with engines between
1500cc and 2500cc grew by 139.1 percent, while those 3000cc and above was up 66
percent, they added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, there was also a noticeable growth in the import of medicine, tobacco
and liquor, as well as cosmetics, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Officials explained that the lowering of import duties and commodity taxes might
have prompted more people to buy cars this year.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Kung said it is likely that many export companies earned
profits last year, and therefore rewarded their young employees more year-end
bonuses.</P>
      <P>As a result, they have begun to purchase cars, and might choose foreign cars
over domestically manufactured ones as the price gap between them is narrowing,
Kung added.</P>

      <P>According to the MOEA draft, board directors, supervisors and managers of a

      <P>Beijing would certainly be disappointed if it expects Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to fail in the 2008 presidential election, Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is currently visiting the United States, made the comments  at  the
Twin-Oaks  Garden  during  a meeting  with Chinese-language media.</P>
      <P>Quoting some U.S. think tank members who recently visited China, Wu said that
ranking Beijing officials displayed obvious reluctance to see the DPP once again
win in Taiwan's upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>However, Wu pointed out that Beijing seems to have become more mature in
handling its relations with Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, Beijing did not halt its negotiations with Taiwan on
opening special cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights last year when the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" mobilized to launch a recall vote against
President Chen Shui-bian nor when the mayoral elections were held in Taipei and
Kaohsiung last December.</P>
      <P>"I prefer to assume that Beijing would observe Taiwan's future elections,
including December's legislative elections and the March 2008 presidential
election, with a more mature attitude, " the MAC chief said, adding that
"otherwise, it will be upset again, just as it was in 2000 and 2004."</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech delivered during a visit earlier the same day to the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, Wu said that Beijing seems to have
eased its policies toward Taiwan in some fields, such as agreeing to launch
cross-strait charter flights on major festivals and for humanitarian purposes
and allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, while flexing its muscle in other
areas, including  further squeezing  Taiwan's international  space and
continuing its military buildup aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed concern that negative developments in cross-strait relations will
eliminate positive elements in bilateral interactions.</P>
      <P>He also forecast that two-way exchanges could slow down due to major political
events that are set to evolve in the second half of this year, both in Taiwan
and China. ENDITEM/jnc</P>

      <P>Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Tsai Duei said Thursday the
ministry plans to open the Hsuehshan tunnel linking Taipei and Yilan counties to
large passenger vehicles in June to mark the anniversary of the tunnel's formal
opening June 16, 2006.</P>
      <P>During an inspection tour in Yilan County, Tsai said his ministry will honor its
promise to open the tunnel to large passenger vehicles on the first anniversary
of its opening to cars, since the traffic situation has been smooth.</P>
      <P>The Hsuehshan tunnel, the most difficult part in the construction of the 54.3-km
Peiyi Freeway, is the longest highway tunnel in East Asia and the fifth-longest
in the world. It was opened to traffic June 16 last year after 15 years of
construction.</P>
      <P>As the tunnel is only open to small cars, Yilan residents have been urging the
government to open it soon to large passenger vehicles to further boost tourism
in Yilan.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the ministry is planning supplementary rescue measures to
cope with possible accidents in the tunnel in preparation for the opening.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yilan County Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua instructed related agencies to
adopt countermeasures in advance of the possible swarm of tourists from around

      <P>Criteria for students from Hong Kong and Macau applying to study in Taiwan have
been further relaxed in a bid to allow more young people from these two areas to
receive education in Taiwan, a Ministry of Education (MOE) official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The relaxed regulations -- which went into effect this month -- allow Hong Kong
or Macau citizens who have lived there for six consecutive years to apply to
study in Taiwan. Previously, the criterion was eight years, said Lin Shu-chen,
executive secretary of the MOE's Mainland Affairs Task Force.</P>
      <P>Lin, however, pointed out that the eight-year-residence criterion is still
required under the new regulations for Hong Kong or Macau applicants wishing to
study medicine, dentistry and traditional Chinese medicine in Taiwan's colleges
and universities.</P>
      <P>The new regulations also allow Hong Kong or Macau youths who have finished
junior high school education in Taiwan to attend Taiwan vocational senior high
schools or five-year junior colleges without having to pass entrance exams.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Taiwan's colleges and universities reserve up to 10 percent of
their enrollments for overseas Chinese or Taiwanese descendants and students
from Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>Taiwan received 154 freshmen students from Hong Kong and 513 from Macau in the
2005 academic year, Lin said.</P>

      <P>Coordination among the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
hopefuls will only be smooth if the timing is ripe, President Chen Shui-bian's
top aide said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, secretary-general to the president, made the remarks amid reports
that four DPP heavyweights -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang,
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh -- are jockeying for
party nomination in the runup to the party primaries in May.</P>
      <P>Noting that some DPP officials are hoping that Chen will intervene to smooth out
difficulties in nominating a presidential candidate, Chiou said nothing should
be done in haste.</P>
      <P>"We can't rush the matter. When the timing is ripe, the coordination will go
smoothly," he said.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that if coordination is needed, it means that the party's
primary mechanism in which public opinion polls will account for 70 percent and
party member vote will account for the remaining 30 percent will not work.</P>
      <P>It also means that the result of the coordination must be "accepted willingly by
every aspirant," he claimed.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said party members at the grassroots level have
generally expressed the hope that Su and Hsieh will form a ticket and the party
has not ruled out the possibility of suggesting that Chen tout coordination this
Saturday at a spring gathering to which elected DPP officials and the party's
Central Standing Committee have been invited.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks after DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun proposed removing the guards
stationed at late President Chiang Kai-shek's temporary mausoleum in northern
Taiwan Taoyuan, which was widely seen as a move by Yu to cater to the wishes of
hard-core supporters of the "pan-green camp" led by the DPP to facilitate his

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN WILL TENDER RESIGNATION IF INDICTED: PARTY OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou will definitely tender his
resignation to the party's Central Standing Committee if indicted on
embezzlement charges related to his alleged misuse of special municipal funds
during his tenure as Taipei mayor, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, Wu said Ma will offer to resign
if he is indicted. "The party's Central Standing Committee will respond to such
a drastic development in line with its existing mechanisms, " he said, adding
that "the party is not considering a bailout plan for such a scenario."</P>
      <P>Wu's comments came after the People First Party (PFP), an ally of the KMT in the
opposition "pan-blue alliance, " proposed earlier in the day that the two
parties should jointly nominate a presidential candidate for the 2008 election
based upon their new but closer KMT-PFP alliance.</P>
      <P>Wu thanked the PFP for its concern and suggestion but insisted that the KMT has
not worked out any package to deal with the situation in the event of Ma's
indictment. The former mayor is widely viewed as the most eligible "pan-blue"
candidate in the 2008 president poll.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was reported that the prosecution had concluded its probe into the
case of Ma's alleged embezzlement and is set to indict the former Taipei mayor
in the coming days. The KMT has reportedly been planning to revise its clauses
to secure Ma's right to participate in the next presidential race or allow him
to run as an independent even if he is indicted.</P>
      <P>According to PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung, the two proposals are bad ideas that
would doom Ma's chances in the race, as both alternatives will significantly
taint Ma's moral reputation as "Mr. Clean."</P>
      <P>Liu said the best chance of victory in the 2008 presidential election is for the
two "pan-blue" parties to jointly field a candidate who stands the best chance
of success. By so doing, Liu said, Ma would not necessarily be nominated, as
other hopefuls could also join the race for nomination. But given Ma's
popularity with grassroots pan-blue supporters, Liu said, Ma stands a good
chance of winning the primary through this process while avoiding damaging unity
within the "pan-blue" alliance.</P>
      <P>"As long as Ma enjoys widespread grassroots support, the best way to bail out Ma
is through the joint nomination mechanism of the new KMT-PFP alliance, " Liu
argued, adding that he believes PFP Chairman James Soong will also fully back Ma
in the 2008 presidential race if Ma is truely nominated by the alliance.</P>
      <P>He urged the KMT to quickly come out with countermeasures to settle the issue as
Ma enjoys very strong support among "pan-blue" voters.</P>

      <P>There is "no need" to associate the current name-change drive with the changing
of the nation's official name, President Chen Shui-bian's top aide said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, secretary-general to the president, made the remarks after Chen
expressed his stance of supporting the drive to change the names of state-owned
companies and suggested that the name of Chunghwa Post Co. be changed to Taiwan
Post in his online newsletter published earlier that day.</P>
      <P>Chiou pointed out that "the assessment of the name-changes has been going on for
quite a long time, although the ball only started rolling recently, so that the
public might think the government only thought about promoting the matter
recently."</P>
      <P>Chen first floated the name-change drive in 2004 to avoid Taiwan enterprises
being mistaken for Chinese companies.</P>
      <P>But he also said the scope of the changes will be left to the discretion of the
state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>Chiou claimed there is no need to associate the name-changes with the changing
of the nation's official name, which the president promised not to do in his
inaugural addresses in 2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>He said the "plight of Taiwan lies in the fact that it can't change its official
name but also can't have its official name recognized by the international
community."</P>
      <P>"Under the circumstances, the current name-change move is the only resort we
have if we want our enterprises to enter the international community," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there is a China Steel Corp. based in Taiwan and a Chinese company
bearing similar name, which could be confusing if both were to be members of the
International Iron and Steel Institute, adding that China Shipbuilding Corp.
(CSBC) and Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) have the same problem, although the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said recently it plans to change these to "CSBC,
Taiwan" and "CPC, Taiwan" to underscore that they are Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan's central bank -- the Central Bank of China (CBC) -- should
also change its name, Chiou said this would be best.</P>
      <P>But as the CBC takes part in a great many international financial organizations,
the CBC and the Executive Yuan will have to assess the scope of any change, he
added.</P>
      <P>Asked if the president supports "the stance of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun's drive to obliterate the last vestiges of the
authoritarian rule of the late President Chiang Kai-shek," Chiou said that
"there is nothing to oppose."</P>
      <P>"The blotting out of Chiang's last vestiges in Taiwan is a substantial move
under a big concept," he said, adding that emerging democratic countries have
shown the same tendencies in cutting all lingering influences of the past
authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>Yu has accused Chiang of being the culprit responsible for the 2-28 incident of
1947, in which Chiang's Nationalist government sent troops to crush a revolt in
Taiwan, resulting in the deaths of thousands, and proposed that the guards

      <P>Chunghwa Post Co., the state-owned postal service, will change its name Friday
to show its Taiwan identity in a wave of name changes among state enterprises.</P>
      <P>The word "Chunghwa" means China. A new Chinese name translated as "Taiwan Post
Co." will be applied after a board meeting Friday passes the proposal, although
an official English name has yet to be decided, company officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa released Thursday a position paper and said the change of its title is
actually a restoration with historical significance, because  Taiwan's  postal
service was first named Taiwan Post Administration when founded in 1888 by Liu
Ming-chuan, the first Governor of Taiwan appointed by China's Ching Dynasty.</P>
      <P>The position paper denies claims that a change of name can only be legal if the
legislature amends the law governing the service's establishment, pointing out
that as a company it can change its name upon a resolution by its board of
directors.</P>
      <P>Not everyone in the company was happy with the change and union Chairman Tsai
Liang-chuan said he will lead colleagues in a protest at the board meeting
Friday.</P>
      <P>We don't see any good the name change can bring to the company's business, he
said, adding that "it's regrettable for the name-changing  of state enterprises
to be used for political purposes."</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-chi, chairman of Chunghwa Post, said a new signboard will be in place
as soon as Monday.</P>
      <P>He said the cost of the change won't be as much as some have claimed, estimating
it to be around NT$67 million. "Old signboards are scheduled to be replaced
anyway," he said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that the National Palace Museum
symbolizes  Taiwan's commitment  to promoting cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while presiding over the inauguration of the museum's
newly renovated main exhibition hall.</P>
      <P>Saying that the overhaul project manifests the government's determination to
build a modern museum based around its ancient Chinese art collection, Chen said
the inauguration of the Palace Museum main hall will give history a new twist.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei houses the world's most famous
collection of ancient Chinese artworks. It is often compared to leading Western
museums like the Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</P>
      <P>The three-year renovation project has given the old museum a brand new face and
new spirit, Chen said, adding that the museum will from now on handle art
collection in a broader vision.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the museum's future art collection will reflect "love for
Taiwan and vision on globalization." Noting that the museum's Chinese art
treasures are invaluable world cultural heritage, Chen said the government will
continue sparing no effort to preserve and glorify them.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, the museum should also endeavor to expand the scope of
its art collection to realize its ambitious goal of becoming  the world's top-
notch  cultural institution  with diversified artworks in its possession.</P>
      <P>Chen also mentioned his administration's plan to build a new museum in Taipao in
southern Chiayi County to be the Palace Museum's branch facility which will
focus on displaying Asian artworks and cultural heritages. The southern branch
will demonstrate Taiwan people's vision and passion for arts, cultures and
lifestyles in neighboring Asian countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, almost two-thirds of the National Palace Museum
building was closed for the renovation project. Following the overhaul, heroic
statutes of the late President Chiang Kai-shek and of Sun Yat-sen, the founding
father of the Republic of China have been removed, while new lighting, air-
conditioning, climate-controlled storage vaults and other features of the
renovated institution rival the newest museums in the West.</P>
      <P>Many dignitaries, including Premier Su Tseng-chang,  museum curators from home
and abroad, members of the Taipei Diplomatic Corps, scholars, experts and
business executives, attended the reopening reception.</P>

      <P>Chunghwa Post Co., the state-owned postal service, will change its name Friday
to show its Taiwan identity in a wave of name changes among state enterprises.</P>
      <P>The word "Chunghwa" means China. A new Chinese name translated as "Taiwan Post
Co." will be applied after a board meeting Friday passes the proposal, although
an official English name has yet to be decided, company officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa released Thursday a position paper and said the change of its title is
actually a restoration with historical significance, because  Taiwan's  postal
service was first named Taiwan Post Administration when founded in 1888 by Liu
Ming-chuan, the first Governor of Taiwan appointed by China's Ching Dynasty.</P>
      <P>The position paper denies claims that a change of name can only be legal if the
legislature amends the law governing the service's establishment, pointing out
that as a company it can change its name upon a resolution by its board of
directors.</P>
      <P>Not everyone in the company was happy with the change and union Chairman Tsai
Liang-chuan said he will lead colleagues in a protest at the board meeting
Friday.</P>
      <P>We don't see any good the name change can bring to the company's business, he
said, adding that "it's regrettable for the name-changing  of state enterprises
to be used for political purposes."</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-chi, chairman of Chunghwa Post, said a new signboard will be in place
as soon as Monday.</P>
      <P>He said the cost of the change won't be as much as some have claimed, estimating
it to be around NT$67 million. "Old signboards are scheduled to be replaced
anyway," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PALACE MUSEUM EMBODIES TAIWAN'S COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY OF CULTURE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that the National Palace Museum
symbolizes  Taiwan's commitment  to promoting cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while presiding over the inauguration of the museum's
newly renovated main exhibition hall.</P>
      <P>Saying that the overhaul project manifests the government's determination to
build a modern museum based around its ancient Chinese art collection, Chen said
the inauguration of the Palace Museum main hall will give history a new twist.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei houses the world's most famous
collection of ancient Chinese artworks. It is often compared to leading Western
museums like the Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</P>
      <P>The three-year renovation project has given the old museum a brand new face and
new spirit, Chen said, adding that the museum will from now on handle art
collection in a broader vision.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the museum's future art collection will reflect "love for
Taiwan and vision on globalization." Noting that the museum's Chinese art
treasures are invaluable world cultural heritage, Chen said the government will
continue sparing no effort to preserve and glorify them.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, the museum should also endeavor to expand the scope of
its art collection to realize its ambitious goal of becoming  the world's top-
notch  cultural institution  with diversified artworks in its possession.</P>
      <P>Chen also mentioned his administration's plan to build a new museum in Taipao in
southern Chiayi County to be the Palace Museum's branch facility which will
focus on displaying Asian artworks and cultural heritages. The southern branch
will demonstrate Taiwan people's vision and passion for arts, cultures and
lifestyles in neighboring Asian countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, almost two-thirds of the National Palace Museum
building was closed for the renovation project. Following the overhaul, heroic
statutes of the late President Chiang Kai-shek and of Sun Yat-sen, the founding
father of the Republic of China have been removed, while new lighting, air-
conditioning, climate-controlled storage vaults and other features of the
renovated institution rival the newest museums in the West.</P>
      <P>Many dignitaries, including Premier Su Tseng-chang,  museum curators from home
and abroad, members of the Taipei Diplomatic Corps, scholars, experts and
business executives, attended the reopening reception.</P>

and comes to me for advice, I accept his present reformation without inquiring
what his past life has been. I am satisfied if I find that, for the present, he
has really reformed, without being able to guarantee that he will not relapse
again. But why should one be too severe?"</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>52 IDLE PUBLIC FACILITIES REVITALIZED: PCC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
02/09/07  12:09:05
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Public Construction Commission (PCC) has successfully assisted local
governments in reviving 52 idle public facilities around the country over the
past couple of years, a senior official said Friday.</P>
      <P>All of these revitalized public facilities were originally built for a total
cost of NT$13.78 billion (US$417.58 million) , PCC Chairman Wu Tze-cheng said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, 96 idle or underused public facilities are still listed for
revitalization, redevelopment or demolition.</P>
      <P>To show the government's determination to resolve the issue and save public
funds, Wu said, Premier Su Tseng-chang has instructed the PCC to further review
all the listed facilities to determine whether they should be redeveloped. "The
premier is not opposed to the demolition of those facilities for which
redevelopment is not warranted," he added.</P>
      <P>Claiming that many idle or underused public facilities were by-products of
election politics, Wu said the facilities were mostly built for the sake of
winning voter support in elections without making any "down-to-earth" evaluation
of practical market demand.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of the construction of parking lots in each township or
village, Wu said many of the parking facilities have been left idle or underused
as local governments have never seriously cracked down on parking violations.</P>
      <P>"Local governments' inefficient management of public facilities has not only
resulted in a waste of public resources but has also affected  local people's
confidence  and trust in the central government," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Executive Yuan has formed a special task force to review the
feasibility of redeveloping or transforming idle public facilities, Wu said that
if possible, private operators will be introduced to manage idle parking lots,
swimming pools, exhibition halls and other public facilities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAA CHIEF INDICTED OVER AIRPORT NOISE INSULATION SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9 (CNA)

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng, director-general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
,  has been indicted on corruption charges for his suspected role in a Taoyuan
International Airport noise insulation subsidies scandal.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan Prosecutor's Office indicted Chang and 28 other CAA and airport
officials as well as borough and village chiefs in northern Taoyuan County
Thursday after more than two years of investigations into the case.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are seeking a seven-year prison sentence for Chang, who was released
on NT$1 million bail after being questioned regarding the case last year.</P>
      <P>The scandal involving noise insulation subsidies for residents in the vicinity
of the Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway, broke in May 2004
after prosecution authorities received tip-offs that many subsidy recipients did
not use the money to install air-conditioners as soundproofing.</P>
      <P>Subsequent  prosecutorial  investigations  showed  that some households managed
to claim soundproofing subsidies even after they had relocated to other areas,
while many other households used fake pictures to mislead transportation
ministry officials into believing that their homes had been equipped with air-
conditioners to qualify for soundproofing subsidies even though they had not.</P>
      <P>As residents could apply for subsidies by just producing pictures showing their
homes were equipped  with air-conditioners,  the indictment said some air-
conditioner suppliers assisted residents in faking pictures through
introductions by borough or village chiefs who were given NT$2,000 to NT$4,000
in commission for each such deal.</P>
      <P>The indictment said that although the then-Taoyuan Airport Administration's
environmental  section chief had informed his superiors of possible
irregularities or profiteering practices in the process, Chang shut his eyes to
the warning and continued the practice of requiring residents to just produce
pictures to receive soundproofing subsidies.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, the scandal caused a huge waste of taxpayer's
money.</P>
      <P>Chang's deputy Wang Teh-ho and CAA Chief Secretary Wei Sheng-chih were  also
indicted  on corruption  charges,  with prosecutors recommending a six-year
prison sentence for each of them.</P>
      <P>Seven Taoyuan Airport Administration officials, including Deputy Director Liu
Chuang-sheng, were also indicted on similar charges. Prosecutors are seeking a
12-year prison sentence for Liu.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors also indicted a number of former and incumbent village and borough
chiefs and are seeking eight-year  prison sentences for each of them.</P>
      <P>As to residents who had claimed noise insulation subsidies without actually
installing soundproofing equipment, prosecutors said they will be indicted later
on charges of fraud.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RELIES ON JUDICIAL CO-OP PACTS FOR APPREHENDING FUGITIVES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Since Taiwan is not a member of the International Criminal Police Organization
(Interpol) , the largest worldwide body established to assist international
criminal police cooperation, Taiwan can only rely on bilateral judicial
cooperation pacts for apprehending criminals who have fled the country.</P>
      <P>An Interpol spokesman said during a telephone interview with the CNA that the
fact that Taiwan cannot seek Interpol assistance to extradite fugitive Rebar
Asia Pacific Group founder Wang You-theng from overseas epitomizes the
difficulties that Taiwan has faced in trying to apprehend criminals on the lam.</P>
      <P>Interpol is the world's third largest international organization, after the
United Nations and FIFA, with 186 member countries and an annual contributions
of about US$41.7 million from its member countries. The Lyon, France-
headquartered organization's work focuses primarily on public safety, terrorism,
organized crime, war crimes, illicit drug production,  drug trafficking,
weapons smuggling, trafficking in human beings, money laundering, child
pornography, white-collar crime, high-tech crime and corruption.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was taken into custody by U.S. immigration authorities at the
beginning of February for traveling without valid travel documents, was put on
Taiwan's list of most wanted fugitives after fleeing the country with his wife
in early January.</P>
      <P>The tycoon is wanted by Taiwanese authorities for his suspected involvement in a
series of crimes, including forgery, fraud, insider trading, and embezzlement of
corporate funds from his group.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government has been asked by Taiwan law enforcement authorities to help
extradite the Wangs as the two countries maintain a judicial cooperation pact.</P>
      <P>Fifty-one people related to the Rebar scandal have been probed as suspects, 13
of whom have been detained. The number of people related to the case barred from
leaving the country has increased to 91.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND AWAITS INSTRUCTIONS ON HANDLING OF LATE PRESIDENTS' MAUSOLEUMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
02/09/07  14:37:23

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has not received any instructions from
the Cabinet with regard to disbanding an office in charge of maintaining the
mausoleums of the late Presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo, a
ministry official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-ping, deputy chief of the general staff for personnel, said that
basically, the office will only be disbanded after the Chiang family has agreed
to and completed the removal of the late presidents' remains from the mausoleums
for permanent burial.</P>
      <P>However, if any instructions are received from the Cabinet on the disbandment of
the office, the ministry will assess the feasibility of doing so, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks during a public hearing on the issue held by several
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislators led by John Chiang, son of Chiang Ching-
kuo.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, a group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators
requested that the Cabinet make an announcement by Feb. 28 to disband the
mausoleum maintenance office under the MND and scrap the budget for the
maintenance of the mausoleums located in Taoyuan County's Tzuhu and Touliao,
respectively, where the two late presidents' remains are temporarily interred.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the government has prepared new tombs for the two late
presidents at Taipei County's Wuchihshan Military Cemetery, the legislators said
the Chiang family should make a decision by Feb. 28 on whether to remove the
remains of the two late presidents.</P>
      <P>They argued that it lacks any legal basis and is a waste of taxpayers' money for
the government to earmark a budget of more than NT$70 million per year to
maintain the mausoleums, including the personnel expenses for 35 staff, 70
military police and 24 honor guards posted at the facilities.</P>
      <P>The proposal to disband the mausoleum maintenance office is among a series of
measures put forth by the DPP recently to "eliminate the remnants of
authoritarian rule" associated with Chiang Kai-shek -- whom the DPP claims was
the key perpetrator behind the 228 Incident of 1947 in which thousands of people
were massacred by KMT troops in suppression of a rebellion against KMT rule in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, John Chiang said he will take legal action against DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun if he does not apologize within one week for the claim.</P>
      <P>He alleged  that although  the DPP claims  it is against authoritarianism, the
party is turning itself into a "Nazist" party under Yu's leadership.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the labor union of Chunghwa Post Co. resisted Friday a plan to have
the state-owned postal service's name changed and blockaded the office of
Chunghwa Post chairman to bar him from attending a board meeting aimed at
endorsing the name change plan.</P>
      <P>Unable to attend the meeting, Chunghwa Post Chairman Lai Chin-chi called
Chunghwa Post President Wu Min-you to convene the meeting at another location.</P>
      <P>Labor union members burst into the meeting room and disrupted the meeting,
causing Wu to call the police in to maintain order.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai managed to escape from his office and attended the meeting as the
standoff came to an end and the police pulled back from the scene.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Lai stressed that the change of the company's name is actually a
restoration with historical significance because Taiwan's postal service was
first named Taiwan Post Administration when founded in 1888 by Liu Ming-chuan,
the first Governor of Taiwan appointed by the Ching Court</P>
      <P>Union leader Tsai Liang-chuan argued that the union sees nothing good about
changing the name of the company in terms of increasing its business, adding
that it's regrettable that the issue of changing the names of state enterprises
is being used for political purposes.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that the name change will probably make Chunghwa Post a fully
privatized company overnight without the workers' interests being protected.</P>
      <P>Tsai also lambasted Chunghwa Post Chairman Lai for initiating the name change
drive and implementing the plan without consulting anybody or notifying any of
the company's workers in advance.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post Co. said it was planning to change its name Friday to show its
Taiwan identity in a wave of name changes among state enterprises.</P>
      <P>The word "Chunghwa" means China. A new Chinese name translated as "Taiwan Post
Co." will be applied after Friday's board meeting passes the proposal, although
an official English name has yet to be decided upon, company officials said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai said a new signboard with the new name will be in place as soon as Monday.</P>

      <P>The country's designation -- the Republic of China -- should be changed, as it
is confused with China's formal name and "fails to reflect Taiwan's historic
truth," Examination Yuan President Yao China-wen claimed Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a colloquium on Taiwan's historic status and future diplomatic
strategy, Yao, a well-known Taiwan independence advocate, said the country of
Taiwan -- whose official name is the Republic of China -- is not the same
country that uses the same designation whose capital had been in Peking, Nanking
and Chungching prior to 1949, nor the regime currently ruling China, whose
formal name is the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Republic of China is "too easy to be confused" in the
international community with the People's Republic of China, Yao said a national
name change as President Chen Shui-bian has championed recently is "a must" for
the country.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the Taiwan people have been given too many "distorted facts
and untrue concepts" by the former Kuomintang government, leading some of the
country's people to have the wrong perceptions  about  Taiwan's  history  and
its status  in the international community.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan official urged the United States Thursday to approve the sale of new
F-16 fighter aircraft to Taiwan, saying Taiwan needs to acquire the aircraft to
beef up its ability to defend itself against China's military threat.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the remarks during an
interview with U.S. cable television station C-span, in the wake of a Defense
News report that the Bush administration has refused to sell 66 F-16 C/D fighter
aircraft requested by Taiwan because Washington is unhappy with Taiwan's delay
in its procurement of diesel-electric submarines, P-3C anti-submarine aircraft
and Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the production of J-10A fighter aircraft by China has
significantly upgraded China's air force and directly threatens the security of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With China continuing  to expand its military  deployments targeting Taiwan, the
number of short-range ballistic missiles deployed by China along its coast
opposite Taiwan has increased from several hundred to more than 1,000, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said the number of submarines owned by China is far larger than
its actual demand, which he said is evidence of China's intention to launch a
naval blockade of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that not only Taiwan but also other countries in East Asia and even the
whole world have also felt China's military ambitions, citing the successful
anti-satellite weapons test by China as an example.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted that the Bush administration's refusal to sell the F-16 C/D fighter
aircraft to Taiwan is related to the delay of the previous arms procurement
package.</P>
      <P>He said the Legislative Yuan is expected to pass part of the budget for the
procurement package in the new legislative session.</P>
      <P>Also during the interview, Wu called Washington's attention to the rapid
expansion of China's influence in Africa.</P>
      <P>In particular, it is a development deserving international concern that China is
engaging with countries with poor human rights records such as Sudan and
Zimbabwe, Wu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Germany protested against the organizer of the
57th Berlin International Film Festival  Thursday for continuing  to label
Taiwan's films in competition as Chinese film products.</P>
      <P>In a press release handed to the Berlin film festival organizer, officials of
Taiwan's representative office in Germany said the country is proud of being
invited to participate in the festival. However, the organizer's labeling of
Taiwanese films as "Taiwan, China" has seriously insulted Taiwan's democracy, as
the island is a democratic and sovereign country in its own right, while China
has never exercised sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the festival organizer' move contrasted with those of
the organizer of the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice International Film
Festival, which introduced Taiwanese films simply as Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>The protest letter has obtained the attention of major European media,
including Germany's Der Spiegel weekly magazine, which published the whole
letter in its online edition.</P>
      <P>The weekly magazine noted that the German government adopts a "one China"
policy, which means Taiwan can only promote its diplomacy through a
representative office rather than an embassy.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Berlin film festival explained to Der Spiegel that they
adopted the German Foreign Ministry's policy of maintaining close relations with
Taiwan without recognizing it diplomatically.</P>
      <P>Switzerland's Neue Zurcher Zeitung said in its international edition that the
fact that the cultural achievements of the most democratic country in Asia has
been included in the products of autocratical China reflect the political
ignorance of the film festival organizer, and said Taiwan's anger is
understandable.</P>
      <P>Officials of Taiwan's representative office in Germany said it was not the first
time that the organizer of Berlin film festival had labeled Taiwan as "Taiwan,
China."</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwanese officials also protested against the label, which resulted
later in a correction by the film festival organizer.</P>

      <P>Hog breeders around Taiwan signed a self-discipline convention Friday as a
pledge to provide consumers with pork from healthy hogs amid the public's
shunning of pork and processed pork products out of food safety concerns in the
wake of reports of meat from sick and dead hogs being sold in local markets.</P>
      <P>Pork sales have been affected countrywide since police cracked down on illicit
trading of diseased and dead hogs in central and southern Taiwan in early
February.</P>
      <P>News reports have said the illicit sales of substandard pork from sick and dead
hogs have been going on for many years, with buyers including vendors at
traditional markets, restaurant operators and food processing businesses around
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The signing took place at the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and
Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture (COA), and was witnessed by COA
officials. During the ceremony, representatives of the convention endorsers
vowed to deal with the bodies of hogs hit by sudden death through a certified
process from delivery to cremation or burying.</P>
      <P>The signatories also urged local hog breeders to support the practice of
applying for life insurance for their livestock as part of efforts to stem
illicit trading of sick and dead hogs, while suggesting that judicial
authorities impose more severe punishment on illegal slaughterhouse operators
and meat transporters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called Friday for public support for the government's
current campaign to change state-owned enterprises' name to avoid confusion with
their Chinese counterparts, saying that it is essential to correct "mistakes
left by history."</P>
      <P>Lu made the comments while answering questions from reporters before attending a
seminar on Taiwan's historical standing and its foreign policy.</P>
      <P>Quoting President Chen Shui-bian's stated resolve to make Taiwan a complete,
normal and great nation, Lu said that the public should back the government's
efforts to "correct the historical mistake in a piecemeal fashion" by taking out
the words "China" or "Chinese" from the names of state-run companies in the
initial stage.</P>
      <P>Despite Chen promised in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural speeches that Taiwan's
official title will not be changed during his tenure, Lu said that Taiwan's
people should back the government's ongoing name change campaign, which has
begun with some state-run companies, such as Chinese Petroleum Corp., China
Shipbuilding Corp. and Chunghwa Post.</P>
      <P>In response to accusations by opponents that the name change drive will cost the
government a fortune to carry out, Lu contended that it is worthwhile to do so
and it will help Taiwan gain a solid ground in the international arena over the
long term.</P>
      <P>The name change campaign is "not an ideological conflict," rather it is an issue
that affects national dignity and which requires nationwide efforts to achieve
and safeguard, Lu claimed.</P>
      <P>The campaign is backed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) but
opposed by the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " with DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
displaying full support for the drive at the party's weekly Central Standing
Committee meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Su Tseng-chang claimed that the campaign is unlikely to cost
the government a fortune and will not affect workers' rights and interests at
the state-run companies.</P>
      <P>Su appealed for widespread public support for the drive and claimed  that  the
move will help sharpen  Taiwan  companies' competitiveness by avoiding
unnecessary confusion in the world market.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the name change campaign should have been carried out long ago, Su
promised to implement the mission through due legal process.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) and the Council of Agriculture (COA) have been
working on the popular "Five a Day" plan to promote a lifestyle of eating at
least five servings of vegetables and fruit per day, a DOH official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Huei-wen, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation, said the DOH
and the COA are promoting the plan by releasing convenience packs containing
three vegetables and two fruits in stores such as Carrefours and agricultural
product marketing centers, in an effort to make vegetables and fruit easier for
consumers to buy.</P>
      <P>An investigation by the DOH shows that 96 percent of Taiwanese realize the
importance of balanced nutrition, but 80 percent do not eat enough fruit and
vegetables, especially those who eat out. The investigation also revealed that
convenient buying channels would increase consumption.</P>
      <P>Cheng pointed out that insufficient intake of dietary fiber causes constipation
and increase the risk of colorectal cancer, chronic and cardiovascular diseases.
Consuming at least three servings (about 300 grams) of vegetables and two
servings (about 200 grams) of fruit contributes to good health.</P>
      <P>The DOH will also call on government authorities, companies and food suppliers
to join this plan and encourage the consumption of more vegetables and fruit.</P>

      <P>The Suhua highway linking Suao and Hualien in eastern Taiwan has become a
"dangerous" highway that requires costly maintenance, an Executive Yuan official
in charge of public construction works said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Tze-cheng, chairman of the Public Construction Commission under the Executive
Yuan, said the road, which was built alongside steep cliffs, has been eroded by
the sea and that it experiences subsidence and rockfalls whenever there is heavy
rain.</P>
      <P>The highway is dangerous, requires constant maintenance and could "even
disappear someday," Wu claimed.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang claimed in Hualien early this year that "Hualien
residents harbor high expectations" that a Suhua freeway will be built and said
that as soon as the project has an environmental difference analysis report
ready that will reinforce an earlier environmental impact assessment,
construction can start.</P>
      <P>An environmental impact assessment on the proposed freeway did pass several
years ago, but construction failed to start in the stipulated time because of
continued controversy surrounding its construction.</P>
      <P>Wu said that after the Chinese New Year holiday it will become clear whether the
freeway will be built.</P>
      <P>In any case, out of safety considerations as well as the establishment of an
islandwide traffic network, another highway linking Suao and Hualien should be
built, he said.</P>
      <P>Faced with the pros and cons of its construction, Wu said the government should
provide more information in a transparent way for the public to make its
judgment, including the safety of the present highway, annual maintenance costs,
as well as the impact on the environment after its completion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) lawmakers threatened Friday to give Chunghwa
Post a hard time should the state-owned postal service insist on changing the
company's name without the consent of its staff and the legislature.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun,  who doubles as the party's spokesman, said that
although Chunghwa Post has changed to corporate operations, it is still a state-
owned company subject to Legislative Yuan screening and approval for its annual
budget.</P>
      <P>Lee warned Chunghwa Post not be so confident over the company name change issue,
claiming that the issue's fate is still up to the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lee said he agreed with remarks made by Chunghwa Post labor union leader Tsai
Liang-chuan earlier in the day in which Tsai argued that the union sees nothing
good about changing the name of the company in terms of increasing its business,
adding that it is regrettable that the issue of changing the names of state
enterprises is being used for political purposes.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that the name change will probably make Chunghwa Post a fully
privatized company overnight without the workers' interests being protected.</P>
      <P>He also lambasted Chunghwa Post Chairman Lai Chin-chi for supporting the name
change drive and implementing the plan without consulting anybody or notifying
any of the company's workers in advance.</P>
      <P>Lee said that when the new legislative session begins later this month, the PFP
will be instrumental in boycotting Chunghwa Post's budget for the coming year,
as a tit-for-tat measure over the name change issue.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post Co. was planning to change its name Friday to show its Taiwan
identity, part of a wave of name changes among state enterprises under a name
change campaign advocated by President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The word "Chunghwa" means China. A new Chinese name translated as "Taiwan Post
Co." was planned to be applied after Chunghwa Post's board meeting passed the
proposal Friday, although an official English name had yet to be decided upon.</P>
      <P>Lee likened the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's name change
campaign to the Chinese Cultural Revolution launched by Mao Zedong, claiming
that the name change drive is a Taiwan version of a cultural revolution against
political foes camouflaged by the advocacy of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lin Hui-kuan called for Chunghwa Post and the ruling DPP not to
play the "magic of names" any longer and instead do something useful to benefit
the people.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs also announced last month a plan to change the
name of the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to "CPC, Taiwan," and China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) to "CSBC, Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang has accused the DPP of "ruling the nation with
ideology" in a bid to blot out the last vestiges of China's influence from the
country.</P>

      <P>Beijing  should  speed up its democratization to appeal to the people of Taiwan
if it expects Taiwan to unify with China, a Taiwan official said in the U.S.
capital Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu, the government of
Taiwan respects its people's choice on whether the country should unify with
China or declare independence.</P>
      <P>However, the undemocratic practices adopted by China are making unification an
increasingly undesirable choice for the Taiwanese people, Wu said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said,  the Chinese people under Beijing's totalitarian rule
enjoy no press, religious or political freedom, and democracy in Hong Kong has
regressed after its handover to China from the British colonial government.</P>
      <P>In addition, China's relentless suppression of Taiwan in the international
community is also abominable to the people of Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, results of various opinion polls indicate that the vast
majority of people in Taiwan are opposed to Chinese rule, with more and more
people supporting independence for Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in response to a question on the issue of Taiwan
independence after an interview with U.S. cable television station C-SPAN.</P>
      <P>Asked about the necessity of Taiwan spending big money on arms procurements, Wu
said the purpose of Taiwan's arms procurement is to defend itself from a Chinese
invasion, not to attack China, because Taiwan needs to equipped with strong
self-defense ability to protect its economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that China has been building up its military power over recent
years, with the number of missiles targeting Taiwan increasing year after year.</P>
      <P>While Beijing has continued to upgrade its fighter aircraft, China's submarines
have appeared more and more frequently in waters close to Taiwan, Wu said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will step in if the National Communications Commission (NCC)
allows the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to sell its Broadcasting Corporation of
China (BCC) , a spokesman for the Executive Yuan warned Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, minister of the Government Information Office (GIO) , said the
Executive Yuan has ordered the NCC to instruct the BCC to fulfill its promise to
hand back the two radio frequencies it uses and not to sell its property before
a lawsuit brought by the Executive Yuan against it is settled.</P>
      <P>Although the NCC agreed to relieve the BCC of its obligation to carry out the
promises  in a settlement  in the Taipei High Administrative Court late last
year, the Executive Yuan is mulling whether to cancel the settlement after a
three-member panel led by Minister-without-Portfolio  Hsu Chih-hsiung
determined that the agreement between the NCC and BCC was illegal.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Premier Su Tseng-chang has repeatedly instructed the NCC to take back
BCC's radio frequencies, thereby foiling the KMT's scheme to sell off its ill-
gotten assets.</P>
      <P>The BCC, which made the promises in 2004 to the GIO in return for the GIO's
renewal of its operating license, asked the court to annul the promises after
the KMT sold the company to a private radio operator last year, claiming that
the GIO abused its power by coercing it into making the promises.</P>
      <P>The NCC, which was founded in 2006 to take over the GIO's business of
supervising the country's broadcasting companies, agreed in court to cancel the
GIO's requests in return for BCC's withdrawal of a lawsuit asking for government
compensation for damages.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Friday that promoting a name change
campaign in the international community is aimed at "proper partition" from
China.</P>
      <P>Huang said the campaign is a bid to avoid the international community or the

is not out of "ideological concerns, " but "out of pragmatic considerations."</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States has expressed concern over the campaign, Huang
said the U.S. had not expressed any views.</P>
      <P>He also said that it was not appropriate for him to comment on the matter as it
is an internal issue.</P>
      <P>He said the "name rectification" issue plagues Taiwan as well as China, citing
the examples that when Chinese President Hu Jintao visited the United States
last year, the master of the welcoming ceremony announced to play the national
anthem of "the Republic of China," instead of "the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Also, when Hu recently visited Grenade, an island nation in the southeastern

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou met his predecesor, KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, Friday, stirring up speculation about the meeting
at a time when the prosecution authorities are reportedly soon to indict him
over embezzlement charges.</P>
      <P>Both Ma and Lien were reluctant to answer questions from reporters after their
tete-a-tete -- the latest move by Ma after an interview  with  a newspaper
Thursday  and  a visit  to the anti-corruption task force at the Taiwan High
Court Prosecutor's Office a day prior to that. The prosecutors have concluded a
probe into the case related to Ma's alleged misuse of special municipal fees
allocated for his discretionary use when he served as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006.</P>
      <P>According to KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih, Ma remained unchanged on his
decision to resign from the party chairmanship if he is indicted, but Wu was
reserved about the question of whether Ma will take part in future elections for
public office if he is indicted.</P>
      <P>Although Ma's public approval ratings have recently dropped due to the
embezzlement allegations, Wu pointed out that Ma still enjoys a high level of
public backing that far exceeds that enjoyed by the various possible
presidential aspirants of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>More than half the respondents to several public opinion polls conducted in
recent months have expressed support for Ma for president in the 2008 elections,
Wu claimed.</P>
      <P>According to KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin, Ma and Lien reached an agreement during
the meeting that the KMT must be fully united if it wants to secure victory in
the next presidential race in the face of the challenge of the "pan-green camp"
of the ruling DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>

industrial parks.</P>
      <P>The planned basic law will provide guidelines around which the government is to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Politicians reacted along party lines Friday upon learning that former Kaohsiung
acting mayor Chen Chi-mai has been appointed deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
responding positively and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) criticizing the
appointment.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced several major appointments, including that of
Chen Chi-mai, earlier Friday.</P>
      <P>This was the president's second wave of key post appointments this week. He
announced a swapping of posts between Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the
National Security Council and Tan Sun Chen, secretary general of the
Presidential Office, earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Chen Chi-mai's new post is "very appropriate."</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, DPP legislator and caucus whip, said that Chen Chi-mai served
three terms as a legislator and had administrative experience given the fact
that he once served as a minister without portfolio and spokesman of the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen Chi-mai vowed to serve with humility, saying that he would do
his utmost to assist President Chen in cross-Strait and diplomatic affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai stepped down as the Kaohsiung acting mayor to take responsibility
for a riot in August 2005 by Thai laborers working on Kaohsiung's mass rapid
transit system to protest their harsh treatment and inhumane management.
Subsequent investigations into the riot uncovered a series of irregularities in
the MRT project involving Chen Che-nan, former deputy secretary-general to the
president and Chen Chi-mai's father.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai reportedly has been biding his time since then, and was said to be
keen on running in the year-end legislative elections, which will adopt a new
"single-member constituency, two votes" electoral system, and halve the
225-member legislature to 113 seats.</P>
      <P>As DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling also made known her intention to run in the same
constituency as Chen Chi-mai's, his new appointment has certainly helped relieve
internal pressures for the DPP.</P>
      <P>But the KMT and its ally the People First Party (PFP) criticized the intentions
of the president in appointing Chen Chi-mai, a protege of the president and a
rising star until the Thai riot brought an abrupt stop to his otherwise smooth
political career.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, KMT legislator and caucus whip, said that Chen Che-nan was
indicted for influence peddling and as a result the public has a poor impression
of the Chens.</P>
      <P>"The president has total disregard for public sentiment, and is only thinking of
his own protege," she lamented.</P>
      <P>Her colleague, legislator Alex Fai, said that the president's latest wave of
personnel appointments could signal that the president is afraid of becoming a
"lamb duck" before his second term expires in May 2008, so to demonstrate that
he is still in command he has invited his protege to help him with the
preparations for two major elections ahead -- the year-end legislative elections
and the March 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun said that the truth of the Kaohsiung MRT probe has
yet to come to light, and the president is appointing Chen Chi-mai to his new
post in return for assisting Chen Chu in last December's Kaohsiung mayoral
election.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai served as the campaign manager for Chen Chu in the fiercely
contested election, helping Chen Chu to win by a razor-thin margin against her
KMT rival Huang Chun-ying when the DPP was mired in its lowest approval rating
due to a spate of scandals involving President Chen's family members and close
aides.</P>

      <P>The funds needed to change the names of three state-run enterprises are limited
and the move will not affect their employees' legitimate rights and interests in
any way, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks after the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) , China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) and Chunghwa Post Co. approved their name changes in
board meetings earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Noting that changing corporate titles to remove references to China and prevent
confusion with Chinese counterparts  is the government's long-term policy goal,
Cheng said each of the three companies has been assessing the feasibility of
name changes for quite a long time.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, all three companies fleshed out comprehensive technical
details regarding name changes before presenting them to the Executive Yuan for
approval. "We have avoided premature exposure to prevent controversies, " he
said,  adding that Premier Su Tseng-chang has kept President Chen Shui-bian
informed of the developments in the issue.</P>
      <P>The name changes  follow calls from the ruling Democratic Progressive  Party  to
remove  references  to China  in state organizations.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. said its new name is CPC Corp., Taiwan, while China
Shipbuilding said it will be called CSBS Corp., Taiwan. The oil company's name
change took effect immediately, while the CSBC's name change is still pending a
formal endorsement by its shareholders at a March 1 meeting.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said the name changes will
contribute to upgrading the images of the two companies' brand awareness and
international competitiveness, while requiring only a limited outlay of
financial resources and will have no adverse impact on the rights and interests
of corporate staff.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, the name changes will have a positive impact on the two
companies' sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post -- Chunghwa means "Chinese" -- changed its name to Taiwan Post
Co., Ltd, but only after the meeting of its board was disrupted by opponents
from the company's labor union.</P>
      <P>Dozens of protesters kicked down the door of the meeting room and forced board
members to move to another location. The union claimed that the name change
would cost too much and come at the expense of the company's employees.</P>
      <P>However, Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei said the name
change will hardly impact the postal company's business growth nor undermine the
rights and interests of its staff and clients.</P>
      <P>As to the cost, Tsai said the name change will cost the postal company less than
NT$70 million.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the postal company has been preparing for the name change since the
Executive Yuan ordered a study of the feasibility in 2004.</P>
      <P>Both CPC Corp., Taiwan and Taiwan Post Co. will begin to use new signboards
Monday. Plaque unveiling ceremonies will be held at both firms' Taipei head

The main rival Palestinian factions agreed late Thursday to form a government of

international boycott.

The agreement, signed here in Islams holiest city under Saudi auspices, appeared
likely to end, at least for now, weeks of fighting that had ravaged the West

the international community for resuming relations and support for the
Palestinian Authority.

behind a cosmetics counter at Bloomingdale's. While she applied makeup to
customers and sold them foundation, lipstick and eye shadow, she dreamed about

      <P>Two state-owned enterprises -- Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) -- are set to change their names in line with the
nation's "name rectification" campaign, Minister of the Economic Affairs Steve
Ruey-long Chen said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the name of the CPC, which will be changed to Taiwanese Petroleum
in Chinese and "CPC Corporation, Taiwan"(or CPC in short) in English, will take
effect immediately.</P>
      <P>A ceremony marking the new name of the CPC will be held Feb. 12, Chen said,
while the name of the CSBC, which will be changed to CSBC Corporation, Taiwan
(or CSBC in short), will only take effect after the decision -- approved by its
board of directors earlier Friday -- is endorsed at an upcoming shareholders'
meeting March 1.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the name-change of the state-owned enterprises aims at avoiding
confusion with similarly named businesses in China.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the name-change will positively impact the image, brand and
market identification of the companies, providing an upgrade in their
international competitive edge, and will by no means affect the rights of the
employees in the two companies.</P>
      <P>On the cost of "name-rectification,' Chen said the ministry has clearly
instructed the two companies to change their names in the most "simple,
efficient and cost-saving" way.</P>
      <P>For example, the sign boards of the CPC petrol stations will not have to be
changed completely, and the ID passes of the employees will only require
stickers, which he said will incur only a "very limited cost."</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian first proposed the "name-change" campaign in December
2004, saying that state-owned enterprises that bear the names of "China" or
"Chinese" should change their names to highlight that they are Taiwanese
companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAME CHANGE COSTS LOW, WON'T AFFECT STAFF'S RIGHTS: CABINET</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The funds needed to change the names of three state-run enterprises are limited
and the move will not affect their employees' legitimate rights and interests in
any way, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks after the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) , China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) and Chunghwa Post Co. approved their name changes in
board meetings earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Noting that changing corporate titles to remove references to China and prevent
confusion with Chinese counterparts  is the government's long-term policy goal,
Cheng said each of the three companies has been assessing the feasibility of
name changes for quite a long time.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, all three companies fleshed out comprehensive technical
details regarding name changes before presenting them to the Executive Yuan for
approval. "We have avoided premature exposure to prevent controversies, " he
said,  adding that Premier Su Tseng-chang has kept President Chen Shui-bian
informed of the developments in the issue.</P>
      <P>The name changes  follow calls from the ruling Democratic Progressive  Party  to
remove  references  to China  in state organizations.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. said its new name is CPC Corp., Taiwan, while China
Shipbuilding said it will be called CSBS Corp., Taiwan. The oil company's name
change took effect immediately, while the CSBC's name change is still pending a
formal endorsement by its shareholders at a March 1 meeting.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said the name changes will
contribute to upgrading the images of the two companies' brand awareness and
international competitiveness, while requiring only a limited outlay of
financial resources and will have no adverse impact on the rights and interests
of corporate staff.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, the name changes will have a positive impact on the two
companies' sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post -- Chunghwa means "Chinese" -- changed its name to Taiwan Post
Co., Ltd, but only after the meeting of its board was disrupted by opponents
from the company's labor union.</P>
      <P>Dozens of protesters kicked down the door of the meeting room and forced board
members to move to another location. The union claimed that the name change
would cost too much and come at the expense of the company's employees.</P>
      <P>However, Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei said the name
change will hardly impact the postal company's business growth nor undermine the
rights and interests of its staff and clients.</P>
      <P>As to the cost, Tsai said the name change will cost the postal company less than
NT$70 million.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the postal company has been preparing for the name change since the
Executive Yuan ordered a study of the feasibility in 2004.</P>
      <P>Both CPC Corp., Taiwan and Taiwan Post Co. will begin to use new signboards
Monday. Plaque unveiling ceremonies will be held at both firms' Taipei head
offices at 2 p.m.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAME CHANGE OF CPC TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two state-owned enterprises -- Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) and China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) -- are set to change their names in line with the
nation's "name rectification" campaign, Minister of the Economic Affairs Steve
Ruey-long Chen said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the name of the CPC, which will be changed to Taiwanese Petroleum
in Chinese and "CPC Corporation, Taiwan"(or CPC in short) in English, will take
effect immediately.</P>
      <P>A ceremony marking the new name of the CPC will be held Feb. 12, Chen said,
while the name of the CSBC, which will be changed to CSBC Corporation, Taiwan
(or CSBC in short), will only take effect after the decision -- approved by its
board of directors earlier Friday -- is endorsed at an upcoming shareholders'
meeting March 1.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the name-change of the state-owned enterprises aims at avoiding
confusion with similarly named businesses in China.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the name-change will positively impact the image, brand and
market identification of the companies, providing an upgrade in their
international competitive edge, and will by no means affect the rights of the
employees in the two companies.</P>
      <P>On the cost of "name-rectification,' Chen said the ministry has clearly
instructed the two companies to change their names in the most "simple,
efficient and cost-saving" way.</P>
      <P>For example, the sign boards of the CPC petrol stations will not have to be
changed completely, and the ID passes of the employees will only require
stickers, which he said will incur only a "very limited cost."</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian first proposed the "name-change" campaign in December
2004, saying that state-owned enterprises that bear the names of "China" or
"Chinese" should change their names to highlight that they are Taiwanese
companies.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has recently announced that it would promote the name changes
in a "reasonable and pragmatic" way.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Politicians reacted along party lines Friday upon learning that former Kaohsiung
acting mayor Chen Chi-mai has been appointed deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
responding positively and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) criticizing the
appointment.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced several major appointments, including that of
Chen Chi-mai, earlier Friday.</P>
      <P>This was the president's second wave of key post appointments this week. He
announced a swapping of posts between Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the
National Security Council and Tan Sun Chen, secretary general of the
Presidential Office, earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Chen Chi-mai's new post is "very appropriate."</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, DPP legislator and caucus whip, said that Chen Chi-mai served
three terms as a legislator and had administrative experience given the fact
that he once served as a minister without portfolio and spokesman of the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen Chi-mai vowed to serve with humility, saying that he would do
his utmost to assist President Chen in cross-Strait and diplomatic affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai stepped down as the Kaohsiung acting mayor to take responsibility
for a riot in August 2005 by Thai laborers working on Kaohsiung's mass rapid
transit system to protest their harsh treatment and inhumane management.
Subsequent investigations into the riot uncovered a series of irregularities in
the MRT project involving Chen Che-nan, former deputy secretary-general to the
president and Chen Chi-mai's father.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai reportedly has been biding his time since then, and was said to be
keen on running in the year-end legislative elections, which will adopt a new
"single-member constituency, two votes" electoral system, and halve the
225-member legislature to 113 seats.</P>
      <P>As DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling also made known her intention to run in the same
constituency as Chen Chi-mai's, his new appointment has certainly helped relieve
internal pressures for the DPP.</P>
      <P>But the KMT and its ally the People First Party (PFP) criticized the intentions
of the president in appointing Chen Chi-mai, a protege of the president and a
rising star until the Thai riot brought an abrupt stop to his otherwise smooth
political career.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, KMT legislator and caucus whip, said that Chen Che-nan was
indicted for influence peddling and as a result the public has a poor impression
of the Chens.</P>
      <P>"The president has total disregard for public sentiment, and is only thinking of
his own protege," she lamented.</P>
      <P>Her colleague, legislator Alex Fai, said that the president's latest wave of
personnel appointments could signal that the president is afraid of becoming a
"lamb duck" before his second term expires in May 2008, so to demonstrate that
he is still in command he has invited his protege to help him with the
preparations for two major elections ahead -- the year-end legislative elections
and the March 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee Hung-chun said that the truth of the Kaohsiung MRT probe has
yet to come to light, and the president is appointing Chen Chi-mai to his new
post in return for assisting Chen Chu in last December's Kaohsiung mayoral
election.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai served as the campaign manager for Chen Chu in the fiercely
contested election, helping Chen Chu to win by a razor-thin margin against her
KMT rival Huang Chun-ying when the DPP was mired in its lowest approval rating
due to a spate of scandals involving President Chen's family members and close
aides.</P>

      <P>The United States does not support steps that would appear to change Taiwan's
status unilaterally, including changes  in terminology  for entities
administered  by Taiwan authorities, a U.S. State Department official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Sean McCormack, spokesman of the department, reiterated that the maintenance of
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait remains the primary interest of the
United States.</P>
      <P>"The United States does not support Taiwan independence and opposes any
unilateral steps by either side that would change the status quo," McCormack
said during a daily press briefing.</P>
      <P>"President Chen's fulfillment of his commitments will be a test of leadership,
dependability and statesmanship, as well as the ability to protect Taiwan's
interests, its relations with others, and to maintain peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait," he added.</P>
      <P>McCormack made the statement in response to questions concerning President Chen
Shui-bian's recent indication of plans to change the names of Taiwan's overseas
outposts.</P>
      <P>In the latest issue of his online newsletter published Thursday, Chen said that
besides the government's current efforts to change the names of state-owned
enterprises that contain references to China, the names of the country's
overseas embassies and representative offices will also be changed in the future

    <HEADLINE>UPU HAS NO COMMENT ON TAIWAN'S POSTAL NAME CHANGE ISSUE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Berne-based Universal Postal Union (UPU) said Friday it is not in a position
to comment on Taiwan's decision to rename its state-owned postal company to make
it more recognizable in the international community.</P>
      <P>Noting that the UPU focuses on upgrading global postal services, setting
relevant operation standards and coordinating the worldwide postal system, the
organization said it never interferes with individual country's internal postal
policies and practices, such as postal charges and the issuing of stamps.</P>
      <P>Moreover, a UPU spokesman said, Taiwan is not a UPU member. The UPU, a U.N.
affiliate, has recognized the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate
Chinese representative since April 1972. The UPU now has 191 member countries.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks amid reports that the labor union of Taiwan's
state-owned Chunghwa Post Co. -- Chunghwa means "China" -- is protesting the
company's decision to change its name to Taiwan Post Co. and has warned its
management that redesignation might draw a backlash from China and lead to a
suspension of postal links across the Taiwan Strait and even with other
countries.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a UPU member, it has consistently followed international
norms and postal regulations and exercised self-rule. The UPU spokesman said it
could not make any comments on the Taiwan postal company's name change issue.
"As to other countries' possible responses to such a move, it's up to Taiwan to
address them, " he added.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the board of directors of Chunghwa Post Co. approved the corporate
name change Friday, despite protests from dozens of labor union members on the
grounds that the name rectification would cost a lot of money and come at the
expense of the company's employees. The name change will take effect Monday when
a nameplate bearing the company's new name "Taiwan Post" will also be unveiled.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, the boards of directors of two other state-owned enterprises --
Chinese Petroleum Corp. and China Shipbuilding Corp. -- approved similar
redesignation proposals, removing references to China and including "Taiwan" in
their titles.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties have criticized the name change policy as a politically
motivated move that will stir up ethnic disharmony or confrontation, but
government authorities argue that the policy has been adopted based on the
practical need to maintain "proper partition" from China and save Taiwan's
state-owned enterprises from being confused with similarly named Chinese
companies.</P>
      <P>Confusing titles between Taiwan and China are truly a problem for foreign
people. Just recently, the band of the Caribbean nation Grenada played the
national anthem of the "Republic of China" (Taiwan's official title) instead of
that of the "People's Republic of China" at a ceremony welcoming visiting
Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>The Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, elaborates on the special phenomenon
with regard to Taiwan's postal service and advises readers to write "Taiwan"
rather than "Republic of China" or "ROC" on mail addressed to Taiwan to ensure
the quickest delivery.</P>
      <P>The Wikipedia's UPU entry includes a paragraph that reads: "The Republic of
China joined the UPU on March 1, 1914. After the People's Republic of China was
founded, the Republic of China continued to represent China in the UPU, until
the UPU decided on April 13, 1972 to recognize the People's Republic of China as
the only legitimate Chinese representative. This makes the International Reply
Coupons not available to Taiwan. Mail addressed to Taiwan will still be
delivered there, albeit routed through a third country. However, writing
'Taiwan' rather than 'Republic of China' or 'ROC' ensures the quickest delivery.
Writing 'Taiwan, Province of China' may send the mail through mainland China and
cause delays."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF CRITICIZES NAME-CHANGE CAMPAIGN AS 'CHILDISH'</HEADLINE>

      <P>The chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) criticized Saturday a
campaign initiated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to change
the names of state-run enterprises, calling the move "childish."</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou made the criticism in a press release following a statement by the
U.S. government earlier the same day that it "does not support changes in
terminology for entities administered by Taiwan authorities."</P>
      <P>Ma rebuked the DPP for attempting to "gloss over its incompetence in running a
country and the fact that the country's economy has been in a state of
stagnancy" by pursuing the name change campaign, which he called "political
manipulation."</P>
      <P>"No matter what changes the DPP makes, it cannot change the fact that the
Republic of China exists, " Ma said, describing the move to "eliminate  the
ROC's existence in state-run  enterprises"  as "childish."</P>
      <P>Ma said the "childishness" and "political manipulation" have harmed the people
of the country. He claimed that Chunghwa Post Co.'s decision to change its name
will not only make the employees suffer by having to engage in the time-
consuming task of changing the company designation on countless documents, it
will also cause problems for people around the country who will have to spend a
lot of time having documents issued by the postal company, which also provides
insurance and banking services, changed.</P>
      <P>"The losses caused by the name-change campaign will be too large to imagine," Ma
claimed, advising President Chen Shui-bian, who gave instructions to initiate
the campaign, to "refrain from playing the game of terminology and to stop
playing with the issue of Taiwan independence at the expense of the Taiwan
people's interests and Taiwan's relations with the United States.</P>
      <P>In their respective board meetings held Friday, the Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) decided to change its name to "CPC Corp., Taiwan, " China Shipbuilding
Corp. (CSBC) decided to change its name to CSBC Corp., Taiwan, " and Chunghwa
Post Co. decided to change its name to "Taiwan Post Co."</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Post's decision triggered protests by the company's worker's union.</P>

      <P>Senior officials said Saturday the government  will  continue  to push  forward
with  its "name rectification" campaign, calling it an "internal matter."</P>
      <P>They were responding to remarks by a U.S. State Department official Friday that
the United States does not support steps that would appear to change Taiwan's
status unilaterally, including changes  in terminology  for entities
administered  by Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>Several Taiwan state-owned enterprises, including the Chinese Petroleum Corp.,
the China Shipbuilding Corp., the China Post Co., have decided in their
respective board meetings to remove any reference to "China" and include
"Taiwan" in their titles.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian also said Thursday that the name-change campaign will
not be restricted to state-owned enterprises and will include Taiwan's overseas
embassies and representative offices in the future.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general of the National Security Council, said that name
rectification campaign is a national policy, and the campaign will continue.</P>
      <P>"The matter will not affect Taiwan-U.S. relations," he added.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, echoed Tan Sun
Chen's views.</P>
      <P>"This is an internal matter, and foreign countries should not interfere," Yu
said.</P>
      <P>Cho Jung-tai,  deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office, said that
"this is the government's policy, and we have a right to carry on the matter."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday that the current
name-change drive is not intended to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait
and that it is aimed at avoiding confusion arising from the fact that many
Taiwan organizations have names that are similar to their counterparts in China.</P>
      <P>"The government's name-change drive has nothing to do with the unification
versus independence debate or with changing the official name of the country,"
MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh stressed.</P>
      <P>Wang also said the ministry's efforts to have overseas embassies have the word
"Taiwan" added to their names in parenthesis have been proceeding smoothly.</P>
      <P>However, in countries with which Taiwan does not maintain diplomatic relations,
changing the name of representative offices will require the consent of the host
countries, Wang said, adding that the matter will have to be dealt with on a
case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan representative offices in Jordan, Bahrain, Papua New Guinea,
Nigeria and Bolivia have the word "Taiwan" included in parenthesis in their
names, he added.</P>

      <P>The United States called on President Chen Shui-bian Friday to fulfill his "four
noes" commitments, including not to change Taiwan's national title, while
expressing concern over Taiwan's ongoing move to rectify the names of its state-
owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>"President Chen Shui-bian repeatedly has said he would not allow either domestic
or foreign pressure to alter the guarantees in his 2000 inaugural  address,  in
which he pledged not to declare independence, not to change the national title,
not to push for inclusion of sovereignty themes in the Constitution, and not to
promote a referendum to change the status quo regarding independence or
unification, " the U.S. State Department said in a written statement.</P>
      <P>"President Chen's fulfillment of his commitments will be a test of leadership,
dependability and statesmanship, as well as ability to protect Taiwan's
interests, its relations with others, and to maintain peace and stability in the
strait," it added.</P>
      <P>The statement was issued in response to a question raised during the
department's daily press briefing, in which spokesman Sean McCormack was asked
to comment on Taiwan's ongoing efforts to rename state-owned enterprises that
contain references to China and plans to change  the names  of the country's
overseas  embassies  and representative offices in the future.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the primary interest of the United States remains maintenance of
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, the State Department reiterated that
the United States does not support Taiwan independence and opposes any
unilateral steps by either side that would change the status quo.</P>
      <P>"We do not support administrative steps by the Taiwan authorities that would
appear to change Taiwan's status unilaterally or move toward independence. The
United States does not, for instance, support changes in terminology for
entities administered by the Taiwan authorities," it said.</P>
      <P>In their respective  board meetings held Friday,  Taiwan's state-owned Chinese
Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name to "CPC Corp., Taiwan, " China
Shipbuilding Corp. decided to change its name to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan" and
Chunghwa Post Co. decided to change its name to "Taiwan Post Co."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet claims the name rectification campaign will help avoid confusion
resulting from Taiwan-based organizations carrying similar names to
organizations in China.</P>
      <P>President Chen said Thursday that similar changes will also be made to the names
of the country's  overseas  embassies  and representative offices in the future.</P>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) reminded users of online banking
services Saturday to check their bank's Web site address before engaging in any
transactions or information exchanges in order to protect themselves from being
"phished" by cyber-criminals.</P>
      <P>The FSC issued the warning after the technology crimes prevention and control
center of the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) revealed that it has recently
discovered that some computer hackers from China have been acquiring online
banking users' personal information, such as bank account numbers and passwords,
through false bank Web sites.</P>
      <P>Explaining the scheme called "phishing, " anti-technology crime police officers
said that "phishers"  copy Web site pages of legitimate banks to trick users
into disclosing sensitive personal information.</P>
      <P>People who do not have the habit of checking the official Website address of
their banks can easily be cheated as the false bank Web sites look almost
identical to the real ones, the police said.</P>
      <P>According to the CIB center, in addition to personal information of bank
clients, the phishers have also been discovered to have been stealing money from
bank accounts online by cooperating with criminal rings in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The FSC therefore called for the public to be on alert against this new type of
online fraud and to avoid communicating by e-mail with any banks or other
businesses with which they are not familiar.</P>
      <P>People should always check information on exchanges through their online bank
accounts and contact their bank at once if they suspect that their bank accounts
and passwords have been used without their authorization, the FSC suggested.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Saturday that he is cautiously
assessing his future options amid reports that he is actively preparing for the
Kuomintang (KMT) primary for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to reports by the United Daily News, a major local
newspaper, that he will make a formal announcement to throw his hat in the KMT
primary at an "appropriate time" after the Chinese New Year holidays to try to
win the party's nomination.</P>
      <P>Instead of confirming the news, Wang said he has to "seriously consider the
questions of what he can do for the country and what the country should do for
the people to live up to their expectations."</P>
      <P>"I will also engage in self-reflection to see if I'm capable of serving the
country," Wang continued.</P>
      <P>"There are many options ahead, and I'll cautiously assess my future direction, "
he said, adding that "I'll not rule out any possibilities, and staying on in the
legislature will also be an option."</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibility of running against KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, the
most likely bet of the party for the presidential election, in the primary, Wang
said that he will respect Ma's decision.</P>
      <P>The politically-savvy Wang resigned from his concurrent post as the KMT vice
chairman after losing to Ma, then also a KMT vice chairman, in the party's
chairmanship election in 2005. He has until now been tightlipped about his
intentions concerning the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, there were mixed reactions from KMT lawmakers to the reports.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said that the primary system will provide  all
aspirants  with the opportunity  to engage in a "gentlemen's battle, " which he
said is better than the fighting under the table between the four heavyweights
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , referring to Vice President
Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh, and DPP Chairman
Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>While KMT Legislator Hsu Chung-hsiung said that he will not speculate on
unconfirmed reports, his colleague Wu Chih-yang stressed that "it is a good
thing for aspirants to make known their intentions."</P>
      <P>Legislator Daniel Hwang, executive director in charge of policy of the People
First Party (PFP) , an ally of the KMT, said that the party respects "Wang's
running for the KMT's nomination in the primary."</P>
      <P>Hwang said that he is sure that the two parties will throw their support behind
a presidential candidate endorsed by the KMT-PFP alliance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Lo Chih-ming of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) noted that Wang has remained on friendly terms with former President
Lee Teng-hui, the spiritual leader of the TSU.</P>
      <P>"If Wang can identify with the Taiwan-centric consciousness as well as the
center-left direction espoused by the TSU, then the chances of bilateral
cooperation will increase," Lo added.</P>

      <P>The Patriotic Front, Zambia's major opposition party, may open a representative
office in Taiwan to learn from the country's experiences in technological and
democratic development, the party's leader said in Taipei earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with the Central News Agency prior to his departure
Friday for home after a five-day Taiwan visit, Michael Chilufya Sata said he has
been impressed by Taiwan's booming economy and technological advancement as well
as its liberal democracy during his stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is my first trip to Taiwan, and it won't be my last. I'm impressed by
Taiwan's prosperity and development in various fields. After I return to my
country, I'll discuss with my party colleagues the possibility of operating a
liaison office in Taiwan, " Sata said, adding that given its proximity to Hong
Kong, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, Taiwan is an appropriate location
to be home to his party's Asia base.</P>
      <P>Praising Taiwan as having come a long way in transforming itself from an
agricultural backwater into an industrial powerhouse, Sata said he believes that
African countries, including Zambia, should have much to learn from Taiwan's
developmental experiences.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable  that few Africans know about Taiwan's achievements in
technological and democratic development, and I believe that such ignorance is
the major reason behind the sad fact that only five African countries recognize
Taiwan," Sata said.</P>
      <P>Sata, 70, is a prominent Zambian politician known for his activism. He used to
be a provincial head and held Cabinet posts in labor, health and social welfare
fields. He made headlines last September when he drew the ire of China by
calling Taiwan a sovereign state on the campaign trail ahead of the Zambian
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Sata led by a large margin in the Zambian capital, major copper mining towns and
urban areas in the first two days of the vote count, but the situation took a
dramatic turn on the third day, with incumbent President Levy Mwanawasa coming
from behind to score an upset victory. Sata ended up losing the election,
garnering only 30 percent of the vote to Mwanawasa's 43 percent.</P>
      <P>Sata's supporters staged a two-day rally to protest the result but were
dispersed by police with tear gas and warning shots. Sata later conceded defeat
(with) but maintained that the ruling party had rigged the vote.</P>
      <P>When Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Zambia early this month, the Patriotic
Front issued a statement expressing Zambian people's anti-China sentiments. Hu
was forced to cancel his plan to visit a Chinese-run copper mine north of
Zambian capital after learning that Patriotic Front supporters were planning to
stage a protest against Hu's visit. Due to his anti-China stance, Sata was
excluded from all welcoming activities during Hu's visit.</P>
      <P>Noting that his party holds a strong clout in Zambia's capital and copper mining
areas, Sata said he believes that Hu should have gotten the message of Zambian
people's discontent with China's exports of laborers to work at Zambian's mining
areas.</P>
      <P>"China's labor exports to Zambia and other African countries have caused
resentment among Africans because Africa itself has abundant labor supplies but
lacks job opportunities," Sata said.</P>
      <P>Asked why he is so critical of China at a time when most African countries are
vying for China's aid in their economic development, Sata said their
expectations are based on wrong perception and ignorance of the many meaningful
aid projects Taiwan has launched for his five African allies -- Malawi, Burkina
Faso, Swaziland, The Gambia and Sao Tome &amp; Principe.</P>
      <P>Sata further said he believes that China's relentless efforts to block Taiwan's
international presence and constant military threat against Taiwan mainly result
from "its jealousy of Taiwan's successful economic development  and its fear of
the spread of Taiwan's democratic  notions and lifestyle across the Taiwan
Strait to influence its people."</P>
      <P>Asked why he recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign state, Sata said Taiwan is a bona
fide sovereign state because "it has its own government, lifestyle and has been
independent for more than 50 years." He further said Taiwan's future will mainly
be decided by its own people, not anybody else. Sata said if had won Zambia's
last presidential  election,  he would have switched  his country's diplomatic
recognition from Beijing to Taipei.</P>

      <P>Richard Gombrich, a professor of Buddhist studies at Oxford University, praised
the contributions of Buddhist nuns in Taiwan to the promotion of Buddhist
doctrines, saying the influence of Buddhism has significantly increased on the
island while followers of the religion have suffered from repression in many
other countries.</P>
      <P>Gombrich made the remarks in an interview with the CNA Saturday, after presiding
over an international conference on Buddhism held in Bodh Gaya in Bihar
Province, northeast India Feb. 4-6 to mark the 2,550th anniversary of the
passing of Buddha.</P>
      <P>During the three-day conference, Master Chue Men of the Fo Guang Shan Monastery
in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan gave a briefing on Buddhist nun's
contributions in the 21st century. In his report, Chue Men said 75 percent of
the around 30,000 Dharma masters in Taiwan are female, nuns, the highest ratio
of any country in the world.</P>
      <P>There are eight universities and colleges, three hospitals and 28 libraries
around Taiwan founded by Buddhist organizations, and the country is home to over
5.4 million Buddhists.</P>
      <P>Chue Men indicated that most nuns in Taiwan are highly educated, with many of
them holding  degrees from domestic  or foreign universities. He noted that in
Taiwan, nuns enjoy a high social status, a fact which has drawn the attention of
Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama who announced on a visit to Taiwan in
1997 his plan to study the system of training female Dharma masters in Taiwan
and expressed the intention of establishing a similar system for Tibetan
Buddhism.</P>
      <P>Chue Men stated that in Taiwan, nuns are widely respected because of their
diligence in studying the doctrines of Buddhism as well as their active
participation in charity operations. Citing the Fo Guang Shan organization, he
pointed out that nuns serve as administrators of 95 percent of the Fo Guang Shan
branches in Taiwan and overseas.</P>
      <P>The Bodh Gaya conference, titled "The 21st Century and Buddhism, "drew around
1,000 leaders and representatives of Buddhism from countries around the world,
including the United States, Britain, Germany, Estonia, Brazil, Hungary,
Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Deadliest Bomb in Iraq Is Made by Iran, U.S. Says

The most lethal weapon directed against American troops in Iraq is an explosive-
packed cylinder that United States intelligence asserts is being supplied by
Iran.

The assertion of an Iranian role in supplying the device to Shiite militias
reflects broad agreement among American intelligence agencies, although
officials acknowledge that the picture is not entirely complete.

Wall Street Journal:After a Slump,Payless Tries On Fashion for Size

The storied merchants of Manhattan's Fifth Avenue have a neighbor with a new
look these days: Payless ShoeSource Inc., the retailer long known for cluttered,
warehouse-like stores, budget shoppers and shoes that rarely cost more than $15
a pair. Across from Lord &amp; Taylor at 39th Street, the Payless store sports a
new sleek design and shoes such as a $22 platform pump with a bow tie.

Once a feared force, Payless ShoeSource saw its performance sag in recent years
under pressure from Wal-Mart and other discount rivals. Now the company believes
its stylish products and spruced- up stores will lure young, hip consumers and
persuade longtime customers to spend more.</TEXT>

      <P>Changing the name of Taiwan's state-owned companies to make them more
identifiable with their country of origin doesn't conflict with President Chen
Shui-bian's "four noes" pledge, Chen's chief of staff said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, secretary-general to the president, was responding to a U.S. State
Department statement that the United States does not support Taiwn's ongoing
move to rectifying  the names of its state-owned companies.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. statement reflects more of its concern about whether Taiwan would move
a step further toward embracing the 'four noes' rather than the current move to
change the names of our state-owned companies," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sideline of a spring gathering of senior govenrment and ruling
Democratic Progressive Party officials in Sanhsia, Taipei County hosted by
President Chen, Chiou said the government will continue communication with U.S.
authorities to let them understand that changing the name of Taiwan's state-
owned companies is not in conflict with the "four noes" commitments.</P>
      <P>"We'll reassure U.S. authorities that our government will continue upholding the
'four noes' commitment," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>The "flour noes" refer to commitments made by Chen in his 2000 inaugural
address, in which he pledged not to declare independence, not to change the
national title, not to push for inclusion of sovereignty themes in the
Constitution, and not to promote a referendum to change the status quo regarding
independence or unification.</P>
      <P>Noting that redesignation of state-owned companies is an internal affairs, Chiou
said the government will continue implementing this policy without any pause.</P>
      <P>Quoting President Chen's previous statement, Chiou said the state-own
enterprises' name rectification need not be associated with change of Taiwan's
national title.</P>
      <P>In their respective  board meetings held Friday,  Taiwan's state-owned Chinese
Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name to "CPC Corp., Taiwan, " China
Shipbuilding Corp. decided to change its name to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan" and
Chunghwa Post Co. decided to change its name to "Taiwan Post Co."</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan said the name rectification is mainly aimed at avoiding
confusion resulting from Taiwan-based organizations carrying similar names to
organizations in China.</P>
      <P>Expressign  concern  about  the  three  Taiwan  state-owned enterprises' name-
change decisions, the U.S. State Department issued a statement Friday reminding
President Chen of the importance of fulfilling his "four noes" commitments,
saying that the "fulfillment will be a test of leadership, dependability and
statesmanship, as well as ability to protect Taiwan's interests, its relations
with others, and to maintain peace and stability in the strait."</P>
      <P>The statement also said that the United States does not support administrative
steps by the Taiwan authorities that would appear to change Taiwan's status
unilaterally or move toward independence. "The United States does not, for
instance, support changes in terminology for entities administered by the Taiwan
authorities," it added.</P>

      <P>Richard Gombrich, a professor of Buddhist studies at Oxford University, praised
the contributions of Buddhist nuns in Taiwan to the promotion of Buddhist
doctrines, saying the influence of Buddhism has significantly increased on the
island while followers of the religion have suffered from repression in many
other countries.</P>
      <P>Gombrich made the remarks in an interview with the CNA Saturday, after presiding
over an international conference on Buddhism held in Bodh Gaya in Bihar
Province, northeast India Feb. 4-6 to mark the 2,550th anniversary of the
passing of Buddha.</P>
      <P>During the three-day conference, Master Chue Men of the Fo Guang Shan Monastery
in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan gave a briefing on Buddhist nun's
contributions in the 21st century. In his report, Chue Men said 75 percent of
the around 30,000 Dharma masters in Taiwan are female, nuns, the highest ratio
of any country in the world.</P>
      <P>There are eight universities and colleges, three hospitals and 28 libraries
around Taiwan founded by Buddhist organizations, and the country is home to over
5.4 million Buddhists.</P>
      <P>Chue Men indicated that most nuns in Taiwan are highly educated, with many of

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has promised to help with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidate selection for the 2008 presidential
contest through building a consensus among all of the hopefuls, party sources
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, top whip of the DPP legislative caucus, quoted Chen as saying at
a spring gathering of senior administrators and DPP officials at a recreational
park in Sanhsia, Taipei County Saturday that he feels "bound in honor" to assist
in coordinating the selection of the DPP's 2008 presidential ticket.</P>
      <P>"If necessary,  I'll not evade the duty of helping  with presidential candidate
selection through coordination, " Chen was quoted as having said at the spring
gathering he hosted in honor of government and party officials as well as DPP
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>According to Ker, the selection of the party's candidate for the next
presidential election was the hottest topic discussed during the "hiking and
talking" event.</P>
      <P>With the party's four heavyweights -- Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su
Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- overtly
or covertly vying for the party's mandate for the presidential race, Ker said
many DPP members are worrying over how to build a consensus among the four
aspirants to avoid damaging party unity.</P>
      <P>"Many participants to the spring gathering requested that the president help
with this tough and arduous job, " Ker said.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Hsieh was quoted as having said on the occasion that party unity
is most important in ensuring electoral victory. Therefore, he said,  the party
should act early to pick its presidential ticket through consensus building
instead of holding a primary, which he said could undermine harmony and unity
within the party.</P>
      <P>If the 2008 presidential election and the year-end legislative election are, in
fact, held simultaneously, Hsieh said, the voting day should be advanced to Jan.
26, 2008. Should that be the case, he said, less than a year is left for
preparations. "This is why I have been advocating that our party should start
presidential hopeful registration as soon as possible," Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Some lawmakers present at the meeting called for an extensive debate among all
aspirants on the party's future policy lines and various reform initiatives.
Hsieh reportedly threw his support behind such a proposal.</P>
      <P>Premier  Su  said  he  believes  that  the  Cabinet's demonstrated
administrative success would be the best guarantee of the ruling party's success
in the two upcoming critical elections.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, I'll work diligently and cooperatively with all party
members in carrying out all of our policy initiatives and reform projects. I
also wholeheartedly support the proposal of having the president assist in
deciding on our party's presidential ticket as early as possible," Su said
during the meeting.</P>
      <P>For his part, DPP Chairman Yu said the party central committee has worked out a
schedule in reference to past practices for selecting the party's presidential
candidate. According to the schedule, candidacy registration will start in
April, a primary vote by party members will take place in May and public opinion
polls will be held in June. According to DPP regulations, the primary voting
result will account for 30 percent and the opinion poll results will make up 70
percent in selecting the party's presidential nominee.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Yu said he himself would not oppose advancing the whole work
schedule or have President Chen help coordinate the candidate selection.</P>
      <P>Another major topic discussed in Saturday's gathering was the DPP
administration's ongoing campaign to rename state-owned companies to get rid of
Chinese reference and include "Taiwan" in their titles to make them more
identifiable with their country of origin and avoid confusion with similarly
named Chinese organizations.</P>
      <P>President Chen was quoted as having acknowledged that it would be very difficult
to satisfy all social quarters with regard to the "name rectification" campaign.
Consequently, he said, the government and the DPP would be better off if they
keep a low profile and refrain from "talking too much" about the issue.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu said the "name rectification" drive is both aimed at realizing
the party's policy goal and a move to deliver on its commitment to making Taiwan
a "normal, complete and great" country.</P>
      <P>"There  might be practical  limitations  and obstacles  to accomplishing our
ultimate goal, but we should never back away from hard work or our party's
ideals, " Yu said, adding that his current push for name rectification and
desinicization is in line with the party's policy line.</P>
      <P>He further said that even though writing a new constitution for the country is a
tall order, the DPP should still present a draft bill in this regard to deliver
on its promise to its hard-core supporters.</P>
      <P>Both Premier Su and his predecessor, Hsieh, were reportedly more reserved about
touting the party's ideals that may be hard to be fully implement given the
present international environment. Both said they prefer to see a delicate
balance achieved between advocating  the party's  ambitious  goals and their
pragmatic implementation.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's legendary hand puppet show master Huang Hai-tai passed away at his home
in Yunlin, central Taiwan early Sunday. He was 107 years old.</P>
      <P>Huang checked  into the Yunlin branch of National  Taiwan University Hospital

authorities said.</P>
      <P>Huang celebrated his 107th birthday in his hometown Jan. 2. Celebrities
attending  his birthday party included Premier Su Tseng-chang. On that day, the
Yunlin County Council passed a resolution designating the date the "Yunlin Hand
Puppet Show Day" in recognition of Huang's contribution to hand puppet show
development and related traditional folk arts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hand puppetry is not just a choice of entertainment, it helps preserve
traditional theater, sculpture and embroidery. Since Yunlin started organizing
biennial international hand puppet festivals in 1999, the county has helped

      <P>Housing is available in excess of demand throughout Taiwan, especially in
Taichung City, but not in Taipei city where there is a shortage, an executive
with a local real estate brokerage firm said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Construction and Planning Agency under the
Ministry of the Interior, Liao Peng-sheng, a manager of the Yungching Realty
Company, said there were 7.4 million homes in the whole Taiwan by the end of
2006, thanks to an abundance of new units built by local real estate developers
over the last three years, but there are only 7.36 million households, which
translates into a surplus of 39,000 homes.</P>
      <P>That excess represents an expansion of 46.76 percent compared with the 26,000
surplus units at the end of 2005, and the excess in supply is expected to keep
growing, Liao said.</P>
      <P>The oversupply is most obvious in Taichung City where there were 415,000 homes
and 353,000 households which translates into a surplus of 62,000 homes.</P>
      <P>Liao attributed that city's housing surplus to broad-based speculation that
Taichung will become more prosperous following the inauguration of high speed
rail service earlier this year and the full operation this year of the Central
Taiwan Science Park near Taichung, not to mention the anticipation for direct
shipping links between Taichung Harbor and mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, the glut of homes in Taichung is sure to put a damper on home prices
there in the short term, Liao predicted.</P>
      <P>At the other end of the spectrum, Liao said there is a shortage of nearly 90,000
homes in Taipei city, which boasts 9.41 million households but has only 8.51
million homes available.</P>
      <P>Three other counties -- Yunlin, Kaohsiung and Tainan -- also have experienced a
shortage of housing but the deficit, varying from 13,000 to 15,000 units, is not
great enough to raise the prices of homes there too steeply, Liao went on.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Taoyuan counties are two counties other than Taichung with an
oversupply of homes, showing a surplus of 59,000 homes and 56,000 homes
respectively, Liao went on.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CALLS FOR KMT-PFP SUMMIT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) called Sunday for an urgent summit between the PFP
and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to present a united front against the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) push for renaming the state-run
enterprises and to iron out ways for cooperation in the 2008 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Opposition PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun issued the call at a Legislative Yuan
news conference.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the ongoing name change campaign for the state-run
enterprises, one in a series of the DPP's pro-independence moves, will
eventually lead Taiwan to an economic and national security disaster.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration's recent decision to change the name of several state-
owned companies, such as Chunghwa Post,  Chinese Petroleum Corp., China
Shipbuilding Corp. and Central Bank of China, will have a far-reaching and
negative impact on Taiwan's economy, Lee warned.</P>
      <P>Lee criticized President Chen Shui-bian for only seeking to grasp greater power
and of ignoring a U. S. backlash on the name change issue, and he opined that a
summit should be held as soon as possible between PFP Chairman James Soong and
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng  to discuss  countermeasures  to cope  with  possible
implications arising from the DPP's name change drive.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung echoed Lee's comments and opined that budget for
relevant agencies should be slashed and that a referendum should be called to
allow the public to have a say on the name change issue so as to stop the DPP
from further fueling the matter.</P>
      <P>The PFP and the KMT, which recently established a new alliance between them,
also have to put forward their blueprints for national development and cross-
Taiwan Strait exchanges, despite the fact that Ma has been dogged by the
possibility of indictment on embezzlement charges related to alleged mishandling
of special municipal funds for his discretionary  use while serving as mayor of
Taipei from 1998-2006, Liu argued.</P>
      <P>Although Soong is currently in the United States, Liu said, the PFP chairman
will definitely offer to contribute  through the mechanisms based upon the new
KMT-PFP alliance.</P>

      <P>A close aide of Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng confirmed Sunday that
Wang does not exclude the possibility of his running the 2008 presidential race
"to live up to the people's expectations."</P>
      <P>Although running in the presidential race, continuing to be the legislative
speaker and retiring to become a farmer are all options for Wang in the coming
two years, the aide said that since there are so many voices from the grass-
roots calling on him to run, Wang will probably throw his hat in the opposition
Kuomintang primary after Chinese New Year to try to win the party's nomination.</P>
      <P>The aide said once Wang wins in the KMT primaries, he will then appoint a vice

      <P>The top priority for the Kuomintang (KMT) now is to unite and field the most
qualified ticket to take back power in the 2008 presidential election, KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside a media report that he had discussed the issue of forming a
presidential ticket with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng during a Friday
meeting with KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, Ma clarified that he has not
thought of the question and added that he only mentioned to Lien that there must
be only one ticket to represent the KMT in the next presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he has yet to officially announce his presidential bid and that he
has never thought about with whom he should form a ticket to run in the race for
the KMT.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a seminar with KMT Taipei city committee members who
urged him to quickly make public his presidential bid for the sake of the
nation's overall interests.</P>
      <P>According to Ma's aides, the KMT's presidential candidate must be produced in
line with the party's mechanisms. Once the party's presidential hopeful is
decided, whether through negotiations within the party or through its primaries,
he or she is entitled to choose a running mate, they said, adding that it is
pointless to discuss the question of who and who should form a presidential
ticket.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Wang also claimed that he had not considered forming a
ticket with Ma to run in the next president poll. "I need more time to carefully
assess the issue," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang also denied a media report that he might team up with a running mate from
the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, arguing that he never discussed such an option or
revealed such an intent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers voiced their worry that there have been no signs of
cooperation between Ma and Wang, despite high public expectations that the two
men should team up to run in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>According to KMT lawmaker Hsu Shu-po, grass-roots supporters keenly wish to see
Ma and Wang form a ticket to represent the KMT in the next presidential
election. But he said that there have been no signs that the two KMT key men
will collaborate in this regard, a development he called "worrisome."</P>
      <P>"Aides surrounding Ma must realize that it will be very difficult for the KMT to
take back power if Ma doesn't team up with Wang in the 2008 presidential race, "
Hsu said, urging both Ma and Wang to unite and face up to reality, and warning
that DPP heavyweights have started to coordinate on producing a combative
candidate for the next presidential race.</P>
      <P>Stating that support for a Ma-Wang presidential ticket remains strong among the
rank and file, KMT lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao encouraged the two men to "have a talk
and settle the issue."</P>

      <P>The government's ongoing name change campaign for state-run companies is very
helpful in galvanizing the people's identification with Taiwan, ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while giving a speech at a ceremony in central Changhua
county during which more than 100 new party workers took an oath to serve the
DPP.</P>
      <P>Defending the name change campaign that he launched earlier this month,  Yu
contended that the drive will certainly boost the identification of the people
of Taiwan with the country. "The more the issue is being talked about, the more
the people will feel akin to Taiwan," he argued.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that the United States has no right to meddle in Taiwan's
internal matters, like the ongoing name change campaign for state-run
enterprises, and called for a customized constitution and joining the United
Nations under the name "Taiwan" making Taiwan a normal country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou voiced his
opposition to the ruling DPP's name change drive at a seminar with the party's
Taipei city committee members.</P>
      <P>Reminding the DPP government that such a meaningless move will only waste the
taxpayers' money and create concerns in other countries, like the United States,
Ma questioned whether the name change drive is the DPP's first step towards a
formal declaration of Taiwan's independence.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the DPP's "bossing around" will gain no public support, Ma said
that he was reserved about a proposal that the KMT should dramatically respond
to the DPP's name change drive.</P>
      <P>The KMT must refrain from dancing to the tune of the DPP, which has been seeking
to divert public attention away from its corruption and incompetence, said Ma.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT GIVES COLD SHOULDER TO PFP'S CALL FOR SUMMIT</HEADLINE>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers gave the cold shoulder to their political
allies in the People First Party (PFP) Sunday over the PFP's call for a summit
between the two parties to field jointly a pair of candidates in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>In response to PFP lawmaker Lee Hung-chun's call earlier that day for a meeting
of leaders of the two parties, KMT lawmaker Wu Chih-yang said that as no PFP
politician has thus far expressed any interest in running in the presidential
election only KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and KMT Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng are likely to enter the race.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT has its own process to choose candidates, Wu said the
competition between Ma and Wang for the chance to stand for the presidency on
the KMT ticket should be dealt with via this process,  or through discussions
between  the two contestants themselves, rather than a summit involving current
and former leaders of the KMT and PFP.</P>
      <P>Wu's statement referred to Lee's suggestion that the summit include former KMT
Chairman Lien Chan, PFP Chairman James Soong in addition to the two hopefuls of
Ma and Wang.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Hsu Shu-po claimed the summit should be held only after the KMT
chooses its presidential candidate according to its own rules, adding that a
decision reached at a KMT-PFP summit may not be acceptable to the New Party and
the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union -- two tiny political groups also included in
the "Pan-blue alliance" -- unless they too are invited to the summit.</P>
      <P>Another KMT lawmaker, Lai Shih-bao was also not in favor of the summit, arguing
that as the existing alliance between the two parties has provided both sides
with channels of communications, "there is no point of bypassing these to hold a
summit."</P>
      <P>In addition to the 2008 presidential election, Lee Hung-chun urged the two
parties take advantage of the summit to discuss putting forth a united front on
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's push to purge the words "China" and
"Chinese" from the names of all state-own companies, but his call drew a blank
from his KMT counterparts.</P>

      <P>The government-approved history textbooks for local senior high schools omit
Japanese aggression against China to avoid a repeat of the depiction of the war,
an education official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-hsing, head of the Secondary Education Department under the Ministry of
Education, said the Sino-Japanese War between 1937 and 1945 had been mentioned
in the textbooks of eighth grade at junior high school, and a repeat of it in
the history textbooks of the junior high school will unnecessarily increase the
students' study burden.</P>
      <P>In order to support his claims, Chen cited a guideline issued by the education
ministry for publishing companies on compiling history textbooks which said the
textbooks of the senior high school should not give too much description of the
Sino-Japanese War as it has already been mentioned in the history textbooks of
the junior high school.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to a criticism from the United Evening News
which broke the news on Sunday about the disappearance of Japan's aggression
against China from the new textbooks published by many private companies, saying
it has caused an uproar among local history teachers. It is especially ironical,
the paper claimed, as the Rape of Nanking, in which Imperial Japanese Army
killed 300,000 Chinese civilians after seizing that city of China's than-capital
in 1937, will reach its 70th anniversary at Dec. 12 this year.</P>
      <P>The newspaper also quoted some teachers as criticising the administration  of
the Democratic Progressive Party,  which is campaigning to purge the island's of
any Chinese influence, for trying to cover up Japanese brutality toward Chinese.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is set to convene a meeting after the Chinese
New Year holidays to discuss adjusting the country's minimum wage, which has
remained unchanged at NT$15,840 (US$481) per month for the last nine years, CLA
Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that whether to adjust the minimum wage and by how much is a matter for
a CLA basic wage screening committee to decide, although he added that he
personally feels the minimum wage should be raised to better reflect current
realities.</P>
      <P>Lee said he sees an upward adjustment of the NT$15,840 minimum wage as necessary
given the fact that over 90 percent of Taiwan's laborers earn over NT$20,000 a
month, that the country's unemployment rate fell to a new six-year low of 3.91
percent in 2006, and that many local companies have reported a shortage of
labor.</P>
      <P>The top labor affairs official also noted that some firms have suggested that
the minimum wage for foreign laborers be de-linked from that for Taiwan citizens
so that they can continue to employ foreign laborers at low costs. Lee said that
he does not think this is something that the CLA will do anytime soon.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Post Co. is expected to issue the first set of "Taiwan stamps" Feb. 28
featuring the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum as the theme of their design, officials
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The issuance will be the first carrying the mark "Taiwan stamp" after the
company changed its name from "Chunghwa Post Co." to "Taiwan Post Co."</P>
      <P>However, other stamps issued by the company in the first quarter of this year
will still be printed with the mark "Republic of China stamp, " as the issuance
of stamps requires preparation in advance, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications ordered the company to prepare
for the issuance of the set of "Taiwan stamps" last year, long before the
company was renamed, to make it in time for its issuance on Feb. 28, they said,
adding that the issuance of "Republic of China stamps" will stop completely in
April at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The board of Chunghwa Post Co. approved a proposal to rename the company Taiwan
Post Co. Friday amid the government's efforts to change the names of state-owned
enterprises that contain references to China. "Chunghwa" means "Chinese" or
"China" in the Chinese language.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Chinese Petroleum Corp. decided to change its name to "CPC Corp.,
Taiwan, " while China Shipbuilding Corp. decided to change its name to "CSBC
Corp., Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet claims the name rectification campaign will help avoid confusion

      <P>One of the 2008 presidential election hopefuls of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) expressed the hope Monday that the process of selecting
the party's candidate for the election will follow the current primary system as
much as possible.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh made the remarks when he met with grass-roots DPP
members in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the DPP should have "teamwork in mind" and choose a candidate who has
the best chance of winning the election, while the others help with the election
campaign.</P>
      <P>"None of the hopefuls should have a 'zero-sum' mindset," he said, adding that
not having this mindset would make the hopefuls more relaxed in taking part in
the party's primary.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said that primary regulations should not be changed unless agreement
on the matter is reached among all the hopefuls.</P>
      <P>"To change the rules of the game after it starts will not work in democratic
politics," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh is one of the four DPP heavyweights said to be keen on representing the
party to run in the 2008 presidential election. The other three are Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun.</P>

      <P>As much as 88 percent of condoms sold in erotic product stores have not passed
inspections by the health authorities, according to the results of a survey
released Monday by the Consumer's Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted among 25 condom products sampled by the foundation from
11 erotic product stores in the city and county of Taipei from Feb. 3-4.</P>
      <P>While all condoms sold on the market are required to be registered with the
Department of Health (DOH) as a medical product and to receive a license code
after passing inspection by health authorities, the survey found that 18 of the
surveyed products did not carry a license code and four others had codes that
did not belong to them.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that only two products were labeled with complete information
as required by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, including the name and address of
the manufacturer, name of the product and its license code, the manufacture date
or shipment identification number, as well as the expiration date.</P>
      <P>Six of the products carried inconsistent labels in their inner and outer
packagings in terms of their manufacture and expiration dates, and four others
had passed their expiration dates, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, among 18 condom products with special fragrances, 12, or 67 percent,
either did not indicate their ingredients at all or failed to label their
ingredients clearly, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>Responding to the results of the survey, foundation chairman Cheng Jen-hung

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, who used to be reputed as the "godfather of
Taiwan independence, " has recently said he shares no common views with the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and has declared that his future
efforts will focus on the "reconstruction of democratic Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during an interview with the Sankei Shimbun, a mass-
circulation Japanese economic daily.  The interview was published in the paper's
Monday edition.</P>
      <P>Lee reiterated that Taiwan is an independent and sovereign country that is faced
with the problem of how to become a "normal" country, rather than how to seek
independence.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should endeavor to make up the "deficiencies" that impede its sovereignty
as a democratic independent country, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Talking about the future development of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU), which regards Lee as its "spiritual leader, " Lee said the party is
undergoing a complete reconstruction under the leadership of Huang Kun-huei, who
took over the chairmanship last month.</P>
      <P>While the party is working on amendments to its platform and a name change, Lee
said it will cut its political ties with the DPP, concentrating on work aimed at
putting together a Taiwan-centric consciousness.</P>
      <P>In reply to questions about his controversial remarks published by Next Magazine
in early February in which the magazine claimed he was "giving up independence,
open to investment from China and looking forward to visiting China, " Lee
claimed that Taiwan's economic growth is stagnated while the number of
unemployed is growing and the gap between the rich and poor is expanding.</P>
      <P>For all that, Lee claimed that the ruling party is still reluctant  to make
efforts  to resolve  the problems  but is concentrating on a power struggle with
the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The DPP's economic policy is a "failure, " according to Lee, who suggested that
the ruling party try to correct its wrongs while making efforts to end
interparty conflicts.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that he has never considered visiting China under communist
rule.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is inviting ethnic Chinese youths residing in the United States or Canada
to take part in a volunteer English teaching program this summer, Overseas
Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC) officials posted in the U.S. capital said

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Monday that he will have 100 roses ready to welcome
his wife Shirley Shaw's first return home since being admitted to hospital
following a serious traffic accident in late November.</P>
      <P>With Shaw's steady recuperation over the last three months and with the recent
removal of the steel brace on her partially amputated left arm, Hu said he asked
doctors to grant his wife "a three-day leave" from hospital to spend the Chinese
New Year holiday at home with him.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the China Medical University Hospital agreed to his request but also
urged that Shaw spend most of her time in bed while at home as "her bones are
still as fragile as sugar cane, " according to Hu.</P>
      <P>The traffic accident occurred on the evening of Nov. 18 when Hu and his wife
were heading home to Taichung from a campaign rally in Kaohsiung along the
north-bound section of the Formosa Freeway. Their car rolled over after it was
hit by a vehicle that was trying to pass a truck. Shaw sustained serious
injuries in the accident and was unconscious when she arrived at Chimei Hospital
in Tainan. Hu also sustained minor injuries in the accident.</P>

      <P>The government will respond to the issue of transitional justice around Feb. 28,
the 60th anniversary of the tragic 2 28 Incident, Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks amid reports that Wu Nai-teh, a researcher at Academia
Sinica, the nation's highest research institute, was preparing  to form a
private  sector truth and reconciliation commission.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed hope that the historical facts about the 2 28 Incident of 1947 and
the ensuing "white terror" imposed by the former Kuomintang administration will
come to light in full to serve as part of democracy education and avoid any
repetition of the tragedy, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Cheng said it would be more suitable for the government to conduct some of the
probes but added that some could be done by the private sector and that the
government would support such efforts.</P>
      <P>He noted that transitional justice is an issue for all emerging democratic
countries seeking to resolve the legacy of authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>"Through reflection on transitional justice, Taiwan will be able to deepen and
cement its democratic system, " Cheng said, adding that the methods used by
other countries, including probes into truth and accounting for responsibility,
can provide a good reference.</P>
      <P>Noting that 2007 is the 60th anniversary of the 2 28 Incident, when Kuomintang
forces crushed a revolt in Taiwan, Cheng said that "it is an appropriate time to
discuss transitional justice."</P>
      <P>He added that the transitional justice issue will not only cover the 2 28
Incident but will also include the ensuing white terror and all other
controversial incidents that took place during the previous authoritarian era.</P>

      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) confirmed Monday it has approved the
resignation of President Chen Shui-bian's disgraced son-in-law, Chao Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>Chao's resignation will take effect Feb. 14, according to NTUH spokesman Lin Ho-
hsiung.</P>
      <P>There have been reports that Chao has been hired by Sin Lau Hospital in southern
Tainan City, but the hospital declined to confirm the reports.</P>
      <P>Chao, who was an orthopedic surgeon at NTUH, was suspended from duty immediately
after he was indicted in July 2006 on charges of insider trading of Taiwan
Development Corp. (TDC) stocks.</P>
      <P>NTUH voted down Chao's request to return to his job in October on the grounds
that he "seriously violated medical ethics."</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court sentenced Chao to six years in prison and fined him
NT$30 million  (US$909,090)  in December  after determining that he took
advantage of his influence to obtain important information regarding TDC share
prices, based upon which he traded TDC shares for huge profits.</P>
      <P>According to the court, Chao got more than NT$54 million in actual gains from
the trading together with his father, although pro forma earnings  calculated
in accordance  with the Securities Transaction Act amounted to only NT$4.27
million.</P>
      <P>Chao has appealed his case to the Taiwan High Court.</P>

      <P>The government has commissioned the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TETRA) to make initial contact with related agencies in
China on its ban on gravel exports slated to take effect March 1, a Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MAC Chief Secretary Jan Jyh-horng said gravel imported from China accounts for
one-fifth of Taiwan's total demand, showing that gravel from China is very
important to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jan said he hopes cross-strait consultations will have good results and that the
measure will not be detrimental to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about the government's contingency plans in the event of a Chinese ban,
Jan said only that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made efforts to help
expand its resources, including increasing the amount of domestic dredging and
imports from other countries.</P>
      <P>But he also said the measures will require a period of adjustment and expressed
hope that China's gravel exports will not undergo dramatic changes in the short
term.</P>
      <P>China originally announced that its gravel export ban would start May 1 last

      <P>A spokeswoman for opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) told the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government Monday that rectifying Taiwan's national
title tops all other name-change efforts.</P>
      <P>Commenting the ongoing campaign aimed at changing the names of state-owned

Chiang Yueh-chin  said the TSU lauds the government's determination to fortify
Taiwan's national identity by pushing for the changes, but considers the efforts
made by the government "hasty,  not delicate enough and lacking sufficient
communication."</P>
      <P>Chiang said the TSU considers rectifying Taiwan's national title is the  most
important.  As the  DPP administration-initiated constitutional amendments have
raised the threshold for revising the Constitution to allow for a change of the

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) aims to put in place a monthly pension system

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan reiterated Monday a call
for party unity if it wants to regain power in the 2008 presidential election,
but he did not volunteer to coordinate a presidential candidate within the
party, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said later that same day.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Lien invited him to the meeting and the KMT honorary chairman
issued the call during their hour-long closed-door discussion. But Wang added
that Lien did not say he would help coordinate the KMT's presidential candidacy
between KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Wang himself. Wang is also a KMT stalwart.</P>
      <P>The Lien-Wang meeting came at a sensitive time as Ma, the former mayor of Taipei
who ended his tenure in December last year and who is the KMT's most likely
candidate in the 2008 presidential race, is being investigated for his alleged
misuse of special municipal funds earmarked for his discretionary use during his
mayoral term.</P>
      <P>Speaking with a group of reporters earlier that same day at the Legislative
Yuan, Wang said that the party's unity must be built upon sincerity and
consensus through discussion and coordination and that the KMT must not deceive
itself if it hopes to achieve that aim.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks came after Ma said during a meeting with a group of farmers at
the KMT's Taitung County chapter in eastern Taiwan that it is better to conduct
intra-party negotiations when the party's aspirants in the 2008 presidential
election have all publicly announced their bids.</P>
      <P>"Winning back power for the KMT was one of my promises made to KMT members when
I took part in the party's chairmanship election in 2005," Ma emphasized. He
made it clear that "the KMT cannot afford to have another split" and that "the
party must field only one ticket to run in the 2008 presidential race."</P>

      <P>Taiwan could become a normal country in 10 years if backed by a tailor-made
constitution and a Legislative Yuan dominated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Monday.</P>
      <P>The DPP could make Taiwan a normal and competitive country in a decade if the
party is fully committed to the goal and backed by full support from the rank
and file, Yu said, adding that Taiwan still dreams of joining the United Nations
under the name of "Taiwan" and of acquiring sufficient defensive weapons to
safeguard the nation's security.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism from main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou that the name change campaign for the state-run enterprises,  being
promoted  by the  DPP administration,  is "unaccountable, " Yu clarified that he
began broaching the idea to underscore Taiwan identity as early as in January
2005 while serving as premier.</P>
      <P>The current name change drive was by no means a hasty move or campaign ploy
aimed solely at solidifying grass-roots support for the DPP ahead of the
December legislative elections, he argued, adding that the redesignation of
state-owned companies is part of the DPP administration's goal of making Taiwan
a normal and complete country.</P>
      <P>Since Yu rekindled the name change campaign earlier this month during a DPP's
Central Standing Committee meeting, several state-owned enterprises have been
renamed, including the nation's shipbuilding and postal companies, as well as
the petroleum provider.</P>

Wall Street Journal:London Parents Scramble for Edge In Preschool Wars

London, like Manhattan, is one of the most extreme examples for preschool
admissions mania. At nearly all private schools here, parents must apply as soon
as children are born.

Some schools grant spots on the basis of those applications. At others, applying
at birth might merely win a chance for a child to interview and test for
admission when he or she is ready for elementary school at four. Parents who
don't apply early or who move to London with a small child are often out of
luck.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that renaming the state-owned postal
company to include "Taiwan" in its title complies with prevailing mainstream
public opinion, which favors promotion of Taiwan's distinct national identity.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while giving a speech at a plaque-unveiling ceremony to
mark the redesignation of Chunghwa Post Co. -- Chunghwa means China -- to Taiwan
Post Co. as part of the government's ongoing name rectification  campaign  to
prevent  Taiwan's  state-owned enterprises  from being confused with similarly
named Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the name change campaign has inevitably met criticism,
misunderstanding, opposition and obstruction, Chen said the government should
nonetheless  be adamant,  determined and responsible in doing what it thinks is
right for the nation.</P>
      <P>If the government pulls out all the stops to fulfill "mission impossible", Chen
said he believes the campaign will eventually win public support and
recognition. He called for widespread public backing in future endeavors,
including pushing to have the country join international organizations --
including the United Nations -- under the name "Taiwan".</P>
      <P>According to the president, the postal company name change is completely
justified and responsible. He also said the change also conveys "high praise for
the country's high-quality mail system" that has served well the Taiwan people
over the past 120 years.</P>
      <P>Chen said the previous authoritarian  government assumed a negative attitude
toward all things Taiwanese, including the dialect, culture and artistry due to
its own rigidly "Chinese supremacy" mindset and consciousness. This animosity
led the past government to prohibiting private groups from using "Taiwan" in
their titles.</P>
      <P>Gone are those dark days, Chen said, adding that Taiwan has democratized  and
all local people should be freed from such unreasonable restrictions and
courageously embrace the beautiful name of their homeland. "We should no longer
hesitate to call our country Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan Post Co. will issue the first set of "Taiwan stamps" Feb. 28
featuring the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum in their design. The issuance will be
the first carrying the mark "Taiwan stamp" following the company's name change
from "Chunghwa Post Co." to "Taiwan Post Co." This set will be a tribute to
Taiwan's century of struggle for freedom, democracy, human rights and peace,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same event, Premier Su Tseng-chang described the government's
name change campaign as a "justifiable move" to "recover the historical truth"
and he gave his assurance that postal workers' and customers' rights and
interests will not be affected by the change.</P>

the government has decided to preserve 'chung' -- which means China -- in its

believes that the inclusion of "Taiwan" in the company's new English title will
bring even more business opportunity to "CPC Corp. Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Renamed state-owned petroleum and shipbuilding companies will retain the rights
to their current trademarks, the two companies said Monday.</P>
      <P>The company formerly known as the Chinese Petroleum Corp. became "CPC
Corporation, Taiwan" after the company's board meeting Friday, and the China
Shipbuilding Corp. is set to change its name to "CSBS Corporation, Taiwan" in
March, with their respective abbreviations CPC and CSBS remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The CPC also said that it will retain its well-established trademark torch,
which is displayed high above every CPC gas station.</P>
      <P>It also filed a pre-registration enquiry with the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) seeking the right to use its original name; the move allows it to set up
a new company under that name within six months, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Even if the CPC or the CSBS stops using its original name or trademark after the
changes takes effect, the government will not --over the next few years --
register identical or similar marks proposed by other parties because the CPC
and CSBS marks are well-known and receive special protection under the Trademark
Act, the Intellectual Property Office said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POSTAL CO. REDESIGNATION REFLECTS MAINSTREAM OPINION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
02/13/07  10:41:06
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that renaming the state-owned postal
company to include "Taiwan" in its title complies with prevailing mainstream
public opinion, which favors promotion of Taiwan's distinct national identity.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while giving a speech at a plaque-unveiling ceremony to
mark the redesignation of Chunghwa Post Co. -- Chunghwa means China -- to Taiwan
Post Co. as part of the government's ongoing name rectification  campaign  to
prevent  Taiwan's  state-owned enterprises  from being confused with similarly
named Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the name change campaign has inevitably met criticism,
misunderstanding, opposition and obstruction, Chen said the government should
nonetheless  be adamant,  determined and responsible in doing what it thinks is
right for the nation.</P>
      <P>If the government pulls out all the stops to fulfill "mission impossible", Chen
said he believes the campaign will eventually win public support and
recognition. He called for widespread public backing in future endeavors,
including pushing to have the country join international organizations --
including the United Nations -- under the name "Taiwan".</P>
      <P>According to the president, the postal company name change is completely
justified and responsible. He also said the change also conveys "high praise for
the country's high-quality mail system" that has served well the Taiwan people
over the past 120 years.</P>
      <P>Chen said the previous authoritarian  government assumed a negative attitude
toward all things Taiwanese, including the dialect, culture and artistry due to
its own rigidly "Chinese supremacy" mindset and consciousness. This animosity
led the past government to prohibiting private groups from using "Taiwan" in
their titles.</P>
      <P>Gone are those dark days, Chen said, adding that Taiwan has democratized  and
all local people should be freed from such unreasonable restrictions and
courageously embrace the beautiful name of their homeland. "We should no longer
hesitate to call our country Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan Post Co. will issue the first set of "Taiwan stamps" Feb. 28
featuring the Taipei 228 Memorial Museum in their design. The issuance will be
the first carrying the mark "Taiwan stamp" following the company's name change
from "Chunghwa Post Co." to "Taiwan Post Co." This set will be a tribute to
Taiwan's century of struggle for freedom, democracy, human rights and peace,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same event, Premier Su Tseng-chang described the government's
name change campaign as a "justifiable move" to "recover the historical truth"
and he gave his assurance that postal workers' and customers' rights and
interests will not be affected by the change.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAME RECTIFICATION 'A MATTER OF COURSE': MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
02/13/07  12:18:14
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Monday that Taiwan's
ongoing name rectification campaign to remove any references to China from the
names of its state-owned enterprises is a matter of course following the
country's democratization.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a meeting with a German Bundestag delegation, the country's top
China policy planner pointed out that many of Taiwan's stated-owned companies
and institutions have kept the words "China" or "Chinese" in their names, which
he said has often caused confusion in the international community.</P>
      <P>Noting  that the practice  dates  back to the period  of authoritarian rule by
the Kuomintang (KMT) , Wu said the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration is obligated to tackle the legacies of that era, such as renaming
state-owned companies by including the word "Taiwan" to make them more
identifiable with their country of origin.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the name change campaign has met criticism and sparked heated
debate in local society and even drawn a "no support" comment from Washington,
Wu said the campaign is a matter of course now that Taiwan has become a
democracy and must address issues remaining from the period of authoritarian
rule.</P>
      <P>Wu further said many of Taiwan's national symbols are legacies of the previous
one-party state era. For instance, Taiwan's national emblem is the KMT's party
emblem, and its national anthem is the KMT's party anthem, he noted.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is a democratic country and the KMT is no longer its ruling party,
Wu said, the people of Taiwan are entitled to freely discuss whether its
national symbols should be changed.</P>
      <P>Wu also pointed to the national titles of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
saying that the close resemblance between the two has caused problems for both
sides. Wu recalled a faux pas made by the master of a welcoming ceremony for
Chinese President Hu Jintao during his visit to the United States last year when
he announced the playing of the national anthem of "the Republic of China" --
Taiwan's national title -- instead of "the People's Republic of China" --
China's official name.</P>
      <P>A similar gaffe happened recently in Grenada, with the Caribbean nation's
marching band playing the national anthem of "the Republic of China" instead of
that of the "People's Republic of China" during the inaugural ceremony of a
China-funded stadium in the country.</P>
      <P>To help the international community better understand that the "Republic of
China" refers to democratic Taiwan, not authoritarian China, Wu said, the
government has arranged for Taiwan's embassies to have the word "Taiwan" added
in parenthesis to their names. He said progress has also been made in
negotiations with countries with which Taiwan  does  not maintain  diplomatic
relations  for similar arrangements for Taiwan's representative offices in those
countries.</P>
      <P>No matter how these issues are discussed or addressed, Wu said, the government's
policy is crystal clear, namely that "so long as China has no intention of using
force against Taiwan, Taiwan will not change its official title nor its anthem."</P>
      <P>"This has been our commitment to the international community since 2000, " Wu
said, adding that the government's current name rectification campaign will by
no means touch on Taiwan's official title.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu took the opportunity to voice his protest over China's
customary addressing of Taiwan as "China, Taipei, " "China, Taiwan, " or "Taiwan
Province of the People's Republic of China" on international occasions.</P>
      <P>While China repeatedly threatens war if Taiwan takes steps to formalize its de
facto independence, including changing its official title, it arbitrarily
changes Taiwan's national title all the time, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Equally disheartening and unfair to democratic Taiwan is that the international
community has consistently kept mum over China's arbitrary change of Taiwan's
official designation, he lamented.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RENAMING STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES DOES NOT CHANGE STATUS QUO: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's recent move to rename state-owned enterprises is an internal
matter which does not involve changes to the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Asserting that any country has the right to change the names of its state-owned
enterprises, MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said during a regular press briefing
that the scenario that the United States is worried about has not occurred.</P>
      <P>Since the U.S. State Department released a written statement to express its
concern over the issue last week, Taiwan has not received any further messages
from the United States either through formal or informal channels, Wang said,
adding that communication between Taiwan and the United States remains smooth.</P>
      <P>In the statement issued last Friday, the State Department said the United States
does not support administrative steps by Taiwan that would appear to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally or move toward independence, including changes in
terminology for entities administered by the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>Also, the State Department called on President Chen Shui-bian to fulfill  his
"four noes" commitments,  namely  not to declare independence, not to change
Taiwan's national title, not to push for inclusion of sovereignty themes in the
Constitution, and not to promote a referendum to change the status quo regarding
independence or unification.</P>
      <P>The statement was issued in response to Taiwan's recent moves to rectify the
names of state-owned enterprises that contain references to China.</P>
      <P>While Chinese Petroleum Corp. has changed its name to "CPC Corp., Taiwan, "
Chunghwa Post Co. has changed its name to "Taiwan Post Co," and China
Shipbuilding Corp. has decided to change its name to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet claims the name rectification campaign will help avoid confusion
resulting from Taiwan-based organizations carrying similar names to
organizations in China.</P>
      <P>President Chen said last week that similar changes will also be made to the
names of the country's  overseas  embassies  and representative offices in the
future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 34-year-old man was diagnosed as having rubella, or German measles, in mid-
January after developing high fever and rashes, the Department of Health (DOH)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease Control, said that
the man has become the first rubella case in Taiwan this year. Staff at the
center were worried that he might pass the disease on to pregnant women, but
fortunately, this has not taken place.</P>
      <P>Shih said the man has never received vaccination against rubella, measles or the
mumps.</P>
      <P>Rubella has yet to be rooted out in Taiwan, Shih said, adding that the man
probably was infected through breathing in the flying particles of the saliva or
the phlegm of a sick person.</P>
      <P>He said that rubella is an illness caused by a virus. Adult men will be immune
from the disease for the rest of their lives after being infected, but they are
likely to pass the disease on to women, he continued.</P>
      <P>If pregnant women are infected, this might result in a poor birth outcome, such
as stillbirth, premature delivery, or birth defects.</P>
      <P>Shih said that there were three indigenous and three imported German measles
cases in Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>The center received 23 confirmed cases of German measles over the past five
years, with most of the patients being middle-aged or old people, Shih said. The
youngest female was only two years old, while the youngest male was 16. The
children were infected mainly because they did not receive their shots before
traveling with their parents abroad, he added.</P>
      <P>The government has inoculated children under 15 months old against measles,
rubella and the mumps since 1992. It also gave shots to primary school students
and female junior high school students between 1992 and 1994, Shih said.</P>
      <P>This means that everyone under the age of 28 has received vaccinations against
measles and the mumps, he said, adding that women over the age of 28 should get
shots against measles and rubella at least one month before a planned pregnancy.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has readied itself to cope with all sorts
of possible scenarios in case Chairman Ma Ying-jeou is indicted over
embezzlement charges related to his special municipal fund during his term as
mayor of Taipei, KMT spokesman Su Chun-pin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Whether or not Ma is indicted, the KMT will deal with the situation according to
an established set of mechanisms, Su said.</P>
      <P>Although Ma has been viewed as the KMT's most likely candidate to run in the
2008 presidential election, Su made it clear that Ma will offer to resign from
the party's top post if he is indicted over his alleged misuse of special
municipal  funds allocated  for his discretionary use while serving as Taipei
mayor from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Su gave assurances that Ma, as a responsible politician, will "definitely" live
up to his promise by stepping down from KMT chairmanship if indicted, consistent
with his efforts to help raise Taiwan's moral standards.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the KMT needs to be fully united in the face of the
unprecedented situation and called for calm among supporters.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the KMT said that the party's powerful Central Standing
Committee will call an emergency meeting later in the day to discuss measures to
deal with the latest development.</P>

      <P>Tai wan has obtained permission from the governments of Chile and Australia to
export Taiwan-grown mangoes and lychees to the two countries this year,
officials of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
under the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The bureau signed with Chilean authorities a working plan last year on
quarantine measures regarding Taiwan's mango shipments to Chile as well as an
agreement on Taiwan mango exports to the South American country. Since the
importing country has ratified the working plan and agreement, COA officials
said, Taiwan can start shipping the fruit to the country this year.</P>
      <P>In Australia, relevant authorities have also recently ratified similar
agreements, allowing Taiwan to begin exporting mangoes to the country this year,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Under the quarantine regulations,  mangoes have to undergo heat-steaming before
they are transported to the two countries, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Before the first batch of mangoes are shipped, the COA will invite Chilean and
Australian officials in charge of quarantine affairs to visit the island to
inspect the steaming and relevant operations, the officials said.</P>

      <P>There will be greater supplies of fruits, vegetables and flowers available in
domestic markets during the five-day period in the lead up to the Chinese New

      <P>Compared with average levels, an increase of 46 percent will be seen in
vegetable supplies during this period, while there will be a 53 percent greater
supply of fruits, and 137 percent more flowers, the officials assessed, noting
that the AFA has asked farmers to increase supplies to meet an expected increase
in demand before the week-long Chinese New Year holiday that will begin on New

      <P>Chinese New Year's Day, which falls on Feb. 18 this year, is one of the most
important festivals in Taiwan, with many families preparing traditional feasts
for the festival. Owing to the fact that wholesale markets for agricultural

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has adopted various measures aimed at enhancing
the learning efficiency and adaptability of school children with a foreign-born
parent, whose numbers are rising in the country owing to the increase in the
number of mixed marriages, a ministry official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>These  measures  include  priority  enrollment  in  public kindergartens for
these children and providing them with after-school care  and  guidance,
according  to  Yang  Chang-yu,  deputy director-general  of the  ministry's
Department  of Elementary Education.</P>
      <P>While a total of 6,363 children with a foreign-born parent are enrolled in
public kindergartens for the 2006-2007 academic year, 19,943 have joined the
after-school programs, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang said the results of a study show that although the performance of children
with a foreign-born parent is not as good as that of other children when they
first enter school because of their weaker Chinese language ability and their
lower socio-economic status, these children gradually catch up as they advance
to higher grades.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking steps to help the children improve their academic
performance, the ministry is also encouraging schools to hold activities, such
as a cultural week and an international week, to allow children from families
with two Taiwan parents to learn about different cultures, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that children from mixed marriages deserve just as much respect as
other children, he said the cultural activities will allow students to
appreciate cultural diversity and enhance cultural exchanges and assimilation.</P>
      <P>A report released by the ministry last month said that as the fertility rate
among foreign spouses has been increasing, an average of one in every eight
newborns in Taiwan has a foreign-born parent.</P>
      <P>The number of elementary and junior high school students with a foreign-born
parent has also jumped 1.8-fold over the past four years, from 30,040 in the
2003-2004 academic year to more than 80,000 in the 2006-2007 academic year,

      <P>Grand justices began a two-day exploratory session Tuesday on President  Chen
Shui-bian's  request for a constitutional interpretation aimed at suspending
trial currently dealing with the high-profile "state affairs fund" case in which
the first lady is one of the defendants.</P>
      <P>Five professors -- Lee Hui-tsung, Hsu Cheng-jung, Chang Tai-lin, Chen Tsung-wen
and Yang Yun-hua -- who specialize in German and French law, were invited to
participate, Fan Kuang-chun, secretary general of the Judicial Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Fan said the grand justices have taken into consideration the academic
specialties,  personal willingness to contribute,  and availability of scholars
as they collect more information on the relevant issues.</P>
      <P>"The exploratory session does not mean that the grand justices have reached any
decisions. There is no cause for speculation, " he stressed.</P>
      <P>Two items on the agenda of the exploratory session were the criminal immunity of
the president and the state secret privilege enjoyed by the president.</P>
      <P>On the president's immunity, the discussion focused on the nature and content of
the immunity as stipulated in the Article 52 of the Constitution,  and compared
this with related articles in the constitutions or other relevant laws of the
United States, France and Germany.</P>
      <P>On the president's state secret privilege,  the discussion centered on which
similar privileges in the United States, France and Germany might be used by the
grand justices in deciding whether or not to accept the request for a
constitutional interpretation.</P>
      <P>The first day session began at 9 a.m. and closed at 12:30 p.m. It was presided
over by Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng. Each of the five scholars was
given 20 minutes to express his views, then the grand justices and the scholars
engaged in a question-and-answer session.</P>
      <P>The five scholars wouldn't share much information following the closed-door
session. Professional Hsu said only that they did not discuss the injunction,
and mainly provided opinions on foreign laws with which they are familiar.</P>
      <P>In the second day session Wednesday, scholars specializing in American
constitution will be present. The Judicial Yuan also presented written briefs on
the definition of state secret privilege in Japan, Austria and Australia.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai filed the
interpretation request with the Council of Grand Justices (CGI) Jan. 25 on
behalf of President Chen in the hope of clarifying the constitutionality of the
court proceedings on the "state affairs fund" case.</P>
      <P>Cho also filed an injunction petition asking the Judicial Yuan to order the
Taipei District Court to immediately stop the trial and repeal its previous
ruling on opening supposedly "secret" files relating to the case.</P>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-jen, along with three former and incumbent senior aides at the
Presidential Office, is being tried at the Taipei District Court after she and
President Chen were named by a public prosecutor as "joint perpetrators" in an
embezzlement case involving the alleged misuse of the president's discretionary
"state affairs fund."</P>
      <P>In a lengthy document submitted to the CGJ Jan. 25, the Presidential Office said
the interpretation request is aimed at defending the constitutional status of
the presidency, maintaining the  democratic  system  and protecting  the
sanctity  of the constitution.</P>
      <P>Since the president  is protected  by Article  52 of the Constitution, it has
been argued that the court cannot ask the president to testify during the
investigation process and court hearing; nor, it is argued, can the court order
him to surrender secret documents or even hear the case as, according to Article
52, the president enjoys immunity to litigation other than treason and sedition
and cannot be prosecuted until his term expires, the statement added.</P>
      <P>The petition further states that the Taipei District Court infringed on the
president's executive privilege and risked leaking state secrets by opening
secret files relating to the "state affairs fund" case.</P>
      <P>Chen has denied any wrongdoing with regards to the special "state affairs fund"
and claims that he has not lined his pockets with monies from the fund. He has
promised to resign if his wife is found guilty in the first trial.</P>

      <P>An immigration official confirmed Monday that a preliminary hearing will be held
in San Pedro, California Tuesday morning to review the case of whether Taiwan
fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng will have to leave the country.</P>
      <P>Wang, founder of the Rebar Group, was placed on Taiwan's most wanted list on
Jan. 15 for suspected embezzlement of large amounts of capital from the group
before fleeing with his wife to China and then on to the United States at the
turn of this year.</P>
      <P>Wang's hearing will be held at the immigration holding center in San Pedro,
where he has been detained since Feb. 2 for entering the country without valid
travel documents.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities have actively been seeking to have Wang and his wife
repatriated back to Taiwan to face the charges against them.</P>
      <P>As Tuesday morning's hearing is preliminary to any possible immigration
procedure regarding Wang's case, its result is not likely to present any final
resolution on whether the fugitive tycoon will be sent back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang has hired several top immigration lawyers to represent him in the case.</P>
      <P>According to an anonymous Los-Angeles based immigration lawyer, Wang will
probably ask to be released on bail during the hearing, a request which is
likely to be turned down.</P>
      <P>"Unless there is some unexpected twist in events, Wang is destined to spend the
Chinese New Year Day at the immigration holding cell," the lawyer said.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is planning to organize a commission
following the Chinese New Year holiday to discuss the feasibility of raising the
minimum wage, which has remained constant since 1998, CLA officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The current minimum wage, which came into effect Oct. 16, 1997, is NT$15,840
(US$478.55) per month, NT$528 per day, or NT$66 per hour.</P>
      <P>The CLA decision to convene meetings of the "basic wage fixing commission" by
the end of May follows demands from laborer groups who have not seen an
adjustment in the minimum wage in over nine years, the officials explained.</P>
      <P>A proposal concerning basic wage adjustment must be endorsed by the commission,
which would then submit the proposal to the Executive Yuan for ratification,
according to the CLA.</P>
      <P>The CLA must be very cautious in considering such an adjustment to the basic
wage because the basic salary is associated with various social benefits
including labor insurance, national health insurance, and the wages of foreign
workers and social relief. Such an adjustment might also affect local
enterprises and the general economic development of the country, the CLA said,
noting that so far it has not yet come up with a likely range for such an
adjustment.</P>

      <P>A proposal by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to review the minimum wage ran
into opposition from the chairman of a major think tank Tuesday on the grounds
that such policy would do more to harm disadvantaged workers.</P>
      <P>The government's move would raise the minimum wage above the value of some
workers' labor, thus discouraging employers from hiring and push some factories
to leave, Chen Po-chih, an economist and Chairman of Taiwan Thinktank, said in a
telephone interview with the CNA. The think tank is seen to be close to the
Democratic Progressive Party government.</P>
      <P>In the end, it is the disadvantaged workers that will be hurt, Chen said.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairman Lee Ying-yuan said a day earlier that the council is to convene a

minimum wage, which has remained unchanged at NT$15,840 (US$481) per month for

wage, but the decisions on whether to adjust it and by how much will be made by
a CLA committee.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih said that the CLA's position is understandable, but his point is
made from a global economic perspective and is aimed at protecting poor and
unemployed laborers.</P>

affairs.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, the two parties have made intensive efforts to strengthen
bilateral ties during the last year, including the organization of two economic
forums and a meeting on the interests of Taiwanese businessmen with operations
in China.</P>
      <P>In those meetings, the two parties have reached a consensus on many issues and
are implementing some of the agreements, Lien said, adding that these measures
have won the support of many Taiwanese people and businessmen with operations in
China.</P>
      <P>However,  Lien expressed regret that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has been trying to mislead the public by offering misinformation
regarding  China's good-will  gestures, including a decision to offer tariff-
free treatment to some of Taiwan's fruit exports.</P>
      <P>Noting that although Taiwan's agricultural produce has entered China and proven
popular on that market, Lien said Taiwan's fruit exporters still can not expand
their market share in China due to the high cost of transportation between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>Lien suggested that KMT continue making efforts to resolve the problems of
Taiwan people and seek the maximum benefits for people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou announced his bid for the
presidency in 2008 and his resignation from his party post Tuesday, hours after
a prosecutor indicted him for stealing NT$11 million (US$332,684) from a special
allowance fund during his term as Taipei city mayor.</P>
      <P>Claiming innocence, Ma said he used the special allowance at issue according to
the law and that he refused to accept the corruption charges.</P>
      <P>The stern-faced KMT chief said he would step down from his post as KMT chief as
he had promised and would fight to clear his name through the judicial system,
which he described as a struggle not only for him but also for thousands of
active and former senior government officials who also spend their special
allowances in the same way as him and therefore may face the same charges.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the ruling party is going out of its way to bash him, Ma vowed not
to be knocked down.</P>
      <P>Rather, he said, he will appeal to the people to clear his image by entering the
2008 presidential race and vindicating his integrity "via voter support" in the
election.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of Ma's indictment and ensuing stepdown, KMT Secretary-General
Wu Den-yih had said a day earlier that the party's first vice chairman, Wu Poh-
hsung, will take over as acting KMT chairman and will call for the election of a
new chairman within three months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTIBIOTICS FOUND EFFECTIVE IN SOME HIGH-GRADE MALTOMA CASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)

      <P>High-grade gastric mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) can be
cured with antibiotic therapy before it spreads, according to a recent study by
the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and National Health Research
Institute.</P>
      <P>The results were released to local press Monday, after The Journal of Pathology
published the findings in its January issue.</P>
      <P>Spokesman for the team, Cheng Ann-lii who is also the deputy director of NTUH's
Department of Oncology said that up till now, patients with helicobacter pylori-
related low-grade gastric MALToma were treated with antibiotics, while high-
grade MALToma patients, whether the tumor had spread or not, have had no other
choice but undergoing generalized chemotherapy for at least six months.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng said, following the study, which extended over a two-year period,
they concluded that 50 to 70 percent of patients with high-grade MALToma could
be cured by a simpler, less-painful antibiotic therapy before signs of spreading
appeared.</P>
      <P>Cheng called the beginning of the research a "pure coincidence." He related that
a 49-year-old female Taiwanese scholar was diagnosed with high-grade MALToma in
the United States about a decade ago. Refusing the course of chemotherapy
recommended  by the U.S. physician, she turned to NTUH to find alternative
treatments.</P>
      <P>Afterward, the scholar was given a period of antibiotic therapy. Her gastric
ulcer and tumor were gone after six weeks and her stomach returned to normal
after 16 months. She has had no relapse since, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The case inspired the NTHU team to undertake further study, he said. The team
then conducted a clinical experiment with 34 patients with low-grade cases and
24 patients with high-grade cases, and the results showed that 97 percent of
low-grade patients, and 92 percent of high-grade patients were cured. Moreover,
only one-eighth of the low-grade patients experienced a relapsed, whereas none
of those with high-grade afflictions did.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Cheng said, follow-up experiments produced less satisfying
results, which prompted them to investigate further into the crux of the problem
and improve the effectiveness of the therapy. Currently, the cure rate has
stabilized at between 50 and 70 percent.</P>
      <P>In a recent project, the team has found two biomarkers -- BCL10 and NF-kB --
that can spot the pathogen of MALTome -- TNF-alpha. If the inflammation caused
by TNF-alpha can be stopped, the cure rate is be even higher, Cheng said.</P>

      <P>Chiayi county's "Taiwan Tangerines" (citrus-ponkans) are proving to be very
popular in Singapore, with more than 300 tonnes exported to Singapore in the
past month alone, a county government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The county's Agriculture Bureau Chief Hsu Ling-sung said that export of
tangerines helped to correct for an over-abundance of produce in the domestic
market and that the "Great Luck" tangerine sets, packaged with a miniature
spring couplet on each tangerine, have become hot-selling gifts in Singapore in
the run-up to the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>With the Tropic of Cancer running through it, Chiayi county is an ideal place to
grow a variety  of fruits including  tropical pineapples, bananas, papayas,
guavas, mangos, as well as temperate tangerines, oranges, and pears, Hsu said,
adding that tangerine orchards in the county cover more than 2,300 hectares and
produce over 33,000 tonnes of fruit.</P>
      <P>County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen encouraged the bureau two years ago to export
tropical fruits to temperate countries like Japan, China, Canada and South
Korea, and temperate fruits to tropical countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, and
Southeast Asian countries. Hsu said the marketing strategy has proved to be
successful.</P>
      <P>County government's marketing strategy has helped to create export channels for
the county's high quality tangerines, Hsu said, pointing out that with Singapore
importing more than 300 tonnes of Taiwan's tangerines in only one month, on
average, every group of 20 people in Singapore has collectively consumed one
creatively packaged set of "Great Luck" tangerines.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was indicted Tuesday on
charges of embezzling from a special allowance fund designated for his
discretionary use while he served as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption  center  under  the Taiwan  High Court Prosecutor's Office
formally indicted Ma Ying-jeou on charges that he embezzled NT$11.17 million
(US$337,650) from the mayoral special allowance during his two mayoral terms.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen said in the indictment that Ma received NT$10.23 million
in special allowances during his first term from December 1998 to December 2003.</P>
      <P>However, the expenditure records of Ma's bank accounts show that he spent only
NT$3.49 million of that amount but did not return the unspent portion -- NT$6.74
million -- to the national coffers, Hou continued.</P>
      <P>From January 2004 to July 2006, Ma used NT$630,000 of the NT$5.06 million fund
and kept the remaining NT$4.43 million in his account.</P>
      <P>Hou contended that the unspent money during his two terms, totaling  NT$11.7
million, should  be considered  "gain  from embezzlement."</P>
      <P>Hou rejected an interpretation by the Ministry of Justice last November that
special allowance funds for executives of government departments are actually
meant as salary subsidies.</P>
      <P>"The view raised by the Ministry of Justice alone is not shared by others and
contradicts the rules and regulations set by the Cabinet and the Ministry of
Finance governing the use of special allowance funds," Hou said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out further that Ma had acknowledged when he was first summoned for
questioning last year that the special allowance fund was not part of his salary
and should have been spent completely on office-related affairs.</P>
      <P>Although taking note of the fact that Ma and his wife donated tens of millions
of dollars to charitable organizations during his mayoral terms, Hou argued that
those donations came mostly from Ma's unspent election campaign funds rather
from his special allowance funds.</P>
      <P>All executives  holding public office are given a special allowance fund every
month. Although the money is left up to the administrative chief's discretion,
half of the fund can be spent without any proof of spending, while use of the
other half must be substantiated with receipts.</P>
      <P>Hou began his investigation into Ma's alleged misuse of fund in August last year
after Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni complained that Ma had channeled money from the
fund into his private bank accounts.</P>
      <P>Ma contended on a TV show a week earlier that he had no intention of breaking
the law because he considered the fund set aside for his discretionary use as
"private money," as it is regarded by every other recipient of similar funds in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He argued that if he is found guilty, then the same fate will befall  almost all
government  executives, including  political heavyweights of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and everyone who has ever served as a mayor or
county magistrate.</P>

      <P>The indictment against opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman and former Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou does not mean he is guilty, a spokesman for the opposition
People First Party (PFP) pointed out Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun made the remarks after the Taiwan High Prosecutor's Office
indicted Ma on embezzlement charges. He also expressed hope that the court will
deal with the case swiftly and that the case will not affect the year-end
legislative election or the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>If the KMT asks for the PFP's cooperation regarding the two major elections, the
PFP -- the KMT's political ally -- will give a hand under the newly formed KMT-
PFP alliance, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Ma, who used to be regarded as a political "Mr. Clean, " was charged with lining
his pockets during his eight-year mayoral term that ended at the end of 2006
with NT$11 million (US$332,684) from a special fund set aside for the mayor's
discretionary use.</P>
      <P>One of Ma's aides, Yu Wen, who allegedly used others' invoices to help Ma claim
reimbursements from the fund, was also indicted for embezzling NT$760,000 from
the fund.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP to stick together
through the challenge.</P>
      <P>Mentioning the alleged involvement of President Chen Shui-bian, his wife Wu Chu-
jen and several of his aides, in a state affairs fund embezzlement scandal, Lee
claimed they are more suspicious than Ma of involvement.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged the judicial authorities to launch investigations into Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank Hsieh, all of who also had
special funds during their services as administrators of local governments.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that it will be regrettable for the whole
world if Taiwan becomes a global quarantine loophole should it continue to be

      <P>Chen made the remarks at a meeting with Lord Howell of Guildford, deputy leader
of Britain's Conservative Party in the House of Lords, in which the president
also expressed gratitude to Howell for his long-term support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to Howell's support, the British House of Commons released a pro-
Taiwan report in August last year suggesting that the government help Taiwan
join the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the decision-making body of the WHO --
as an observer and increase its political interaction with Taiwan, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>On the global anti-avian flu efforts, Chen said Taiwan has been making great
efforts in this regard, including the organization of three high-level anti-bird
flu meetings during the last two years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of the few countries that put anti-bird flu work on the level of
national security. It is still free from bird flu, Chen noted.</P>

peace and have close exchanges in trade, education, tourism and culture, Chen
expressed hope that the two countries can establish closer cooperation ties in
sanitation, quarantine and health care.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that some of the treasures of the British Museum are being exhibited

additional NT$1.8 billion (US$54.38 million) to help the Central Taiwan Science
Park complete an access road at an early date to link the industrial complex
with the public road system.</P>
      <P>Su gave the assurance during an inspection tour of the park that the funds will

that industrial companies setting up shop in the park can enjoy convenient
transportation.</P>
      <P>At a briefing for the premier, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said construction of the
access road has lagged behind schedule because the original budget from the
central and local governments was insufficient to meet the extra costs arising
from the widening of the road from an originally designed width of 30 meters to
60 meters.</P>
      <P>He said the 3-km road linking the science park with the No. 1 Freeway and the
Taichung-Changhua Expressway carries a price tag of NT$4.67 billion, of which
NT$2.2 billion came from Taichung City and NT$400 million from Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Although the Cabinet has earmarked NT$100 million for the project, there is
still a shortfall of NT$1.8 billion, Hu said, adding that insufficient funding
could delay the completion of the road from the end of 2008 to 2013 and have an
adverse impact on the operations of the science park as well as the development

      <P>"He kept patching up lies with other lies during the criminal investigation,
causing turmoil in society; he provoked partisan conflict in the legislature
during his chairmanship, failing all the bills crucial to people's lives," Ker

      <P>Hsieh Hsin-ni, the DPP legislator who originally made the corruption allegations
against Ma,  claimed the indictment has "proved" that the accusations against Ma
and evidence unfavorable to him in the case were not political manipulations, as
the KMT claimed.</P>
      <P>You Ching, a DPP at-large legislator, complained that the indictment should have

the special fund as personal property rather than spending it on official

1998 to 2006, received a total of NT$15.29 million (US$461,934) in a mayoral
special allowance fund designated for his discretionary use and failed to return

Chen said it is also important that the system serves as a reminder for the
public and the government to reflect upon the problems faced by people when
dealing with the judicial system.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment two-and-a-half years ago, the foundation has set up 20
branches around Taiwan and has handled a total of nearly 25,000 cases.</P>
      <P>However, the president pointed out that the foundation is not large enough to
provide help for more people in need and he promised to provide more resources

      <P>He also expressed hope that the foundation can further improve the public's
understanding of the law in addition to providing lawyers to represent them.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has drafted plans to
make Taiwan world-class in the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) industry, a
government spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the technology industry describes the rapidly developing RFID
technology as "the second IT revolution." Hardware and software factories have
invested heavily in RFID technology research and development and advanced
countries regard it as a new power in industrial development.</P>
      <P>RFID can be used in the fields of mobile business, global logistics, national
security, transportation, operations management, and medical care. Deployment of
RFID in wholesale, convenience, and department stores can also reduce inventory
inaccuracies.</P>
      <P>In addition, RFID helps to control product distribution chains from loading and
transportation, to the retail level. The Kaohsiung Customs Office and Port of
Kaohsiung replaced manual escorts on products in logistics with RFID, a move
that has reduced escort waiting time by 6,200 hours.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that according to ABI Research statistics, RFID's
market scale will reach US$22.3 billion by 2011, while the Asia-Pacific market's
rapid growth will surpass the American market in 2010 to account for half of the
global output.</P>
      <P>The CEPD has completed a blueprint for RFID applications from 2006-2013 and is
now promoting the deployment of RFID in the country's free trade port zones for
better operation efficiency, the spokesman added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKERS FIRM ON CHAIRMAN RUNNING IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE</HEADLINE>

02/13/07  21:29:29

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers voiced their keen support Tuesday for
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's participation in the 2008 presidential election,
saying that Ma must not pull out of the race despite his indictment on
embezzlement charges earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former mayor of Taipei who ended his eight-year mayoral term last
December, was indicted on embezzlement charges over his alleged mishandling of
special municipal funds earmarked for his discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Ma was charged with lining his pockets with NT$11 million (US$332,684) from a
special allowance fund for the mayor's discretionary use that required no
invoices or receipts upon which to claim reimbursement, while Yu Wen, a
municipal government clerk, was also indicted for graft and document forgery for
allegedly using others' invoices to claim reimbursements from the special
municipal fund.</P>
      <P>Describing Ma's indictment as a "politically charged move, " KMT lawmaker Lai
Shyh-bao said that Ma must take part in the next presidential election
regardless of the indictment, claiming that the public strongly believes in his
"clean name."</P>
      <P>Lai questioned why investigations into similar charges against heavyweights in
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , such as Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh and former Premier and
incumbent DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, as well as Judicial Yuan President Weng
Yueh-sheng and National Security Council Chairman Tan Sun Chen, have not even
started.</P>
      <P>"The prosecution's  singling out Ma is just a politically motivated move," he
claimed.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu asked the prosecution to come out with a timetable
for beginning probes into the DPP figures and called for calm and unity within
the KMT at this very critical time.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker  Kuo Su-chun ascribed  Ma's indictment  to a long-existing flawed
government system that can be used as a pretext to set someone up and claimed
that it is "extremely unfair" to solely indict Ma.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Shuai Hua-ming insisted that Ma has to stay in the race for the
sake of the overall national interest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Hung-chun, spokesman for the opposition People First Party (PFP)
, a KMT ally, told the KMT that December's legislative elections and the 2008
presidential elections must not be hobbled due to Ma's indictment.</P>
      <P>Lee called for speedy follow-up trials and a conclusion of Ma's case as quickly
as possible. He offered to collaborate with the KMT through their cooperation
mechanisms in order to secure victory in the coming elections.</P>
      <P>"Ma's indictment does not mean he is guilty, " Lee pointed out, calling for
judicial justice through due legal process and warning that the opposition "pan-
blue alliance" cannot afford to have another split.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP lawmakers demanded that Ma weigh his next move, apologize to the
public and conduct self-reflection now that he has been indicted.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference in the Legislative Yuan, DPP Legislator Lin Shu-
fen insisted that Ma must judge himself by the same standard with which he
judged President Chen Shui-bian's wife and son-in-law, who were indicted on
charges of embezzlement and insider trading, respectively, last year.</P>
      <P>Investigation results show that Ma lied Nov. 15 last year when he claimed he did
not embezzle from the special municipal allowance, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Ma immediately offered to resign from the KMT chairmanship following
his indictment -- a promise he made before his indictment. The party's Central
Standing Committee is slated to call an emergency meeting to deal with the
drastic development.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday he believes in opposition

charges of embezzling from a special allowance fund while serving as Taipei
mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>"I also have confidence in the nation's judicial system," Wang said when asked
to comment on Ma's indictment.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is a seen as a presidential hopeful and major rival to Ma in the KMT's
primary for the 2008 presidential election, also said that he respects Ma's
resignation from his post as KMT chairman, as well as his decision to join the
presidential race.</P>
      <P>Wang indicated last weekend that he would not rule out the possibility of taking
part in the KMT presidential primary.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption  center  under  the Taiwan  High Court Prosecutor's Office

from the mayoral special allowance during his two mayoral terms.</P>
      <P>Shortly afterwards, Ma professed his innocence at a press conference and claimed
that he had used the special allowance fund according to the law.</P>
      <P>Ma announced his resignation from the KMT chairmanship but vowed that he will
appeal to the people to clear his image by entering the 2008 presidential race
and vindicating his integrity "via voter support" in the election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Hsin-nan, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday, upon hearing about the indictment of
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman and former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, that
the problem of possible "institutional traps" should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Lu was responding to queries from the press during a visit to a Taipei
community. She claimed to be "surprised" to hear about the indictment.</P>
      <P>"Some have fiercely attacked President Chen-Shui-bian over his state affairs

whether there are some 'institutional traps'".</P>
      <P>She said there should not be joy over Ma's indictment, for its impact can be

      <P>According to the indictment, during his two consecutive terms as Taipei mayor
from 1998 to 2006 Ma received a total of NT$15.29 million (US$461,934) in
special allowance funds designated for the mayor's discretionary use and failed
to return the unspent NT$11.17 million kept in his account.</P>
      <P>Ma has pointed out that his treatment of the fund is in line with the way such
funds are treated by every high-ranking public official across party lines.</P>
      <P>Sympathizers of Chen have also described the special state affairs fund case, in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Investigations into suspected special allowance fund misuse involving many
government executives will get underway soon, a spokesman for the anti-
corruption center under the Taiwan High Prosecutor's Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou was indicted earlier in the day on charges of embezzling  from a
special  mayoral  fund designated  for his discretionary use while he served as
Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen began his investigation into
Ma's alleged misuse of fund last August after Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni
complained that Ma had channeled money from the fund into his private bank
accounts.</P>
      <P>Under the existing budgetary system, all executives holding public office are
given a special allowance fund every month. Although the money is left up to the
administrative  chief's discretion, half of the fund can be spent without any
proof of spending, while use of the other half must be substantiated with
receipts.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption center has also received similar accusations against Vice
President Annette Lu, Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng, Premier Su Tseng-
chang, and other heavyweights of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The High Prosecutor's Office spokesman said the anti-corruption center will
begin to investigate those cases in the near future now that probes into Ma's
case has been concluded.</P>
      <P>Ma was charged with embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from the mayoral
special allowance fund during his two mayoral terms. Ma claimed innocence and
argued that if he is found guilty, then the same fate will befall almost all
government executives, including almost all prominent DPP heavyweights.</P>
      <P>The indictment dealt a blow to Harvard-educated Ma, but he denied the charges
and announced he would run for president next year. "I want to face the people
and prove my innocence, " he said in a televised speech. "Ma Ying-jeou won't be
knocked down."</P>
      <P>However, Ma announced that he would step down as KMT chairman in line with a
promise he has made repeatedly over the past several weeks.</P>
      <P>The KMT's decision-making Central Standing Committee rejected his resignation.
It remains uncertain when Ma's resignation will take effect.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the KMT committee  passed a resolution  at an extraordinary meeting
Tuesday evening to revoke a party regulation that requires suspension of
membership rights of any KMT member who is indicted on criminal charges. The
removal of the regulation is part of the committee's efforts to retain Ma as
party chairman.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ma's indictment, Vice President Lu reminded her DPP colleagues to
refrain from harboring the feelings of schadenfreude over Ma's predicament or
the KMT's misfortune.</P>
      <P>"All DPP politicians should instead reflect upon themselves and brace themselves
up for new challenges ahead, " Lu said, adding she believes that Ma's indictment
would have significant ramifications on domestic poltiical development.</P>

restraints or by war, famine, or disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who commanded three
major voyages of "discovery," charting and "naming" many islands in the Pacific
Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in Hawaii.

known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of their hegemony, the
Japanese invaders of northern China installed the Manchukuo regime in 1932. This

extension of Japanese aggression.

1939: The German battleship Bismarck is launched.

1950: The Chinese communist regime and the Soviet Union sign the "Sino-Soviet
Friendly Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty" in Moscow.

1956: Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev denounces the policies of Joseph Stalin

served 18 months in prison for his role in the Watergate cover-up.

2000: President Lee Teng-hui confers the Order of the Brilliant Star with Grand
Cordon on Cor Boonstra, president of Royal Philips Electronics, in recognition
of his company's contribution to Taiwan's economic development.

2000: Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian says
that he will visit Beijing and invite mainland Chinese leaders to visit Taipei
if he wins the March 18 election.

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday, upon hearing about the indictment of
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman and former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, that
the problem of possible "institutional traps" should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Lu was responding to queries from the press during a visit to a Taipei
community. She claimed to be "surprised" to hear about the indictment.</P>
      <P>"Some have fiercely attacked President Chen-Shui-bian over his state affairs
fund case, " Lu said, adding that "now it's time for more contemplation on
whether there are some 'institutional traps'".</P>
      <P>She said there should not be joy over Ma's indictment, for its impact can be
profound.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, during his two consecutive terms as Taipei mayor
from 1998 to 2006 Ma received a total of NT$15.29 million (US$461,934) in
special allowance funds designated for the mayor's discretionary use and failed
to return the unspent NT$11.17 million kept in his account.</P>
      <P>Ma has pointed out that his treatment of the fund is in line with the way such
funds are treated by every high-ranking public official across party lines.</P>
      <P>Sympathizers of Chen have also described the special state affairs fund case, in
which the first lady is on trial on corruption charges, as an incident caused by
the lack of laws that clearly define the way such money should be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Lu refused to comment further on Ma's case, saying she had not read the
indictment.</P>

      <P>Investigations into suspected special allowance fund misuse involving many
government executives will get underway soon, a spokesman for the anti-
corruption center under the Taiwan High Prosecutor's Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou was indicted earlier in the day on charges of embezzling  from a
special  mayoral  fund designated  for his discretionary use while he served as
Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, prosecutor Hou Kuan-jen began his investigation into
Ma's alleged misuse of fund last August after Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni
complained that Ma had channeled money from the fund into his private bank
accounts.</P>
      <P>Under the existing budgetary system, all executives holding public office are
given a special allowance fund every month. Although the money is left up to the
administrative  chief's discretion, half of the fund can be spent without any
proof of spending, while use of the other half must be substantiated with
receipts.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption center has also received similar accusations against Vice
President Annette Lu, Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng, Premier Su Tseng-
chang, and other heavyweights of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The High Prosecutor's Office spokesman said the anti-corruption center will
begin to investigate those cases in the near future now that probes into Ma's
case has been concluded.</P>
      <P>Ma was charged with embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from the mayoral
special allowance fund during his two mayoral terms. Ma claimed innocence and
argued that if he is found guilty, then the same fate will befall almost all
government executives, including almost all prominent DPP heavyweights.</P>
      <P>The indictment dealt a blow to Harvard-educated Ma, but he denied the charges
and announced he would run for president next year. "I want to face the people
and prove my innocence, " he said in a televised speech. "Ma Ying-jeou won't be
knocked down."</P>
      <P>However, Ma announced that he would step down as KMT chairman in line with a
promise he has made repeatedly over the past several weeks.</P>
      <P>The KMT's decision-making Central Standing Committee rejected his resignation.
It remains uncertain when Ma's resignation will take effect.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the KMT committee  passed a resolution  at an extraordinary meeting
Tuesday evening to revoke a party regulation that requires suspension of
membership rights of any KMT member who is indicted on criminal charges. The
removal of the regulation is part of the committee's efforts to retain Ma as
party chairman.</P>
      <P>Responding to Ma's indictment, Vice President Lu reminded her DPP colleagues to
refrain from harboring the feelings of schadenfreude over Ma's predicament or
the KMT's misfortune.</P>
      <P>"All DPP politicians should instead reflect upon themselves and brace themselves
up for new challenges ahead, " Lu said, adding she believes that Ma's indictment
would have significant ramifications on domestic poltiical development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAME CHANGE NOT TO AFFECT VALIDITY OF STAMPS: TAIWAN POST CO.</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The change of the name on stamps issued by Taiwan Post Co. will not affect the
stamps' validity, a spokesman for the state-owned company said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after a postal expert with the Berne-based
Universal Postal Union (UPU) said a day earlier that individual UPU member
countries can ask to invalidate new stamps to be issued by the newly renamed
Taiwan Post Co.</P>
      <P>The state-owned postal company formally changed its name from Chunghwa Post Co.
-- "Chunghwa" means China-- to Taiwan Post Co. Monday, and it plans to issue the
first set of stamps marked "Taiwan" Feb. 28, featuring the Taipei 228 Memorial
Museum as the theme in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the 228
Incident.</P>
      <P>The stamps will be the first to carry the Chinese characters for "Taiwan stamp"
instead of the words "Republic of China stamp."</P>
      <P>According to the UPU expert, UPU member countries are entitled to void the new
"Taiwan stamp" in line with Article 8 of the UPU Convention regarding the name
on stamps.</P>
      <P>If any individual UPU member state informs the UPU Secretariat of its decision
to invalidate the new "Taiwan stamp, " the expert said, the UPU Secretariat is
obliged to deliver the message to all other member states. It's up to individual
UPU member states to decide whether to follow suit, the expert said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the UPU expert's remarks, the Taiwan Post spokesman said such a
scenario is not expected to happen given the company's longstanding good
cooperative ties with various UPU member countries.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has not been a UPU member since 1972, it has consistently
followed international norms and UPU regulations, the spokesman  said,  adding
that the bilateral postal cooperation agreements the company has signed with
various UPU member states are valid for good.</P>
      <P>"Following our company's redesignation, we need just to exchange notes with
various UPU member countries and our bilateral postal cooperative contracts will
continue to be valid and binding, " the spokesman explained.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, stamps prepared with the words "Republic of China"
will continue to be printed in the first quarter of this year, with "Republic of
China" stamps to stop being issued in April at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Unveiling the "Taiwan Post Co." plaque at the postal company headquarters
Monday, President Chen Shui-bian said the name change is "a belated move to
serve Taiwanese justice by dumping the outdated 'Great China' ideology."</P>
      <P>"Although we have practiced democracy for 20 years, " Chen said, "many people
still have martial law in their hearts, and they refuse to use the beautiful
name of Taiwan to address ourselves and our country."</P>
      <P>Noting that the history of the postal company dates back to 1888 when the Qing
Dynasty established a Taiwan Post Bureau, Chen said the redesignation also marks
the restoration of the name and history of the postal service.</P>
      <P>"Since Taiwan is already a democratic country, we Taiwanese should recognize
ourselves and value our culture as well as our name," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEARING ON REBAR FOUNDER'S CASE NOT OPEN TO PUBLIC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A preliminary hearing on Taiwan fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng's illegal entry
into the United States was held as a closed-door session in San Pedro,
California Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The judge ruled that the hearing, which began at 8 a.m. at an immigration court
in the immigration holding center in San Pedro, was not open to the public at
the request of Wang's attorneys, shutting out a large group of Taiwan media
members waiting there to cover the event.</P>
      <P>The hearing ended two-and-a-half  hours later,  but Wang's attorneys declined to
make any comment regarding the case despite inquiries by the media.</P>
      <P>The next hearing on the case reportedly is scheduled for March 6 or 7, but U.S.
justice officials would not confirm the information.</P>
      <P>Wang, founder of the Rebar Asia Pacific Group, has been detained by U.S.
immigration authorities since Feb. 2, when he tried to return to Los Angeles
with both his Republic of China and Dominican Republic passports canceled,
following a failed attempt to flee to Myanmar via Singapore.</P>
      <P>According to Yang Ling, a former U.S. immigration official who is now working as
an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, Wang could have petitioned for political
asylum through his lawyers, which was the reason why the hearing on his case was
allowed to be held as a closed-door session.</P>
      <P>However, Yang said that such a petition by Wang would have slim chance of
success as Taiwan is not defined by the United States as a country where
citizens suffer political persecution.</P>
      <P>Even if Wang makes up a story to try to justify his petition for political
asylum, U.S. immigration authorities will judge whether Wang was actually being
persecuted or just making an excuse to evade facing trial in Taiwan for
allegedly breaking the law, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Wang is suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds
from the group before fleeing with his wife, Wang Chin She-ying, to China late
last year and then to the United States early this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities placed the couple on the country's most-wanted list Jan. 15
and are actively seeking U.S. assistance to have them repatriated back to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang said that Wang might be trying to use the political asylum petition to
extend his stay in the United States to facilitate his application for family-
based immigration, given the fact that his wife is a U.S. citizen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SCHOLAR DESCRIBES INDICTED KMT HEAD AS 'CLEVER STRATEGIST'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. scholar on Tuesday described Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of Taiwan's main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who was indicted on corruption charges the day
before and subsequently resigned from the position, as "a very clever
strategist" for announcing his bid to run for the presidency in 2008 almost
immediately after the indictment.</P>
      <P>June Teufel Dreyer, a China hand and a professor of political science at the
University of Miami at Coral Gables, said during an interview with the CNA that
"sadly, people in Taiwan are not shocked to hear that politicians are corrupt,
and in any case, the proceedings will probably drag on for so long that the
general public will lose interest."</P>
      <P>Describing Ma as a "very clever strategist, " Dreyer said that there is no doubt
Ma will be able to portray himself as a victim in this indictment and that he
has tried to maintain his innocence and vowed to clear his name by announcing
his bid for the presidency in 2008.</P>
      <P>She stressed that it is uncertain whether Ma's crisis has been solved by making
the announcement, noting that "one of the reasons is that Taiwan politics is so
unpredictable."</P>
      <P>"I wonder, however, if Ma's indictment will change many voters' minds," she
added.</P>
      <P>In related news, renowned U.S. China hand Alan D. Romberg said that a key to
Ma's political future is not so much his formal status in the KMT party as what
the public reaction is both to the indictment and to Ma's response.</P>
      <P>Romberg, a senior associate and director of East Asian studies at the Henry L.
Stimson Center, said that if the public takes the indictment -- without a
conviction -- as tarnishing Ma's image and therefore turn away from him, the
whole political situation in Taiwan will open up, both within the KMT and in the
"pan-blue, pan-green" competition.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, the public continues to view Ma as a man of integrity --
a standing that he obviously considers extremely important -- and continues to
support him, and, of course, if he is not found guilty, then he will continue to
have a good chance of winning the KMT nomination and perhaps the presidential
election, Romberg continued.</P>
      <P>Romberg said that in the wake of his indictment, Ma has taken two steps to try
to consolidate his political position. First, Ma followed through on his promise
to resign as KMT chairman, thus showing himself to be a man of his word. And
second, Ma has made clear that he will run for president, thus forestalling a
political vacuum within the KMT or an opportunity for the ruling Democratic
Progressive  Party to dominate the political  field while the "pan-blue" camp
struggles to find its moorings.</P>
      <P>He said the race for the presidency was always destined to be closer than
current public opinion  polls indicate,  and Ma's indictment adds even greater
uncertainty.</P>
      <P>If Ma is able to quickly clear himself -- and he undoubtedly will seek an early
trial to do just that -- then this uncertainty may also quickly pass. If, on the
other hand, it takes some time to bring the case to resolution, this will
undoubtedly handicap Ma in his quest for Taiwan's presidency and create new
ferment in Taiwan's political situation, Romberg commented.</P>
      <P>Romberg also predicted that if Ma were to be "fatally hurt" by the indictment
and related developments, this would seem to enhance the chances of a DPP
victory in 2008. While this does not mean that the cross-strait situation could
not improve -- clearly Beijing wants improvement and thinks some progress would
be possible with either Su Tseng-chang or Frank Hsieh as president --
nonetheless it would alter Beijing's perception about the likely pace and extent
of that improvement, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's mentor at Harvard Law School, Jerome A.
Cohen, described the indictment of Ma on charges of embezzlement the day before
as "stunning" and "surprising."</P>
      <P>On Ma's announcement of his bid for 2008 presidency, the U.S. authority on law
said if Ma feels he was wronged, he should try to prove his innocence. And if he
is clear of the charges, Cohen said there is no doubt that the opposition
Kuomintang chairman can run for the presidency.</P>
      <P>During an interview with the CNA, Cohen, who is currently a law professor at New
York University, described Ma as a person of honesty and uprightness. He said he
feels sympathetic and sad just as what he felt after the imprisonment of his
another Taiwanese student -- current Vice President Annette Lu -- in the 80s.</P>
      <P>Both Ma and Lu were Cohen's students at Harvard Law School. Returning home from
the United States in 1978, Lu joined in the pro-democracy movement in Taiwan.
However, because of a 20-minute public speech at a rally held to commemorate
Human Rights Day Dec. 10, 1979, she was subsequently sentenced to 12 years in
prison for sedition.</P>
      <P>Lu ended up spending five years and four months in jail before being given a
medical parole due to thyroid cancer.</P>
      <P>Asked about the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office's move to indict Ma for allegedly
embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from a special allowance fund during
his two mayoral terms, Cohen said he is not familiar with the case and expressed
that he does not want his remarks on the issue to be "misinterpreted" as support
for either the ruling "pan-green camp" or the opposition "pan-blue alliance" in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"People should give Taiwan's judicial system a chance,  " suggested the scholar,
who has been paying attention for a long time to Taiwan's democratic development
as well as human rights and judicial practices in China. He also noted that Ma's
indictment is a whole new judicial case and that the judicial system has been
facing greater  pressure  given  the increasing  level of inter-party
confrontation.</P>
      <P>The case could be an "interesting" challenge for Taiwan in its efforts to
develop democratic politics, Cohen said.</P>
      <P>Ma, who has portrayed himself as a political "Mr. Clean, " tendered his
resignation as KMT chairman and announced his bid to run for the presidency in
2008 just hours after he was indicted. He argued that if he is found guilty,
then the same fate will befall almost all government executives and everyone who
has ever served as a mayor or county magistrate.</P>

      <P>Taoyuan County-based Yuan Ze University has recently achieved a breakthrough in
the development of technologies for building unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for
commercial use, the director of a UAV development project at the university said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Chang-huei, an associate professor at Yuan Ze University's department of
mechanical engineering, indicated that through the UAV computer system his team
has developed, an unamanned vehicle can be made to automatically carry out
various surveillance missions simply by punching in the coordinates of the
appointed targets.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that unmanned aircraft have been widely used to carry out military
missions for many years, but it has only been in recent years that such vehicles
have started to be developed for civilian uses.</P>
      <P>In 2006, the Environmental Protection Administration contracted Yuan Ze to
develop a commercial UAV system capable of performing automatic flight by
following satellite navigation signals, he said.</P>
      <P>With cameras, a UAV can also transfer images from the sky back to the control
headquarters on the ground, Wu said, adding that the machine is useful for all
kinds surveillance missions, including monitoring pollution at sea and the
traffic situation on roads and highways. In addition, UAVs can be used for
rescue missions in difficult to reach locations, such as mountainous regions or
on the open seas.</P>
      <P>Citing an unoffical estimate, Wu said military-use UAV production is expected to
reach US$3 billion annually over the next five years, while civilian UAV
production is forecast to reach US$600 million per year in the same period.</P>
      <P>"The space for Taiwan to develop UAVs and relevant technologies is unlimited,"

      <P>A south-bound bullet train was delayed by 13 minutes Wednesday due to a switch
machine problem, Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) officials reported.</P>
      <P>The train, which departed from Banciao, in northern Taipei County for Zuoying,
in southern Kaohsiung City, came to a temporary halt at around 10: 30 a.m. after
passing Yunlin Station due to a failure in a switch machine, the THSR officials
said, adding that the train resumed its journey after switching to another rail.
It arrived at Zuoying Station 13 minutes late.</P>

      <P>Valentine's Day may not have been the most romantic time for most of Taiwan's
offices workers this year, with a recent survey showing that a vast majority of
these workers suffer from a sense of loneliness.</P>
      <P>The "loneliness index" survey, conducted by the Chinese-language monthly job-
tracking magazine Career between Jan. 17-26, found that 88.9 percent of office
workers in Taiwan suffer from a sense of loneliness.</P>
      <P>As to the reasons for their feelings of loneliness, "unchanging routine in life"
was mentioned most often, by 44.5 percent of respondents, followed by "not
having a boyfriend/girlfriend" by 38.3 percent of respondents, and "a lack of
sense of achievement at work" by 37.4 percent.</P>
      <P>A total of 49 percent of the office workers surveyed said they are still single,
with 61.4 percent of these respondents noting that Valentine's Day makes them
feel especially lonely, and 78.6 percent mentioning that they want to give up
the single's life.</P>
      <P>As to the kind of relationship they aspire to have, 58 percent of the single
respondents said they want a "loving relationship in which each partner has
their own personal space, " perhaps indicating that many young workers in Taiwan
have become accustomed to a carefree lifestyle.</P>
      <P>On ways to get rid of feelings of loneliness, "watching TV or seeing a movie"
was mentioned most often, by 59.3 percent of the respondents, followed by
"visiting an online chatroom" by 50.3 percent of the respondents, "listening to
music" by 46.1 percent, "reading a book" by 39.1 percent, and "going shopping"
by 32.6 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday that the government's  recent move of
changing the names of three state-owned enterprises shows that it is facing
history and the country honestly.</P>
      <P>Revealing that preparatory work for the name changes had been going on for six
months before being finalized Feb. 9, Su expressed satisfaction that the
information was not leaked beforehand, which he said helped avoid "unnecessary
troubles" that could have hampered the process.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during a weekly Cabinet meeting, when the Cabinet approved
draft amendments to the Postal Service Act and to a statute on the establishment
of the Chunghwa Post Co. The amendments became necessary after the company was
renamed "Taiwan Post Co."</P>
      <P>According to Su, the name "Taiwan Post" appeared as early as 1888 when postal
service was inaugurated in Taiwan during the Ching Dynasty, and changing the
name of Chunghwa Post Co. to "Taiwan Post Co." is only "a return to truth so
that the familiar name -- Taiwan -- can be spoken."</P>
      <P>As to Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC), Su pointed out that company was established
in 1946 in Shanghai and moved to Taiwan three years later.</P>
      <P>"With CPC having lived together with the people of Taiwan for the last 50 years,
renaming the company 'CPC Corp., Taiwan' has more clearly reflected its
history," Su said.</P>
      <P>Su said that the government has dealt with the name-change issue in a mild,
brave, honest and sincere manner and that it respects the opposing opinions
expressed by some people on the matter.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that the name changes will not undermine the rights and interests of
the workers and clients of the affected companies but will enhance the
companies' competitiveness and prominence, because they will no longer be
confused with companies carrying similar names in China, such as China National
Petroleum Corp. and China Petrochemical Corp.</P>
      <P>Also undergoing a renaming on Feb. 9 was China Shipbuilding Corp., which decided
to change its name to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh accused former opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou Wednesday of resorting to "populism" for announcing his bid to run
for the next presidency immediately being charged with corruption.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption  center  under  the Taiwan  High Court Prosecutor's Office
indicted Ma a day earlier on corruption charges after determining that he
embezzled NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from a special allowance fund designated
for his discretionary use during his two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to
2006.</P>
      <P>While resigning from the KMT chairmanship immediately after the indictment, Ma
claimed his innocence and announced his decision to run for the presidency in
2008 to prove his integrity "via voter support" in the election.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, who is a possible presidential candidate of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,  Ma's move is unfavorable to the
establishment of a fair judicial system, because the people do not review
relevant documents, question witnesses or see any evidence but only base their
judgment on their impressions.</P>
      <P>On expected judicial investigations into suspected misuse of special allowance
funds involving other government executives, which could implicate a number of
other important politicians, Hsieh said he believes there are no problems with
the way their special allowances were spent.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that he did not use fake receipts to claim reimbursement  from the
allowance and spent all the funds on office-related affairs.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that Ma is to be blamed for his own predicament, pointing out that

      <P>The government is to issue six regional licenses for broadband wireless access
(BWA) services in the first part of a two-phase licensing plan, the Executive
Yuan announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The licenses, scheduled to be issued at the end of June, include three each for
the northern and southern halves of the country, are valid for six years and can
be renewed only once, the Executive Yuan said, adding that the government is
expected to earn at least NT$1.26 billion (US$38.07 million) in license fees
over the first six years.</P>
      <P>According to an agenda drawn up by the Cabinet-level National Communications
Commission (NCC) , the government will hold a public hearing on the BWA
regulations draft in March, establish the regulations the same month, accept
business applications in April and May, and then complete application reviews
and bidding processes in June before giving out the licenses.</P>
      <P>The northern BWA service region will include Taipei city and county, Taoyuan
County, Hsinchu city and county, Miaoli County, Yilan County, Keelung City and
Matsu islands, while the other parts of the country go to the southern service
region, the NCC said.</P>
      <P>Each regional licensee will be allocated a bandwidth of 30 MHz within the
international standard spectrum range of 2.5 - 2.69 GHz, and regional operators
will be permitted to merge and convert their regional licenses into a nationwide
one, the NCC said.</P>
      <P>Two of the six licenses will be first reserved for new players that are not
running Type I Telecommunications Enterprise services and will apply the 802.16e
standard, unless no such company wins a bid, NCC officials said. The Type I
Telecommunications Enterprise is referred to businesses that provide
telecommunications services with its own connection facilities.</P>
      <P>Bidders that combine services and manufacturing industries will be better
evaluated  during the application  review procedure, according to the NCC.</P>
      <P>In the bidding process that follows, qualified bidders will compete with their
offers of annual license fees, defined by a percentage of their total annual
revenues. Minimums for the license fee are set at NT$20 million (US$ 604,318)
for the first year, NT$30 million for the second year and NT$40 million per year
from the third through the sixth year, the NCC said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan said in a news release that the issuance of three licenses
each in two regions will not only accommodate the current needs of the business
sector but will foster a healthy competitive environment, provide multiple
choices to consumers and allow consumers to enjoy high-quality
telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>The news release added that in the second phase of the project, at least one
additional nationwide license will be issued after June 2009, depending on the
progress of phase one mergers.</P>

      <P>China's Taiwan Affairs Office declined to comment Wednesday on former Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's indictment on charges of embezzling from a mayoral special
allowance fund betweem 1998 and 2006, saying only that its officials have noted
the development.</P>
      <P>Hours after the indictment Tuesday, Ma resigned from his post as chairman of
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and declared his intention to run for
president in the 2008 election.</P>
      <P>Li Weiyi, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, was asked whether Chinese
President Hu Jintao, who sent a congratulatory message to Ma when he was elected
KMT chairman in 2005, contacted the KMT about Ma's indictment, and what the
Chinese leadership would think if KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan were to be
made acting chairman.</P>
      <P>Li said that because none of the media speculation actually occurred, and
because the KMT had not made a decision yet, the Beijing government had no
comment.</P>
      <P>Asked about speculation that Beijing might change its strategy toward Taiwan by
no longer pinning its hopes on the KMT and beginning to develop a relationship
with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Li said Beijing welcomes DPP
members to visit China to increase mutual understanding as long as they
acknowledge Beijing's one-China principle and the so-called 1992 Consensus.</P>
      <P>The 1992 Consensus refers to an understanding the KMT claims was reached in Hong
Kong between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait that there is only one China,
but with both sides free to make their own interpretations of what "one China"
actually means.</P>
      <P>Li urged the DPP to remove its party plank seeking Taiwan independence in order
to open the gate to exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing welcomes rank-and-file DPP members wishing to visit China
because they are different from the "handful of diehards who champion Taiwan
independence."</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's resignation has become
effective and will be sent to the party's Central Standing Committee (CSC) for
reference during its Feb. 28 weekly meeting, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Ma remained firm on his promise to quit the KMT chairmanship
despite the CSC's efforts to persuade him to stay in the post after Ma was
indicted a day earlier on corruption charges over his alleged misuse of a
special municipal allowance earmarked for his discretionary use when he served
as mayor of Taipei from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Ma tendered his resignation and officially announced his bid to run in the 2008
presidential race following his indictment Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As Ma's resignation has taken effect, First Vice Chairman Wu Po-hsiung, in
accordance with the party's regulations, will serve as KMT acting chairman in
the coming three months until a new chairman is elected through a direct vote
among party members.</P>
      <P>In an effort to secure Ma's chance to take part in the next presidential
election, the powerful CSC rescinded Tuesday evening a special clause
implemented last July that bans indicted party members from participating in
elections, on the grounds that it goes against the party platform that prohibits
only convicted members from running for public office.</P>
      <P>According to Juan Kang-meng, director of the KMT's Evaluation and Discipline
Committee, the special clause has been removed and the party will only follow
its platform to screen KMT members' candidacy in coming elections.</P>
      <P>With the removal of the special clause, the KMT need not discuss the issue of
Ma's indictment and therefore, the question of whether or not Ma should be
suspended from participating in party activities does not exist, Juan said,
adding that such rights of other KMT cadres who violated the special clause will
be reinstated, including Hsinchu County Magistrate  Cheng Yung-chin  and
lawmaker Chang Chang-tsair.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP CLAIMS NO MISUSE IN HER SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FUND</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday that she "has faith" in her use of
special allowance fund amid reports that prosecutors will soon investigate
alleged fund misuse involving many high-ranking officials, including Lu.</P>
      <P>Lu claimed to have "no idea whatsoever" on how to handle the fund and said she
simply follows the instructions of her staff.</P>
      <P>"An executive will not dwell on trivialities," she claimed, adding that she "has
confidence in the use of the public fund."</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks came one day after prosecutors indicted former opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou on corruption charges, accusing him of
embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$338,500) from his special allowance fund during
his tenure as two-term Taipei mayor that ended December 2006. Ma has maintained
his innocence.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, when prosecutors indicted the first lady on corruption charges
over the alleged misuse of the state affairs fund at the discretionary use of
President Chen Shui-bian, the public reactions were in stark contrast with Ma's.</P>
      <P>"Society has a serious double standard and this is the biggest crisis of the
nation," she claimed.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Ma's case is largely similar to the president's 'state affairs
fund" case.</P>
      <P>If Ma is what Lu considered to be wronged by the prosecution, it is likely that
the first lady and others involved in the state affairs fund case have also been
wronged.</P>
      <P>While the state affairs fund case caused an uproar from the opposition camp, Lu
said, it seems that many on this occasion are taking a more lenient attitude
toward Ma.</P>
      <P>"We should calm down and reflect on whether there is an institutional defect in
the system," she said, adding that if necessary, actions should be taken to
amend any deficiencies in the system.</P>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-jen is accused of corruption in that she collected invoices
from others to claim NT$14.8 million from the state affairs fund use between
July 2002 and March 2006.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors allege that Ma remitted half of his special allowance fund, or NT$17
million per month into his account, knowing that it should be used for public
affairs but failing to return the unspent money to the national coffers.
Although Ma claims to have donated over NT$68 million over the years,  he did
not convince the prosecutors that the donations came from the special allowance
fund.</P>
      <P>The nation's 6,500 high-ranking officials who are also entitled to special
allowances, including Lu, the heads of the five branches of the government, city
and county chiefs as well as school principles, are allowed to claim
reimbursement from the fund in cash or check form or by direct bank account
remittance.</P>
      <P>Those who remit the funds into their bank accounts are the easiest to track down
compared with those who deal in cash or checks. There have also been conflicting
interpretations about whether the fund should be used for public affairs or
simply given as a subsidy to the executives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan agreed Wednesday to
help coordinate and bolster cooperation between two key KMT members in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a press release issued following a meeting with acting Chairman Wu
Po-hsiung and five KMT vice chairmen who suggested that Lien help coordinate the
presidential candidacy within the party, Lien promised to assist in the matter
and called for joint efforts to serve that end.</P>
      <P>"It may seem that the KMT is deeply mired in a crisis, but it also presents a
turning point in the party's transformation into victory," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Although Lien pledged to do his utmost to help forge cooperation between former
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng in forming
a ticket for the next presidential election, he said, however, that Ma's
announcement of his presidential bid in the coming  presidential  race has
"narrowed"  the space  for coordination.</P>
      <P>Ma delivered on his promise to resign from the KMT chairmanship Tuesday after
being indicted on corruption charges over his alleged mishandling of a special
municipal allowance when serving as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>In a special emergency meeting that evening, the KMT's Central Standing
Committee (CSC) returned Ma's resignation and rescinded a special clause that
bans indicted party members from running in elections with the aim of bailing
out Ma's participation in the 2008 presidential race as a KMT candidate.</P>
      <P>Warning the KMT against flow-on effects of the clause's removal, Lien asked Wu
to get Ma and Wang to sit down and talk as soon as possible, reiterating that
"unity is essential if the KMT wants to win in December's legislative election
and regain power in the 2008 presidential polls."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang failed to agree to have a tete-a-tete with Ma in the coming
days, despite Lien's hope for a meeting with the two men before the Feb. 18
Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>Instead, Wang urged the KMT to build a noble spirit to gain back widespread
public support.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will kick off its primaries for
the year-end legislative elections and the March 2008 presidential election
earlier than originally scheduled, officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee passed a proposal at its regular  weekly
meeting that day that all aspirants  for the presidential election must register
between March 5 and March 9. A party member vote for both the presidential and
legislative elections will be held May 6, which will account for 30 percent of
the primary.</P>
      <P>Public opinion polls for the presidential election will be held between May 7
and May 28, which will account for the remaining 70 percent. The party will
announce its candidate May 30.</P>
      <P>All hopefuls for the legislative elections should register with the party from
March 12-16 and public opinion polls will be held May 11-June 17 before the
candidates are announced June 20.</P>
      <P>The DPP said earlier  that the primary  system should be institutionalized based
on the three previous presidential elections, which would mean registration in
April, a member vote in May and public opinion polls in June.</P>
      <P>However, after President Chen Shui-bian intervened to sort out differences among
the four heavyweights and aspirants for the presidency -- Vice President Annette
Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and former Premier Frank
Hsieh -- a consensus was reached to bring the primary forward.</P>
      <P>"The moving ahead of the primary has nothing to do with the announcement of
former Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's bid for the presidential election," Yu
said.</P>
      <P>Ma resigned as the party head and announced his bid for the presidency after
being indicted for allegedly embezzling NT$11.17 million (US$338,500) from a
special allowance fund for his discretionary use during his tenure as two-term
Taipei mayor that ended December 2006. Ma has maintained his innocence.</P>

      <P>A pro-Taiwan independence group called for debate among the aspirants of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party for the 2008 presidential election in lieu
of coordination to produce the party's candidate.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Society said that coordination among the four DPP aspirants -- Vice
President Annette Lu, Premier Su Tseng-chang, former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun -- "might be convenient, but it shows no respect for the
people."</P>
      <P>"If a fair and reasonable set of game rules are followed, then those who fail to

      <P>Group members said that they are planning to co-sponsor with the media a public

their platforms and engage in cross-debate.</P>
      <P>Yu and Hsieh have expressed willingness to take part in such debate, while Lu

      <P>Chin Heng-wei, a society member and TV commentator, said that what really makes
the DPP win is the voters, claiming that the progress of democracy relies "on
the system, not the people."</P>
      <P>Chin claimed that the KMT currently only relies on one person, an oblique
allusion to the most likely presidential bet for the party, former KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Chin said that "the potential of the DPP is better than that of the KMT, because

      <P>Law enforcement agents seized 45 kg of heroin bricks from two Taiwanese fishing
boats Wednesday after intercepting the boats at sea two days ago.</P>
      <P>Agents from the Bureau of Investigation's Kaohsiung office arrested Hsu Tung-
sheng, owner of the two fishing boats -- Yu Fa 102 and Yu Fa No. 2 -- and three
accomplices: Hu Jui-chung, skipper of Yu Fa 102; chief engineer officer Chen
Shih-hsien; and crew member Chen Teh-liang.</P>
      <P>Altogether the agents found 106 heroin bricks, with an estimated street value of
NT$200 million (US$6.04 million), after the two boats were intercepted by anti-
smuggling ships and escorted to Anping harbor in Tainan.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) said the bureau's Kaohsiung
office received tip-offs from foreign sources last October that Hsu Tung-sheng
would attempt to smuggle heroin into Taiwan from Phuket Island, Thailand.</P>
      <P>A special task force was subsequently formed to monitor the activities of Hsu's
boats. BOI agents also received aid from anti-drug authorities  in Thailand and
the United States Drug Enforcement Administration to keep Hsu under surveillance
while he was in Thailand to contact his suppliers.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, as Yu Fa 102 sailed into waters approximately 190
nautical miles southwest of Taiwan, Hsu Tung-sheng instructed its skipper, Hsu
Hui-chung to phone Tungkang harbor's fishery radio station via satellite, and
claim that the boat was low on fuel and needed its sister boat, Yu Fa No. 2, to
bring a supply of fuel and meet it in the open sea.</P>
      <P>Actually, the spokesman explained, their real intention was to have the Yu Fa
No. 2 take possession of the heroin bricks in order to avoid police inspection.</P>
      <P>Two anti-smuggling ships dispatched to intercept Yu Fa 102 and Yu Fa No. 2 met
the two boats in waters southwest of Taiwan two days ago and escorted them to
Anping harbor. At that point, agents boarded the boats and seized the heroin
from where it was hidden among the fishing nets and gear.</P>

The Iraqi government on Tuesday ordered tens of thousands of Baghdad residents

challenging effort to reverse the tide of sectarian cleansing that has left the
capital bloodied and Balkanized.

In a televised speech, Lt. Gen. Aboud Qanbar, who is leading the new crackdown,
also announced the closing of Iraqs borders with Iran and Syria, an extension of
the curfew in Baghdad by an hour, and the setup of new checkpoints run by the
Defense and Interior Ministries, both of which General Qanbar said he now
controlled.

Wall Street Journal:Shifting Down In Humbling Overhaul,Chrysler Faces Big Cuts

With a painful restructuring slated for today, Chrysler becomes the last of the
Detroit Big Three to abandon hope of growing its way out of problems. Now it has
a humbler goal: making money.

DaimlerChrysler AG is set to announce that it plans to cut some 10,000 jobs and
close factories at its Chrysler Group unit in the U.S. The retrenchment by the
company that not long ago claimed to have risen above the problems plaguing
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. highlights the challenges unionized U.S.
auto makers face. It's also a setback for DaimlerChrysler chief Dieter Zetsche,
who got his job in large part because of his apparent success at turning around
Chrysler after a profit collapse in 2000.</TEXT>

      <P>Disaffected with a National Communications Commission (NCC) administrative
decision seen as unduly favoring a formerly Kuomintang-owned (KMT) radio
station, the Executive Yuan announced Wednesday that it will void the offending
decision.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will also form a team to investigate the possibility of
misconduct and negligence at the NCC,  Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said in
a news conference.</P>
      <P>The NCC's  moves  to make a deal with the Broadcasting Corporation of China
(BCC) , to repeal a previous governmental decision and disregard the Cabinet's
policy is a violation of due administrative procedure and ethics, and has done
serious harm to the prestige of the government, Minister  without Portfolio  Lin
Ferng-ching said.</P>
      <P>When the BCC in 2004 applied to renew its broadcasting license with the
Government Information Office (GIO), the GIO listed several conditions,
including one concerning proportioning of political ads by party on the BCC
during the presidential election period, and another that asked the KMT company
not to dispose of its ill-gotten real estate before the delivery of a verdict in
property litigation. The GIO also asked the BCC to return to government control
a number of frequencies.</P>
      <P>The BCC filed a lawsuit  against  the GIO and asked for compensation from the
state after an administrative appeal with the Executive Yuan was rejected. In
2006, the newly-founded NCC, which took over the GIO's supervisory  role
regarding the country's broadcasting companies -- and thus the lawsuit case --
reached a settlement with the BCC, and in early December voided the GIO's
previous stipulations.</P>
      <P>Later that month, former UFO Radio Chairman and former New Party politician Jaw
Shau-kong confirmed that he has bought the BCC.</P>
      <P>NCC Vice Chairman Shih Shih-hau reiterated Wednesday that the commission's moves
were justified, saying the conditions that the GIO imposed on the BCC were
irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Election  ads are the business  of the Central Election Commission, while the
property litigation was a civil case; neither has anything to do with the
renewal of a broadcasting license, Shih said, adding that the settlement has
averted scenarios in which the government may have needed to pay compensation.</P>
      <P>Lin Ferng-ching, however, said that the NCC should have gone to the Cabinet for
permission when seeking to reach a settlement, rather than arbitrarily deciding
to repeal previous stipulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HONORARY CHAIR TO HELP COORDINATE CHOICE OF 2008 PARTY CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) honorary Chairman Lien Chan will host a meeting
Friday to help arrive at a consensus among all aspirants contending to be the
party's candidate in the 2008 presidential election, party sources said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Early efforts to come to an agreement on the party's presidential ticket grew
urgent after former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou announced his presidential bid and
resigned as KMT chairman following his indictment on corruption charges Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lien said earlier in the day that Ma's hasty announcement of his presidential
bid may "narrow" the maneuvering room available in attempting to coordinate with
another party kingpin -- Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former mayor of Taipei, has been seen as the front-runner in the 2008
race. His indictment over the alleged misappropriation of public funds during
his mayoral term has dealt a serious blow to the KMT.</P>
      <P>Party sources now say the best hope for the party to win the 2008 presidential
election is for Ma to make peace with his bitter political rival.</P>
      <P>Ma beat Wang in a contest for the party's chairmanship election in 2005 by
painting his rival as corrupt, but Tuesday's charges have undermined Ma's once
formidable "Mr. Clean" image.</P>
      <P>Analysts said Wang resented the accusations, which may have stoked his interest
in opposing Ma in the KMT's presidential selection process, or perhaps even have
encouraged him to consider running as an independent in the presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Through KMT acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung's intensive contacts, Wang and Ma have
accepted Lien's invitation to a meeting at Lien's office Friday morning, party
sources said.</P>
      <P>But the sources said it remains unclear how Lien would push for Wang and Ma to

companies to remove Chinese reference and add the word "Taiwan" to their titles
to avoid confusions with similarly named Chinese counterparts has nothing to do
with changes of the country's official title.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO REVOKE NCC DECISION FAVORING EX-KMT BROADCASTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Disaffected with a National Communications Commission (NCC) administrative
decision seen as unduly favoring a formerly Kuomintang-owned (KMT) radio
station, the Executive Yuan announced Wednesday that it will void the offending
decision.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will also form a team to investigate the possibility of
misconduct and negligence at the NCC,  Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said in
a news conference.</P>
      <P>The NCC's  moves  to make a deal with the Broadcasting Corporation of China
(BCC) , to repeal a previous governmental decision and disregard the Cabinet's
policy is a violation of due administrative procedure and ethics, and has done
serious harm to the prestige of the government, Minister  without Portfolio  Lin
Ferng-ching said.</P>
      <P>When the BCC in 2004 applied to renew its broadcasting license with the
Government Information Office (GIO), the GIO listed several conditions,
including one concerning proportioning of political ads by party on the BCC
during the presidential election period, and another that asked the KMT company
not to dispose of its ill-gotten real estate before the delivery of a verdict in
property litigation. The GIO also asked the BCC to return to government control
a number of frequencies.</P>
      <P>The BCC filed a lawsuit  against  the GIO and asked for compensation from the
state after an administrative appeal with the Executive Yuan was rejected. In
2006, the newly-founded NCC, which took over the GIO's supervisory  role
regarding the country's broadcasting companies -- and thus the lawsuit case --
reached a settlement with the BCC, and in early December voided the GIO's
previous stipulations.</P>
      <P>Later that month, former UFO Radio Chairman and former New Party politician Jaw
Shau-kong confirmed that he has bought the BCC.</P>
      <P>NCC Vice Chairman Shih Shih-hau reiterated Wednesday that the commission's moves
were justified, saying the conditions that the GIO imposed on the BCC were
irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Election  ads are the business  of the Central Election Commission, while the
property litigation was a civil case; neither has anything to do with the
renewal of a broadcasting license, Shih said, adding that the settlement has
averted scenarios in which the government may have needed to pay compensation.</P>
      <P>Lin Ferng-ching, however, said that the NCC should have gone to the Cabinet for
permission when seeking to reach a settlement, rather than arbitrarily deciding
to repeal previous stipulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HONORARY CHAIR TO HELP COORDINATE CHOICE OF 2008 PARTY CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
02/15/07  11:03:15

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) honorary Chairman Lien Chan will host a meeting
Friday to help arrive at a consensus among all aspirants contending to be the
party's candidate in the 2008 presidential election, party sources said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Early efforts to come to an agreement on the party's presidential ticket grew
urgent after former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou announced his presidential bid and
resigned as KMT chairman following his indictment on corruption charges Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lien said earlier in the day that Ma's hasty announcement of his presidential
bid may "narrow" the maneuvering room available in attempting to coordinate with
another party kingpin -- Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former mayor of Taipei, has been seen as the front-runner in the 2008
race. His indictment over the alleged misappropriation of public funds during
his mayoral term has dealt a serious blow to the KMT.</P>
      <P>Party sources now say the best hope for the party to win the 2008 presidential
election is for Ma to make peace with his bitter political rival.</P>
      <P>Ma beat Wang in a contest for the party's chairmanship election in 2005 by
painting his rival as corrupt, but Tuesday's charges have undermined Ma's once
formidable "Mr. Clean" image.</P>
      <P>Analysts said Wang resented the accusations, which may have stoked his interest
in opposing Ma in the KMT's presidential selection process, or perhaps even have
encouraged him to consider running as an independent in the presidential poll.</P>
      <P>Through KMT acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung's intensive contacts, Wang and Ma have
accepted Lien's invitation to a meeting at Lien's office Friday morning, party
sources said.</P>
      <P>But the sources said it remains unclear how Lien would push for Wang and Ma to
team up -- forming a Wang-Ma ticket or a Ma-Wang ticket -- or to come to terms
on other options.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Wang has assumed a low profile since Ma's announcement
of his presidential bid. Wang said earlier in the day that he feels no rush to
announce his future plans. "I think I still have much time to review all
variables before coming to a decision," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>Sources close to Wang said joining the presidential race remains Wang's top
priority.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOG TRACEABILITY SYSTEM TO BE IN PLACE BY JUNE: CABINET SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  15  (CNA)
02/15/07  12:12:52
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A hog traceability system will be introduced by the end of June as part of the
government's efforts to prevent sick and dead hogs from being illegally
processed into edible pork products, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang gave the directive after a Council of Agriculture (COA)
official delivered a report on stepping up supervision of pork production to
ensure food sanitation at a weekly Cabinet meeting the day before, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the premier also ordered the COA to flesh out measures for
stricter control of sick and dead hogs, including encouraging hog farmers to
join a national hog insurance program to secure compensation in the event of the
death of their hogs.</P>
      <P>With consumers getting increasingly critical of food quality and hygiene,
Premier Su said relevant government agencies should initiate new measures and
new systems to streamline management of farm produce production and marketing.</P>
      <P>Su also said that a farm produce traceability system should be introduced and
promoted throughout the country, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Compared with other farm products, it should be easier to implement a
traceability system for hogs, Su said, adding that technical details for
implementing the system should be in place by the end of June.</P>
      <P>Su said that under the new system, each package of pork products should have a
label explaining where the hog was reared, as well as information about the farm
and the breed.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, Taiwan produces about 9 million hogs annually. To
strengthen management, Su said the hog insurance system should be expanded to
cover as many hogs as possible.</P>
      <P>The COA has come up with a plan to set up a special fund, with money provided by
hog farmers and relevant government agencies, to subsidize farmers in case their
insured hogs die. The subsidy may reach about 70 percent of the market price of
the dead hog.</P>
      <P>According to a COA plan, the current hog insurance program will be expanded to
cover up to 5.7 million hogs raised in 18 cities and counties around the island
by the end of this year. In the future, COA officials said, all of the hogs
raised in the country will be covered by the insurance program.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the premier asked law enforcement authorities to speed up
investigations into suspicious trade in sick and dead hogs and bring to justice
all those involved. Unscrupulous dealers should be harshly punished and fined,
while areas where relatively large quantities of suspicious pork products have
been uncovered should be listed for intensified monitoring and crackdown, Su
said.</P>
      <P>The issue of sick and dead hogs being sold on the market has drawn the public's
attention after substandard pork products were uncovered in certain southern
counties earlier this month. Key government agencies have reached an agreement
to list sick and dead hogs as waste subject to stringent regulation.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration is working on a set of rules to
better govern the disposal of sick and dead hogs. For its part, the COA will
coordinate with county and city governments to establish an orderly hog
production and sale system. And the Department of Health will step up its
crackdown on illegal pork processing plants, inspections on downstream pork
vendors and probes into the sources of suspicious  meat products used for human
consumption.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP LU HAS NO PLANS AT PRESENT TO JOIN DPP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday that she has no plans at present to take
part in the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party's (DPP's)  primary for the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lu dismissed as "groundless" a media report claiming that President Chen Shui-
bian has tried to dissuade her and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun from running for the
presidency in 2008 in an effort to "simplify" the presidential competition
within the DPP.</P>
      <P>"How could President Chen possibly have dissuaded me as I have never told him
that I want to join the race?" Lu asked.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Chen is trying to reduce the number of DPP contenders
to just two, namely former Premier Frank Hsieh and incumbent Premier Su Tseng-
chang, and has offered to arrange some other positions for Lu and Yu in exchange
for them agreeing not to run.</P>
      <P>Lu,  Yu, Hsieh and Su are widely seen as "the four DPP heavyweights" who are
likely to compete to represent the party in the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Asked about the same report Thursday, Yu denied any knowledge of the president's
reported efforts to dissuade him and Lu from joining the race.</P>
      <P>While expressing his support for efforts within the DPP to try to mediate among
the presidential aspirants, Yu, however, said such efforts, if excessive, might
create misunderstanding that the DPP is making some kind of under-the-counter
deals with the aspirants.</P>
      <P>Yu confirmed that President Chen has consulted with him about the possibility of
his taking over the premiership, but he stressed that the offer has nothing to
do with the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Yu said he has no intention of leaving his present position, because as the DPP
chairman, he can do a lot of things for the country, especially those related to
the country's development and future.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the report, Wang Shu-huei, a deputy whip of the DPP
legislative caucus, said that the DPP has a complete primary system to guide the
nomination of candidates for public offices and that it is unlikely the
president will try to dissuade anyone from running for the presidency when no
one has publicly announced their decision to join the race.</P>
      <P>According to a timetable for the presidential primary finalized by the DPP's
Central Standing Committee Wednesday, registration for the primary will be open
from March 5-9.</P>
      <P>A vote by party members is scheduled for May 6, while opinion polls on the
support ratings of the aspirants will be conducted from May 7-28. The outcome of
the primary is slated to be announced May 30.</P>

      <P>The number of traffic police will be doubled to maintain road safety and keep
traffic flowing during the Chinese New Year holidays as the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) forecasts a 40-percent increase in the
number of travelers using Taiwan's roadways during the holiday period, an
official of the Naitonal Police Agency (NPA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the NPA's transportation affairs department, a total of 10,241

scenic spots, main connecting roadways and major bottleneck spots on highways
around the island to keep traffic moving along during peak travel periods during
the holidays.</P>
      <P>The MOTC also announced that a special "traffic conditions hotline" will be set
up, with traffic police around the island reporting several times a day on the

      <P>Taiwan has not imported peanut butter from two U. S. brands that have been
linked to a recent salmonella outbreak in America, a Department of Health (DOH)
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A salmonella outbreak that has slowly grown to nearly 300 cases in 37 U.S.
states since last August has been linked to tainted jars of Peter Pan or Great
Value peanut butter -- both brands produced by the same ConAgra Foods company.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director of the DOH Bureau of Food Safety said that after
detailed examination it was found that Taiwan has not imported those brands of
peanut butter -- which has only been sold in the U.S. state of Georgia -- over
the past year.</P>
      <P>ConAgra Foods has reportedly begun to recall all Peter Pan and Great Value
peanut butter produced after May 2006, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH Center for Disease Control, said
salmonella infection is most commonly caused by uncooked chicken, followed by
infant formula.</P>
      <P>It is probably the first salmonella outbreak associated with peanut butter in
U.S. history since about 85 percent of the infected people said they ate peanut
butter, according to a report from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. About 20 percent of the people infected have been hospitalized,
although none have died.</P>
      <P>U.S. health officials said how salmonella got into the peanut butter is still
under investigation.</P>
      <P>Shih said the CDC has launched an investigation, via the Taiwan PulseNet, into
all imported food products and has found no suspicious cases of salmonella
contamination.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of salmonella can include diarrhea, fever, dehydration, abdominal pain
and vomiting, according to Shih.</P>

      <P>Su pointed out that Ma demanded that President Chen Shui-bian step down when Wu
was charged with corruption and forgery in November 2006 for alleged misuse of
the president's "state affairs fund, " a case in which Chen was named as a
"joint perpetrator" but not charged because he currently enjoys presidential
immunity from criminal prosecution.</P>
      <P>However, contrary to what Ma has demanded of Chen, Ma is now making a bid for
the presidency while facing similar charges, Su said.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption center of the Taiwan High Court Prosecutor's Office indicted
Ma Tuesday on corruption charges after determining that he embezzled NT$11.17
million (US$337,650) from a special allowance fund designated for his
discretionary use during his two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>While resigning from the KMT chairmanship immediately after the indictment, Ma
claimed that he is innocent and announced his decision to run for the presidency
in 2008 to prove his integrity "via voter support" in the election.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed he had no intention of breaking the law because he considered the
fund set aside for his discretionary use as "private money, " as it is regarded
by every other recipient of similar funds in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has no plan to mediate among the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) presidential aspirants before the registration
period for the party's primary ends, a Presidential Office official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Cho Jung-tai, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
it is impossible for the president to do anything before that date, because
there is no way to know who will be vying for the party's nomination until then.</P>
      <P>Cho said recent newspaper reports about President Chen trying to dissuade
certain aspirants from joining the race are based merely on speculation.</P>
      <P>A local daily reported Thursday that Chen has tried to dissuade Vice President
Annette Lu and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun from running for the presidency  in 2008
in an effort to "simplify"  the presidential competition within the DPP.</P>
      <P>It said Chen is trying to reduce the number of DPP contenders to just two,
namely former Premier Frank Hsieh and incumbent Premier Su Tseng-chang, and has
offered to arrange some other positions for Lu and Yu in exchange for them
agreeing not to run.</P>
      <P>Lu,  Yu, Hsieh and Su are widely seen as "the four DPP heavyweights" who are
likely to compete to represent the party in the next presidential election, but
none of them has publicly announced their decision to join the race.</P>
      <P>Both Lu and Yu have denied having discussed the issue with the president.</P>
      <P>According to a timetable for the presidential primary finalized by the DPP's
Central Standing Committee Wednesday, registration for the primary will be open
from March 5-9.</P>
      <P>A vote by party members is scheduled for May 6, while opinion polls on the
support ratings of the contenders will be conducted from May 7-28. The outcome
of the primary is slated to be announced May 30.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and four another party heavyweights
are to meet Friday in an effort to build a consensus and encourage cooperation
within the party prior to its presidential primaries, KMT Secretary-General Wu
Den-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Wu Den-yih said that Lien
is to call a meeting the next day with KMT Acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung,
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to
coordinate presidential candidacy within the party.</P>
      <P>Lien's Wednesday decision to mediate the issue came one day after Wu Po-hsiung,
leading five KMT vice chairmen, paid a visit to Lien to express their hope that
Lien, a respected figure in the party, could assist in coordinating the matter
before he leaves Taiwan Saturday to spend the Chinese New Year holiday overseas.</P>
      <P>Lien is expected to push Ma and Wang to form a single ticket, avoiding a KMT
split in the coming presidential polls.</P>
      <P>As to a media report that the two Wus have formed an alliance to help Ma outgun
Wang in seeking the KMT's nomination for the 2008 presidential race, Wu Den-yih
said that Wu Po-hsiung will lead the party in accordance with its regulations
after Ma stepped down as KMT chairman Tuesday over an indictment againsh him on
corruption charges earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Ma immediately  announced  his decision  to quit  the KMT chairmanship  and
officially made public his presidential  bid following the indictment over his
allegedly mishandling of a special municipal allowance allocated for his
discretionary use when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1996 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Ma's announcement of his intention to take part in the next presidential
election has placed Wang, who is also keenly interested in vying for the KMT's
nomination, in an awkward position.</P>
      <P>In a bid to secure Ma's right to participate in the party's presidential
primaries, the KMT's powerful Central Standing Committee removed a special
clause banning indicted members from running in elections during its weekly
meeting Wednesday, provoking criticism that it is a tailor-made measure to bail
out Ma.</P>
      <P>KMT-affiliated Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, who met Lien earlier Thursday, said
that Lien strongly believes that unity is the key to securing the party's
victory in the 2008 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Hau quoted Lien as saying that both Ma and Wang are valuable assets to the KMT
but that the two men need to cooperate to win the election.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, Lien contended that there absolutely is room for coordination
to work out a solution between Ma and Wang given the precondition that party
unity be maintained.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law, orthopedic surgeon Chao Chien-ming, will
serve at SinLau Hospital's Matou branch starting March 1, the hospital announced
Thursday at a news conference in Tainan County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>SinLau Hospital superintendent Chuang Ming-hsiung said at the news conference
that Chao hopes for a fresh start and that the board of directors of the
hospital only agreed to hire him after he vowed to serve "with a spirit of
voluntarism" by donating his entire salary to charity.</P>
      <P>Chuang said that Chao first talked with hospital officials on January 18 but
that he did not touch on the subject of serving at the hospital during that
talk. Later,  Rev. Kao Chun-ming, former president of the Presbyterian Church in
Taiwan,  served as a go-between, and the hospital learned of Chao's intention of
serving patients in remote areas.</P>
      <P>Rev. Kao said that when he first met with Chao, he was at his lowest point in
life because of the insider trading scandal.</P>
      <P>Kao said that as a Christian, he wanted to extend a helping hand to others. He
added that he was also deeply moved by Chao's aspiration to help people in need
in remote areas and therefore began actively working to help Chao achieve his
goal.</P>
      <P>Chuang said that Chao will donate his entire salary to charity, but the hospital
has yet to determine how much to pay him and what organization or organizations
the money should be given to.</P>
      <P>The superintendent denied that the government has offered him the post of
Department of Health minister in exchange for inviting Chao to work at the
hospital.</P>
      <P>Chuang said that he was once indeed interested in politics but that he has lost
"the zest for it" in recent years.</P>
      <P>The hospital has dealt directly with Chao concerning his request to work there,
and no one at the Presidential Office or in the first family has been involved
in the hiring, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Chao was not present at Thursday's news conference. Instead, a written statement
in which he expressed his appreciation to the hospital for allowing him to work
there was read at the news conference.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Chao also asked that he be allowed to carry out his work of
helping patients at the hospital without being hounded by members of the media.</P>
      <P>Chao recently resigned from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) , with
the resignation taking effect Wednesday. He was suspended from duty by the
hospital immediately after he was indicted in July 2006 on charges of insider
trading of Taiwan Development Corp. (TDC) stocks.</P>
      <P>NTUH voted down Chao's request to return to his job last October on the grounds
that he had "seriously violated medical ethics."</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court sentenced Chao to six years in prison and fined him
NT$30 million  (US$909,090)  in December  after determining that he had taken
advantage of his influence to obtain important information regarding TDC share
prices, based upon which he traded TDC shares for huge profits.</P>
      <P>Chao has appealed his case to the Taiwan High Court.</P>

      <P>A survey conducted by 1111 Manpower Bank, an online job search firm, shows that
over 80 percent of working men and women believe financial means are a
prerequisite for marriage, a spokesman for the manpower bank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Juei-ying, vice general manager and spokesman for 1111 Manpower Bank, said
that the online survey, conducted Jan. 30- Feb. 13, on working class attitudes
towards love and money, elicited 1,957 valid responses.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey show that 80.71 percent of working women would not
marry to those with poor financial resources, and 80.37 percent of working men
admit that they would not make a commitment to a girlfriend under similar
conditions.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that three ideal indications of financial ability that women look
for in men are a monthly income of NT$100,000 (US$ 3,043) --31.56 percent, home
ownership--25.80 percent, and NT$1 million in available funds--13.86 percent.</P>
      <P>Working  men ranked highest the following  three threshold conditions for
entering into marriage: available cash of NT$1 million--33.11 percent, stable
monthly income of NT$ 100,000--20.78 percent, and a car--16.89 percent.</P>
      <P>Overall, the three top ranked considerations when considering stepping out of a
love affair and into a marriage, for both unmarried men and women, are a stable
relationship (78.83 percent), financial ability (71.17 percent), and stable
employment (44.67 percent).</P>
      <P>Wu said only less than 20 percent of working people believe in love without
money.</P>

      <P>The supply of pork in the first half of this year should be more than adequate,
the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that the results of the latest census, which was conducted
last November, show that hog farmers could provide 4.78 million hogs in the
first half the year, indicating that there will be an ample supply of pork.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that there were 12,671 hog farmers at the end of last
November, down 2.3 percent from the same month in the previous year.</P>
      <P>The number of hogs totaled 7.09 million, down 1.4 percent year-on-year. On
average, each operation raised 560 hogs.</P>
      <P>The COA said that the survey showed that six counties south of Changhua are the
major areas to rear the hogs -- Pingtung County, Yunlin County, Changhua County,
Tainan County, Kaohsiung County and Chiayi County. The number of hogs raised in
the six counties account for 83.1 percent of national hog production.</P>
      <P>The COA said that the census also included black hogs whose meat is preferred
among local people. The census also showed that 90 percent of the hogs raised by
5,587 hog farmers, or 44.1 percent of all hog farmers, were black hogs.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed the number of black hogs is now 1.06 million, accounting
for 15 percent of the hogs around the island, and that operations raising black
hogs tend to work on a smaller scale.</P>
      <P>The census also queried hog farmers about their intentions to raise hogs in the
first part of the year, with the result showing that 85 percent of them said
that they would maintain their present level, 10 percent said that they are
willing to cut the number, and three percent said they are willing to increase
the number.</P>
      <P>The COA said that with the rise in the price of feed on the international market
the cost of raising hogs has also risen, suggesting that hog growers not to
increase the number of hogs, and should adopt a limited growth strategy to
maintain hog price and ensure profitability.</P>

02/15/07  19:55:55

    <TEXT>
      <P>Public opinion showed a rise in expressions of Taiwanese identity in the nation
in 2006, according to a report released Thursday by the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC).</P>
      <P>After analyzing all public surveys carried out in 2006 in Taiwan on issues
concerning cross-Taiwan Strait relations, MAC researchers come up with the
following four conclusions: the Taiwan people support the idea of promoting
cross-strait exchanges in the fields of trade and investment in a prudent
manner; public opinion reflects a growing Taiwanese identity; the Taiwan people
hope that Beijing will conduct negotiations and talks with the Taiwan
government; and the Taiwan people strongly agree that government should take
steps to expand Taiwan's role in the international community.</P>
      <P>The report was compiled by the MAC from the results of 49 public surveys
conducted by 15 different poll centers around the island.</P>
      <P>On questions concerning Taiwan independence or unification with China, all of
the surveys show that most respondents favor the idea of maintaining the status
quo, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>Most survey respondents oppose unification as described in Taiwan's now shelved
Guidelines for National Unification, as well as China's "one country, two
systems" policy, and believe that Taiwan's future should be decided by the
people of Taiwan, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-strait trade and investment, the MAC said the survey results
show that Taiwanese people do not believe the country has benefited from
Taiwanese investment in China and think the government should impose stricter
restrictions on investment in China.</P>
      <P>While most survey respondents  expressed  support  for the government' s "active
management, effective opening" policy regarding cross-strait trade and
investment, they also support the notion that the government should reinforce
its management of such exchanges, with national interests the guiding principle,
the MAC said.</P>
      <P>On the subject of cross-strait negotiations, the MAC said most of the
respondents believe Beijing's decision to make contact with Taiwan's private
sector but keep "open lines of communication" with the government will affect
the general interests of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC said the surveys show that the public do not agree with Beijing's
attempt to deny the existence of Taiwan's government and that opposition
political parties cannot take the place of the government  in dealing with
problems derived from cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Only through government-to-government channels can the national interests and
rights of Taiwan be properly secured, the MAC claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT MUST PAY DAMAGES FOR UNSUPPORTED CLAIM: COURT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei District Court ruled Thursday that President Chen Shui-bian must pay
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong NT$3 million (US$91,183)  in
damages and apologize in newspapers for his allegation that Soong met secretly
with China's State Council Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen Yunlin in 2005.</P>
      <P>The court said the president failed to carry out necessary verification before
making his allegation.</P>
      <P>"The president exercises overall control over the executive sector resources and
his responsibility to verify information must be weighted," a court spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Lee Hung-Chun called the judgment "comforting" but said it came
too late. "It took more than a year for the first judgment to come out," he
said, adding that this meant the public did not get the chance to learn the
truth during a time when the political situation was changing rapidly.</P>
      <P>Chen's counsel said he will appeal to the High Court.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed in an interview with a cable TV channel in May 2005 that Soong met
Chen Yunlin in the United States in February that year.</P>
      <P>Claiming that his remarks were based on "intelligence," Chen also said Soong
promised  during the meeting to oppose a proposed constitutional amendment that
would allow for popular referendums on future constitutional amendments, in
exchange for Beijing's approval for Soong to visit China.</P>
      <P>Soong filed a defamation suit against Chen in June 2005, demanding a symbolic
NT$1 in compensation and a published apology in four major local newspapers for
three consecutive days.</P>
      <P>After Chen repeated his claim in another TV interview in October that same year,
Soong extended his compensation demand to NT$50 million and asked Chen to
publish an apology in four internationally famous newspapers in the United
States, the United Kingdom, France and Japan, as well as in three local ones.</P>
      <P>According  to the written  judgment,  Chen said that  the intelligence about
Soong's activity was submitted to him by Bureau of Investigation Director-
General Yeh Cherng-maw. However, Yeh told the court that he had warned Chen that
the intelligence, some of which he admitted was drawn from media speculation,
was difficult to check.</P>
      <P>The judgment said that as president, Chen must have understood the weakness of
the information and could have ordered the national security system to conduct
further verification, but decided not to bother.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CARLYLE AGREES TO TERMINATE ASE BUYOUT EXCLUSIVE CLAUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
02/15/07  20:17:06
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Carlyle Group has agreed to terminate an exclusive clause that it
signed late last year with Taiwan's Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc.
(ASE) concerning Carlyle's proposed buyout, ASE officials announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>ASE announced that the exclusive clause -- signed by ASE Chairman Jason Chang
and the Carlyle Group management Nov. 16 -- along with agreements on buyout
costs and contract-breaching compensation, became null and void with immediate
effect.</P>
      <P>Noting that the termination complies with U.S. stock market regulations and
norms, the officials said the company sought the termination of the exclusive
clause aimed at protecting the interests of ASE investors from Taiwan and
abroad.</P>
      <P>The Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, offered in
early January to purchase ASE, the world's largest chip packaging and testing
company, for approximately US$5.5 billion, or NT$39 per share for ASE's entire
stocks, and make it private.</P>
      <P>ASE said it was not sure whether NT$39 per share is a reasonable price for the
buyout and that there are probably other companies willing to acquire ASE at a
higher price.</P>
      <P>The Carlyle Group's ASE acquisition case, however, is still being reviewed by an
assessment group headed by Cheng Tien-cheng, a member of the ASE board, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>So far, ASE is still uncertain as to whether the Carlyle Group will still be
interested in continuing the acquisition bid, they added.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, a non-profit association that groups companies
involved in business between Taiwan and the United States, said Feb. 1 in a news
release that the potential deal highlights the ability of Taiwan companies to
attract substantial foreign investments, greatly benefiting Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>It also underscores the attractiveness of Taiwan's semiconductor market, which
the council has predicted will become the world's largest market for chip
equipment spending and for DRAM production in 2007,  due largely to new
partnerships  and a number of new investments, the press statement said.</P>
      <P>Responding to the U.S. council's comments, a Ministry of Economic Affairs
official in charge of investment affairs said the buyout application is still in
the opinion-soliciting stage.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, the Carlyle Group's intention to
enter Taiwan's semiconductor market reflects the high caliber of Taiwan
businesses and a desire to link the U.S. and Taiwan -- arguably the two most
important semiconductor markets in the world.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Bush Declares Irans Arms Role in Iraq Is Certain

President Bush said Wednesday that he was certain that factions within the
Iranian government had supplied Shiite militants in Iraq with deadly roadside
bombs that had killed American troops. But he said he did not know whether Irans
highest officials had directed the attacks.

Mr. Bushs remarks amounted to his most specific accusation to date that Iran was
undermining security in Iraq. They appeared to be part of a concerted effort by
the White House to present a clearer, more direct case that Iran was supplying
the potent weapons X and to push back against criticism that the intelligence
used in reaching the conclusions was not credible.

Wall Street Journal:How a Chastened KPMG Got By Tax-Shelter Crisis

Timothy Flynn, a top executive at KPMG LLP, was driving to a nephew's graduation
in May 2005 when he got a phone call from the chairman: The firm faced imminent
criminal indictment over tax shelters it used to sell.

Then a different sort of shock. One week later, the chairman, Eugene O'Kelly,
learned he had a brain tumor that left him just months to live. Mr. Flynn, a
down-to-earth accountant who once led KPMG's human-resources department, was
suddenly thrust into its top job, where he faced an urgent task: to somehow
persuade the government not to indict. He knew that criminal charges against the
firm would probably kill it, as they did Arthur Andersen after the Enron
scandal.</TEXT>

      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) will spend four years promoting the
"Taiwan Life Aesthetics Movement" with a budget of NT$ 3.02 billion (US$ 91.9
million) from the central government, a spokesman for the CCA said Thursday.</P>
      <P>To increase the Taiwanese people's awareness of aesthetics and the environment,
the CCA solicited contributions from experts and scholars then drafted a plan
for the "Taiwan Life Aesthetics Movement, " which has since been referred to the
Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the plan has three main aspects: creating an
artistic environment, increasing public awareness of aesthetics, and nurturing
talents in the arts. The movement's goals include the reformation, promotion,
demonstration, and evaluation of art.</P>
      <P>The first aspect of the plan calls for an "artistic reformation of public space"
and an "aesthetics reformation of cultural arenas". The second includes a
"student museum" and general "life aesthetics promotion", while the third
envisions the creation of an "artistic promotional bank" and provision of local
"artistic creative resources."</P>
      <P>The CCA hopes to cultivate the Taiwanese people's aesthetic sensibilities and
create a robust environment in which the country's art will flourish, the

      <P>Taiwan's crude (unadjusted by age) death rate from suicide grew by 0.7 percent
or 4,000 people last year, marking the first decline in a decade in this regard,
the National Suicide Prevention Center (NSPC) under the Department of Health
(DOH) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Compared to the growth of 23 percent posted during the 2004-2005 period, the 0.7
percent growth figure posted in 2006 was massively relieved, said Hsu Ching-
hsin, a department chief of the DOH Bureau of Medical Affairs.</P>
      <P>The growth figure stood at 15 percent 10 years ago, according to tallies
compiled by the DOH.</P>
      <P>The country's crude death rate from suicide hit an all-time high of 18.8 per
100,000 people in 2005.</P>
      <P>According to DOH tallies, suicide was the ninth most frequent cause of death in
Taiwan in 2005, with crude mortality surpassing the previous record of 18.73
persons per 100,000 recorded in 1964.</P>
      <P>Since the NSPC was inaugurated in January 2005, local hospitals and clinics have
been required to report every attempted suicide case.</P>
      <P>Crude mortality from suicide also declined in Keeling City, Taoyuan County,
Changhua County and Kaohsiung City since the four cities and counties were
selected for enforced suicide-prevention efforts, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that some people, particularly depressives or people who live alone,
can be suicidal on special days such as Valentine's Day, Christmas or New Year
holidays.</P>
      <P>Noting that some 40 percent of suicidal people send out messages before their
suicide attempts, Hsu called for the public to help prevent suicides during the
upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.</P>

      <P>A concert titled "Spirit of Taiwan" will take place Feb. 28 at the Chungshan
Soccer Stadium in Taipei City, a concert organizer said at a press conference
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsu-tzuo, a member of local band Chthonic, which will perform at the
concert, said the concert is being organized by people from the music, art, film
and academic circles to "express non-government, civic voices about solutions to
social problems in Taiwan" and to mark the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident,
in which thousands of Taiwanese were murdered by troops of the then-ruling
authoritarian Kuomintang headed by the late President Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>The concert aims to convey the idea and call for people's recognition of
"transitional justice" that it is believed can bring Taiwan on the road of
reconciliation to its history of authoritarian rule giving way to democracy.</P>
      <P>Wang Dan, a leader of China's 1989 pro-democracy movement that later led to the
tragic Tiananmen massacre, said at the conference that he admires Taiwan's
democratic society but still sees that its civic society is not well developed

      <P>Lin said that in addition to groups from Taiwan, bands from other countries have
been invited to perform, including the U.K.'s Muse, Plastic People of the
Universe from the Czech Republic and Akiakane from Japan. There will also be
speeches and a film on human rights and democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER QUESTIONS KMT CHARTER REVISION PLAN</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) kingpin reminded the party Thursday that the
people's feelings should be taken into account when the party mulls a plan to
revise its charter so that the party can nominate criminals convicted in their
first and second trials and that only when convicted in a third trial will such
criminals be banned from being nominated by the party to run for elected office.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who has a keen interest in seeking the
main opposition party's nomination for the 2008 presidential election, made the
comments after it was widely reported that the KMT is considering amending its
charter to allow for nomination of indicted former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to run
for the 2008 presidency.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that the KMT will advance its party congress to early June
to carry out the revision through due process by lowering the threshold to ban
only "those convicted in a third trial" from being nominated by the party to run
for elected office.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted Tuesday on corruption charges over his alleged mishandling of a
special allowance fund earmarked for his discretionary use during his tenure as
Taipei mayor from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Saying that the KMT must not ignore the people's negative response to its sudden
charter shift, Wang claimed that the party would have no future and is doomed to
fail should it make people feel it is "embarking on the road of moral
degeneration."</P>
      <P>"How could people continue supporting the KMT if it is unable to touch their
hearts? " Wang asked, urging the party to "maintain a high level of moral
standards" and "maintain the public's strong confidence in it."</P>
      <P>Asked whether he would consider forming a Wang-Ma or Ma-Wang ticket to represent
the KMT in the next presidential election, Wang said it is "too early" to talk
about the issue but called for sincere unity among party members.</P>
      <P>Wang said he has yet to make a final decision on whether he will run in the 2008
presidential election and made it clear that the decision will not be made
anytime soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih denied the report that the KMT is
softening its stance regarding indicted members wishing to run for public
office, but he acknowledged that many of the KMT's rank-and-file members and
Central Standing Committee members support a charter modification to help party
candidates avoid what they called "political interference from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party."</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng, however, backed the charter revisions, claiming that
it would be a change to help protect KMT candidates in the year-end legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Wu, one of Ma's proteges who once served as a core aide to Ma when the former
KMT chairman served as mayor of Taipei from 1998 to 2006, claimed that the
proposal "is by no means aimed at bailing out Ma. It is a measure to protect KMT
members from politically charged prosecution by the DPP."</P>
      <P>Wu made the claim at the Legislative Yuan at a time when the KMT has come under
fire for customizing its rules to guarantee Ma's right to participate in the
party's presidential primaries.</P>
      <P>In view of a foreseeable fierce competition in December's legislative polls, it
is necessary to implement the charter modification to secure the KMT's survival,
Wu contended, pointing out that "the revision still needs to be discussed by
more than 1,000 party delegates in the June national congress."</P>
      <P>"The party needs to hear the voices of its members first before making a final
decision on the issue after it has gained an understanding of public opinion,"
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HISTORIANS BLAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK FOR 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The late President Chiang Kai-shek was the person most responsible for the
bloody 228 Incident, the head of Academica Historica, the country's top state
history institution, said Thursday upon release of a shortened version of a
famous report on the 1947 tragedy.</P>
      <P>To herald the approach of the 60th anniversary of the still controversial
incident, the Ketagalan Institute published a booklet of around 60 pages to
publicize the gist of "The 228 Incident: A Record on Responsibility, " a
600-page research report published by the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation a
year earlier.</P>
      <P>"Chiang Kai-shek ordered sending more troops to kill Taiwanese people; he was of
course the prime culprit behind the historical trauma, " Academia Historica
chief Chang Yen-hsien said at the publication press conference for the booklet.</P>
      <P>He also said then-Taiwan Governor Chen Yi, Taiwan Provincial Garrison Command
Chief of Staff Ko Yuan-fen and Kaohsiung Garrison Commander Peng Meng-chi were
also responsible, as all three advocated violent suppression and asked the
central government in Nanking to send more troops to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A number of "half-mainlanders" collaborated with the then-ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) regime and helped in the purge of Taiwan's elite, he added. "Half-
mainlanders" refers to people with Taiwan origins during Japanese colonization
but who later went to China and built ties with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-shen, a co-author of the 2005 report and a researcher with Academica
Sinica's Institute of Modern History, rebutted a claim by Chiang Kai-shek's
grandson, KMT lawmaker John Chiang, that the former strongman had tried to
prevent bloodshed.</P>
      <P>Chiang claims that his grandfather had on March 13, 1947 issued an order
prohibiting troops from killing in retaliation. However, Chen said, Chiang gave
the order only because ombudsman Yang Liang-kung informed him of the bloody
situation, and the order was not issued until four days after island-wide
massacre began.</P>
      <P>Chen said there should be no "Chiang Kai-shek Temple" -- a reference to Taipei's
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall -- in Taiwan, and added that while commemorating
the 228 Incident, Taiwan should pursue the ultimate goal of changing its
official name and drafting a new constitution.</P>
      <P>Ketagalan Institute Chairman Lee Hung-hsi said Chiang Kai-shek's slaughter of
Taiwan's elite deprived Taiwanese people of their identity.</P>
      <P>"It's regrettable that younger generations in Taiwan only know this year as the
70th anniversary of the Nanking massacre but have no knowledge about the
anniversary of the 228 incident," he said.</P>

      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan reported another record high of
NT$1.12 trillion (US$33.9 billion) in total revenue last year, up 14 percent
from the same level in 2005, park administration officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The rising demand for information electronic products -- such as PCs, cell
phones, digital cameras, and digital TVs -- benefited the semiconductor industry
in 2006, which also contributed to the growth in the park's total revenue, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Four of the six major industries in the park saw increases while the other two
--  the computer peripherals  industry and the communications industry -- posted
a small decline, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The total revenue of the park's integrated circuit (IC) industry went up 17
percent, the officials explained, adding that the optoelectronics industry was
up 18 percent, precision machinery industry up 36 percent, and the bioindustry
up 2 percent.</P>
      <P>By the end of last year, the total number of companies and manufacturers in the
park had reached a record high of 395, with 121,762 employees, which was a 10
percent rise from the previous year, the officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>The total value of import and export trade in the park last year rose 20 percent
to hit NT$982.3 billion, the officials said. The total value of exports was up
22 percent to reach NT$592.9 billion, while that of imports increased 18 percent
to record NT$389.4 billion, they explained in detail.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the park's revenue is expected to go up 10 percent to total NT$1.25

      <P>Preliminary tallies show that individual income tax revenues amounted to
NT$334.3 billion last year, business income tax revenues totaled NT$311.8

Taipei mayor from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>Saying that the KMT must not ignore the people's negative response to its sudden
charter shift, Wang claimed that the party would have no future and is doomed to
fail should it make people feel it is "embarking on the road of moral
degeneration."</P>
      <P>"How could people continue supporting the KMT if it is unable to touch their
hearts? " Wang asked, urging the party to "maintain a high level of moral
standards" and "maintain the public's strong confidence in it."</P>
      <P>Asked whether he would consider forming a Wang-Ma or Ma-Wang ticket to represent
the KMT in the next presidential election, Wang said it is "too early" to talk
about the issue but called for sincere unity among party members.</P>
      <P>Wang said he has yet to make a final decision on whether he will run in the 2008
presidential election and made it clear that the decision will not be made
anytime soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih denied the report that the KMT is
softening its stance regarding indicted members wishing to run for public
office, but he acknowledged that many of the KMT's rank-and-file members and
Central Standing Committee members support a charter modification to help party
candidates avoid what they called "political interference from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party."</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng, however, backed the charter revisions, claiming that
it would be a change to help protect KMT candidates in the year-end legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Wu, one of Ma's proteges who once served as a core aide to Ma when the former
KMT chairman served as mayor of Taipei from 1998 to 2006, claimed that the
proposal "is by no means aimed at bailing out Ma. It is a measure to protect KMT
members from politically charged prosecution by the DPP."</P>
      <P>Wu made the claim at the Legislative Yuan at a time when the KMT has come under
fire for customizing its rules to guarantee Ma's right to participate in the
party's presidential primaries.</P>
      <P>In view of a foreseeable fierce competition in December's legislative polls, it
is necessary to implement the charter modification to secure the KMT's survival,
Wu contended, pointing out that "the revision still needs to be discussed by
more than 1,000 party delegates in the June national congress."</P>
      <P>"The party needs to hear the voices of its members first before making a final
decision on the issue after it has gained an understanding of public opinion,"
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HISTORIANS BLAME CHIANG KAI-SHEK FOR 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
02/16/07  10:59:00
(By Y.C. Jou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The late President Chiang Kai-shek was the person most responsible for the
bloody 228 Incident, the head of Academica Historica, the country's top state
history institution, said Thursday upon release of a shortened version of a
famous report on the 1947 tragedy.</P>
      <P>To herald the approach of the 60th anniversary of the still controversial
incident, the Ketagalan Institute published a booklet of around 60 pages to
publicize the gist of "The 228 Incident: A Record on Responsibility, " a
600-page research report published by the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation a
year earlier.</P>
      <P>"Chiang Kai-shek ordered sending more troops to kill Taiwanese people; he was of
course the prime culprit behind the historical trauma, " Academia Historica
chief Chang Yen-hsien said at the publication press conference for the booklet.</P>
      <P>He also said then-Taiwan Governor Chen Yi, Taiwan Provincial Garrison Command
Chief of Staff Ko Yuan-fen and Kaohsiung Garrison Commander Peng Meng-chi were
also responsible, as all three advocated violent suppression and asked the
central government in Nanking to send more troops to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A number of "half-mainlanders" collaborated with the then-ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) regime and helped in the purge of Taiwan's elite, he added. "Half-
mainlanders" refers to people with Taiwan origins during Japanese colonization
but who later went to China and built ties with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-shen, a co-author of the 2005 report and a researcher with Academica
Sinica's Institute of Modern History, rebutted a claim by Chiang Kai-shek's
grandson, KMT lawmaker John Chiang, that the former strongman had tried to
prevent bloodshed.</P>
      <P>Chiang claims that his grandfather had on March 13, 1947 issued an order
prohibiting troops from killing in retaliation. However, Chen said, Chiang gave
the order only because ombudsman Yang Liang-kung informed him of the bloody
situation, and the order was not issued until four days after island-wide
massacre began.</P>
      <P>Chen said there should be no "Chiang Kai-shek Temple" -- a reference to Taipei's
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall -- in Taiwan, and added that while commemorating
the 228 Incident, Taiwan should pursue the ultimate goal of changing its
official name and drafting a new constitution.</P>
      <P>Ketagalan Institute Chairman Lee Hung-hsi said Chiang Kai-shek's slaughter of
Taiwan's elite deprived Taiwanese people of their identity.</P>
      <P>"It's regrettable that younger generations in Taiwan only know this year as the
70th anniversary of the Nanking massacre but have no knowledge about the
anniversary of the 228 incident," he said.</P>

      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park in northern Taiwan reported another record high of
NT$1.12 trillion (US$33.9 billion) in total revenue last year, up 14 percent
from the same level in 2005, park administration officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The rising demand for information electronic products -- such as PCs, cell
phones, digital cameras, and digital TVs -- benefited the semiconductor industry
in 2006, which also contributed to the growth in the park's total revenue, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Four of the six major industries in the park saw increases while the other two
--  the computer peripherals  industry and the communications industry -- posted
a small decline, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The total revenue of the park's integrated circuit (IC) industry went up 17
percent, the officials explained, adding that the optoelectronics industry was
up 18 percent, precision machinery industry up 36 percent, and the bioindustry
up 2 percent.</P>
      <P>By the end of last year, the total number of companies and manufacturers in the
park had reached a record high of 395, with 121,762 employees, which was a 10
percent rise from the previous year, the officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>The total value of import and export trade in the park last year rose 20 percent
to hit NT$982.3 billion, the officials said. The total value of exports was up
22 percent to reach NT$592.9 billion, while that of imports increased 18 percent
to record NT$389.4 billion, they explained in detail.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the park's revenue is expected to go up 10 percent to total NT$1.25
trillion, the officials forecast.</P>

      <P>Thanks to higher-than-expected tax revenues, the central government managed to
make its ends meet last year for the first time since 1999, the country's budget
chief said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to preliminary tallies, Hsu Chang-yao, director-general of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), said the

      <P>"The government resultingly managed to make its ends meet last year," Hsu said,
adding that it marked the first time since 1999 that the government has managed
to balance its annual budget.</P>
      <P>Preliminary tallies show that individual income tax revenues amounted to
NT$334.3 billion last year, business income tax revenues totaled NT$311.8
billion and securities transaction tax revenues topped NT$89.9 billion due to a
30 percent annual increase in accumulated securities trading volume over the

    <HEADLINE>RATIO OF ADULT CHILDREN LIVING WITH PARENTS DECLINING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
02/16/07  13:06:10
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The percentages of adult children living with their parents on the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait have both been in steady decline, but they remain higher than
that in the United States, an economist said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cyrus C. Y. Chu, an academic at Academia Sinica, said in a speech delivered at
National Taiwan University that more than 60 percent of adult children lived
together with their parents in China in the 1990s, compared with 50 percent in
Taiwan and 40 percent in the United States.</P>
      <P>According to his study, Chu said the average number of people in a family has
also dropped on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, from slightly more than four
two decades ago to about three at present.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chu said, many of those who choose to live together with their
parents are not necessarily doing so because of filial piety, but rather because
they need their parents' help in caring for their young children, particularly
those aged under 3.</P>
      <P>"Studies show that adult children tend to become less willing to live with their
parents when their income increases, " Chu said, adding that daughters-in-law
tend not to be inclined to live with their parents-in-law when they earn more.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, sons-in-law also tend to be less willing to live with their
parents-in-law if they have a high income.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Chu said, the parental preference for sons over daughters has been
declining, with the percentage of those wanting boys falling from 68 percent to
46 percent in a series of his studies . A similar trend is also seen in China,
Chu added without elaborating.</P>
      <P>Chu further said the average age of women when they give birth for the first
time is also steadily increasing on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, with the
number of women giving birth to their first child after 30 years of age rising
continuously.</P>
      <P>In one of Chu's studies, 17 percent of all children born in China were born to
mothers aged over 30, with the figure in Taiwan being 48 percent.</P>
      <P>Chu's studies also found that American parents usually do not pass all of their
assets or property on to their children before their death because, if they do
so, their children may no longer visit them regularly. In America, he said, the
richer the parents, the more frequent their children come back to see them.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Chu said, the frequency of children visiting their parents tends to
remain high or even become higher after their parents pass their assets to their
children. The phenomenon is probably related to pressure from siblings and
society, he explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TRAVELERS TO CHINA WARNED OF RABIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
02/16/07  13:38:41
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan citizens who are planning to visit China during the Chinese New Year
holidays were warned Friday about the risk of acquiring rabies -- an infectious
disease that killed 182 people in China in January.</P>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health called for
potential visitors to China to avoid contact with dogs or other animals in order
to avoid getting rabies, a disease caused by a virus found in the saliva of
infected animals and transmitted to humans by bites or possibly by contamination
of an open cut.</P>
      <P>According to a report released recently by the Chinese Ministry of Health, 217
people were bitten by dogs or other animals that were infected by the rabies
virus across China in January. Of the total, 182, or over 80 percent, died.</P>
      <P>Rabies was the top specific infectious disease that killed the greatest number
of people for eight consecutive months in China, followed by tuberculosis, which
killed 94 people in January.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi said that China has been a rabies-endemic
country and that there was a case several years ago where a Chinese citizen, who
had been bitten by a stray dog before leaving for Taiwan for a short visit, died
of rabies in Taiwan, which is not a rabies-endemic country.</P>
      <P>Shih said that treatment of an infected person is critical and that rabies can
cause a painful death if untreated.</P>
      <P>Shih said that in addition to avoiding contact with dogs and other animals while
visiting China, Taiwan visitors can also receive preexposure rabies vaccination
before heading to China or receive rabies vaccination immediately if they are
bitten by an animal.</P>
      <P>Rabies is an acute, fatal encephalomyelitis caused by neurotropic viruses in the
family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus. The disease progresses  from a
nonspecific  prodromal phase to paresis or paralysis; muscle spasms can be
stimulated by the sight, sound, or perception of water (hydrophobia) ; delirium
and convulsions can develop, followed by coma and death.</P>
      <P>Most animals can be infected by the virus and can transmit the disease to
humans. Infected bats, raccoons, foxes, skunks, dogs or cats provide the
greatest risk to humans. Rabies may also spread through exposure to infected
domestic farm animals, groundhogs, weasels and other wild carnivores. Squirrels,
rodents and rabbits are seldom infected.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's ongoing name rectification campaign will not include changing the
country's official title or flag and thus will not violate President Chen Shui-
bian's "four noes" commitments, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislator said here Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Bi-khim, who is on a visit in Washington D.C., told Taiwan reporters that
she made the assurance to the U.S. side during her meeting with U.S. officials
and members of major think tanks.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, the U.S. officials were surprised at Taiwan's move and
expressed concern about whether the campaign will be further expanded to include
changing Taiwan's national title and affect President Chen's commitments to the
United States.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said she has explained to the U.S. officials that Taiwan's efforts to
change the names of state-owned enterprises containing references to China are
aimed at avoiding confusion and that the DPP has no intention of pushing the
campaign further.</P>
      <P>Also, Hsiao said the United States is concerned about whether the candidates to
be fielded by various political parties in Taiwan for the 2008 presidential
election will take into account the position of the United States while putting
forth their policies, especially whether the DPP's candidate will follow Chen's
commitments to the United States.</P>
      <P>In his 2000 and 2004 inauguration addresses, Chen pledged that if China has no
intention of using force against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan
independence, not change the official name of the country, not include the
"state-to-state" concept on cross-strait relations in the Constitution, and not
promote a referendum to change the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>On the corruption charges against former opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou, Hsiao said the U.S. side is paying much attention to Ma's ability to
manage the crisis triggered by his indictment and how he is going to cope with
other challenges.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said that although the decline in Ma's popularity following his indictment
has boosted the DPP's confidence concerning the next presidential election, the
DPP still needs to work harder to win the people's support.</P>
      <P>The anti-corruption center of the Taiwan High Court Prosecutor's Office indicted
Ma Tuesday on corruption charges after determining that he had embezzled
NT$11.17 million (US$337,650) from a special allowance fund designated for his
discretionary use during his two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>While resigning from the KMT chairmanship immediately after the indictment, Ma
claimed that he is innocent and announced his decision to run for the presidency
in 2008 to prove his integrity "via voter support" in the election.</P>

      <P>The number of Taiwan students receiving visas to study abroad in 2006 totaled
37,171, marking a record high over the past decade, the Ministry of Education
(MOE) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The 2006 figure also represented an increase of more than 3,000, or 9.1 percent,
over that of the previous year, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics show that Taiwan students still prefer English-speaking
countries and that among the top three foreign countries in terms of number of
visas issued to Taiwan students in 2006, the United States was first, issuing
visas to 16,451 Taiwan students, followed by Britain, which issued 9,600 visas
to Taiwan students, and Australia, which issued 2,862 visas.</P>
      <P>Japan issued student visas to 2,108 Taiwan students in 2006, ranking it fourth.
The figure marked an increase of 360 over the previous year.</P>
      <P>The top eight countries in terms of the number of visas issued to Taiwan
students -- namely the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany,
Australia, New Zealand and Japan -- issued more visas to Taiwan students in 2006
than they did in the previous year, except for Canada.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-sheng,  director  of the ministry's  Bureau  of International Culture
&amp; Education Relations, attributed the increase in the number of Taiwan
students studying abroad to the ministry's encouragement by providing students
with scholarships and pushing domestic colleges and universities to send top
students to study abroad.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ministry kicked off a study abroad loan program in 2004. It
further eased the conditions for applying for overseas study loans in 2006,
Chang said.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang has not had any plans to resign from his post to prepare
for a bid for the presidency in 2008, Executive Yuan spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang
said in a statement Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks in response to an Apple Daily report Friday that said Su
had planned to resign prior to the Chinese New Year and to announce his
presidential bid but then changed his mind after President Chen Shui-bian asked
him to enter the race without quitting his post until after the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) primary for the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the daily's  report was "based merely on speculation" and that
the newspaper failed to verify its report before printing it.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Ker Chien-ming, a DPP legislative caucus whip, confirmed  that
President  Chen will mediate  among the DPP's presidential aspirants concerning
the timetable for the party's presidential primary.</P>
      <P>As to whether Su should resign or not to join the DPP primary, Ker said that
these are matters for the president and the premier to decide upon and that the
DPP legislative caucus will fully respect whatever decision they make.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Chung-mo, however, noted that once a DPP official is chosen
as the party's candidate for the presidential election, he or she should resign
from their post immediately to focus on the race.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Su and former premiers Frank Hsieh and Yu
Shyi-kun are widely seen as "the four DPP heavyweights" who are likely to
compete to represent the party in the election. However, none of them have
publicly announced their decision to join the race.</P>
      <P>Registration for the DPP primary will be open March 5-9, and a vote by party
members is scheduled for May 6, while opinion polls on the support ratings of
the contenders will be conducted May 7-28. The outcome of the primary is slated
to be announced May 30.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has passed a proposal to amend regulations
governing approval for professionals from China to engage in professional
activities in Taiwan, relaxing some restrictions on visits by professionals in
the fields of industry, technology, sport, media and religion.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun explained Thursday that the amendment is part of
the Executive Yuan's drive to attract high-tech and sports talent from China to
upgrade the standard of Taiwan's science and technology and to strengthen its
training programs for national athletes to compete in international sporting
events such as the Olympics.</P>
      <P>The amendment will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for ratification before
being sent to the Ministry of the Interior, which will publicize and implement
the revision.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the amendment allows Chinese professionals invited to
assist in the training of athletes of Taiwan's national teams to stay on the
island for up to one year at a time, instead of the current six months. If the
professionals are invited to help train athletes for the Olympics, they can
extend their stay in Taiwan up to six years.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chinese sports or high-tech professionals who have to stay in Taiwan
for at least four months for work are permitted to bring their spouse and
children aged under 18 with them.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that before the revision,  Chinese  media professionals who
wanted to conduct interviews, cover news or produce television programs in
Taiwan had to apply for official permission at least two months in advance. Now,
the condition has been lifted for emergency cases.</P>
      <P>In addition, the amendment also allows a Chinese actor or actress to bring along
five assistants while making a film in Taiwan, and religious professionals who
come to the island to study at certified religious institutions can get a one-
year resident permit.</P>
      <P>Liu added that the Chinese professionals need not attach their return tickets on
their visa applications if they apply for a stay of at least six months.</P>
      <P>Besides the revision, the MAC has also worked out many measures to improve the
government's management of the movements of Chinese professionals in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GARDEN OF HOPE LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN TO HELP SEXUALLY-ABUSED CHILDREN</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Estimating that an average of 52 children in Taiwan are sexually abused every
day, the Garden of Hope Foundation has decided to launch a "Flying Dandelion"
campaign to raise funds to help the victims of such abuse and to work to
eradicate the problem.</P>
      <P>The foundation said that it hopes to raise NT$20 million (US$607,902.7) to be
used toward setting up victim treatment services at its centers around Taiwan,
educating the public about the problem of sexual abuse of children, and working
to prevent such crimes.</P>
      <P>Noting that there were more than 4,900 reported sex crimes around Taiwan in
2005, foundation officials said the actual number of cases could be seven to 10
times that figure. They added that three out of every five sex crime victims
were children.</P>
      <P>Based on the estimate that the actual number of cases was seven times the
reported figure, that would mean that a child was sexually abused every 27
minutes on average in Taiwan last year, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Chi Hui-jung, chief executive officer of the foundation, said that if child
victims of sexual abuse do not receive therapy early on, they could be scarred
for life. "It's like a broken arm, which if not treated immediately, will not
heal properly," he added.</P>
      <P>"If a child victim of sexual abuse can receive therapy to deal with what they
have experienced, they then have a much better chance of recovering and leading
a healthy, normal life," he continued.</P>
      <P>He further said that although the Garden of Hope Foundation has centers in the
north, south, east and west of the island, only the foundation's center in
Taipei has the resources to provide the treatment that child victims of sexual
abuse need to recover.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we hope to raise enough funds through our 'Flying Dandelion'
campaign to expand our treatment services to our centers in other parts of
Taiwan where they are urgently needed, " he continued.</P>
      <P>Currently, according to Chi, Taiwan's child sex crime prevention and treatment
services lag far behind those of other developed countries. "In most developed
countries, cases of sexual abuse of children are exposed within one year on
average, while in Taiwan, the average is over three or four years," he said,
adding that "the costs of helping these victims recover are extremely high."</P>
      <P>Through its campaign, the foundation also aims to enter schools and local
society to educate people on the problem of sexual abuse of children and how to
prevent it, Chi said.</P>
      <P>He also urged everyone to report any cases of suspected sexual abuse of children
to authorities, noting that "one phone call can change a child's entire life."</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will field only the strongest ticket with
the greatest chance of winning the 2008 presidential election, acting KMT
Chairman Wu Po-hsiung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the announcement after a closed-door meeting with KMT honorary Chairman
Lien Chan, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou aimed at helping arrive at a consensus among all aspirants contending for
the party's candidacy in the 2008 race.</P>
      <P>Lien, who called the meeting, said that the four exchanged views in a "very
friendly" atmosphere, although all of them were serious about the subjects
discussed.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Wu announced a six-point consensus that the four KMT bigwigs
reached: that the KMT is resolute in defending the country and the people's
interests; that esprit de corps tops all issues concerning the 2008 race; that a
new KMT chairman will be elected soon after the Lunar New Year; that the KMT
will be equally single-minded  and relentless  in efforts  toward the year-end
legislative election as it is toward the 2008 presidential election; that the
KMT hierarchy will remain completely neutral; and that Wang and Ma will give
deep thought during the Lunar New Year holiday concerning the 2008 presidential
race and that mediation as well as coordination will begin soon after the
holidays end.</P>
      <P>An early agreement on the KMT's presidential ticket grew urgent after Ma
announced his presidential bid and resigned as KMT chairman following his
indictment on corruption charges Feb. 13.</P>
      <P>Lien has said that Ma's hasty announcement of his presidential bid may "narrow"
the maneuvering room available in attempting to mediate between Ma and Wang, who
is another KMT kingpin.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An activity of using human hair to lift an "elephant" off the ground was held in
an amusement park in Tainan County, southern Taiwan Friday, although rocks and
timber took the place of a real elephant due to protests from animal rights
activists.</P>
      <P>The protest caused embarrassment at one point for the National Science and
Technology Museum and Wan-Pi World, which sponsored the heavily advertised
activity.</P>
      <P>The museum spent NT$250,000 (US$7,570) to buy 1.6 million human hairs and asked
a vocational school in Kaohsiung to braid into a rope capable of lifting an
elephant and platform with a total weight of around eight tons.</P>
      <P>But the activity caused concern among animal right groups, which sent officials
to appeal against using an elephant.</P>
      <P>Lin Tai-ching, an ecology activist, pointed out that if the activity is aimed
merely at proving that human hair is strong enough to lift heavy objects --
which in any case is already well-known and hardly a scientific breakthrough --
there is no need to use a living elephant.</P>
      <P>Elephants are sensitive animals and even caging them in zoos is already a
violation of nature, let alone lifting one chained to a platform, Lin said while
questioning who would be held responsible if anything goes wrong.</P>
      <P>Wan-Pi World Chairman Hsu Chung-fa said the Asian elephant they had planned to
use has been held captive in the zoo for more than 10 years and is mild-
tempered.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the park had done everything possible to ensure the animal's safety
and the platform carrying the elephant would only be lifted 10 cm off the
ground, which he said would also be an opportunity to get an exact weight the
elephant.</P>
      <P>But because of the vehement protests from conservationists, the organizers
decided to use rocks and timber of equal weight to carry out the "experiment"
and apply for listing in the Guinness Book of World Records.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-fa, director of the museum, claimed that the experiment was "very
creative."</P>

trade agreement (FTA) with the United States.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks in response to media inquiries about reports that Shih
asked Washington to develop U.S.-Taiwan FTA ties based on the framework of the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , which the U.S. Congress passed in 1979 to govern
U.S.-Taiwan interactions after the severance of diplomatic relations between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>The TRA authorizes quasi-diplomatic ties with the government in Taiwan by giving
authority to the American Institute in Taiwan to serve as the de facto embassy.</P>
      <P>Describing the act as a "very special legal arrangement, " Shih said that since
Washington could create a set of special measures regarding U.S.-Taiwan
exchanges in the absence of diplomatic ties, it is possible for it to come up
with creative ideas and measures on the FTA issue.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the existence of the U.S.-Taiwan  Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement, sealed in 1994 to resolve bilateral trade issues and enhance economic
cooperation,  Shih said the agreement cannot replace a FTA because the latter
concerns rules of taxation, which have to be regulated by the law.</P>

      <P>The Tainan District Prosecutor's Office recently cracked a criminal ring that
produced and sold some 240,000 bottles of fake red wine over the past two years,
the prosecution said Friday, adding that the wine was mostly sold to catering
services.</P>
      <P>Two suspects have been detained, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors and investigators searched several sites related to a food
company and a winery in Kaohsiung and Tainan counties and seized counterfeit
sorghum liquor and the fake red wine. Continuing investigations  over  the next
two days uncovered  the ring's operations, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The winery used grape juice, red wine extract and flavoring to produce the fake

      <P>The risk of death among senior citizens who exercise regularly is 35 percent
lower than those who do not, according to the results of a study released Friday
by the National Health Research Institute (NHRI).</P>
      <P>The study was based on data collected via tracking the exercise habits and
health conditions of 2,113 people aged 65 or above over a two-year period.</P>
      <P>The study found that the more the seniors exercise, the better the effect of
lowering their risk of death, with the risk dropping significantly if they
exhaust more than 1,000 kcal of energy per week through exercise.</P>
      <P>To exhaust 1,000 kcal of energy per week, a person needs to walk at least 40
minutes per day, researchers said.</P>
      <P>The study shows that walking is the most popular exercise among senior citizens
in Taiwan, along with tai chi, wai tan kung and folk dance.</P>
      <P>However, the study found that of all senior citizens in Taiwan, only 60 percent
of men and 54 percent of women exercise regularly.</P>
      <P>Of those who exercise regularly, only 50 percent exercise enough to exhaust
1,000 kcal of energy per week, according to the study.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) is "protecting  students' Internet security"
through promotion and education on information ethics and online self-

      <P>A survey conducted by the Taiwan Network Information Center (TWNIC) shows that
Internet usage rate among Taiwan families was 72 percent, and that of individual
users is 68 percent as of June 2006, with 95 percent of users aged from 12-25.
The spokesman claimed that Internet use by young people will cause more social
problems of Internet pornography or slander.</P>
      <P>To prevent  such social problems,  the MOE initiated  the Taiwan Academic
Network improper information filtering system for nearly 3,500 schools four
years ago to protect students from bad Web sites, and also provides students'
parents with free downloading of IEblocker software -- an end-user filtering
system.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the MOE subsidized the Taiwan chapter of the global End Child

President Bush warned on Thursday that he expected fierce fighting to flare in
Afghanistan this spring, and he pressed NATO allies to provide a bigger and more
aggressive force to guard against a resurgence by the Taliban and Al Qaeda that
could threaten the fragile Afghan state.

With American and NATO commanders pressing for more troops and experts
predicting that further gains by the Taliban could put the Afghan government of
President Hamid Karzai in danger, Mr. Bush used his presidential platform to lay
out what he said was substantial progress in Afghanistan since 2001, but also a
continuing threat.

Wall Street Journal:Probes of Backdating Move to Faster Track

On Jan. 4, 2002, the chief financial officer of Broadcom Corp. tapped out an
email about stock options to his chief executive and others."I very strongly
recommend that these options be priced as of December 24," he wrote.

They were, and that was fortunate for recipients. Broadcom's share price rose
23% between the two dates. The pretense that the options had been granted on the
earlier date made them extra valuable.

A probe into Broadcom is a sign of how long- running investigations of stock-
options backdating are heating up, as prosecutors winnow the roster of some 140
companies with options problems to a tighter list.</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate for 2006 reached 4.62 percent, thanks to
diminishing credit card problems, a rising stock market and good weather, the
country's budget chief said Friday.</P>
      <P>The figure surpassed the government's target of 4.5 percent, Hsu Chang-yao,
director-general of the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting,
and Statistics (DGBAS), said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, last year's unemployment rate was 3.91 percent, while the consumer
price index (CPI) saw an annual increase rate of 0.6 percent, Hsu said, adding
that both figures were lower than the government's targets of 4 percent and 2
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Attributing the rise in the economic growth rate to good performance in the
fourth quarter, Hsu said the effect of two "ghost months" -- the seventh month
of the Chinese calendar when business activity is usually sluggish -- was over
and that the negative impact of bad credit card debt was subsiding.</P>
      <P>The two factors had helped boost the tourism and food and beverage sectors by 11
percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, Hsu went on.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the stock market became more active, reporting a 20.4 increase in the
total trading value compared with the 2005 level, Hsu said, adding that this had
also increased private spending.</P>
      <P>The economic growth rate in the final quarter of last year recorded 4.02
percent, higher than the 3.15 percent forecast by the government, while the per

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's official representative office and civil groups in the United States
expressed gratitude Friday for a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives
proposal led by Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) calling for the United States to
resume normal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tancredo, along with Reps. Mark Souder (R-Ind.), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.) ,
Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y.) and Dan Burton (R-Ind.) , introduced earlier the same
day the resolution urging the Bush administration to recognize Taiwan as a
sovereign and independent state in demonstration of concrete support for the
democracy.</P>
      <P>The resolution calls on the U.S. president to abandon the fundamentally flawed
"one China policy" in favor of a more realistic "one China, one Taiwan policy"
and begin the process of resuming normal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. It
also urges the United States to aggressively support Taiwan's bid for full
participation in the United Nations and other international organizations that
require statehood for membership.</P>
      <P>Tancredo said that "the 'one China' policy is a fiction - a relic of time that
has long since passed, " arguing that it is time for the United States to "stop
living this lie."</P>
      <P>Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) President C.T. Lee applauded the
resolution, saying "the policy of dual recognition will be the most effective
way for the United States to manifest its support for democratic countries
around the world and to counter China's ambition of invading Taiwan."</P>
      <P>FAPA is a Washington-based private non-profit organization aiming to promote
Taiwan's international status.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States also

    <TEXT>
      <P>A special ferry hired by the Kinmen County Government to help Kinmen people
living on Taiwan proper return home for the Lunar New Year holidays arrived at
the outlying island's Liaoluo Harbor Saturday morning after a nine-hour journey
from Taichung Harbor.</P>
      <P>A total of 355 people took advantage of the special ferry service set up by the
county government for the first time as a solution to the problem of limited
availability of air tickets during the holiday period due to high demand.</P>
      <P>Passengers aboard the "Kinmen Express" received a warm welcome as well as red
envelopes from Kinmen County Commissioner Lee Chu-feng upon their arrival at
Liaoluo Harbor.</P>
      <P>Most of the passengers interviewed expressed satisfaction with the ferry
service. Some of them said they took the ferry because there were no plane
tickets available, while others said they decided to return home by sea as the
cost was much lower than flying.</P>
      <P>As the county government bore most of the cost of providing the ferry service,
passengers only needed to pay NT$500 (US$15) for an adult one-way ticket.</P>
      <P>Lunar New Year traffic has been a nightmare for Kinmen people who live on Taiwan
proper and wish to return home to reunite with family during the holidays, as
there are only a limited number of flights and no regular passenger ferry
service linking Taiwan to the outlying island.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen Express will depart on its return trip to Taichung Harbor at 10:00
p.m. on Feb. 24, the county government said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGHER CONSUMER SPENDING REFLECTS PROGRESS IN QUALITY OF LIFE: DGBAS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The increased level of consumer spending in Taiwan, which totaled NT$7.07
trillion (US$214.89 billion) in 2006, reflects improvements in the quality of
life of local people, the Cabinet's statistics agency reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a recent survey by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , Taiwan's consumer spending --
meaning the purchase of goods and services by individual citizens -- increased
2.2 percent year-on-year in 2006.</P>
      <P>An in-depth analysis of consumer spending in Taiwan over the past decade shows
that the percentage of spending on basic necessities, such as food, water,
shelter and clothing, has declined steadily, while spending on entertainment and
education has been on an upward spiral, a trend that points to progress in the
pursuit of higher quality of life following increases in the nation's per-capita
income, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>In 2006, spending on food continued to represent the lion's share of overall
consumer spending at 23.6 percent, but the figure marked a decline of 0.5
percentage points over that of a decade earlier.</P>
      <P>Rent and water bills accounted for 14.6 percent of total consumer spending, down
2.8 percentage points from the level registered a decade ago, DGBAS officials
said, adding that the percentage of spending on clothing also dropped 0.9
percentage points to a mere 3.7 percent of total spending.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the ratio of spending on travel, entertainment, recreation,
education  and cultural services increased by 1.9 percentage points to reach
18.7 percent of total spending, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As local people's average life expectancy has risen steadily over the past
decade, medical and health care bills have also spiked, with the ratio surging
1.5 percentage points to reach 9.1 percent of total household spending in 2006.</P>
      <P>The prevalence of mobile phone and Internet service has driven up the ratio of
spending on transportation and communications to 11.9 percent, or 0.8 percentage
points higher than the figure a decade ago, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Shirley Shaw, wife of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, on Saturday made her first public

      <P>Shaw was able to walk slowly with Hu leading her by the hand and greet the

      <P>The traffic accident occurred on the evening of Nov. 18 when Hu and his wife
were heading home to Taichung from a campaign rally in Kaohsiung along the
north-bound section of the Formosa Freeway. Their car rolled over after it was
hit by a vehicle that was trying to pass a truck. Shaw sustained serious
injuries in the accident and was unconscious when she arrived at Chimei Hospital
in Tainan. Hu also sustained minor injuries in the accident.  The medical team

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 20,000 passengers have traveled between Taiwan and China via the outlying
island of Kinmen for the Chinese New Year holiday over the last eight days
leading up to and including Saturday, according to officials from the Kinmen
Harbor Authority.</P>
      <P>The small Taiwan-held island saw 571 inbound travelers and 373 outbound
travelers Saturday. Ferries will not operate Sunday on Chinese New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Most of the inbound passengers Saturday were Taiwan businessmen working in
China. They made a transit stop in Kinmen before flying on to Taiwan. The
outbound passengers were mainly China-born spouses of Taiwan nationals  heading
back to their hometowns  or Taiwan businessmen assigned to work in China during
the holidays.</P>
      <P>Although the ferry service was operating smoothly Saturday, the island's only
airport was closed for an hour in the morning because of heavy fog, and a flight
from Taiwan carrying some 200 passengers wanting to head on to Xiamen by ferry
arrived about an hour late. As a result, the departure time of Saturday's last
ferry to Xiamen, originally scheduled for 11 a.m., was delayed for fifty minutes
to wait for the passengers.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen Harbor Authority, which operates the ferry services between the
outlying island and Xiamen and Chuanzhou in Fujian Province in southern China,
began adding extra ferry service eight days ago to handle the increased
passenger traffic ahead of the holidays. As of the end of Saturday, a total of
19,138 people had used the ferry service during the eight-day period, marking an
increase of 2,184 passengers over the figure for the same period last year, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Ferry service will resume Monday, when many local residents are expected to
travel to China for sightseeing during the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday and
Taiwan businessmen will begin to return to their posts in China following the
holiday.</P>

The phone had been in development by Apple and Cingular for two years and was

      <P>Electoral authorities have decided tentatively to hold a by-election on May 12
for the post of Keelung mayor, which has been rendered vacant by the death of
Hsu Tsai-li, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu, 60, who suffered from diabetes and cardiovascular disease, died of related
complications Monday after serving barely more than one year of his second four-
year term as Keelung mayor.</P>
      <P>Teng Tien-yu, spokesman for the Central Election Commission, noted that
according to the country's election laws, a by-election should be held within
three months after an elective post becomes vacant if the original office holder
has not yet served half of the term.</P>
      <P>With a by-election due by May 19 in this case, the election committee of Taiwan
Province is planning to schedule the by-election for May 12, as elections in the
country are usually held on the second Saturday of a month, Teng said.</P>
      <P>He said the committee will call a meeting after the Chinese New Year holiday to
finalize the date for the election and other related details.</P>
      <P>Political observers said the upcoming by-election will be a litmus test of the
coalitions formed by the "pan-blue alliance" and "pan-green camp" for the year-
end legislative elections and next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung remains the most
likely candidate to stand for the "pan-blue alliance, " but the support of the
party's ally -- the opposition Kuomintang -- will be crucial for victory if he
is to run for the post, the observers said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -led "pan-green camp"
is widely seen as enjoying weaker voter support in the northern port city than
the "pan-blue alliance, " DPP officials said the party will take the by-election
very seriously.</P>
      <P>Even if the DPP loses the by-election, the DPP will learn from the results
whether the people are disappointed in the party and how it should adjust its
strategies for the upcoming legislative and presidential elections, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen as to whether DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh, who has expressed
his intention to leave politics, will take part in the by-election.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who ran under the banner of the KMT in the last Keelung mayoral election in
December 2005, won with 76,162 votes, while Taiwan Solidarity Union's Chen
Chien-ming, who represented the "pan-green camp," took 58,243 votes.</P>
      <P>PFP's Liu garnered 47,932 votes, and the DPP's Wang got 2,771 votes despite his
withdrawal from the election.</P>
      <P>The KMT expelled Hsu from the party after he was found guilty of corruption by
the Keelung District Court in September 2006 for trying to sell a plot of land
he bought from a businessman to the city's bus service department for a windfall
profit.</P>
      <P>The KMT had since urged Hsu to resign from the mayoral post and launched a drive
to recall him after the request was ignored.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian traveled to the eastern city of Hualien Tuesday to meet
with bereaved families of the 228 Incident victims.</P>
      <P>Chen exchanged Lunar New Year greetings with the families at the office of the
Concern for 228 Incident Victims Association and wished them a prosperous,
auspicious new year.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has come to gain a better understanding of the living conditions
of the families of the 228 Incident victims, including the schooling and
employment of their children, Chen said his administration has spared no efforts
to pursue the facts concerning the events in the hopes that such a tragedy will
never be repeated.</P>
      <P>"The 228 Incident" refers to a series of events in 1947 that led to a brutal
crackdown by the former Kuomintang (KMT) government against the local
population, particularly the intelligentsia.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the historical facts concerning the 228 Incident will come to
light in full to serve as a part of our democratic education and help avoid any
repetition of the tragedy, " Chen said, adding that the pursuit of transitional
justice is an issue in all emerging democratic countries seeking to resolve the
sad legacies of authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Lin Lien-ming, president of the Concern for 228 Incident
Victims Association, expressed worries that a 228 Incident memorial monument in
Peipin Park in Hualien City may be toppled because of a highway expansion
project to link the nearby Hualien Harbor Bureau to other parts of the city.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen promised to ask relevant government authorities to include the
building of an even more magnificent monument in commemoration of the tragic
incident as part of the road expansion project.</P>
      <P>The bloody 228 Incident took place during a turbulent period of Taiwan's
history. In 1945, the mainland China-based KMT government reclaimed Taiwan,
which had been a Japanese colony. But the KMT's rule was brutal and corrupt,
leading to a massive protest Feb. 28, 1947, by the native Taiwanese. More troops
were sent from the mainland to crush the demonstrations and in the following
months, soldiers arrested and killed thousands of people whom they claimed were
communists or saboteurs trying to overthrow the government.</P>

      <P>Premier  Su Tseng-chang  remained tight-lipped Tuesday about when he will
formally throw his hat in the ring and declare his candidacy for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's nomination (DPP's) for the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Su was asked by a group of reporters concerning his intention to run for the
presidency during a tour of a tropical agricultural park in Changchih township
in southernmost Pingtung County where he once served as magistrate.</P>
      <P>The premier was accompanied by Council of Agriculture Minister Su Jia-chyuan and
Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung on the tour as part of his community
outreach program during the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>In the company of his octogenarian mother and his wife, Su toured various
sectors of the park which is divided into 18 areas for planting different
tropical floral and fruit species.</P>
      <P>Along the way, Su was often surrounded by crowds of local residents asking to
have their photos taken together with him and cheering him to "go for the
presidency." Some passionate supporters even addressed him as "President Su."
The premier was all smiles while greeting his fans, but he refrained from giving
any response to press queries concerning when he will announce his bid for the
presidency.</P>
      <P>Su instead knelt on the ground and spent 10 minutes carving the words "praying
for a better future for Taiwan, wishing everyone a happy new year" on a big
pumpkin.</P>
      <P>Concluding his tour of the pumpkin section of the agricultural park, Su
dispensed "red envelopes" containing a NT$10 coin to holidaymakers in the park
and wished them a prosperous new year.</P>
      <P>Su is one of the four DPP bigwigs viewed as possible presidential contenders.
The other three are Vice President Annette Lu, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and
former Premier Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>So far, only Hsieh has formally declared his candidacy for the DPP primary
preceding the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh threw his hat in the ring last Friday, a day before the long Chinese New
Year holiday that lasts until Feb. 25.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a former mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung, announced his
candidacy while meeting with his grass roots supporters in Kaohsiung. He told
them that he will take advantage of the Chinese New Year holiday to ponder
issues of public welfare and taxation reform and will then register for the
DPP's presidential primary.</P>
      <P>Registration for the DPP primary will be open from March 5 through March 9,
according to a timetable for the presidential primary finalized by the DPP's
Central Standing Committee last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Party members will vote on both presidential and legislative hopefuls May 6,
after which public opinion polls will be held. The votes of party members are
weighted to comprise 30 percent of a would-be candidate's score, while the
public opinion poll counts for 70 percent. The presidential aspirant who
receives the highest approval rating will be named as the party's presidential
candidate May 30.</P>

In a rare coordinated assault on an American combat outpost north of Baghdad,
suicide bombers drove one or more cars laden with explosives into the compound
on Monday, while other insurgents opened fire in the ensuing chaos, according to
witnesses and the American military. Two American soldiers were killed and at
least 17 were wounded.

The brazen attack, which was followed by gun battles and an evacuation of the
wounded by American helicopters, was almost surely the work of Sunni militants,
most likely Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, according to American and Iraqi officials.

Iran sits on one-tenth of the world's known oil supplies but is using so much
energy these days it may start rationing gasoline as soon as next month.

Part of the reason lies with people such as 42-year-old Seyd Jessem Moosavi. No
one in Mr. Moosavi's family had an automobile when he was growing up. He was the
first to buy one, followed quickly by his father. Now all five of his brothers
have cars, and Mr. Moosavi just bought one for his 25-year-old son.</TEXT>

      <P>According to the country's public functionaries election law, a by-election
should be held within three months after an elective post becomes vacant if the
original office holder has not yet served half of the term.</P>
      <P>With a by-election due by May 19 in Hsu's case, the election committee of Taiwan
Province is planning to schedule the by-election for May 12, as elections in the
country are usually held on the second Saturday of a month.</P>
      <P>Chang was the first from both ruling and opposition camps to explicitly express
intention to run in the mayoral by-election.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who ran under the banner of the KMT in the last Keelung mayoral election in
December 2005, won with 76,162 votes, while Taiwan Solidarity Union's (TSU's)
Chen Chien-ming, who represented the "pan-green camp," took 58,243 votes.</P>
      <P>Another candidate, Liu Wen-hsiung,  a legislator from the opposition People
First Party, which has formed a"pan-blue alliance" with the KMT, garnered 47,932
votes, and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's Wang Tuoh got 2,771 votes
despite his withdrawal from the election to support the TSU's Chen.</P>
      <P>The KMT expelled Hsu from the party after he was found guilty of corruption by
the Keelung District Court in September 2006 for trying to sell a plot of land
he bought from a businessman to the city's bus service department for a windfall
profit. The deal was called off after prosecutors began probes into the case.</P>
      <P>The KMT had since urged Hsu to resign from the mayoral post and launched a drive
to recall him after the request was ignored.</P>
      <P>Chang said he fully understands  Hsu's grievances  and is determined  to win the
mayoral by-election  to fulfill  Hsu's uncompleted missions.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will definitely nominate a
qualified aspirant to run for the Keelung mayorship following the death of the
northern port city's embattled Mayor Hsu Tsai-li, the party's top leader said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun made the remarks while visiting the famous Lungshan
Temple in Taipei to pray for national well-being as part of his community
outreach activities during the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Yu said he will meet with the leading figures of the DPP's Keelung chapter and
opinion leaders familiar with Keelung politics in the next few days to exchange
views on the party's candidacy issue.</P>
      <P>As to whether DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh, a veteran politician in the Keelung
constituency, will likely represent the DPP in the upcoming Keelung mayoral by-
election, Yu said he would not rule out any possible candidate.</P>
      <P>Wang garnered 2,771 votes in the last mayoral election in December 2005, albeit
he announced his withdrawal from the race a few weeks before the election  and
threw his support behind Chen Chien-ming, the candidate of the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, a DPP ally in the legislature, who eventually captured 58,243 votes.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who ran under the banner of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the
last mayoral election, won with 76,162 votes. He was expelled by the KMT last
September after being found guilty of corruption for trying to sell a plot of
land he bought from a buisnessman to Keelung's city bus service department for a
windfall profit. The deal of called off after prosecutors began probes into the
case.</P>
      <P>Hsu died from complications from chronic heart disease Monday a the age of 60.
According to the current public functionary election law, a by-election must be
held within three months because Hsu had not yet serve out half of his term. A
by-election is tentatively set on May 12.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dulan Police Station in Taitung County's Tungho township along the east
coast -- always a scenic spot -- has become a very secure camping area for
tourists thanks to the 24-hour police presence, a spokesman for the station said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Luo Kuang-chung, director of Chengkung Police Precinct of the Taitung County
Police Bureau said the idea behind making the police station into a scenic rest
area is to bridge the gap between the police and people and share the natural
beauty of the scenery surrounding the station with tourists.</P>
      <P>The station's free camping spaces can hold about 10 tents at one time, and no
reservations are needed. Tourists may camp there so long as there is space
remaining, provided that they notify the police. Luo said over 200 people have
camped at the station since March 2006.</P>
      <P>With subsidies  from the East Coast National  Scenic Area Administration
provided for its renovation, Dulan Police Station is now a convenient and
beautiful stopping-off point with a fountain, ecology pond, showers and washing
facilities, all free for those camping at the site.</P>
      <P>Campers may also visit nearby pre-historical relics, Dulan Artist Village, Dulan
sugar factory, and Moonlight Inn--once a shooting location in an old movie. In
addition to the Dulan Police Station, the Tuli Police Station in Taitung County
also offers free camp sites for the public, Luo said.</P>

      <P>Hsinchu -- the "garden city" of northern Taiwan -- is holding a glass art

      <P>Hsinchu Mayor Lin Junq-Tzer said Wednesday  that the city government welcomes

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ultra-endurance marathoner Kevin Lin, along with an American and a
Canadian, completed their run across the Sahara Desert Tuesday (Taipei time) ,
making the trio the first three modern runners to cross the Sahara's grueling
7,300 kilometers.</P>
      <P>Lin, 30, and his fellow ultra-athletes -- Charlie Engle, 44 and Ray Zahab, 38 --
reached the Suez Canal at Egypt's Red Sea Tuesday night after running 111
consecutive days to cross the Sahara -- the world's largest desert. The trio
traversed six countries, beginning with Senegal, but also including Mauritania,
Mali, Niger and Libya, by the time their trek ended in Egypt.</P>
      <P>The trio endured strong winds, which can abruptly raise sand in every direction,
making it difficult to see and breathe, and extreme temperatures, which might
peak as high as 38 degrees Celsius during the day but dip below freezing at
night, on the trek, which was originally scheduled to finish in 80 days.</P>
      <P>They began last November but had to run an extra 200 kilometers under the
surveillance of the Libyan authorities, who at one point refused to grant them
entry visas.</P>
      <P>Lin, who has traveled the world competing in adventure races, said during a
mobile phone call to his mentor Tuesday night that running through turbulent
conditions is nothing new to him, but the past 111 days had tested his physical
and mental limitations.</P>
      <P>He had to change his running shoes from size seven to 8.5 due to swelling, but
this had not forced him to rest for one single day, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin, the first Asian to run a seven-day-six-night Sahara marathon in 2002, is
scheduled to return to Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>A film crew followed trio, chronicling their desert journey for a documentary by
actor Matt Damon's production company, LivePlanet. Damon plans to narrate the
documentary, which will be a film titled "Running the Sahara."</P>
      <P>At several points in their trek, Lin said, they stopped near sparsely populated
wells to talk with villagers and nomads about the difficulties they face finding
water -- prompting them to plan a fund-raiser for the nonprofit group H2O
Africa, which was established to raise awareness about the need for clean water
throughout the African continent.</P>

      <P>Su -- considered a strong contender to become a 2008 presidential candidate of

Wu Ping-jui who accompanied Su during the visit, likely to announce his
presidential bid after the Lunar New Year holidays -- noted that the country
should emulate Kevin Lin, who had just finished the daunting, unprecedented
cross-Sahara marathon, saying that with perseverance and determination,
everybody will succeed as long as they try hard enough.</P>
      <P>Su lauded Lin as having fully demonstrated the "spirit of Taiwan" by achieving
the "impossible dream" of crossing the 7,400-km Sahara Desert by foot in 111
days, carrying the Republic of China national flag on his back.</P>
      <P>The premier said he phoned Lin upon hearing the good news the night before and
told Lin that he is a source of pride for all of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Su visited a coast guard base in Tamshui, Taipei County and

      <P>The new housing market in the central Taiwan city of Taichung recorded growth of
more than 7 percent last year and is expected to grow even more rapidly in 2007,
market experts said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang  Chung-cheng,  chairman  of the Taichung  Real Estate Development
Association, quoted statistics showing that new housing projects launched in
Taichung during 2006 amounted to NT$117.15 billion (US$3.54 billion) in total
value, an increase of NT$9.5 billion, or 7.7 percent, from 2005.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the city's Hsitun District was the most sought-after
neighborhood for house buyers because of its close proximity to the city's
amenities, including the new civic center, the Taichung Opera House and the
Central Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that new housing projects launched in Hsitun District in 2006
totaled NT$31.25 billion, accounting for 35 percent of the new housing market in
Taichung.</P>
      <P>Wang attributed  Taichung's  booming new housing market to increased employment
opportunities brought by the Central Taiwan Science Park and a number of newly
opened hypermarkets, as well as the launch of the first high speed railway
traversing Taiwan's west corridor.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has completed the installation of a nationwide
anti-graft website for ordinary citizens to join the fight against political
corruption by reporting suspicious corrupt cases to relevant law enforcement
authorities, an MOJ official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the new year, the official said the MOJ will mobilize all government ethics
units to investigate suspicious governmental operations in accordance with the
ministry's anti-corruption plan.</P>
      <P>The plan, approved by the Executive Yuan in November 2006, attacks the problem
of corruption from two directions, "eliminating corruption" and "preventing
corruption," the official said.</P>
      <P>The MOJ set up the website to harness all available energy and knowledge in its
efforts to wipe out political corruption. The website went live Jan. 15, 2007,
showcasing government's performance in the anti-corruption campaign and keeping
the public informed of its progress.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage people to report cases of corruption, the MOJ is scheduled
to raise the minimum monetary reward from NT$ 200,000 (US$ 6,062) to NT$
300,000, and the maximum reward from NT$ 6 million to NT$ 10 million, provided
that the Executive Yuan approves of relevant changes to the Anti-Corruption
Informant Rewards and Protection Regulations.</P>
      <P>The official said the MOJ will also craft strategies and decide upon key points
to thoroughly investigate major irregularities at governmental institutions,
especially those pertaining to suspicious governmental operations that score

eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft
and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries  --  has been  blocked  by the
opposition-controlled legislature over 70 times since it was first submitted in
mid-2004.</P>
      <P>The budget for the arms procurement package from the United States was slashed
from NT$610.8 billion to NT$480 billion in 2005 to placate opposition lawmakers.
It was further reduced to NT$340 billion to cover only the purchase of the
submarines and sub-hunting aircraft.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Wu said, he expressed appreciation on behalf of the government
to Chabot for the congressman's long-standing, staunch support for Taiwan's
cause and also called for continued U.S. support of Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Organization and other major international organizations.</P>
      <P>In response to Chabot's inquiries about Taiwan's reaction to China's Taiwan
policies, Wu said that Beijing has been adept at employing two-pronged strategy
-- showing so-called "goodwill" to the people of Taiwan on one hand while
marginalizing Taiwan on the world stage and building up its military forces
targeting Taiwan on the other.</P>
      <P>Beijing has relentlessly strangled Taiwan's attempts to gain maneuvering room in
the international community, most recently barring Taiwan from joining the World
Health Organization and many other NGOs, organizations supposedly least
influenced by politics and completely concerning people's well-being, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu said, despite China's relentless efforts to choke off Taiwan,
militarily and diplomatically, the Mainland Affairs Council has done its utmost
to improve bilateral relations with China in order to maintain peace across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Council efforts to help alleviate tensions across the strait included
persistent  calls for cross-strait  negotiations  and stepped-up exchanges; the
opening of direct cross-strait cargo and passenger  charter  flight  services;
as  well  as  Taiwan's cross-the-board opening up to Chinese citizens for
leisure trips, Wu told Chabot.</P>
      <P>Wu said to Chabot that it is keenly hoped that all Chinese citizens will be
allowed to travel to Taiwan for tourism and to experience Taiwan society and its
democracy for themselves so that people from the two sides will better
understand each other, indirectly enhancing peace and stability across the
strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWSUIT AGAINST REBAR FOUNDER TO BE FILED SHORTLY: LAWYER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
02/21/07  20:57:29
(By Lu-sheng Chu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawyer Chiu Chang, who obtained her doctorate of law (J.D.) in the United
States, said Wednesday that she will represent some Taiwan creditors to file a
lawsuit against fugitive tycoon Wang You-theng in Los Angeles shortly.</P>
      <P>Chiu, who was formerly a legislator-at-large of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said she is sending a copy of a plaint to Wang, who is
currently detained at an immigration center in San Pedro, California, and will
file the plaint to a court of law in the California High Court Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiu said a news conference will be held in Los Angeles within days to brief the
media how and what she will do as a litigator representating part of the Taiwan
creditors after Wang and his wife reportedly having embezzled billions of
dollars in corporate funds from the Rebar Asia Pacific Group before fleeing to
China late last year and then to the United States early this year.</P>
      <P>On Chiu's action, Bern Steves, an expert in international litigation services,
said Wang's case involves a jurisdictional issue at the initial stage and it is
too early to speculate whether the lawsuit against the Wangs will get to a U.S.
court.</P>
      <P>Steves warned that Wang's attorneys could ask the California High Court not to
accept and hear the suit on the premise that none of the "crimes" that the Wangs
were accused of had occurred in the United States.</P>
      <P>Wang has been detained at a San Pedro immigration holding center for illegal
entry into the United States since Feb. 2, when he tried to return to Los
Angeles with both his Republic of China and Dominican Republic passports
canceled, following a failed attempt to flee to Myanmar via Singapore.</P>
      <P>Following a hearing on the Wang case held in mid-February, a next hearing is
scheduled for March 6 or 7, although U.S. justice officials would not confirm
the information.</P>
      <P>The tycoon is wanted by Taiwanese authorities for his suspected involvement in a
series of crimes, including forgery, fraud, insider trading, and embezzlement of
corporate funds from his group.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government has been asked by Taiwan law enforcement authorities to help
extradite the Wangs as the two countries maintain a judicial cooperation pact.</P>
      <P>Fifty-one people related to the Rebar scandal have been probed as suspects, 13
of whom have been detained. The number of people related to the case barred from
leaving Taiwan has increased to 91.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REITERATES TAIWAN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO FREE CHOICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  21  (CNA)
02/21/07  22:04:44
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated Wednesday that only the people of Taiwan
have the right to determine their country's future and the form of relationship
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"In tandem with the spirit of popular sovereignty and the principle of
democracy, nobody else can arbitrarily conclude that ultimate unification is the
only available choice for the development of cross-strait relations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while receiving visiting U.S. Congressman Steve Chabot
(R-Ohio) at the Presidential Office. Also present at the occasion was Stephen
Young, director of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan, which
represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>During a Lunar New Year's Day gathering in his southern hometown in 2006, Chen
unexpectedly announced his intention to cease the functioning of the National
Unification Council (NUC) and the application of the National Unification
Guidelines, both of which were created in the early 1990s when the pro-
unification Kuomintang was in power. His announcement immediately drew strong
reaction from the United States and China as they were skeptical whether Taiwan
would move toward formal independence following the abolishment of the two
symbols of Taiwan's commitment to eventual cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>To the best of his knowledge, Chen said, Young was concerned whether he would
announce sensitive policy initiatives of a similar gravity during the current
Lunar New Year festive season.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had assured Young of "no surprise" this time around. "I have
honored my promise. I just savored sweet dumplings and other festive snacks as
well as exchanged New Year greetings  with townsfolk during my homecoming visit
three days ago.  You can now take it easy and need not be in a stew any more,"
Chen told Young.</P>
      <P>During the NUC dispute, Chen said Chabot didn't hesitate to throw support behind
his decision. Calling Chabot "Taiwan's best friend and one of his dearest
siblings, " Chen said he is grateful for his resolute support for Taiwan's
cause. "Your generosity has helped us withstand hardships and challenges."</P>
      <P>Claiming that he remains open and doesn't harbor any preset stance on the future
development of cross-strati relations, Chen said what he insists is that only
the 23 million Taiwan people have a final say on Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>"And this is why the NUC should cease to function and its guideline should cease
to apply," Chen stressed, adding that his administration managed to do away with
the NUC and its guidelines within one month following his revelation of his
plan.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan-U.S. relations, Chen said he appreciates Chabot's ardent
efforts to push for the signing of a bilateral free trade agreement between the
two countries. It is hoped that both sides can continue working together to
realize this goal, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen further expressed his heartfelt gratitude for Chabot's call for the U.S.
government to agree to senior Taiwanese officials' visits to major U.S. cities,
including Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>"We also wholeheartedly admire and appreciate your courage to push the U.S.
government to review its so-called 'one China' policy on the ground that the
policy is outdated and unfit for today's situation as Taiwan has fully
democratized," Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITRI CALLS FOR IPR CAPITALIZATION TO BOOST BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan should promote capitalization and securitization of intellectual property
rights (IPR) to rev up the development of the knowledge-based  biotechnology
industry,  a researcher with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Lien-tze, a research fellow at ITRI's Biomedical Engineering Research
Laboratory, said the R&amp;D-oriented biotechnology industry tends to require
heavy capital investment over a long period of time to fruition.</P>
      <P>Citing the pharmaceuticals industry, Lee said the overall time needed to develop
and market a new drug could reach 10 years and the cost may hit US$1 billion.
"Investment in this kind of industry is highly risky," he added.</P>
      <P>Unlike the manufacturing-oriented electronic and information technology (IT)
industries, Lee went on, the biotechnology industry is R&amp;D-oriented and its
manufacturing cost is comparatively low.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lee said, the OEM formula commonly used in the IT
industry cannot apply to the biotechnology industry. Any biotechnology company
intending to adopt an OEM business strategy would face the predicament  of
"minimal  profits  and limited development potential," he added.</P>
      <P>According to ACER Group founder Stan Shih's "Smiling Curve" theory,  Lee said
R&amp;D is the most profitable  sector of the pharmaceutical market and the most
promising field for Taiwanese investors to explore.</P>
      <P>The annual turnover of the global biomedical market reaches an estimated US$800
billion, of which sales of new pharmaceuticals account for about US$150 billion,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>To tap this lucrative market, Lee said Taiwan should step up IPR capitalization
or securitization of patenting to offer easier access to needed R&amp;D funds
and accelerate the growth of local biotechnology industry.</P>
      <P>Securitization  is a financing  technique  that allows the corporation to
separate credit origination and funding activities and can thereby convert
illiquid assets into liquid assets to facilitate business operations and
expansion.</P>
      <P>In Stan Shih's "Smiling Curve" theory, the entire business or production process
comprises three sectors -- R&amp;D, manufacturing and marketing/services.
According to Shih, the starting point or R&amp;D and access to end users or
marketing/service are the most profitable, while the manufacturing section is
least lucrative.</P>

in the Philippines is distressing, and President Macapagal-Arroyo should
persuade the Armed Forces to acknowledge the fact and conduct a genuine
investigation, UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston said Wednesday.

      <P>The government has set a goal of increasing the output of renewable energies to
contribute 10 percent of the nation's total electricity output by 2010,
according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said Thursday that the 10% goal would require some 5.13 megawatts
of electricity capacity, most of which would come from wind power -- with an
estimate output of 2.15 megawatts by 2010.</P>
      <P>Energy from hydropower, biofuels, and solar power would fill the remaining
supply gap, they said.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA, taking into account the fluctuations inherent in wind power,
by 2010 that output might result in the generation of 5.74 billion kilowatt-
hours per year, translating into a market value of NT$11.48 billion.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the annual energy output from wind power would be the equivalent to
that generated by 1.43 million kiloliters of oil.</P>
      <P>Wind power facilities could also help eliminate the emission of some 3.45

      <P>Taiwan's 2006 agricultural trade was valued at US$12.58 billion, a decrease of
2.75 percent from the year-earlier level, according to a statistical report
released by the Council of Agriculture (COA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>The COA report was based on its analysis of 2006 agricultural import and export
data provided by the Directorate General of Customs under the Ministry of
Finance, a COA spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The report shows that the island's 2006 agricultural imports totaled US$9.28
billion, showing a slight year-on-year decrease of 0.77 percent; the island's
agricultural exports reached US$3.3 billion, making a significant decrease of
7.91 percent. As a result the overall agricultural trade deficit increased
US$211 million to reach the total of US$5.98 billion.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the island's main agricultural imports are corn, tobacco,
soybean, cotton, frozen beef, milk powder, and broad leaf material.  Main
agricultural exports include frozen tuna, feathers, frozen bonita, eel, wool,
pigskin, frozen mouthbreeder and frozen squid.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwan's frozen tuna exports decreased by US$300 million because
the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)
largely cut Taiwan's 2006 quota for bigeye tuna in November 2005, and Taiwan's
take of yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean slumped. But as the ICCAT has
reinstated Taiwan's 2007 quota for bigeye tuna, its exports value is expected to
rise in the year to come.</P>
      <P>The main source of agricultural imports to Taiwan in 2006 were the United
States, Australia, Japan, Malaysia, and China; the main destinations for exports
were Japan, Hong Kong, China, and the United States, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>Local biotechnology industry's 2006 turnover reached an estimated NT$177.2
billion (US$5.37 billion) , marking an 11 percent year-on-year rise, an
Industrial Development Bureau spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Of the amount, NT$65 billion came from the pharmaceutical sector, NT$43.2
billion belonged to emerging sectors of the biotechnology industry, and NT$69
billion came from the medical device industry which grew rapidly with help from
Taiwan's information-technology industry, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The preliminary statistics also show that over the past five years the yearly
growth rate of the island's biotechnology industry reaches an average of 12
percent. Annual investment in the industry has remained above NT$20 billion
since 2001, and increased to 25.3 billion in 2005. The 2006 amount was estimated
to be NT$21.013 billion.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that biotechnology was a part of the "two trillion,
twin star" plan. The government set up dozens of incubation centers to nurture
biotechnology companies, and plans to establish several technology parks to
bring the benefits of the clustering effect to this industry.</P>
      <P>The government's  three policies  to improve  the island's competence in this
industrial sector include introducing foreign pharmaceutical  factories to
Taiwan,  availing the industry of advantages derived from the electronic and
chemical industries to produce more and better products, and expanding the
international market for Taiwan's medicines.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that in order to help make Taiwan a powerhouse in the
industry, the government established a number of goals, including realizing
investment of approximately NT$150 billion by 2008, achieving a 25 percent
yearly revenue growth rate, establishing more than 500 biotech companies within
10 years, and having 18 successful companies in this industry by 2010, the
spokesman said.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Thursday a newspaper report about
his plan to visit China in March is not factual.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is widely seen as a potential candidate in the 2008 presidential
election, made the denial during a community outreach visit to offshore Penghu
County.</P>
      <P>"I have long worked on a China travel plan, but the timing has not yet been ripe
to make such a visit, " Wang said, adding that he is still waiting for an
opportune time to realize such a plan.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to a China Times report that Wang would visit China in March
in his capacity as the head of Taiwan's top legislative body. According to the
Chinese-language newspaper, Wang would meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao
during his Beijing visit.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said the
report "deviates from truth."</P>
      <P>The report came a week after a Taiwan prosecutor filed corruption charges
against former Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, prompting Ma to quit his post as KMT
chairman. Ma has formally announced his bid for the 2008 presidency.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he would declare his candidacy for the KMT primary for the 2008
presidential election after the current Lunar New Year holiday, Wang said he is
still pondering the issue.</P>
      <P>"I think I need to solicit opinions and views from various social quarters and
grassroots groups before I come to a decision on whether to throw my hat in the
ring," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker said his visit to Penghu is part of his grass roots
outreach activities during the Lunar New Year holiday. At noon, he had a lunch
meeting with volunteer firefighters in the Penghu area in his capacity as the
head of the national volunteer firefighting corps.</P>
      <P>In the company of Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa and other local
political figures, Wang visited the county's popular temples to pray for
national well-being. Later in the day, he visited the county government and
county council on foot, receiving a warm welcome from crowds of local residents
along the way.</P>

      <P>Government vehicles in Taipei City will switch to using E3 ethanol gasoline
within this year on a trial basis, officials at the Ministry of Economic Affairs

      <P>They said the ethanol gasoline will be supplied to these vehicles at specific
state-owned CPC Corp., Taiwan gas stations.</P>
      <P>By 2009, the ethanol gasoline will be available in several other major cities in
Taiwan, and filling stations all around the island will make available both
normal and ethanol gasoline by 2011, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>E3 ethanol gasoline is composed of 97 percent gasoline and 3 percent ethanol.
Countries of the European Union have been using E85 ethanol gasoline, while E93
has been introduced on the market in Brazil.</P>
      <P>Although ethanol mixed fuels can help reduce dependency on fossil fuels and
diminish emissions of greenhouse gases, MOEA officials noted that ethanol can
erode fuel tanks and limit driving performance -- factors which can only be
offset by future improvements.</P>
      <P>Citing a previous survey, MOEA officials said that 1.17 million cars, or 80
percent of all cars made after 2001, are adaptive to ethanol gasoline. However,
cars made before 2001 must be tested to determine whether they can use ethanol-
blended fuels.</P>

It was at least the third truck bomb in a month to employ chlorine, a greenish

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo has sent a letter to Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice criticizing what he called the State Department's  overreaction
to Taiwan's "name rectification" efforts.</P>
      <P>In his Feb. 20 letter to Rice, Rep. Tancredo writes: "First, it is rather
difficult to understand how a decision about what the name of a local business
might be in Taiwan is any of the State Department's concern. Second, for the
State Department to equate the renaming of a gas station with a change Taiwan's
international status is, to say the least, rather puzzling."</P>
      <P>Tancredo was referring to Taiwan's recent decision to rename three of its state-
owned enterprises to get rid of Chinese reference in their titles and add the
word "Taiwan" to make them more identifiable with their country of origin and
avoid confusion with similarly named Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>Referring to China's passage of the anti-secession law in 2005, Rep. Tancredo
writes: "Clearly, this act represented a change in the "status quo" - yet the
strongest and most direct rebuke to China that State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher could muster was "[W]e think it's important for both sides to
focus on dialogue." The best then-White House spokesman Scott McClellan could do
at the time was to characterize the law as "unhelpful."</P>
      <P>The congressman concludes:  "We often hear that the State Department is
concerned about unilateral actions by either China or Taiwan that might change
the 'status quo.' In practice, however, the department seems more than willing
to criticize Taiwan's leaders (often for quite trivial things) , yet very
reluctant to rebuke the leadership in Beijing."</P>
      <P>Tancredo is a member of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus, a Taiwan-friendly
subgroup in the House of Representatives. He has promoted many bills in U.S.
Congress in support of Taiwan's cause in the past few years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, C.T. Lee, president of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, a
Washington-based non-profit organization dedicated to promote international
support for Taiwan's  cause,  echoed Tancredo's view, saying the State
Department reaction to Taiwan's "name rectification" campaign is an irony.</P>
      <P>Lee said in a written statement that reads: "State Department guidelines over
the past decade clearly state that U.S. officials can and may not refer to
Taiwan as the "Republic of China" - only "Taiwan" - since the United States and
Taiwan do not maintain diplomatic relations. (E.g. Taiwan Relations Act,
American Institute in Taiwan, Taiwan desk a the State Department etc...) Now
Taiwan no longer uses "China" but starts using "Taiwan, " and the State
Department criticizes Taiwan for that! It is the ultimate irony!"</P>

      <P>New Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san expressed Friday that boosting the
economy of the southern port city, attracting investment, and luring more
tourists are his three most "urgent tasks" in his new position which he assumed
two months ago.</P>
      <P>Chiu, who holds a master's degree in law from National Taiwan University, had
served as a prosecutor, a lawyer, a legislator and vice chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council before he was appointed by Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu to serve as

      <P>As a professional in the field of law, as well as finance and economics, Chiu
has been commissioned to work to boost the economy of the country's second
largest city, which also has the island's largest port.</P>
      <P>"At the very least, I'm expected to prevent Kaohsiung's economy from becoming a

      <P>Chiu said he thinks one of the urgent tasks is to attract investment in local
enterprises in Kaohsiung, adding that local industries  should  be  upgraded
and  developed  with  local characteristics as part of efforts to maintain their
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He further said that he wants to develop the port city into a "city of hope,"
where investors like to stay on.</P>

that the city can become the last stop on the itinerary of visitors touring

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO PAY HEED TO GROWING CHINESE CURRENCY STASH IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should pay heed to the possible adverse impact on the efficacy of
its monetary policy of the growing Chinese currency stash in Taiwan, an
economist said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hung Tsai-lung, a research fellow with the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said local people may have amassed a total of more than 100 billion
Chinese yuan over the past several years.</P>
      <P>The accumulation of Chinese currency in Taiwan can be attributed to a
combination of factors, including China's chronic trade deficit with Taiwan and
the inclination of Taiwan businesspeople operating in China to bring home
Chinese yuan, Hung said.</P>
      <P>In March 2004, Taiwan's central bank began to allow each local citizen to bring
in up to 6,000 yuan per homecoming visit, and the amount was raised to 20,000
yuan in October 2005. According to an estimate by the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, local people have made a total of more than 12 million visits
to China over the past three years.</P>
      <P>"If each China-bound visitor brings home 6,000 yuan per visit, then that would
mean about 72 billion yuan has been brought into the country over the past three
years, " Hung said, adding that the total domestic yuan stash probably exceeds
100 billion if the Chinese currency brought in before 2004, including earnings
from illegal trade deals between fishing boats from the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, is taken into account.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan may soon fully open its doors to Chinese tourists, Hung said, the
domestic Chinese yuan stash may increase further. Noting that Chinese yuan still
cannot be converted into local currency freely, Hung said the government should
not ignore the possible negative effects of the yuan hoarding in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Money laundering and banknote counterfeiting that could arise from the influx
of yuan onto the black market may only be trivial matters compared with a
possible resulting strain on the domestic currency circulation due to financial
authorities' inability to get real-time monetary market information," Hung said.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Hung said,  the current ban on Chinese yuan conversion would hobble
Taiwanese businesspeople's funding operations and consequently discourage them
from remitting their earnings back to Taiwan from China.</P>
      <P>Hung suggested that the government step up efforts to sign a cross-strait
agreement on the establishment of a cash settlement mechanism. If such a
mechanism cannot be formulated in the near future, he said, Taiwan should
unilaterally open free Chinese yuan conversion through selected banking
institutions.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, we'll be able to properly resolve the issues arising from rapid
accumulation of the Chinese currency in Taiwan, " he added.</P>

"stock vulture" insider trading, prosecutorial coverup of drug trafficking, and
ethical problems involving judicial personnel.</P>
      <P>With no Control Yuan members available to probe whether any government official
should be held responsible for dereliction of duty or violation  of law in those
cases,  the Control Yuan administrator said, people's trust in the government
has been affected.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said, 67 cases involving censure or punishment of
individual government employees are pending approval of Control Yuan members.
"Any delay in finalizing probes into those cases is unfair to all those
involved," he added.</P>
      <P>The absence of Control Yuan members has had an even more serious result, namely
inaction on suspected infractions in assets disclosure reports by public office
holders as well as cases involving conflict of interests and irregularities in
political donations, the official said, adding that the inaction is like
offering "a legal break" to those who violate various "sunshine laws" designed
to promote clean politics.</P>
      <P>The official also lamented the large backlog of petitions filed by individual
citizens over alleged infringements on human rights or personal property rights.</P>
      <P>Noting that the International Ombudsman Institute (IOI) is one of the few
international organizations that Taiwan has been admitted to under its official
title -- the Republic of China, the official said Taiwan has missed three IOI
meetings over the past two years because of the absence of Control Yuan members.
According to the official, China has repeatedly tried, although in vain, to have
Taiwan expelled from the organization.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the Control Yuan has been incapacitated by the Legislative Yuan's
refusal to exercise its power of consent to the president's nominations to the
watchdog body, the official said the memberless Control Yuan poses an
"unprecedented strange phenomenon in the country's constitutional history."</P>
      <P>It is keenly hoped that all the Control Yuan seats can be filled as early as
possible to resume the watchdog body's normal operations in addressing
individual  citizens' petitions  and grievances, protecting their legitimate
rights and interests,  as well as correcting  wrongdoings  of government
agencies and individual officials, and supervising operations of law enforcement
officers.</P>
      <P>President Chen has agreed to redraw a list of nominees for the Control Yuan
seats and asked various political parties to recommend qualified candidates. But
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party,
which holds a slim majority in the legislature, has so far given a lukewarm
response to Chen's call.</P>
      <P>With no signs of reconciliation between the ruling and opposition camps in
sight, it remains unclear when the Control Yuan will resume normal operations,
the analysts said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER U.S. OFFICIAL URGES WASHINGTON TO LEARN ABOUT 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 22 (CNA)
02/23/07  18:15:30
(By Chiehyu Lin &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former U.S. official urged Washington Thursday to acquaint itself well with
the history of the 228 Incident of 1947 in Taiwan, saying he believes that doing
so will be helpful for the U.S. government in forming its Taiwan policy.</P>
      <P>Randy Schriver, former deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs responsible for China, Taiwan, Mongolia and Hong Kong, made the
call at a workshop on the 228 Incident. The workshop was co-organized by the
Brookings Institution, a prestigious  think  tank  in the  U.S.  capital,  and
the Washington-headquartered Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA).</P>
      <P>Schriver and Peng Ming-min, a renowned Taiwanese scholar on international law
and one of the leaders of Taiwan's independence movement, were invited to attend
the workshop hosted by Richard C. Bush, director of foreign policy studies at
the Brookings Institution and former chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Schriver said that the 228 Incident has profoundly affected Taiwan's political
and cultural development,  suggesting  that policymakers in Washington study the
history of the incident which led to the deaths of around 30,000 people.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident was sparked by a skirmish on Feb. 28, 1947, in which Monopoly
Bureau officials who tried to confiscate smuggled cigarettes in Taipei caused
injury to a woman vendor and the death of an innocent bystander, prompting mass
demonstrations and clashes all over Taiwan between locals and mainland  Chinese.
Nationalist government troops moved into Taiwan March 8 and began a brutal
crackdown.</P>
      <P>Schriver said he believes the fact that the U.S. government has never really
understood how important the historic event is to Taiwan has affected the
judgment of its policymakers on the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Making efforts to learn about the tragic event will help the United States in
evaluating the political situation in Taiwan and mapping out its Taiwan policy,
he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. will be able to better understand the historic meaning behind the
current "name rectification" movement promoted by Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, Schriver said, adding that he supports the move to declassify
the documents concerning the 228 Incident, which have been kept confidential for
more than half a century. He added the family members of victims of the 228
Incident have the right of access to information concerning the death of their
loved ones.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that it is a positive thing that many
within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are keen on bidding to
represent the party in the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks after visiting the tomb of Huang Hsin-chieh in
Taipei County's Pali township to pay his respects to the late chairman of the
DPP, whom he said was his life-long mentor who led him along the path into
politics. Accompanying Chen on the visit was Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun announced his bid Thursday to run in the party's
primary for the 2008 presidential election, becoming the second DPP heavyweight
to do so. Former Premier Frank Hsieh was the first to throw his hat in the ring,
announcing last Friday that he would run in the party's primary next month.</P>
      <P>The two other DPP heavyweights -- Vice President Lu and Premier Su Tseng-chang
-- have yet to make an announcement on whether they will also run.</P>
      <P>After visiting Huang's tomb Friday, Chen spoke of his own experience to
represent the party in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"It's all about fate, " the president said, noting that before 2000, he had only
thought about running for re-election as Taipei mayor in 1998. Ma Ying-jeou
defeated Chen in the mayoral election that year and went on to serve as mayor
for two terms before stepping down in December 2006.</P>
      <P>"If you're destined to get the post, then you'll be able to overcome the major
difficulties ahead, even if your chances may look slim," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said he is gratified to see so many capable people within the party keen to
represent the party in the presidential election, adding that "as long as there
is competition, there is progress."</P>
      <P>The president also said that he hopes for a "gentlemen's battle" among the
party's hopefuls in the primary.</P>

      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) is expected to elect a new chairman in the middle of April
to lead the party, KMT Acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed the hope that a new chairman can be elected by that time and said
that party unity is his top concern at this juncture when the KMT is gearing up
to choose its candidates for December's legislative elections and to hold a
primary to select its candidate for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters whether he will vie for the post of KMT chairman, to be
elected in a direct vote by the party's members, Wu said that he is not
considering the matter right now, pointing out that his top priority now is
reinforcing party unity.</P>
      <P>Wu, a KMT first vice chairman, has been serving as the acting chairman in
accordance with the party's regulations following Ma Ying-jeou's resignation
from the post Feb. 13 after Ma was indicted on corruption charges earlier the
same day for his alleged misuse of a special municipal allowance fund during his
two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Ma also announced his presidential bid that same day, making him a possible

The American military quietly waged a campaign from Ethiopia last month to
capture or kill top leaders of Al Qaeda in the Horn of Africa, including the use
of an airstrip in eastern Ethiopia to mount airstrikes against Islamic militants
in neighboring Somalia, according to American officials.

The close and largely clandestine relationship with Ethiopia also included
significant sharing of intelligence on the Islamic militants positions and
information from American spy satellites with the Ethiopian military. Members of
a secret American Special Operations unit, Task Force 88, were deployed in
Ethiopia and Kenya, and ventured into Somalia, the officials said.

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang took time during the Chinese New Year holidays to pay a
visit to a nursing home for veterans in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>During his visit, the premier played snooker with some of the veterans and
wished them prosperity in the Year of Pig.</P>
      <P>Su, widely considered a strong contender within the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP)  to represent the party in the 2008 presidential election, was
tightlipped when asked about when he is going to announce his bid to enter the
race.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said that his primary concern is to do his job well in order to
"live up to the expectations of the public."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, who announced Thursday that he will take
part in the party's primary for the next presidential election, said that he
will do everything he can to win the party's nomination.</P>
      <P>"I have not considered the question of who would be my partner on the ticket for
the presidential election if I were to win the primary, nor have I considered
whether I would join another winner of the primary on a ticket," Yu said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while paying a visit to a temple in Tainan, southern Taiwan,
where he distributed red envelops containing cash to wellwishers.</P>
      <P>Yu said that Taiwan is moving along the path of freedom and democracy but that
it has yet to become a "normal country."</P>
      <P>He touted himself as the one who can best lead Taiwan out of its difficulties to
move forward and also the one who insists most on "Taiwan-centric consciousness"
and who is closest to the "grassroots" public.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Taiwan Society, a local pro-independence group, later the
same day, Yu also spoke of his campaign platform of "making Taiwan into a normal
country within a decade."</P>
      <P>Yu said that he personally thinks becoming a "normal country" involves
rectification of the nation's official designation and the crafting of a
"timely, relevant and viable" constitution.</P>
      <P>Other elements involved in making Taiwan into a normal country will include
gaining membership in the United Nations, establishing a sufficient self-defense
capability, and building a sound economy to compete with other nations around

      <P>Taiwan's new deputy representative to the World Trade Organization (WTO) assumed
office Friday.</P>
      <P>Almost immediately after taking up his new post, Wei Ko-ming began work on
matters concerning the Doha Development Round of WTO negotiations, which aims to
lower trade barriers around the world.</P>
      <P>Wei, a seasoned trade negotiator who once served as deputy head of the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) , is no stranger to WTO affairs as he was deeply involved
in negotiations for Taiwan's WTO accession during his tenure as BOFT deputy
director.</P>
      <P>Before  coming to Geneva,  Wei served as Taiwan's  deputy representative to the
European Union and Belgium. During his more than four years serving in the post,
Wei made contributions to efforts to promote Taiwan's trade and economic
relations with the European Union and Belgium.</P>
      <P>Wei was appointed last September to fill the post left vacant by John C. Deng,
who has been serving as Taiwan's deputy representative to the United States
since late last June.</P>

      <P>Total trade at Taiwan's five free trade zones (FTZs) reached NT$15 billion
(US$455 million) for 2006, an encouraging figure that has led the government to
take more active steps to try to attract more foreign investment in the FTZs,
the vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ming-feng revealed that relevant officials, including those at the Ministry
of Economic  Affairs  and the  Ministry  of Transportation and Communications,
have been working together to come up with new incentives to attract businesses
to invest in the FTZs.</P>
      <P>The  planned  incentives  will  target  businesses  in the international
logistics,  manufacturing  and technical services sectors,  Yeh said, noting
that his council believes the new incentives will bring in a "considerable"
amount of investment which is expected to create numerous job and trade
opportunities.</P>
      <P>As part of efforts to attract more foreign investment, Yeh further said, the
officials also plan to organize at least 13 presentations  overseas this year to
introduce  the investment environment in Taiwan's FTZs.</P>
      <P>According to the council's statistics, as of the end of January, there were a
total of 93 businesses based in the FTZs, which are situated at the Taipei and
Keelung ports in northern Taiwan, the Taichung port in central Taiwan, and the
Kaohsiung port in the south, as well as at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2006, total investment in the FTZs had surpassed NT$9.9
billion, according to statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-PFP ALLIANCE MULLING TASK FORCE TO COUNTER DPP TACTICS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to a name change campaign and a new constitution drive rekindled by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , the People First Party (PFP) and
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) are considering setting up a task force to
tackle the DPP's electioneering offensive, a core PFP aide said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the aide, the KMT-PFP alliance, established in January, will study
ways to fight the DPP's ideological tactics aimed at reinforcing "deep green"
voter support in the December legislative elections and the March 2008
presidential polls.</P>
      <P>As the KMT-PFP alliance vowed in its founding declaration to play a key
stabilizing force in case of contingencies across the Taiwan Strait, the two
parties will not sit idly by should the DPP try to rehash ideological issues to
fuel confrontation in society and shift public attention away from its
corruption scandals, the aide said.</P>
      <P>The KMT-PFP alliance's planned task force is expected to focus on observing the
cross-strait situation and political developments at home so as to prevent the
DPP from scoring political points, the aide said.</P>
      <P>In a related development, PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun said a day earlier that
the PFP insists that no matter whether former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou or
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng represents  the  opposition  "pan-blue
alliance"  in the next presidential election, whoever is picked must also be
endorsed and jointly fielded by the KMT-PFP alliance.</P>
      <P>The KMT, the PFP and the New Party are partners in the loose "pan-blue alliance"
against the pro-independence DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>Although PFP Chairman James Soong is currently in the United States, Lee said
that Soong has been carefully watching political developments in Taiwan but is
in no hurry to pledge his support for either Ma or Wang.</P>
      <P>Soong will cautiously gauge which of the two he will support despite the fact
that Ma seems to enjoy a comfortable lead over Wang, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted PFP lawmakers as expressing worry that Ma's public approval ratings
might continue to drop after he was indicted on corruption charges earlier this
month over his alleged mishandling of a special municipal fund allocated for his
discretionary use during his eight-year term as mayor of Taipei from 1998 to
2006.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of an accord clinched by the KMT and the PFP upon forming their
alliance, the two parties must closely cooperate in the coming legislative and
presidential elections, which is the reason behind the PFP's insistence that any
"pan-blue" candidate hoping to run in the 2008 presidential race must also be
approved by the new KMT-PFP alliance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN TO BEGIN MEDIATING DPP HOPEFULS AFTER PRIMARY REGISTRATION</HEADLINE>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian might begin mediating presidential hopefuls in the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after the registration deadline for
its primary ends March 9, a ranking government official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the Executive Yuan official, Chen will mediate to help the DPP
field the most "winnable" candidate to run in the March 2008 presidential
election during the period from March 9 until late April.</P>
      <P>DPP aspirants can register to run in the party's presidential primary from March
5 to March 9, and the party is slated to make public its official presidential
candidate May 30.</P>
      <P>Should Chen's mediation fail to produce a presidential candidate, the party will
then have to resort to its primary mechanism -- a composite of public opinion
polls and a direct vote among party members -- to screen a hopeful to run in the
presidential race, the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Su Tseng-chang was expected to announce his participation in
the DPP's presidential primary Sunday, following in the footsteps of former
Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun, who made public their
intentions to seek the party's nomination Feb. 16 and Feb. 22, respectively.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu is the only one of the DPP's four top heavyweights who
had yet to announce her presidential ambition and she continued to refuse to
discuss the issue Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, also a former Kaohsiung mayor, called for a "democratic demeanor" in the
DPP's mediation process, because "the DPP is a democratic and institutional
political party" and because "it is vital to restore public confidence in the
party."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS FACTOR IN CROSS-STRAIT INSTABILITY: U.S.</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government needs to take into account all factors affecting stability
across the Taiwan Strait in dealing with cross-strait issues, which include
China's military deployments against Taiwan and the lack of high-level political
contact between the two sides, a U.S. official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the United States has encouraged Beijing to make contact with the
Taiwan government, said Thomas Christensen, deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs with responsibility for China, Taiwan and
Mongolia.</P>
      <P>Christensen made the remarks during a Hong Kong TV interview when asked to
comment on Beijing's criticism that the United States has failed to take any
substantial steps to try to stop the trend toward independence in Taiwan, with
the exception of making some strongly worded statements.</P>
      <P>Christensen reiterated that the United States does not support Taiwan
independence and is opposed to any unilateral action by either Taiwan or China
to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>While people have often focused their attention on action taken by Taiwan, the
United States needs to also take into consideration other factors that cause
cross-strait instability, Christensen said.</P>
      <P>He said the United States aims to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait and hopes Taiwan and China will find a peaceful, mutually acceptable
resolution to their differences.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's recent move to change the names of state-owned enterprises that
contain references to China, Christensen noted that the United States has taken
a clear and consistent stand on this issue, namely that Washington expects
President Chen Shui-bian to honor the commitments he has made publicly,
including those made in his 2000 inaugural address.</P>
      <P>He said the United States takes Chen's pledges seriously and that the statement
released recently by the State Department has addressed the issue in a very
appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>In the statement issued Feb. 9, the State Department said the United States does
not support administrative steps by Taiwan that would appear to change Taiwan's
status unilaterally or move toward independence,  including  changes  in
terminology  for entities administered by the Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>The State Department also called on Chen to fulfill his "four noes" commitments,
namely not to declare independence, not to change Taiwan's national title, not
to push for inclusion of sovereignty themes in the Constitution, and not to
promote a referendum to change the status quo regarding independence or
unification.</P>

      <P>In light of a significant increase in the amount of leftovers during the one-

      <P>Leftovers account for around a quarter of the garbage generated by the average

the whole country produces 4,500 tons of leftovers every normal day.</P>
      <P>During the Chinese New Year festival -- one of the most important traditional

      <P>No-one within the Kuomintang (KMT) has shown any willingness to run for the
party chairman post in a by-election tentatively slated for mid-April or early
May, not even acting Chairman Wu Po-hsiung, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu Den-yih made the comments while answering questions from reporters amid
speculation that Wu Po-hsiung is almost certain to take part in a planned by-
election for the party's top post.</P>
      <P>"No-one has come forward and displayed interest in running, and all media
reports on the issue are sheer speculation, " Wu Den-yih said.</P>
      <P>The KMT is slated to finalize a timetable for the by-election in the next weekly
meeting of its decision-making Central Standing Committee Feb. 28, Wu Den-yih
said, adding that it might be held in the middle of April or early May.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT lawmakers were mixed in their reaction to media speculation that
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan might assume the chairmanship or that Wu Po-hsiung
might take part in the by-election.</P>
      <P>Wu Po-hsiung, the KMT's first vice chairman, took over the post from former KMT
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou earlier this month after Ma was indicted on corruption
charges over alleged misuse of a special municipal allowance when he served as
mayor of Taipei from 1998 to 2006.</P>
      <P>Ma offered to resign as KMT chairman following his indictment and immediately
announced his bid to participate in the 2008 presidential race, making him a
possible opponent of Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who is also
interested in representing the KMT in the presidential race. The KMT is Taiwan's
largest opposition party.</P>
      <P>KMT Lawmaker Wu Chih-yang, Wu Po-hsiung's son, categorically denied the media
rumors that his father is gearing up to run for the party's chair.</P>
      <P>Wu Chih-yang said that "the top priority for my father now is building party
unity and pushing Ma and Wang to discuss their presidential rivalry."</P>
      <P>According to lawmaker Hsu Shu-po, "it would be best" if Lien were to be handed
the KMT chairmanship without having to take part in the by-election, and he
called for KMT members' support for this idea.</P>
      <P>Wu Po-hsiung has yet to make public any intention to run for the KMT
chairmanship, and Ma's aides had better not to speculate over the issue, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Wu Yu-shen, a protege of Ma, argued that Lien should have to run in the
by-election in accordance with the party's mechanism if he is interested in
assuming the KMT chairmanship.</P>
      <P>"Whoever wants to become KMT chairman must follow the party's system and get
elected through the by-election in line with the party's reform efforts," he

      <P>The pro-independence Taiwan Society will hold a memorial event on the eve of the
60th anniversary of the 228 Incident with the theme of "restoring the truth of
the tragedy, " an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Feb. 27 event will take place at Taipei's Machangting Memorial Park -- the
site where many victims of the 228 Incident were executed, said Yang Wen-chia,
secretary-general of the group.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the government and private sectors have held various memorial
events to mark the incident annually for many years, Yang claimed that the
Taiwan Society will discard the "sentimental tone" in which such events have
been held in the past and will take a tough stand this year to seek justice on
behalf of the victims' families.</P>
      <P>Yang claimed that a documentary film on the 228 Incident produced by the Taipei
city government during the term of former Mayor Ma Ying-jeou was an attempt by
the former ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to distort the truth.</P>
      <P>"This is like rubbing salt into the wounds of the victims' families,  which has
brought  them inexpressible  sadness  and resentment," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang said that during the memorial event, his group will try to represent the
bloody atmosphere of 60 years ago through dance and audio-video effects.</P>
      <P>In addition, President Chen Shui-bian will erect a monument condemning the
perpetrators at the scene and lead the participants in performing a ritual
symbolizing a crusade for justice, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the event is "not aimed at stirring up ethnic conflict but
upholding justice."</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has accused the late President
Chiang Kai-shek of being the key perpetrator of the 228 Incident of 1947, in
which thousands of people were massacred by KMT troops suppressing a rebellion
against the KMT's iron-fisted rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To mark the 60th anniversary of the incident, the DPP has put forth a series of
proposals regarding the pursuit of transitional justice,  including  measures
to "eliminate  the remnants  of authoritarian rule" associated with Chiang, such
as removing military guards posted at Chiang's mausoleum, renaming the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall the "Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall" and renaming all
roads named after Chiang.</P>

      <P>Folk singer, writer and producer Ma Chao-chun died at the age of 48 early
Saturday after collapsing the previous night.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the Cardinal Tien Hospital's Yungho branch in Taipei County said Ma
showed no signs of life when he arrived at the hospital. Doctors gave up
attempts to resuscitate him after working on him for more than an hour.</P>
      <P>He left behind a wife and three children, the youngest of whom is just a month
old.</P>
      <P>Ma had a history of high blood pressure  and experienced difficulty  breathing
recently and doctors speculated that the talented musician, who was overweight,
might have died from heart disease.</P>
      <P>Ma made his mark early in life. At the tender age of 19, he became a recording
star and a cash cow for recording companies.</P>
      <P>He reached his zenith in his 20s, when such famous singers like Teresa Teng,
Tracy Huang, Liu Wen-cheng and Fong Fei-fei were keen on cooperating with him
and singing his songs.</P>
      <P>But the sudden death of his father plunged the talented musician into depression
and he began drinking heavily and using marijuana.</P>
      <P>He suffered a further blow when the devastating 9-21 earthquake in 1999
destroyed his music studio, leaving him heavily in debt.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Canadian Court Limits Detention in Terror Cases

Canadas highest court on Friday unanimously struck down a law that allows the
Canadian government to detain foreign-born terrorism suspects indefinitely using
secret evidence and without charges while their deportations are being reviewed.

The detention measure, the security certificate system, has been described by
government lawyers as an important tool for combating international terrorism
and maintaining Canadas domestic security. Six men are now under threat of
deportation without an open hearing under the certificates.

Wall Street Journal:States Set Big Spending Plans As Washington Preaches
Austerity

Washington may currently be focused on fiscal austerity. But a major spending
spree is shaping up in the states, as local legislators abandon a half-decade of
fiscal conservatism to pursue bigger budgets.

From New York to Montana to California, states are proposing budget increases
that outpace inflation and far exceed the 1% rise in domestic outlays -- outside
of defense and homeland security -- that President Bush recently proposed in his
fiscal 2008 federal budget.</TEXT>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang announced his bid to represent the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su made the announcement at Fort San Domingo in Tamsui, Taipei County. Choosing
the historic site originally built by the Spanish in 1628 and seen by the
Taiwanese as a sign of the country's previous foreign rulers, Su said Taiwan's
democracy must not step back and that "the owner of Fort San Domingo must not
change again."</P>
      <P>Su said the people of Taiwan need a leader with "a blueprint for governing the
country as well as resolution, willpower and executive ability that can make
Taiwan keep advancing."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan needs to break constraints on its international activities, form
a united national identity, create new opportunities for economic development,
deal with new social problems, promote quality of life, build a mature
democratic culture, re-establish the people's trust and seriously address the
challenges facing the next generation.</P>
      <P>Su claimed that his personal history from a DPP founding member to the party's
chairman, from Pingtung county commissioner to legislator,  Taipei  county
commissioner,  Presidential  Office secretary-general and premier proves him
"trustworthy, capable and honest."</P>
      <P>Registration for the DPP's presidential primary is set to take place March 5-9.
Former Premier Frank Hsieh and DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun have declared their bids
to compete in the primary, which according to the party leadership might not be
held if negotiations convened by President Chen Shui-bian successfully determine
the party's candidates for president and vice president.</P>
      <P>Su's declaration left Vice President Annette Lu the only one of the four top DPP
heavyweights expected to compete for the party's nomination that had not
announced her bid, while none of the others had nominated their running mate.</P>

      <P>Ties between Taiwan and the United States have been growing steadily despite
Washington's criticism of Taiwan, Republic of China Representative to the United
States David Ta-wei Lee said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although President George W. Bush criticized the Taiwan leadership
in 2003 and then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell described Taiwan as a
"landmine"  in Washington-Beijing relations in 2004, U.S.-Taiwan relations have
been growing steadily as U.S. criticism on Taiwan has eased off over the past
couple of years.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a speech titled "Current Situation of Taiwan-U.S.
Ties, " at an event held in Washington,  D.C. to commemorate the Feb. 28
Incident, which has left deep scars on Taiwan's contemporary political history.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwan people must strive to retain a system of freedom and
democracy -- values that are identical to those pursued by the U.S.</P>
      <P>The system of freedom and democracy -- which allows the Taiwan people to
criticize the president and the government -- has above all granted the people
of Taiwan the right to choose their future freely, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>To defend this right, nevertheless, Taiwan must have the ability to defend
itself, he went on.</P>
      <P>Compared with China's continuous military build-up, with its military budget
growing by double digits annually, Lee said, Taiwan's overall defense budget for
2007 has not even been passed, while a bill governing procurement of weapon
systems from the United States has been long-stalled in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes the 2007 overall defense budget and the U.S. weapon
procurement bill will be passed by the Legislative Yuan in March as a boost to
Taiwan's system of freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>He also called on the Taiwan public of all political persuasions to consolidate
for the cause of the nation and to retain their freedom and democracy.</P>

      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) will work closely with its ally, the
Kuomintang (KMT), in pushing through major legislation in the new Legislative
Yuan session, a PFP legislator in charge of the party's policy said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Daniel Hwang, executive director of the PFP Policy Committee, told reporters
that a proposed amendment to the Organic Law of the Central Election Commission
(CEC) that failed to pass in the last legislative session will continue to be a
priority on the legislative agenda when the legislature begins to screen draft
bills in early March.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the PFP and the KMT will try to have the legislature complete the
third reading of the amendment in the new legislative session because the
legislation is needed to ensure a fair and just presidential election in 2008.</P>
      <P>He added that although the DPP opposed the amendment in the last legislative
session, the proposed legislation will get passed easily in the new session as
long as Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is determined to enforce the
legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by the KMT would have the CEC's members selected
according to the ratio of seats held by each political party in the legislature,
instead of being nominated by the premier and appointed by the president as is
the case at present.</P>
      <P>The KMT has complained that 15 of the 17 members currently serving on the CEC
are from the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union.</P>
      <P>On the final day before the last legislative session ended Jan. 19, DPP
legislators resorted to physical violence to block the draft amendment from
passing on the grounds that the budget bill was more important and should have
been reviewed first.</P>
      <P>However, opposition legislators refused to make concessions to the DPP lawmakers
and insisted on pushing for a vote on the third reading of the amendment.</P>
      <P>To prevent the speaker from re-entering the legislative floor after a recess to
continue the legislative process, radical DPP lawmakers even locked the main
entrance to the legislature with a motorcycle padlock.</P>
      <P>The legislative session ended without passing any bills and left the central
government without a fiscal budget after the start of the fiscal year for the

      <P>More than 60 percent of Taiwanese citizens do not think the identification of
the late President Chiang Kai-shek as the prime culprit behind the 228 Incident
will harm harmony between ethnic groups, according to the results of a survey
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>Three days prior to the 60th anniversary of the 1947 tragedy, the Taiwan
Thinktank held a news conference to announce the results of its recent poll on
public perceptions of the incident and ethnic relations.</P>
      <P>The 228 incident refers to an uprising against the corrupt Kuomintang (KMT)
regime, and the government's brutal crackdown on Taiwanese people, who had just
come under the China-based KMT rule following the end of half a century of
Japanese colonization. Thousands  of  Taiwanese,  including  many  of  the
nation's intelligentsia, were murdered, leaving a scar on the nation's
collective memory that exists to this day.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether they agreed that the identification of Chiang as the
prime culprit behind the incident could damage relations between the country's
ethnic groups, 60.9 percent of the respondents said it would not while 27.9
percent said it would.</P>
      <P>"Ethnic groups" in Taiwan generally refer to Hoklo (or Hokkien) , Hakka,
Waishengren and indigenous people.</P>
      <P>A 600-page research report titled "The 228 Incident: A Record on Responsibility"
published by the semi-official 228 Incident Memorial Foundation last year named
the former strongman as the person most responsible, raising controversy.</P>
      <P>The poll results also said 46.7 percent of the respondents agreed that efforts
to clarify truth of the incident so far have been insufficient; 43.8 said that
commemorating the incident would harm ethnic harmony, while 47.7 said it would
not.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ethnic problem is serious, 47.3 percent said yes while 38.7
said no, the think tank officials added.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, a political scientist at Academia Sinica, said at the conference
that the percentage of people perceiving serious ethnic problems has risen
significantly over the past two decades. "The reason is the worsening of
political conflicts, and political leaders should properly address this
problem," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chun-kai, a professor of history at the Catholic Fu Jen University,  said
standing  institutions  should be set up to investigate the 228 Incident as well
as the "White Terror," the KMT's violent purge of so-called "leftists" in the
1950s.</P>
      <P>"Only  the  restoration  of  truth  and  clarification  of responsibility can
really improve ethnic harmony," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll was conducted Feb. 13-14 and received 936 valid responses.</P>

      <P>The government has stepped up checks at airports and seaports as Taiwan
holidaymakers return home from abroad at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday,
in a bid to keep contagious diseases at bay, a health official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health has assigned
extra manpower at the country's borders to watch for the entry of Taiwan
citizens who have made leisure trips to Southeast Asia, China, Hong Kong and
Macau and might be carrying contagious diseases.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said traditionally, the days after the
Lunar New Year holiday sees the annual apex of the risk of disease brought in by
inbound passengers.</P>
      <P>Shih said the CDC has tried hard to bar the entry of diseases such as avian flu,
arboviruses, intestinal and respiratory diseases in general and dengue fever,
influenza and bacillary dysentery in particular.</P>
      <P>Most recently, Shih said, two Taiwan citizens who had traveled to Thailand for a
few days had become infected with bacillary dysentery, while 107 out of 109
reported dengue fever cases in Taiwan last year were picked up on trips to
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Shih called for returning travelers to fill in forms at the airport or seaport
about their symptoms if they develop fever, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes
or jaundice.</P>
      <P>People who develop such symptoms in the month after their return from abroad
should also report their conditions and disease history to the health
authorities, Shih noted.</P>

      <P>A man was rescued unscathed Sunday after being trapped for nine days on a rock
ledge in a mountainous area of Hungye village in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>The 49-year-old Chung Fu-chin was hungry but otherwise all right, according to
his rescuers from the Taitung fire department.</P>
      <P>Chung, who worked as a ranger for local fruit farmers and hunters, said he fell
down a precipice Feb. 16 while inspecting shelters belonging to his employers
and landed unharmed on a rocky ledge about 30 meters above a ravine from which
he was unable to climb either down or up.</P>
      <P>Trapped without food or water, Chung said he survived by eating leaves and
drinking water dripping down the precipice.</P>
      <P>He was boosted by the sound of intense firecrackers from the nearby Hungye
village Feb. 17 which was Chinese New Year's Eve, but his hopes of getting
through the ordeal faded as the sound of firecrackers became fewer and further
between with the passing of New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Chung said he saw a man walking into the ravine Sunday morning and began to blow
his whistle loudly to draw his attention.</P>
      <P>The man, a photographer trying to capture the natural beauty of the ravine, was
surprised to see Chung on the ledge and quickly alerted police in Hungye
village.</P>
      <P>It took rescuers three hours to drop a rope to Chung from the top of the
precipice and help him abseil down into the ravine to safety.</P>
      <P>The rescuers said afterward that Chung had almost eaten all the leaves he could
reach from his rocky perch.</P>

A group of influential Christian conservatives and their allies emerged from a

The event was a meeting of the Council for National Policy, a secretive club

Although little known outside the conservative movement, the council has become

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Monday that the non-profit 228 Incident
Memorial Foundation, which was inaugurated in 1995 and which is slated to become
history in 2010, will "exist forever."</P>
      <P>Su said he will see to it that the foundation -- established by the Executive
Yuan in April 1995 based on the Compensation and Rehabilitation Act which was
signed into law by then President Lee Teng-hui for the 228 Incident of 1947 to
deal with compensation and rehabilitation matters for the victims of the
incident -- will not become history in 2010 and instead will remain in
operation.</P>
      <P>Su said that since 2000 when the Democratic Progressive Party came to power, the
government has presented certificates to families of the 228 Incident victims to
clear the victims' names.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, Su said, the foundation has not only provided
compensation to the families of the victims of the incident, it has also
consoled  them by holding  memorial  activities, investigating the truth, and
paying personal visits to them.</P>
      <P>The foundation has compiled a mammoth archive of 16 volumes about the 228
Incident -- which happened due to the mismanagement of the then Taiwan
provincial government and cost thousands of people their lives -- so as to
provide researchers with accurate accounts for their studies on that period in
history, Su added.</P>
      <P>The incident severely impeded social harmony and created ethnic cleavage. After
the lifting of martial law in 1987, the government, realizing the impact the
incident had had upon our society, decided to ameliorate this historic tragedy
and to promote integration of all ethnic groups. In 1990, the Executive Yuan set
up a task force, inviting scholars and experts to study the incident. The
"Report of the February-28 Incident" was then published in 1992. In 1995. the
Feb. 28 Memorial Monument was established in the Feb. 28 Peace Park in Taipei
City, which has served as a symbol and a cornerstone for a more harmonious
society.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su said a "228 Peace Fund" will be established soon by the government
in the hopes that NT$1.5 billion will be allocated over five years to help
finance the sustainable operations of the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S, DPP'S TRUST INDICES UP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Trust indices for both President Chen Shui-bian and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) rose in the latest public opinion poll conducted in
February, the Global Views Monthly reported Monday.</P>
      <P>In its Taiwan public mood index (TPMI) survey for February, the magazine found
that Chen's trust index had risen to 33.7, up 0.7 points from January, while the
DPP's "ruling side trust index" had advanced to 34.6, up one point from January.</P>
      <P>The monthly attributed the rising trust indices mainly to the president's and
the DPP's recent steps aimed at winning back the hearts and souls of pro-
independence diehards ahead of the DPP presidential primary, including the
removal of references to the late President Chiang Kai-shek from Taiwan and the
changing of the names of several state-owned enterprises to add "Taiwan" to
their titles.</P>
      <P>The trust index for Premier Su Tseng-chang, however, dropped 1.5 points to 52.7
in February, the survey found. Despite the fall, Su remained the most popular
figure among the DPP heavyweights and the only DPP official to enjoy a trust
index exceeding 50, pollsters of the monthly said.</P>
      <P>By comparison, the survey found, the trust index for former Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou remained at 54.2, the same as that posted in January. The
February survey was conducted before Ma resigned as KMT chairman Feb. 13, the
day he was indicted on corruption charges.</P>
      <P>The trust index for the main opposition KMT dropped -- down 2.5 points to 46.5
in February, according to the survey results.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan public mood index stood at 39.5 in February, the same as that posted
in January. That index was composed of a political confidence index, which stood
at 43.1, and an economic confidence index, which stood at 35.8, according to the
monthly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON 2008 TICKET AIMED AT BOOSTING DPP COHESION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was aiming to strengthen the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's) cohesion when he expressed hope that the
presidential aspirants who finish first and second in the party primary can form
a ticket for the 2008 presidential election, sources at the Presidential Office
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The primary will consist of two parts, with a DPP member vote accounting for 30
percent of individual candidate's total score and public opinion polls
accounting for 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The sources were responding to reports by the Liberty Times, a major local
newspaper, that the president said a day earlier that he hopes coordination he
initiated among the presidential hopefuls will move in line with the opinion
poll results, with the two aspirants who place first and second forming a ticket
for the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen reportedly said he will start to listen to views from the presidential
hopefuls and the party after registration for the primary starts March 5 to
bring about a coordination mechanism that can be accepted by all. He was also
reported to have noted that some had suggested that opinion polls should decide
the rankings and that the member vote should be scrapped to avoid division.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Premier Su Tseng-chang
have each announced their intentions to join the race to represent the DPP in
the election. Vice President Annette Lu is the only DPP heavyweight yet to
announce her intentions.</P>
      <P>But the president will also respect whatever decision the two hopefuls who
finish first and second in the primary make on forming a ticket, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the party has to unify in the March 2008 presidential election and
that the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections in December 2006 clearly
demonstrated that all the factions in the DPP must unite in order to be
victorious, according to the reports by the Liberty Times.</P>
      <P>The DPP retained its hold on the Kaohsiung mayorship by a slim margin, despite
the fact that a series of scandals surrounding the president's close aides and
family members in 2006 seriously dented the party's approval ratings. Although
the DPP lost the Taipei mayoral election, it was able to expand its support base
in Taiwan's capital, traditionally a stronghold of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>"The DPP's most formidable rival is not the KMT nor former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-
jeou, but rather a lack of solidarity within the DPP itself," the report quoted
the president as saying.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged candidates in the various elections to be held in
2007 Monday to run "rationally and responsibly."</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal at a Lunar New Year gathering at the Presidential Office in
which Chen and Vice President Annette Lu extended New Year greetings to their
staff.</P>
      <P>Noting that 2007 will be an "election year," Chen said he hopes all electoral
battles will be gentleman's battles.</P>
      <P>More importantly, Chen said it is hoped that all participants will refrain from
adopting election campaign ploys designed to hinder approval of the central
government's general budget -- which includes funds for arms purchases -- and
other proposed bills related with people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Chen also said the calligraphy characters "Taiwan" printed on the red envelopes
he handed out symbolize his great affection for the country and that the
government's policy on changing the names of state-owned companies is only a
small step toward making Taiwan a "normal" country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO DEAL WITH SCRAPPING CHIANG MEMORIAL HALL STEP BY STEP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
02/26/07  19:12:12
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that the government will deal with the
issue of scrapping a mausoleum and a memorial hall for the late President Chiang
Kai-shek step by step.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he attended an international seminar to mark
the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident, an uprising against the corrupt
Kuomintang administration under Chiang that began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed
by a bloody crackdown, resulting in tens of thousands of civilian deaths. The
seminar was sponsored by the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Chiang's mausoleum in Tzuhu, Taoyuan County, is a feudal legacy
completely out of tune with a democratic era. Chiang's embalmed body was
temporarily placed there when he died in 1975 and is now awaiting reburial in a
military cemetery in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the existence of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, located
in downtown Taipei, is also highly controversial, given the fact that it was
built when the line between the KMT and the nation was thin.</P>
      <P>When dealing with historic legacies, the government is bound to encounter steep
resistance and opposition, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"But I'm convinced that justice will be upheld and that the people will make the
right choice so as to let the country emerge from the shadow of the past and
move toward becoming a normal, complete, beautiful, progressive and great
country," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that "228" symbolizes the suffering of the Taiwan people for over half
a century and stands for a total denial of freedom and democracy by an alien,
authoritarian regime.</P>
      <P>"It was an authoritarian regime's ruthless suppression of basic human rights and
was by no means a rebellion caused by misgovernment or conflict between the
people and the police as claimed by some," according to Chen.</P>
      <P>"If it were that simple, there would not have been martial law that lasted for
more than three decades, " he said, referring to the declaration of martial law
in the year following the incident that was not lifted until 1987.</P>
      <P>To define the 228 Incident as misgovernment or conflicts between the police and
the people is an attempt to "paper over" the past authoritarian brutality, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He said the past administration saw only the sufferers and victims and never
touched on the ones who imposed the suffering or the perpetrators of the brutal
suppression.</P>
      <P>"Such a passive approach might avoid social conflict for the time being, but
will never uphold justice and true forgiveness and reconciliation will never be
achieved," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the 99-piece "Tahsi files" relating to the 228 Incident were
exchanges between Chiang and Taiwan Garrison Commander Chen Yi and other ranking
party, government and military officials.</P>
      <P>The exchanges were enough to prove that Chiang was deeply involved in the
killings and that "it was an open fact that it was Chiang's decision to send
troops to crack down on the uprising," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Peng Meng-chi, then the commander of the Kaohsiung Fortress, killed around 2,500
people, which won him notoriety as the "Kaohsiung butcher. " Despite this,
Chiang promoted Peng to Taiwan garrison commander, demonstrating his support and
endorsement.</P>
      <P>"Chiang was undoubtedly the main culprit behind the 228 Incident judging from
the related historical documents and government files," Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang continues to enjoy special status like a feudal king and those
who imposed suffering during the 228 Incident and the ensuing martial law rule
have escaped persecution, which Chen said is "intolerable to the victims and
family members of the incident."</P>
      <P>The president described his name rectification drive of recent years, including
changing the name of the road in front of the Presidential Office to Ketagalan
Boulevard, the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport to Taiwan Taoyaun
International Airport as well as the dismantling of more than 200 Chiang Kai-
shek statutes in military barracks -- as the "first step toward addressing
history seriously."</P>

      <P>Promotion of casual games by the online video game industry has expanded the
market by bringing in many who would otherwise be outsiders and changed the
composition of the virtual world, according to a recent study.</P>
      <P>The Market Intelligence Center (MIC) under the quasi-official Institute for
Information Industry (III) conducted research into online video game markets and
found that light players, who spend less than an hour per day playing games,
make up 36 percent of online gamers and for the first time outnumbered medium
and heavy players, the MIC officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Heavy players, who play games for more than four hours a day, constitute 27.5
percent of the market while medium players make up 35.9 percent, the study said,
adding that compared to last year's survey, light players have showed an
increase in percentage while both of the other two categories showed a relative
decline.</P>
      <P>Heavier players tend to prefer multiplayer games, strategy games, role-playing
games and games with more complex design that require more skill and practice,
while light players favor simpler ones, MIC researchers said.</P>
      <P>With the game industry now making greater efforts to develop and promote casual
games that are simple and suitable for short breaks, many people that were too
busy to play games are being drawn into the circle of online video game players,
the study said.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will seek during  negotiations  with China
wider  applications  for cross-Taiwan  Strait charter flight services  to allow

      <P>Wu made the remarks following a wish expressed by President Chen Shui-bian
during a Lunar New Year party with China-based Taiwan businessmen that if
negotiations with China over charter flights and the issue of Chinese citizens
coming to Taiwan for tourism are successful, foreign nationals traveling to
Taiwan from China, Chinese tourists and China-based Taiwanese businessmen should
all be allowed to board direct cross-strait charter flights.</P>
      <P>Noting that direct cross-strait  charter flights  are only available to
Taiwanese businessmen, their dependents and other Taiwan citizens, including
tourists and students, during the Lunar New Year holidays, Tomb Sweeping
Festival, Dragon Boat Festival and Mid-Autumn Festival,  Wu said the MAC will
continue  to push for wider availability of the charter flight services to other
categories of passengers.</P>
      <P>The MAC will also seek to allow cargo to be transported across the strait via
direct charter flights, Wu added.</P>
      <P>He refused to speculate on when the negotiations will be completed,  saying
only that the MAC has been  "active  and enthusiastic" on the matter and
expressing hope that the Chinese authorities will act in a similar manner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei said opening
Taiwan to Chinese tourists is a set policy of the government and an expanded
cross-strait charter flight program would also be welcomed by both the
government and the private sector.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he had no idea when Chinese tourists will be allowed to Taiwan or when
direct cross-strait charter flight services will be expanded to weekends, but
added that March would be the most appropriate time for the programs to kick

President Bush has decided to send an unusually tough message to one of his most

that the newly Democratic Congress could cut aid to his country unless his
forces become far more aggressive in hunting down operatives with Al Qaeda,

Wall Street Journal:Policy Makers At Fed Rethink Inflation's Roots

For decades, a simple rule has governed how the Federal Reserve views the
nation's economy: When unemployment falls too low, inflation goes up, and vice
versa.

But Fed officials have rethought that notion. They believe it takes a far bigger
change in unemployment to affect inflation today than it did 25 years ago. Now,
when inflation fluctuates, they are far more likely to blame temporary factors,
such as changes in oil prices or rents, than a change in the jobless rate.</TEXT>

      <P>During the White Terror, around 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned or executed
for their real or perceived opposition to the Kuomintang government led by
Chiang Kai-shek, according to a report by the Executive Yuan. Some prosecuted
Taiwanese were labeled by the Kuomintang as "bandit spies", meaning spies for
Chinese communists, and punished as such. The "White Terror" left many native
Taiwanese with a deep-seated bitterness towards the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek,
and sometimes mainlanders.</P>
      <P>Shen and Duan said that according to statistics published by a foundation
dealing with compensation for the "bandit spy" cases during the martial law
years, some 8,488 applications have been filed with the foundation as of Feb. 9.</P>
      <P>The number of those who were compensated for totaled 6,341, among whom 58
percent of are of Taiwanese origin and 43 percent are mainlanders.</P>
      <P>Judging from the figures, Shen said the gap of Taiwanese and mainlander victims
is not significant.</P>
      <P>Those responsible for the imposition of suffering were a few led by the late
Chiang, although blame was shifted to the mainlanders as a whole.</P>
      <P>The duo spoke positively of Wu Nai-teh, a researcher of Academia Sinica, the
highest research institute in Taiwan, who is promoting a private version of a
"Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission, " but urged the government to take the
lead in forming a "white terror" commission to investigate the truth so as to
uphold the "transitional justice" advocated by the DPP.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative to the Philippines donated 50 police motorcycles on
behalf of the Republic of China government to the Philippines' Bureau of Fire
Protection (BFP) under the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG)
Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-hsing, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Manila
symbolically transferred keys to the motorcycles to the Philippines' DILG
Secretary Ronald Puno in the ceremony held at the BFP's headquarter. Puno
reciprocated by presenting a "certificate of thanks" to Wu.</P>
      <P>The donation is the second extension of fire fighting aid since the Philippines'
DILG ex-secretary Angelo Reyes made a verbal request of help from Taiwan in
2004. Taiwan's government made the first donation of two ambulances, fire
fighting equipment, and 140 police motorcycles in 2005.</P>
      <P>Puno admitted that the BFP is short of money to purchase or maintain equipment,
adding that these 50 motorcycles will be distributed to remote townships for
fire patrol duties.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan's government hopes to help the Philippines in building safer
cities.  In addition to the donations  to the Philippines government, Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO FOREIGNERS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that foreign nationals and Chinese tourists
should be given access to direct charter flight services across the Taiwan
Strait if Taipei and Beijing finally come to terms on relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending a Lunar New Year gathering at Taipei Grand
Hotel of Taiwanese businesspeople operating in Cina, known locally as
"taishang."</P>
      <P>After years of efforts, Chen said, progress has been made on cross-strait
negotiations over the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists as well as the
launch of regular cross-strait charter flight services.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that bilateral talks can come to fruition in the near future so
that ordinary Chiense people can visit Taiwan to experience diversity, openness
and hospitability in local society, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the two sides have reached consensus on technical  details
regarding the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists, including the "group-in,
group-out" formula, the daily number of Chinese tourists to be allowed to enter
Taiwan, regulations governing travel agencies, delivery of travel documents,
travel quality assurance, treatment of overstaying visitors and a mechanism for
handling emergencies.</P>
      <P>Chen said relevant government agencies will continue negotiations with China on
unsettled issues to pave the way for entry of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>As to the launch of direct charter flights, Chen said significant progress has
been made in this regard over the past two years. "I'm convinced that convenient
direct cross-strait passenger and cargo flight services will become available on
a regular basis in the not too distant future," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said the government has completed an overall review of the
"mini three links" services between the Taiwan-held outlying island of Kinmen
and Matsu and port cities of Xiamen and Mawei in China's Fujian province. The
government will adopt some flexible adjustments to expand availability of
relevant services.</P>
      <P>The government will also allow for conversion of Chinese currency in small
amount on an experimental basis, Chen said, adding that all these measures are
aimed at promoting development of cross-strait relations in a constructive

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO DEAL WITH FALLING BIRTH RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
02/26/07  23:39:37
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should take measures early on to deal with likely impacts of the
dropping birth rate, according to a report released by the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER), a local think thank.</P>
      <P>The TIER report also called on the public to accept cohabitation and children
born out of wedlock, which it claimed could help solve the issue.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the average fertility of women in Taiwan in
2005 was 1.1 babies per woman, the report noted.</P>
      <P>The figure was lower than the world average total fertility rate -- 2.7 babies
per woman -- and the 1.6 babies average of advanced countries, the report said,
adding that the figure was only higher than the current 1.0 babies per woman in
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Following this trend, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
estimated that in 2017, the population of people aged 65-year-old  and above
will surpass that of people aged 14-year-old and under.</P>
      <P>A reduction in the number of children could cut teaching jobs at primary and
middle schools, and might decrease the demand for medical services for women and
children, the TIER added in the report.</P>
      <P>In addition, the falling birth rate could cut the labor force, which will be
detrimental to Taiwan's economic growth, the report said, adding that raising
labor productivity is thus becoming an important task.</P>
      <P>However, it is impossible to lift the labor productivity to a level capable of
solving all the negative influences resulted from the declining birth rate,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>For instance, by 2035, the Germany government will need to raise labor
productivity by 15 percent in order to cope with the shrinking, economically
active population, the report said. Yet, it will be possible to increase it by
only six percent at most, the institute noted.</P>
      <P>Citing Japan as a further example, the report said that the measures proposed by
the Taiwan government, such as providing subsidies, or maternity leave, might
not generate satisfactory results, as they failed in Japan in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>However, the report noted that western or northern European countries are
successful in dealing with the slumping birth rate by adopting different family
values.</P>
      <P>In these countries, women enjoy a high status, and children are independent at
early ages, the report said, adding that cohabitation and illegitimate children
are more socially accepted.</P>
      <P>According to the report, unless people in Taiwan change their family values it
will be difficult to boost the fertility of women.</P>
      <P>However, the think tank admitted that changing family values is not likely to
happen in the foreseeable future. As a result, the government should help those
who are willing to have a baby strike a balance between work and family, the
report urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER IN NO HURRY TO ANNOUNCE CANDIDACY: AIDES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a stalwart of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , is in no hurry to announce his presidential candidacy, his
aides said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Although Wang is widely seen as a potential contender for the 2008 presidency,
his aides said that he has no plans to formally announce his bid at present but
might do so around the Lantern Festival -- which falls on March 4 this year.</P>
      <P>At that time, Wang will put forward a comprehensive discourse and vision on his
philosophy of how to rule the country, his aides said.</P>
      <P>December's legislative elections are Wang's top concern for the time being as
they are critical to the KMT's chances of victory in the 2008 presidential race
and will have ramifications for the party's sustainable development and
continued cooperation with the People First Party to maintain a majority in the
Legislative Yuan, they said.</P>
      <P>In addition, they went on, the KMT's chairman election and the variables
surrounding former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, are also issues of concern to Wang.</P>
      <P>Ma stepped down from the party's top post and announced his desire to take part
in the next presidential polls after being indicted in the middle of this month
on corruption charges over alleged misuse of a special municipal allowance
earmarked for his discretionary use during his term as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006.</P>
      <P>These thorny issues must be carefully handled by the new KMT chairman, the aides
quoted Wang as saying. Wang contends that it is better to elect a new chairman
within the next month, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>But Wang remains unchanged regarding his plan to visit China as part of his
efforts to make peace cross the Taiwan Strait, despite the fact that the planned
trip may be postponed to April from originally scheduled March, the aides said.</P>
      <P>Wang also favors the idea of inviting Honorary Chairman Lien Chan to assume the
KMT's chairmanship the sooner the better, they said, adding that Wang is not
seeking to compete against acting KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung for the
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of several recent polls, Wang's aides said that more than 60
percent of respondents said no indicted candidates should be allowed to pursue
the presidency, ahead of 37 percent who are in favor of a recent KMT rule change
to give Ma the right to take part in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien is expected to help mediate between Ma and Wang in seeking the
KMT's nomination to represent the party in the next presidential race, they
said.</P>

      <P>The new record was twice the average number of passengers each day at the

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO DEAL WITH FALLING BIRTH RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should take measures early on to deal with likely impacts of the
dropping birth rate, according to a report released by the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER), a local think thank.</P>
      <P>The TIER report also called on the public to accept cohabitation and children
born out of wedlock, which it claimed could help solve the issue.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the average fertility of women in Taiwan in
2005 was 1.1 babies per woman, the report noted.</P>
      <P>The figure was lower than the world average total fertility rate -- 2.7 babies
per woman -- and the 1.6 babies average of advanced countries, the report said,
adding that the figure was only higher than the current 1.0 babies per woman in
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Following this trend, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
estimated that in 2017, the population of people aged 65-year-old  and above
will surpass that of people aged 14-year-old and under.</P>
      <P>A reduction in the number of children could cut teaching jobs at primary and
middle schools, and might decrease the demand for medical services for women and
children, the TIER added in the report.</P>
      <P>In addition, the falling birth rate could cut the labor force, which will be
detrimental to Taiwan's economic growth, the report said, adding that raising
labor productivity is thus becoming an important task.</P>
      <P>However, it is impossible to lift the labor productivity to a level capable of
solving all the negative influences resulted from the declining birth rate,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>For instance, by 2035, the Germany government will need to raise labor
productivity by 15 percent in order to cope with the shrinking, economically
active population, the report said. Yet, it will be possible to increase it by
only six percent at most, the institute noted.</P>
      <P>Citing Japan as a further example, the report said that the measures proposed by
the Taiwan government, such as providing subsidies, or maternity leave, might
not generate satisfactory results, as they failed in Japan in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>However, the report noted that western or northern European countries are
successful in dealing with the slumping birth rate by adopting different family
values.</P>
      <P>In these countries, women enjoy a high status, and children are independent at
early ages, the report said, adding that cohabitation and illegitimate children
are more socially accepted.</P>
      <P>According to the report, unless people in Taiwan change their family values it
will be difficult to boost the fertility of women.</P>
      <P>However, the think tank admitted that changing family values is not likely to
happen in the foreseeable future. As a result, the government should help those
who are willing to have a baby strike a balance between work and family, the
report urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER IN NO HURRY TO ANNOUNCE CANDIDACY: AIDES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
02/27/07  10:39:12
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, a stalwart of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , is in no hurry to announce his presidential candidacy, his
aides said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Although Wang is widely seen as a potential contender for the 2008 presidency,
his aides said that he has no plans to formally announce his bid at present but
might do so around the Lantern Festival -- which falls on March 4 this year.</P>
      <P>At that time, Wang will put forward a comprehensive discourse and vision on his
philosophy of how to rule the country, his aides said.</P>
      <P>December's legislative elections are Wang's top concern for the time being as
they are critical to the KMT's chances of victory in the 2008 presidential race
and will have ramifications for the party's sustainable development and
continued cooperation with the People First Party to maintain a majority in the
Legislative Yuan, they said.</P>
      <P>In addition, they went on, the KMT's chairman election and the variables
surrounding former Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, are also issues of concern to Wang.</P>
      <P>Ma stepped down from the party's top post and announced his desire to take part
in the next presidential polls after being indicted in the middle of this month
on corruption charges over alleged misuse of a special municipal allowance
earmarked for his discretionary use during his term as mayor of Taipei from
1998-2006.</P>
      <P>These thorny issues must be carefully handled by the new KMT chairman, the aides
quoted Wang as saying. Wang contends that it is better to elect a new chairman
within the next month, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>But Wang remains unchanged regarding his plan to visit China as part of his
efforts to make peace cross the Taiwan Strait, despite the fact that the planned
trip may be postponed to April from originally scheduled March, the aides said.</P>
      <P>Wang also favors the idea of inviting Honorary Chairman Lien Chan to assume the
KMT's chairmanship the sooner the better, they said, adding that Wang is not
seeking to compete against acting KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung for the
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of several recent polls, Wang's aides said that more than 60
percent of respondents said no indicted candidates should be allowed to pursue
the presidency, ahead of 37 percent who are in favor of a recent KMT rule change
to give Ma the right to take part in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien is expected to help mediate between Ma and Wang in seeking the
KMT's nomination to represent the party in the next presidential race, they
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former clerk with the Bureau of Immigration, which was superseded by the
National Immigration Agency at the beginning of this year, was indicted Tuesday
on charges of colluding with "snakeheads" in smuggling Chinese prostitutes into
Taiwan in exchange for cash rewards.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutor's  Office charged Lee Juo-ling  with corruption and
violations of the statute governing civilian exchanges across the Taiwan Strait
on suspicion that she had offered tips to a human trafficking ring to facilitate
the entry of Chinese women to work as prostitutes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 145 other suspects, including tour operators, the human trafficking
ring mastermind, Chinese women and their local bogus marriage partners, were
also indicted on charges of fraud and of violating the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, Lee, a former member of a liaison task force with
the Legislative Yuan, was very familiar with the processing procedures for
Chinese women's entry permit applications due to her long years of service at
the immigration office.</P>
      <P>Lee is suspected of having told the human trafficking ring led by Chung Ju-chih
to have Chinese women fake pregnancy to get early entry interviews. Moreover,
she is accused of having on many occasions asked her immigration colleagues to
speed up processing of their entry applications under the false claim that
certain lawmakers had requested it.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, the indictment said, 82 Chinese women had managed to enter
Taiwan via marriages of convenience, among whom 34 had received direct
assistance from Lee. The Chinese women tended to pose as brides of Taiwanese men
before turning to prostitution, the indictment said.</P>
      <P>For each case, Lee allegedly received between NT$30,000 (US$910) and NT$80,000,
and she is believed to have raked in NT$2.04 million in bribes, while the human
trafficking ring made about at NT$6.8 million in total.</P>
      <P>Lee was fired by the immigration office late last October after she was taken
into custody pending investigation. Chung and two other accomplices were also
held incommunicado to prevent them from coordinating false stories.</P>
      <P>One of Chung's accomplices, Lin Chieh-shan, a tour operator, is accused of
having on many occasions asked an independent lawmaker to lobby for the speedy
processing by the immigration office of Chinese women's entry applications.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said no individual lawmaker or legislative aide has so far been
found to be involved in the case, but they added that separate investigations
have begun to determine whether any lawmaker or legislative aide was involved in
the case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP ASPIRANTS URGED TO GIVE PRESIDENT ROOM TO MEDIATE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged all aspirants contending to represent the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008 presidential election to give
President Chen Shui-bian room to mediate among them.</P>
      <P>Chen is reportedly  supposed to begin mediating among DPP presidential hopefuls
after the registration deadline for the party's primary for the presidential
election ends March 9 to help produce the strongest ticket for the election. The
party is scheduled to make public its official presidential candidate May 30.</P>
      <P>While urging the DPP presidential aspirants to allow Chen some room for
mediation, Su said the hopefuls should also respect the president's opinions and
efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>Su said he believes  that the president  will engage  in comprehensive thinking
before moving to mediate and will help work out who is the most acceptable
candidate with the greatest chance of winning the presidential race.</P>
      <P>Su and former premiers Frank Hsieh and Yu Shyi-kun have all announced their bids
to represent the ruling DPP in the next election. Local newspapers have
speculated that Chen may push for Su and Hsieh to be on the DPP's presidential
ticket.</P>
      <P>On questions regarding whether a debate among the aspirants or a public opinion
poll should be conducted to help the DPP arrive at a consensus regarding the
party's ticket in the next election, Su said he remains open to all of these
options.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, another DPP heavyweight, has yet to announce whether
she will make a bid to represent the party in the presidential election and has
remained tightlipped regarding the issue of Chen's possible mediation or a DPP
presidential primary.</P>

      <P>The Southern Taiwan Science Park registered business turnover of NT$451.6
billion (US$13.68 billion) for 2006, up 28 percent over the year-earlier figure,
the park's director-general, Chen Chun-wei, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the original target for 2006 was NT$500 billion but that the park
failed to attain the goal due to market and price factors, although it still
recorded robust growth of around NT$100 billion over the previous year's level.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Chen said that the park has set the goal of NT$520 billion in
business turnover and of 52,000 employees for 2007. The park employed 47,371
workers in 2006.</P>
      <P>He said that if the market continues to grow steadily, the park's turnover will
be even higher in the coming years.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the park's annual business turnover will reach NT$1
trillion by 2011, led by the booming optoelectronics, semiconductor, precision
machinery and biotechnology sectors.</P>
      <P>He said the park had approved 198 manufacturers to invest in the park as of the
end of 2006, among which 93 have started mass production. The optoelectronics
and integrated circuit sectors are the two dominant sectors in the park, he

      <P>A former government information officer has established a prize worth US$30,000
annually for individuals whose actions promote freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>74-year-old Chang Chao-ying said he and his family set up the "Freedom of Speech
Prize" in order to improve Taiwanese people's understanding of this democratic
value.</P>
      <P>Chang, now living in New York, said the prize money, and an equivalent amount
for administration expenditures, have been donated by his American son-in-law
Brian Scanlan, a computer software businessman.</P>
      <P>The Washington-based, Taiwanese group Formosan Association for Public Affairs
(FAPA) is cooperating in selecting the prize winner and organizing the awards
ceremony, which will be held in Taipei Mar. 4. at FAPA's 25th anniversary event.
Scanlan will present to award the prize as Chang, who is receiving chemotherapy

      <P>Chang was an information officer for Taiwan's government in New York between
1967 and 1980, in Tokyo from 1980-1985, and again from 1994-1998. Among his
legendary achievements was his acquiring of intelligence shortly before the
Carter Administration of the United State announced that it would cut diplomatic
relations with Taiwan in December 1978.</P>
      <P>Brought up in a millionaire family in Taipei at the turn of Japanese
colonization and Kuomintang rule, Chang benefited from broad international
experiences that his contemporaries rarely enjoyed, which were featured in his
2006 prize-winning and best-selling dictated autobiography "90-banchi, Miyamae-

educational system. In that year, there were less than 10 countries which had
adopted a compulsory educational system of such length.</P>
      <P>However, today more than 46 countries have adopted a fundamental educational
system of at least 10-years, the premier said.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the implementation of the new system, Su said the government
will first carry out two projects this year, including offering tuition fee
subsidies to private high school and vocational school students who are
economically disadvantaged, and subsidizing the operations  of high schools with
high-quality  educational environments.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the government will undertake an overall effort to promote a national
program to provide learning assistance  to elementary and junior high school
students, Su noted.</P>
      <P>The decision to prolong the compulsory educational system, however,  triggered
criticism from independent  Legislator  Lin Ping-kun, who claimed that the
government has never shown any signs of wishing to promote a 12-year educational
system before it come out with the "sudden" announcement.</P>
      <P>Lin criticized the government's apparent lack of regard for working out proper
resolutions of problems, such as disputes over school district divisions that
are expected to arise following the implementation of the prolonged compulsory
educational system, before deciding to implement the new system.</P>
      <P>Lin denounced the plan as an election gambit intended to woo voters in the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>In response to the criticism,  Minister  of Education  Tu Cheng-sheng explained
the government had taken 10 months to come out with a complete set of programs
for the plan to prolong the compulsory educational system. His ministry will
convene public hearing on the programs as soon as possible, and will invite all
of the relevant individuals, including school administrators, teachers and
parents of students to attend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADJUSTING TREATMENT ACCORDED CHIANG NOT PROVOCATIVE: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
02/27/07  18:29:04
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that the government should consider
adjusting the special treatment accorded to the late President Chiang Kai-shek
but that the change is by no means aimed at fanning an ethnic row.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the Presidential Office during a meeting with a group
of victims' families from the 228 Incident, recently returned from the United
States.</P>
      <P>Stressing that "now is the time for the government to face up to the truth and
hold the culprits accountable 60 years after the tragedy, " Chen said that it is
a very serious issue and cannot be dodged.</P>
      <P>Thousands of Taiwanese elite were massacred by the KMT government troops during
the 228 Incident, in which local people rose against an authoritarian KMT rule
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although  the government  has taken some measures to help compensate for damage
to the Taiwanese people, including the creation of a 228 Memorial Fund and the
publication of a series of reports on the 1947 incident, Chen said that the
government should consider adjusting the special treatment accorded Chiang now
that solid evidence points to him as the main culprit behind the tragedy.</P>
      <P>The government's plan to remove the guards posted at Chiang's mausoleum in Tahsi
township in northern Taoyuan county and a planned name change for the Chiang
Kai-shek memorial Hall in downtown Taipei were not made with any intention of
stoking ethnic disputes, rather, it is a step forward toward clarifying the
truth of the incident and doing justice to the suffering of the victims and
their families, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said Monday that the Chiang's mausoleum and the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall should be phased out to purge Taiwan of Chiang's lingering shadow.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said the same day that he supports the president's
proposal on renaming the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to Taiwan  Democracy
Memorial  Park  so as to observe  Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial  Hall could serve as a good exhibition  venue  for
the government  to mark  the country's democratization process, Su said.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun asked the Executive
Yuan withdraw guards and relevant personnel stationed at Chiang's mausoleum as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Yu also asked former KMT Chairman Ma Yin-jeou, the person most likely to
represent the opposition "pan-blue alliance" in the 2008 presidential election,
to stop whitewashing the history of the Chiang regime and stop paying respect to
Chiang on his death day at his tomb.</P>

      <P>The China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) completed repainting its new name, "Taiwan
International Shipbuilding Corp.", in Chinese on the huge Goliath crane at the
CSBC Kaohsiung shipyard, a CSBC official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The working crew spent the whole day painting the CSBC's new Chinese name on the
Goliath bridge crane, which is a hallmark of the CSBC. The repainting task was
not easy as the Goliath crane is 177 meters wide and 87 meters high, and each
Chinese character on it covers nine square meters, which is the equivalent of
approximately three stories in height.</P>
      <P>The official said that the CSBC's name-change plan has been approved by its
board directors, and is awaiting final approval by CSBC general investors March
1. That motion is expected to pass smoothly as the Ministry of Economic Affairs
holds most of the stocks of the CSBC.</P>
      <P>Premier Su will host an unveiling ceremony marking the CSBC's new name March 3

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has tentatively set April 7 for a by-
election to select the party's chairman, KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu said this was in response to a recent call by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, who wanted a new party head to be installed as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former KMT vice chairman, said recently that he has no plans to run for
the post of KMT chairman and praised Wu Poh-hsiung, the party's first vice
chairman who is serving as acting chairman, as a good candidate for the party's
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>But Wu Den-yih also said that the date still has to be confirmed by a meeting of
the KMT Central Standing Committee Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He said that if the date passes, the party will proclaim the process for the by-
election March 1, after which there be a little time for hopefuls to solicit
sufficient endorsements before April 7.</P>
      <P>The by-election has been made necessary by Ma Ying-jeou's resignation as party
chairman Feb. 13 immediately after he was indicted on corruption charges for his
alleged misuse of a special allowance fund put under his discretionary use
during his two-term mayoralty between 1998 and 2006. Ma also announced
simultaneously his bid for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that a party chairman by-election will cost about NT$20 million
(US$606,000), and that some party members have suggested that the by-election be
held in tandem with a primary vote to select the party's presidential candidate
May 26.</P>
      <P>But most party members later concurred that the major task of a party chairman
is to coordinate the party's slate of candidates for the year-end legislative
election as well as the March 2008 presidential election, so that the date
should be set at some point prior to the presidential primary.</P>
      <P>Reports said that no one has come forward to express interest in running for the
party's head.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung, though favored by all sides, said recently that he is not
considering the matter right now, pointing out that his top priority now is
reinforcing party unity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH DEPT. NOT TO REGULATE COPPER LEVELS IN OYSTERS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday that it is not considering
regulation of copper levels in oysters in view of the fact that most other
countries have not imposed similar limits.</P>
      <P>The DOH was responding to a call by the Consumers' Foundation, which urged the
government to regulate copper levels in the wake of its random check of 20
samples of oysters in market and finding three samples contained copper levels
in excess of 200 ppm.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director general of DOH's Bureau of Food Safety, said that the
bureau will not contemplate setting up a maximum level for the time being.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that copper, which is easily worked out of the body, is generally not
considered a health hazard. In addition, copper is one of the metal elements of
which all animals require trace amounts.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that Taiwan, as well as most other countries in the world, has not
regulated every kind of heavy metal, and has only set maximum limits on highly
toxic metals such as mercury and lead.</P>
      <P>Lin Chieh-liang, director of Clinical Toxic Department of Chang Kung Memorial
Hospital, also said that oysters tend to accumulate heavy metals easily, but it
is easy for the human body to eliminate copper.</P>
      <P>Unless one eats several kilograms of oysters a day, these levels of copper will
not affect one's organs, including the liver where many toxins accumulate, Lin
added.</P>
      <P>But DOH health officials nonetheless reminded consumers to be careful not to
choose oysters whose color is green, as this indicates high levels of copper.</P>

      <P>A group of ruling party lawmakers proposed Tuesday a law revision which would
ban citizens under indictment from pursuing presidential election, a move
inexplicitly aimed at former main Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is
widely viewed as a strong contender in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers Cheng Kuo-chung, Chiu Chuang-chin and
Chen Ching-teh unveiled the idea and called for widespread legislative support
for their proposed amendment in a Legislative Yuan news conference.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, it is unbelievable that Ma will pursue the presidency  after
he was indicted  in mid-February  by Taipei prosecutors on corruption charges
over alleged misuse of a special municipal fund earmarked for his discretionary
use when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>The Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law currently forbids
those who have been given a death sentence, a term of life-long imprisonment, or
a jail term of more than 10 years from registering to run in a presidential
race.</P>
      <P>If Ma still wanted to pursue the presidency, Chen argued, the country may have
to choose a president again if Ma were given a sentence of over 10 years after
he was elected.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment would ban indicted aspirants, even if not yet convicted
in their first trial, from registering to run in presidential polls, Chen said,
urging lawmakers from different parties to back the initiative and have the
proposal be included on the agenda for the procedural committee.</P>
      <P>If the revision were made law, it would be a milestone in the government's
efforts to promote clean politics, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Now, with presidential hopefuls subject to the strictest public scrutiny, it is
necessary to push through the proposed amendment to the law and bolster public
confidence, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Cheng's view, Chiu said that such a revision would reflect the people's
high expectations for political integrity.</P>

      <P>Although Taiwan would welcome more Chinese tourists to Taiwan and is looking
forward to direct charter flights between Taiwan and China, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) has never compromised national sovereignty in bilateral
negotiations, MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the statement to reporters after opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
Legislator Tseng Tsahn-deng, in an interpellation session earlier that same day,
accused the MAC of yielding to China in its efforts to reach agreement on the
two matters.</P>
      <P>Tseng claimed that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is leaning
toward China, even though it "might seem on the surface to be promoting Taiwan
independence to gain voter support."</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, recent poll results showed that more than 74 percent of the
people surveyed believe that Taiwan is an independent sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside Tseng's allegation that the DPP has failed to safeguard Taiwan's
independent sovereignty in cross-strait talks, Wu said that the MAC has never
given way to China in bilateral talks regarding the authority of the governments
on the two sides of the strait. In contrast, it has always tried to do its
utmost to safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty and standing, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, indirect passenger flights between Taiwan and China are
currently offered on three routes, via Hong Kong, Okinawa or South Korea's Jeju.</P>
      <P>Even if domestic carriers fly between Taiwan and China with a transit  stop  in
Hong Kong,  they are still  designated  as "international" routes, Wu explained,

      <P>The Executive Yuan will work out a plan to handle the remains of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek if his descendants refuse to have them interred in a
tomb prepared for him by the Ministry of National Defense (MND), Government
Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MND will ask Chiang's descendants to decide where they want to inter the
remains of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo -- who served as
president three years after his father died in 1975.</P>
      <P>Their remains have been stored separately in temporary mausoleums in Tahsi,
Taoyuan County, since their deaths in 1975 and 1988, respectively, and their
mausoleums are under the charge of the MND, which assigns a squadron of military
honor guards to protect the Chiang Kai-shek mausoleum.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Chiang's descendants agreed in 2004 to lay them to rest permanently
in a military cemetery in Taipei, but told the authorities in 2005 when the
construction of their graveyards was completed that there were different
opinions in the family about whether the interring should proceed.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that if the remains of the two Chiangs are transferred to the
military cemetery, the guards posted at Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum will be
withdrawn and if the family refuses to allow the bodies to be removed, the
Executive Yuan will ask the MND to come up with anew plan about the management
of the mausoleum.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic

guards.</P>
      <P>Citing a statement by President Chen Shui-bian earlier that day that Chiang is
responsible for the brutal crushing of a Taiwanese revolt in 1947, Yu argued
that there is no reason for the country to pay any respects to the late dictator
by allowing an honor guard to protect his mausoleum.</P>
      <P>He urged the MND to give up management of the two Chiang mausoleums and turn
them over to the Chiang family.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Iraqis Reach an Accord on Oil Revenues

The Iraqi cabinet approved a draft of a law on Monday that would set guidelines
for nationwide distribution of oil revenues and foreign investment in the
immense oil industry. The endorsement reflected a major agreement among the
countrys ethnic and sectarian political blocs on one of Iraqs most divisive
issues.

The draft law approved by the cabinet allows the central government to
distribute oil revenues to the provinces or regions based on population, which
could lessen the economic concerns of the rebellious Sunni Arabs, who fear being
cut out of Iraqs vast potential oil wealth by the dominant Shiites and Kurds.
Most of Iraqs crude oil reserves lie in the Shiite south and Kurdish north.

      <P>The Executive Yuan will work out a plan to handle the remains of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek if his descendants refuse to have them interred in a
tomb prepared for him by the Ministry of National Defense (MND), Government
Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MND will ask Chiang's descendants to decide where they want to inter the
remains of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo -- who served as
president three years after his father died in 1975.</P>
      <P>Their remains have been stored separately in temporary mausoleums in Tahsi,
Taoyuan County, since their deaths in 1975 and 1988, respectively, and their
mausoleums are under the charge of the MND, which assigns a squadron of military
honor guards to protect the Chiang Kai-shek mausoleum.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Chiang's descendants agreed in 2004 to lay them to rest permanently
in a military cemetery in Taipei, but told the authorities in 2005 when the
construction of their graveyards was completed that there were different
opinions in the family about whether the interring should proceed.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that if the remains of the two Chiangs are transferred to the
military cemetery, the guards posted at Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum will be
withdrawn and if the family refuses to allow the bodies to be removed, the
Executive Yuan will ask the MND to come up with anew plan about the management
of the mausoleum.</P>
      <P>He made the statement after Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, urged the Executive Yuan Tuesday to remove the military
guards.</P>
      <P>Citing a statement by President Chen Shui-bian earlier that day that Chiang is
responsible for the brutal crushing of a Taiwanese revolt in 1947, Yu argued
that there is no reason for the country to pay any respects to the late dictator
by allowing an honor guard to protect his mausoleum.</P>
      <P>He urged the MND to give up management of the two Chiang mausoleums and turn
them over to the Chiang family.</P>

      <P>China poses a threat to the United States, and the threat will grow over time
due to Beijing's rapid military buildup, a U.S. intelligence officer said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Michael Maples, director of U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, told a
U.S. Senate hearing that Beijing began its military modernization in 1999 and
that its rapid military buildup will not cease even if the Taiwan problem is
resolved because of China's aspirations for great power status.</P>
      <P>Maples said the Chinese are developing more capable long-range ballistic
missiles with terminally guided maneuverable warheads able to hit U.S. aircraft
carriers at sea and targets in the continental United States.</P>
      <P>Chinese military modernization has been coupled with its notable success in
improving relations with Japan and its active engagement with multilateral
organizations, including ASEAN, Maples continued.</P>
      <P>However, Maples said he sees a diminished possibility of China engaging in
conflict with Taiwan and a low risk of China undergoing a severe financial
crisis over the next five years despite its banks' huge amount of bad loans.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting delegation of Taiwan legislators and government officials have met
with their British counterparts and exchanged views over the past two days on
issues regarding global climate change and renewable energy.</P>
      <P>Legislators Lee Chun-yi, Luo Shih-hsiung, Wang Tu-fa, Chen Ming-chen,
representing the Legislative Yuan's discipline, economic, and energy and
science-technology committees, respectively, as well as Yeh Hui-ching, chairman
of the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, have paid visits
to the United Kingdom's Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of
Trade and Industry, marking the first Taiwan official delegation to visit U.K.
government offices in 35 years since London switched its diplomatic recognition
from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held at the Taipei Representative Office in the United
Kingdom Tuesday, Lee said his delegation has engaged in intensive discussions on
climate change and renewable energy issues with the British officials and has
suggested to the officials that Taiwan and the United Kingdom can cement
bilateral  ties via cooperation in voluntary carbon offset transactions.</P>
      <P>The delegation has also paid visits to relevant committees under the British
House of Commons, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee further said that Taiwan will take part in a global wind power conference to
be hosted by the United Kingdom in September at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to invite British officials and experts to the country next year
for discussions on systems,  mechanisms and technologies concerning sustainable
renewable energies, Lee added.</P>
      <P>During their visit, Lee said, the members of the delegation have asked for the
United Kingdom's help to facilitate Taiwan's joining the Kyoto Protocol. Taiwan
has continued to be excluded from the Kyoto Protocol -- aimed at reducing carbon
dioxide emissions -- as the protocol is an agreement formed under an
organization of the United Nations,  and statehood is therefore a requirement
for participation.</P>
      <P>The legislators have also stressed to the British officials that Taiwan's
success in reducing carbon dioxide emissions should never be listed under the
efforts of China and should instead be recognized as Taiwan's achievement, Lee
added.</P>
      <P>In response, the British officials have expressed that they "understand" the
Taiwan lawmakers' position, but they have not made any promises on the issue,
Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lee further said that a draft bill governing renewable energy development has
already been screened by the legislature's Economic and Energy Committee, and it
is expected to be passed into law before the end of June this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an energy taxation draft bill has already been signed by 134
legislators from across the political spectrum, and its passage into law is only
a matter of time, said Legislator Chen Ming-chen, who initiated the bill.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over the opening of the National 228 Memorial
Museum Wednesday and said in his opening  address  that the museum symbolizes
the government's determination to heed the lessons of history and safeguard
democracy.</P>
      <P>"I hope the museum will eventually become a first-class platform for human
rights exchanges in the world," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the turbulent history of the bloody revolt should not be forgotten,
distorted or smeared. Now that the National 228 Memorial Museum has been
established, the government will accelerate efforts to restore historical truth
and facts, he added.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the museum will not only become a top human rights museum
-- which will help champion the causes of peace, freedom, democracy and human
rights -- but that it will also contribute to turning the tragic term of the
"228 Incident" into a pronoun that stands for hope,  forgiveness, reconciliation
and consolidation.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, who also delivered an address at the opening
ceremony, pointed out that it has been 60 years since the incident and that
relevant developments in finding out the truth and facts surrounding the
incident have continued, underlining the government's resolve to give justice to
all of the victims of the brutality, and to their families.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the ceremony, Premier Su Tseng-chang said the government will
continue to strive to collect information and historical archives on the 228
Incident from home and abroad to better facilitate related studies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su said, the Executive Yuan has decided to allocate a budget of
NT$1.5 billion over a period of five years to allow the National 228 Memorial
Museum to remain in operation.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, the officials joined families of the 228 victims to observe
a minute of silence to pay homage to the dead.</P>
      <P>A "Division and Rebirth" exhibition commemorating the 60th anniversary of the
incident is being staged at the museum, which is remodeled from the building in

government, Mann said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, he said democratic development in China remains a "mirage" even
though the country has managed to achieve a boom in economic development since
Beijing's brutal military suppression of democracy advocates during protests in
Tiananmen Square in 1989.</P>
      <P>Tkacik said it is understandable that Taiwan's present Democratic Progressive
Party government has been working to eliminate all facilities and symbols that
mark the image of late President Chiang Kai-shek as a great man, while accusing
him of being responsible for the 228 Incident that caused the deaths of
thousands of Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>He said the movement to eradicate  Chiang's  memory is a declaration that Taiwan
is totally different from the Taiwan of the Chiang regime and described the 228
Incident as a terrible moment in history.</P>
      <P>When reviewing history, the government should answer calls for a complete
revelation of the truth behind the tragedy, the scholar suggested.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to an uprising against the Chiang-led Kuomintang
administration that began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed by a bloody crackdown
that resulted in the death of tens of thousands of civilians.</P>
      <P>A so-called "White Terror" ensued, which involved the suppression of political
dissent and of public discussion of the massacre.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SHOULD ADMIT MISTAKE OVER 228 INCIDENT: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should eat humble pie, admit its mistake
over the 228 Incident and hand over all relevant archives to the government,
Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a plaque-unveiling ceremony for the National 228 Incident Memorial
Hall, Su said the families of the victims yearn to learn the historical facts
about the tragic event.</P>
      <P>Claiming that only a complete revelation of the truth behind the tragedy can
comfort the souls of the victims, Su said the KMT should turn over to the
government all documents relating to the incident kept at its party history
hall.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to uprising against the corrupt KMT administration under
the late President Chiang Kai-shek that began Feb. 28, 1947 and was followed by
a bloody crackdown resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.</P>
      <P>The ensuing "White Terror" -- involving the suppression of political dissent and
of public discussion of the massacre -- was conducted under martial law declared
following the incident.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident remains a sensitive subject for millions of Taiwanese --
particularly the older generation -- and a key source of acrimony between the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the KMT-led opposition.</P>
      <P>Although former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is widely seen as the KMT's best
bet for victory in the 2008 presidential election, has apologized for the 228
Incident on behalf of his party, Su said he did not feel the party's sincere
repentance.</P>
      <P>"The KMT is saying one thing while doing another. For one thing, the KMT still
refuses to hand over its 228 Incident archives to the government,  " Su said,
adding that many important documents, including those detailing how the then-KMT
Taiwan chapter contacted the KMT government in Nanjing and asked it to send
troops to Taiwan to crush the uprising.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Su went on, the KMT and its "pan-blue" ally, the People First Party,
have continued to block the passage of a bill calling for people who committed
atrocities during the 228 Incident to stand trial.</P>
      <P>The bill is aimed at amending the Statute for Handling of and Compensation for
the 228 Incident, enacted in April 1995. The statute details a series of steps
to help the victims and their families.</P>
      <P>Dissatisfied with the statute because it focuses mainly on compensation issues,
the DPP proposed an amendment that is aimed at determining legal responsibility
for the incident and replacing the word "compensation" with "indemnification" as
well as enacting a special law entitling 228 Incident victims to seek
indemnification from the people who injured them and demand that those people
face justice.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers suggested Tuesday that the amendment bill be put on the
legislative agenda for discussion at Friday's plenary session, but the proposal
was voted down by the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance, " which controls a slim
majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Su said that if the KMT truly repents its past mistakes as Ma has claimed, it
should return its billions of dollars-worth of ill-gotten party assets amassed
during its five decades of authoritarian rule of Taiwan to use as compensation
to the families of the victims.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu and many other govenrment
officials and representatives of the families of the 228 Incident victims also
attended the ceremony, which also marked the inauguration of an exhibition
commemorating the 60th anniversary of the tragic incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OUTLOOK FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT EXECUTIVE JETS PROMISING: CAA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to a brisk Chinese economy and anticipated direct charter flights across
the Taiwan Strait, growth in Taiwan's executive  air travel market is in sight,
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) officials forecast Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials  predicted  promising prospects  for Taiwan's executive air travel
market in view of the fast expansion in Hong Kong and Macau business travel to
and from China. The CAA has proposed exploring the market, they added.</P>
      <P>The CAA conducted an opinion survey of top 500 local enterprises last year to
explore the commercial aviation market potential. A total of 88 valid replies
were collected.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of the survey, the officials said that two of them expressed
full willingness to use special executive jets for their business travel as long
as the government gives a green light, while 49 companies said that they would
"conditionally" consider the possibility.</P>
      <P>Costs were the main consideration when 43 of the 49 companies willing to use
special executive jets weighed the issue, the officials said. Twenty six
enterprises said that they would think about the issue only when direct cross-
strait air travel has been put in place, while 25 said that they would do so
when regular commercial flights are not effective enough to cope with demand.</P>
      <P>As most  Taiwan  corporations  are small-  or medium-sized businesses, only four
of the local companies surveyed said that they would consider purchasing a
private airplane, according to the poll results.</P>
      <P>For international routes, Taipei Songshan Airport was most-often cited by
respondents as the best hub for executive jets, followed by Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport in northern Taoyuan County and Kaohsiung International
Airport in southern Taiwan. Songshan Airport led its counterparts in Kaohsiung,
Taoyuan, Taichung and Tainan in terms of domestic air travel demand.</P>
      <P>The CAA hopes to permit Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Kaohsiung
International Airport to serve special executive jets and private planes plying
international routes in its planned first-phase opening.</P>
      <P>In the second phase, Songshan Airport and other airports in Hualien, Taichung,
Kinmen and Makung that operate international charters will be authorized to
serve special executive and private planes on international routes, as well as
all other civilian airports, the officials added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC REBUTS CHINA'S INTERPRETATION OF 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
02/28/07  19:11:20

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) rebutted Wednesday China's interpretation of
the 228 Incident, describing it as mere distortion serving only to further
disaffect the Taiwanese people from the Beijing communists.</P>
      <P>"Having experienced more than 20 years of deepening democracy, the Taiwanese
people have gradually established their identification with the nation, their
history, culture and values. China and international society should respect that
identification, " the MAC said in a news release.</P>
      <P>The news release was in response to a statement from a spokesman for China's
State Council Taiwan Affairs Office who said earlier in the day that Beijing's
stance is that the "228 Uprising was a patriotic movement pursuing democracy and
autonomy against the Kuomintang regime's autocratic rule and a part of the
Chinese people's struggle for liberation."</P>
      <P>The MAC release said the tragedy that took place 60 years ago was a brutal
persecution conducted by the government against innocent civilians and members
of Taiwan's elite that has left a scar deep on the nation's memory. However, it
said, through commemoration of the past, the Taiwanese people have become more
able to understand the truth.</P>
      <P>It said that while Taiwanese people are broadminded enough to forgive,
realization of and reflection on the past are the most important procedures to
ensure that such a tragedy never happens again and that Taiwan's democracy keeps
advancing and consolidating.</P>
      <P>"Eighteen years ago in Beijing there was another massacre conducted by the
military against innocent students, and Chinese people will have the same
feeling as the 23 million Taiwanese people now have when they probe into the
truth in the future, " the news release continued.</P>
      <P>"Like the Taiwanese government, the Chinese government has to face the same
international human rights criteria, " it said, adding that "fundamental human
rights in China will only be manifested when the Chinese government admits its
past guilt."</P>
      <P>The MAC said China's passage of its so-called Anti-secession Law in 2005, its
attempts to unilaterally impose its politics on Taiwan and change the cross-
strait status quo using non-peaceful means, and its denial of the fact that two
sides of the strait are under different governments are the biggest barriers
preventing better development in cross-strait relations.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang demanded Wednesday that the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) publish the truth behind the 228 Incident and compensate the families of
the victims of the tragedy with money from sale of its assets.</P>
      <P>Su issued the demand at a central government-sponsored ceremony at the 228
Memorial Park in downtown Taipei to mark the 60th anniversary of the incident,
in which thousands of Taiwan's elite were massacred by KMT government troops
controlled by the late President Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu, Examination Yuan President
Yao Chia-wen, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun were also present at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Insisting that nothing but the truth will allow reconciliation, Su demanded that
former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, the most likely contender of the "pan-blue
alliance" in the 2008 presidential election, apologize in public again for the
massacre and make the KMT unveil historic facts behind the incident.</P>
      <P>Su denied that public demand for digging out the 228 Incident truth is a
politically motivated move, describing it instead as a way of serving justice
and helping younger generations learn from history. He added that the KMT should
compensate the families of the victims with money earned from the sale of its
ill-gotten party assets, instead of having the government pay the reparations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma paid his respects to the 228 Incident victims at a memorial
monument at the 228 Memorial Park in Hsinying City in southern Tainan County --
the home of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he is willing to bear the burden of the KMT's past, Ma said that
the historic tragedy can be forgiven but never forgotten and that present-day
Taiwan youth must keep this in mind and do their best to prevent any recurrence.</P>

      <P>Sales of the first postage stamp bearing the word "Taiwan" were brisk Wednesday
at post offices in Taipei City, including a temporary one at the new National
228 Memorial Museum.</P>
      <P>Fifty-one post offices were open around Taiwan on 228 Memorial Day -- a national
holiday -- to manage sales of the first "Taiwan" postage stamp featuring the
National 228 Memorial Museum and carrying the mark of Taiwan Post Co., a state-
owned company previously known as Chunghwa Post Co.</P>
      <P>The change of name to Taiwan Post from Chunghwa Post is part of the government's
drive to change the names of state-run businesses to get rid of Chinese
references in their titles and add the word "Taiwan" to make them more
identifiable with their country of origin and avoid confusion with similarly
named Chinese organizations.</P>
      <P>The historic stamp issuance was also made in accordance with the opening of the
National 228 Memorial Museum, located in the former United States Information

      <P>Stamp collectors waited in long queues in front of the North Gate and Nanhai

    <TEXT>New York Times:Wall St. Tumble Adds to Worries About Economies

Stock markets around the world plummeted yesterday in a wave of selling set off
by a plunge in China that was reinforced by worries of weakening economies. The
falling prices continued in early Asian trading today, but by midday the Chinese
market seemed to be stabilizing.

While China was the first market to tumble, it was not clear what set off the
selling. But once it began, it spread first to other Asian countries, then to
Europe and the United States.

Wall Street Journal: Markets' Slide Spotlights Risks

Yesterday's plunge in stock prices around the world, including the steepest
percentage decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in nearly four years,
signals that investors may finally be re- evaluating their insatiable appetite
for risky investments.

The catalyst was Tuesday's nearly 9% fall in stock prices in Shanghai, one of
the hottest and most volatile markets in the world. That helped send U.S. stocks
on a roller coaster that ended with the DJIA down 416.02 points, or 3.3%, to

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that the commemoration for the 60th
anniversary of the 228 Incident marked a beginning of a new era in which
emphasis will be placed on investigating the legal responsibility of every
perpetrator of abuses in the country's authoritative past.</P>
      <P>Addressing the central government's 228 Incident remembrance ceremony held at
the 228 Memorial Park, Chen said he never described the incident as an ethnic
conflict because many mainlanders were also victimized.</P>
      <P>Chen said the incident was not a simple historical event but that it was
inseparable from the ensuing four decades of martial law.</P>
      <P>All the Taiwanese people suppressed under the authoritarian regime were 228
Incident victims, he said,in this respect most of Taiwanese people are together
on the side of the victims and their families, willing to strive for justice.</P>
      <P>He said the government will investigate every perpetrator's legal
responsibilities so as to clarify the historical truth and achieve justice,
adding that such investigations will not be applied to the 228 Incident alone,
but also all crimes against human rights committed during the martial law era.</P>
      <P>Citing former President Lee Teng-hui's apology while Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
for the 228 Incident, Chen said the KMT should also apologize for its 38 years
of martial law rule if the party is sincere in its reflections on history and
its belief in the universal value of democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>The KMT should also return to the country, and the people, all the property it
stole through the mechanisms of the party-state regime, Chen said.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that some politician on the one hand apologizes for the 228
Incident, while on the other speeding up the sale and disposal of ill-gotten
party assets,he said.</P>
      <P>He said the government opposes the actions of the ruling bloc during the
authoritative era. The historical fact that members of the bloc were mostly of
Waishengrens, people who fled to Taiwan from China during and after the China
Civil War and their decedents, does not mean the government is singling out that
specific ethnic group.</P>
      <P>It is sheer distortion to describe the pursuit for democracy and freedom as the
suppression of a particular ethnic group, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KEELUNG CITY GOVERNMENT COMMEMORATES INFAMOUS 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Keelung,  Feb.  28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Keelung city government held a memorial service in front of a monument in
the northern port city at 2: 28 p.m. Wednesday in commemoration of the 60th
anniversary of the infamous 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>Acting Mayor Hsu Ching-kun led department heads of the Keelung city government
and families of the tragic event in observing a moment of silence in remembrance
of all those killed in the incident at the beginning of the memorial service.</P>
      <P>The incident refers to uprising against the corrupt Kuomintang administration
under the late President Chiang Kai-shek that began Feb. 28, 1947 and was
followed by a bloody crackdown resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of
civilians.</P>
      <P>Noting that the incident resulted from the previous government's wrongdoing, Hsu
said the city government has held a memorial service on Feb. 28 annually in the
hopes of heeling the past wounds and remind everybody to work together to avoid
recurrence of similar tragedies.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that it's not easy for the families of the 228 Incident victims to
forget the trauma of losing their loved ones to political persecution, Hsu said
the city government is willing to do every possible effort to help alleviate the
historical wounds.</P>
      <P>In line with the central government's directive, Hsu said, the Keelung city
government will have the national flag fly at half-mast at all municipal
institutions from this year. It is hoped that everyone in the country can
commemorate the incident with magnanimity and vision to boost social harmony.</P>
      <P>Similar memorial services were held in all amjor cities and counties around the
country.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Mayor Hau Lung-bin attended a ceremony held at the 228 Memorial Park
in the city's downtown district, in which Hau said the incident has not only
caused distress and affliction to the victims and their families but has also
sowed seeds of discord and animosity between native Taiwanese and Chinese
immigrants.</P>
      <P>Noting that the lesson of the tragic incident lies in reminding those in power
to deal with people humbly rather than oppressively, Hau said the tribulation
caused by abuse of political power can be irreparable.</P>
      <P>Hau said he is determined to do whatever he can during his tenure to heel
historical wounds and mend ethnic division and resentment.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government in southern Taiwan sponsored a special concert in
commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident, with Mayor Chen Chu
presiding.</P>
      <P>In her opening remarks, Chen said the 228 Incident has come to crystallize the
beginning of a string of tragedies and abuses that began almost immediately
after the KMT troops arrived in Taiwan at the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>"These abuses, including the security census and the White Terror that followed
the 228 Incident, must never be forgotten if the nation is to avoid repetition
of similar tragedies, " Chen said, adding that an indispensable  part of the
process is the release of all information from official investigations to let
the facts be known.</P>
      <P>"True  forgiveness  is  only  possible  with  justice  and understanding, and
understanding must be built on facts and the courage to face up to them and the
consequences of their release, " Chen added.</P>

Presidential Office, and opened with an orchestra's performance of the1947
Overture, a work of composer Hsiao Tyzen.</P>
      <P>Addressing the audience, Lee Teng-hui said Taiwan should draw up a new
Constitution, change the country's official name and become a normal country.</P>
      <P>Lee said he was a witness and "mental victim" of the 228 Incident, which erupted
at the time he was a Taiwan University senior in agricultural economics.</P>
      <P>Sixty years on, I still cannot forget the Taiwanese people's passion to follow
their ideals, and the horrible sight of the Kuomintang slaughtering Taiwanese
people,he said.</P>

his presidential terms, including setting up a cabinet level research team to
publish an investigative report, meeting with victims' families, and extending
an apology in the name of the state to people who suffered.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECIAL CONCERT TO MARK 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF INFAMOUS 228 INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A special concert was held at the Chungshan Soccer Stadium  in Taipei Wednesday
to commemorate  the 60th anniversary of the infamous 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>Music bands from Taiwan, China, Britain, the United States and the Czech
Republic performed in the concert as part of a "With Justice We Cure the Nation"
campaign.</P>
      <P>The special concert  attracted  more than 10,000 audiences, including many
influential political figures from both ruling and opposition camps, including
Premier Su Tseng-chang, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Examination
Yuan President Yao Chia-wen, former President Lee Teng-hui, former Premier Frank
Hsieh, former opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Organizers said the concert was designed to enlist support for the "With Justice
We Cure the Nation" campaign aimed at pursuing transitional justice to get rid
of negative legacies from the previous period of authoritarian rule. The concert
climaxed at the signing of the declaration on the "Justice" campaign by
political bigwigs.</P>
      <P>Except Ma, all other aspirants for the 2008 presidential election signed the
declaration to signify their support for all feasible approaches  to heel
historical  wounds from previous political persecution and human rights abuses,
including the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian signed the declaration before the beginning of the
concert. A video featuring his signing of the declaration at the his office was
shown at the concert. In the video, Chen said he takes pleasure in signing the
declaration and seeing progress in the transitional justice campaign. He also
called for an end to ethnic animosity and confrontation.</P>
      <P>Transitional justice refers to a range of approaches that societies undertake to
reckon with legacies of widespread  or systematic human rights abuse as they
move from a period of violent conflict or oppression towards peace, democracy,
the rule of law, and respect for individual and collective rights.</P>
      <P>In making such a transition, societies must confront the painful legacy, or
burden, of the past in order to achieve a holistic sense of justice for all
citizens, to establish or renew civic trust, to reconcile people and
communities, and to prevent future abuses. A variety of approaches to
transitional justice are available that can help wounded societies start anew.</P>
      <P>These approaches are both judicial and nonjudicial, and they seek to encompass
broadly the various dimensions of justice that can heal wounds and contribute to
social reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Transitional  justice incorporates a realistic view of the challenges faced by
societies emerging from conflict or repression, and an appreciation of their
unique cultural and historical contexts, without allowing these realities to
serve as excuses for inaction. All stakeholders in the transition process must
be consulted and participate in the design and implementation of transitional
justice policies.</P>
