    <HEADLINE>EUROTRAIN'S INJUNCTION OVERRULED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court on Tuesday
overturned an injunction filed by the Eurotrain consortium last month
seeking to block further contract negotiations between Japan's
Shinkansen and Taiwan High-Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC).</P>
      <P>Taipei Court judges overturned the injunction on the grounds that
Eurotrain did not produce sufficient evidence proving that the
France-German-Anglo consortium has a legitimate right to force a stop
to negotiations between Shinkansen and THSRC.</P>
      <P>Furious at being sidetracked by the Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium
(TSC) in a race to build Taiwan's multi-billion dollar high-speed
railway system, Eurotrain filed an injunction with the Taipei
District Court on Jan. 12, trying to get its bid, which has been at
least a two year effort, back on track.</P>
      <P>In the injunction, Eurotrain sued THSRC for breaking an earlier
agreement signed between the two, challenging THSRC's decision to
dump it in favor of TSC, and sought an injunction blocking further
Shinkansen-THSRC negotiations.</P>
      <P>TSC, which groups leading Japanese industrial conglomerates
including Mitsui &amp; Co., Mitsubishi Corp. and Marubeni Corp., came
from behind in late December to become the priority bidder to build
Taiwan's first high-speed railway system.</P>
      <P>TSC and THSRC began negotiations on Jan. 10 to work out
agreements on the mammoth project's costs, including export credits,
loans, TSC's expected equity investment and the transfer of
technology.</P>
      <P>If TSC wins the contract, Shinkansen will be authorized to build
the US$3 billion core systems of the island-spanning bullet train,
including engines, carriages, locomotives, power supply and overhead
container systems, transmission systems, signals and
telecommunications systems.</P>
      <P>THSRC chose TSC as the priority bidder after it found that
Shinkansen was a better choice in terms of technology, maintenance
and price.</P>
      <P>A THSRC spokesman said that a formal and final contract may be
signed in early February.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 28, when THSRC announced that TSC had been chosen as
priority bidder for the contract, Eurotrain's headquarters in Paris
announced that it would look into the legal consequences of the
decision. "Eurotrain will take all necessary actions to protect its
interests," it said.</P>
      <P>The chairman of Siemens, one of the major partners of Eurotrain,
flew to Taipei in mid-January to meet with President Lee Teng-hui and
Premier Vincent Siew, apparently in a last ditch effort to win back
the contract for the multi-billion dollar project.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei's China Times, Christopher Patten, chairman
of the European Union's Foreign Affairs Committee, met with officials
of the Taiwan representative office in Brussels over the high-speed
railway matter on Jan. 28 and asked the ROC officials to relay a
letter to Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>In Patten's letter, according to the China Times report, Patten
challenged the impartiality and transparency of the whole process of
the high-speed railway bid and threatened that the matter may
undermine Taiwan's bid to enter the World Trade Organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA ISSUES 8,888 YEAR OF THE DRAGON GOLD COINS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Jan. 31 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To celebrate the arrival of the Year of the
Dragon in the Chinese lunar calendar, the Royal Canadian Mint has
introduced its Year of the Dragon Hologram Gold Coin.</P>
      <P>The coin is of particular significance, as it is only the second
gold hologram coin ever produced by the Royal Canadian Mint, and the
first gold hologram coin produced in the year 2000. The Lunar New
Year's Day falls on Feb. 5 this year.</P>
      <P>Designed by Canadian artist Harvey Chan, the coin features two
dragons guarding a pearl, the symbol for wisdom. They are accompanied
by clouds, which are another symbol for good fortune. This coin
commemorates the Year of the Dragon coinciding with the dawn of a new
millennium, an occurrence that happens once every three thousand
years.</P>
      <P>The 18 karat gold coin has a diameter of 28 mm and weighs 13.61
grams. The coin has a serrated edge and is 1.81 mm thick. The face
value is C$150.00 and mintage has been limited to 8,888 coins

    <HEADLINE>US LAWMAKERS URGED TO SUPPORT TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Jan.  31  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two US congressmen have urged their
colleagues to support the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act when the
House of Representatives considers it on Tuesday, stressing that this
important legislation is "a necessary, bipartisan approach to
fulfilling our promise to Taiwan" regarding its self-defense
capability.</P>
      <P>Rep. Peter Deutsch (D-FL) and Rep. Robert Andrews (D-NJ) pointed
out in their Jan. 28 letter that according to a Pentagon report
submitted to Congress earlier this year, China is engaged in a
missile buildup across the strait from Taiwan and is pressuring the
US to cease defensive weaponry sales to the island, pointing out that
"both of these factors represent a substantial threat to the balance
of power, and therefore the stability of the area."</P>
      <P>"We strongly believe that the United States must remain steadfast
in its commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the Taiwan
Relations Act -- in which the US promised to provide Taiwan with the
means to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability as the key
method of maintaining a balance of power in the region," said the
Democratic congressmen.</P>
      <P>The congressmen added that "this bill would reiterate the
fundamental truth of democracy -- that any determination of the
ultimate status of Taiwan must have the express consent of the people
of Taiwan. And finally, the bill would require the President to
submit an annual report to Congress on Taiwan's defense needs."</P>
      <P>Therefore, Reps. Deutsch and Andrews urged their colleagues to
join them in supporting the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which
was passed overwhelmingly with a 32-6 vote by the House International
Relations Committee on Oct. 26 last year and currently has 82
cosponsors in the 435-member House.</P>
      <P>Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) first introduced his version of the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act to the Senate on March 24, 1999. It
presently has 17 cosponsors.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the Clinton administration is striving hard
to prevent the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act from becoming law by
dissuading the Senate from passing the bill, since it seems that the
House of Representatives will likely pass the legislation during its
floor consideration scheduled for Tuesday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Sky watchers will have a special reason to
get out of bed early on Feb. 2 as a slender crescent moon will kiss
the dazzling planet Venus, David J. Eicher of Astronomy Magazine said
Monday.</P>
      <P>On the Wednesday morning, sky watchers will be able to witness
the moon sliding closely by the planet Venus. Such conjunctions are
routinely visible in the sky as solar system bodies constantly change
their respective positions with respect to the fixed stars.</P>
      <P>Such a close brush between the moon and a planet as bright as
Venus, however, is not so common. At its closest approach, the
crescent of the moon will pass within two moon diameters of the
brilliant planet.</P>
      <P>Observers on the eastern coast of the United States and Canada
will see the moon about 1 degree away from Venus half an hour before
sunrise. West coast observers will get their chance to view the
pairing three hours later.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Schizophrenia, cerebral palsy, autism, and
even sudden infant death syndrome may be caused by babies having
their oxygen supply reduced or cut off for short periods in the womb,
the Sydney Morning Herald reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The research by Associate Professor Sandra Rees of the University
of Melbourne finds that the problems may stem from such common
occurrences as knots forming in the umbilical cord or from the cord
wrapping itself around a fetus's neck or limbs.</P>
      <P>She told reporters that she has conducted tests on guinea pigs
and sheep where a fetuses' oxygen supply is compromised, causing
physical changes associated with such neurological conditions as
schizophrenia and autism.</P>
      <P>She said each of the fetuses responded differently. Out of any
six that were deprived of oxygen in the tests, two might be very
affected, two only mildly affected, and two not at all.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE NEW NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES INAUGURATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan
on Tuesday presided over a ceremony marking the inauguration of
National Kaohsiung University (NKU), located in Kaohsiung's bay area.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Lien envisioned the prominent
and invaluable contribution that NKU is expected to make to Taiwan
in terms of education and economic development, given the
university's strategically important position near Taiwan's Southern
Science-based Industrial Park and Kaohsiung Harbor, the country's
largest international seaport.</P>
      <P>NKU is also promising to play an important role in the
government-initiated "Go South" strategy, which encourages Taiwan
industries and businesses to relocate their investment to Southeast
Asia, as Kaohsiung is geographically nearer to the region than any
other major cities in Taiwan, Lien noted.</P>
      <P>Wang Jen-hung, an LL.D. from prestigious Heidelberg University
who had been director of National Taiwan University's Department of
Law, has been appointed as the first president of NKU.</P>
      <P>Wang said that NKU will initially have 290 students enrolled this
autumn in six departments. The academic scale will be increased to
seven colleges containing 33 departments over the next five years, he
said, adding that NKU is expected to have 15,000 undergraduate,
post-graduate and doctorate students enrolled in 10 years.</P>
      <P>The university is located on a 82.5 hectare site in Kaohsiung
City's Nantze District.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew traveled to the southern city of
Chiayi, his hometown, where he officiated at a ceremony marking the
inauguration of National Chiayi University (NCU).</P>
      <P>Siew said NCU, a merger of National Chiayi Teachers College and
the National Chiayi Institute of Technology, will definitely turn out
to be one of the most prestigious universities in southern Taiwan
given the solid academic foundation established by the two former
institutes.</P>
      <P>Vice Education Minister Yang Kuo-si has been appointed as the
newly-formed university's president.</P>
      <P>Exhilarated over NCU's establishment, the first of its kind in
the city of Chiayi, Mayor Chang Po-ya said the coming into being of
NCU is a dream come true for all Chiayi residents after years of
expectation.</P>
      <P>Also on Tuesday, the newly-established National Taipei University
(NTU) was formally inaugurated by Education Minister Yang
Chao-hsiang.</P>
      <P>Vice Education Minister Lee Chien-shin, who has been appointed
NTU's first president, said during the inaugural ceremony that NTU
will be a learning hub in Taipei County, featuring the local colors
and culture of Sanhsia and Yingke where the 54.5-hectare campus of
the new university is located.</P>
      <P>In the first year of enrollment this autumn, Lee said the
university will open 16 departments and graduate schools in five
colleges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WOMEN SAID TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF SELVES THAN DO MEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Women in Taiwan seem to take better care of
their health than do men, judging from the fact that women use health
insurance more often and incur higher medical costs than men do, the
Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The BNHI said that this may help explain why women live longer
than men, adding that 30 years from now, the difference between the
number of elderly men and elderly women will be even greater.</P>
      <P>Lee Lung-an, a researcher at the Institute of Statistical Science
of Academia Sinica, the highest research body in Taiwan, said that in
1996 and 1997, health insurance use rates and medical costs were
higher among women -- regardless of in- or out-patient status,
traditional Chinese or Western medicine.</P>
      <P>Taking 1996 as an example, Lee said there were more female than
male in-patients and men incurred lower medical costs.</P>
      <P>In that year there were also more female than male out-patients;
medication -- whether Western or traditional Chinese, administered by
physicians or dentists -- was distributed to more women than men; and
medical costs were higher for women.</P>
      <P>Lee Shao-lin, deputy manager of the BNHI's Department of Planning
and Evaluation, said that this does not necessarily mean that women
spent more in medical costs, adding that in 1996, the number of
insured women was higher than that of insured men, so the number of
female out-patients was correspondingly higher.</P>
      <P>So the most reasonable explanation is that women take better care
of their health and seek medical assistance when they are feeling
unwell, the BNHI concluded. Although they make more visits to the
doctor, women are much more likely to save the astronomical medical
costs incurred when an ignored minor malaise turns into bigger
trouble.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan is gradually becoming a graying society, Lee
estimated that medical costs for women three decades from now will be
three times the present amount, while medical costs for men will
double.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PEACE ZONE' A FUTURE GOAL: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The idea proposed by Vice President Lien
Chan to set up a "peace zone" in the Taiwan Strait will be a goal for
the future, one which requires efforts from both Taiwan and mainland
China, said National Defense Minister Tang Fei on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>However, under the current political and military situation in
the Taiwan Strait, Tang stressed that the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) will still do what is necessary to safeguard Taiwan's
security.</P>
      <P>"The 'peace zone' overture is only a personal view of Vice
President Lien which is not yet a government policy, and the MND will
carry out its military-building program as planned in order to ensure
cross-strait security," Tang said at a year-end news conference
marking his first anniversary at the post.</P>
      <P>Tang was questioned about a newspaper report that said Premier
Vincent Siew will make public in his report to the Legislative Yuan
on Feb. 18 that the MND will purchase three additional anti-missile
systems for central and southern Taiwan regions, step up local
development on air defense missile groups and increase efforts to
/cquire US-built Aegis combat systems.</P>
      <P>Responding to the query, Tang made it clear that building an
islandwide anti-missile defense network, safeguarding national
security and securing national development are the three goals that
the MND cannot elude and are necessary to protect Taiwan from
mainland Chinese military attacks.</P>
      <P>Turning to another of Lien's proposals -- that Taiwan and
mainland China should take measures to forge mutual trust on the
military front -- Tang insisted that the two sides should first end
hostility between them before moving toward that direction.</P>
      <P>If the mainland is reluctant to do so by taking concrete measures
to renounce military threat against Taiwan and forswear military
drills in waters off the island, any effort by Taiwan will be
fruitless, Tang claimed, adding that "wishful thinking will put
Taiwan in great danger."</P>
      <P>The Chinese communists remain deeply hostile toward Taiwan and
are always seeking to intimidate Taiwan, which, according to Tang, is
the key factor preventing both sides from ending the state of
hostility.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND FILES SHOW NO ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT BY SIEW IN LAFAYETTE DEALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No documents or records in the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) files showed that Premier Vincent Siew, then
the economics minister, was involved in any arms procurement from
foreign countries, said the head of the MND.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei was referring to a reported bribery
scandal concerning the sale of French-made Lafayette missile frigates
to Taiwan, in a Chinese-lunar-year-end news conference held by the
MND on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Siew reportedly had come to Paris in November 1990 to personally
lobby for the arms deal, according to the third in a series of books
on the scandal by Christine Devier-Joncour, who was once the mistress
of former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.</P>
      <P>Tang also used the opportunity to point out to the press that
regarding high-ranking Presidential Office official Su Chih-chang and
Military Intelligence Bureau chief Hsu Chu-sheng being named by a US
Rand report as perhaps intervening in the arms sales, he personally
has no impression that the two officials have had any involvement in
arms sales or procurement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang remarked that the opinions of a recently
published US-policy research report made by the California-based Rand
Institute do not represent opinions of the US Department of Defense.</P>
      <P>Tang was referring to a media report that Rand says Taiwan's
defense procurement policy is poorly coordinated.</P>
      <P>The MND's arms procurements follow a very strict procedure, the
MND chief noted. However, he said, military deals usually do not come
under the control of Taipei, as "we have always been in a passive
status" in arms procurement from foreign countries. Thus, Tang said,
it was unfair when the island's media cited the Rand report as
criticizing Taiwan's defense procurement policy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY CULTURAL CHIEF NOT FAZED BY ALLEGATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The top cultural official at Taipei City
Hall said on Tuesday that she is not fazed by allegations or
accusations after being labeled an "anti-Japanese extremist."</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai, director of the Taipei municipal government's
Bureau of Education, said she felt that Tokyo Governor Shintaro
Ishihara's recent accusation that she is an "anti-Japanese extremist"
was strange and ridiculous.</P>
      <P>Reports from Tokyo said that Ishihara told Japanese media
recently that he considers Lung to be an anti-Japanese figure, as she
said as much on one occasion when he was visiting Taipei last
November. Ishihara also asked Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou to "restrain"
Lung and her remarks, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Writer-turned-civil-servant Lung said that as a writer, she has
been called different things -- including "pro-independence,"
"pro-unification," a "Chinese traitor" when she and Mayor Ma
entertained Ishihara, and now, an "anti-Japanese extremist." "Nothing
will change me. I am still me," she said.</P>
      <P>"I have never made any remarks similar to those in reports
alleging that I described myself to Ishihara as anti-Japanese," Lung
told interviewers from the Japanese daily Sankei Shinbun's Taipei
office.</P>
      <P>"I simply gave Ishihara one of my books -- 'Thinking of the
Century' -- as a token of goodwill when he visited Taipei City Hall,"
she said. In the book, there are articles that discuss the Japanese
invasion of mainland China and occupation of Taiwan, which may likely
be the root of the accusation.</P>
      <P>"I believe Ishihara made a false accusation because he made an
erroneous judgment after receiving wrong information," Lung said.</P>
      <P>It is a serious and dangerous matter when an influential
policy-maker makes a wrong judgment based on wrong information, Lung
stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou told the media Tuesday that
he and Lung were present on the same occasion when the city
government entertained Ishihara last November, and he did not hear
Lung remark on anti-Japanese sentiment or anything similar.</P>
      <P>Chin Pu-tsung, director of the city government's Department of
Information, said the Taipei City government is not excluding the
possibility of filing a complaint or lodging a protest against
Ishihara for making improper accusations -- unless Ishihara provides
an explanation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lung's office was swamped Tuesday with a flood of
letters and phone calls from people expressing support of what they
believed to be her "anti-Japanese stance" and her determination not
to be swayed by any influence, according to city government sources.</P>
      <P>Ishihara, the Japanese novelist-turned-politician, visited Taiwan
Nov. 13-15 at the invitation of President Lee Teng-hui, mainly to
gain an understanding of Taiwan's rehabilitation after sustaining a
devastating magnitude-7.3 earthquake two months earlier.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital on
Tuesday announced the successful simultaneous transplant of both
liver and kidney, only the second such case in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The patient, a 17-year-old female student surnamed Chang, was
released from the hospital after a celebration with the best wishes
of doctors, nurses and her family members.</P>
      <P>Chang endured 15 hours of marathon surgery on Jan. 6, after she
received a liver and a kidney from a donor.</P>
      <P>Chang, who has hereditary liver and kidney problems, said she
began to develop symptoms when she was five or six years old. Her
condition continued to worsen and she required regular blood
transfusions.</P>
      <P>She had also needed dialysis every other day since she checked
into the hospital last year, which left her under great stress,
always wondering when the ordeal would end and when she could get a
donated liver and kidney.</P>
      <P>Chang's younger brother also received a liver transplant two
years ago.</P>
      <P>Chang, who had to quit school for two years because of her poor
health, said she now plans to build up her strength and return to
school in September when the new semester begins.</P>
      <P>The recipient of the first such successful transplant, a
51-year-old man surnamed Yang, also attended the festive "rebirth"
ceremony and cut the "birthday cake" together with Chang.</P>
      <P>Yang, who had liver and kidney failure problems and underwent the
same operation on Feb. 23, 1997, said that since his operation, his
physical condition has improved greatly and he can now work for more
than 10 hours a day.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation will face a shortage of between
13,000 and 20,000 people with high-tech skills each year between 2000
and 2002, the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers'
Association said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Association officials made the remarks when they released a
survey on high-tech talent at present and expected changes over the
next three years.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that domestic information and electrical and
electronic manufacturers are most short of electrical engineers who
specialize in software and hardware.</P>
      <P>The survey noted that related electrical and electronics
industries will require 162,559 high-tech talents between 1999 and
2002.</P>
      <P>The association said that even though educational institutions
have grown by 5 or 10 percent every year, the high-tech industry
still faces a shortage of between 16,000 and 17,000 skilled workers
every year.</P>
      <P>The association has suggested that the government actively take
part in nurturing high-tech talents.</P>
      <P>The association has therefore suggested that the government allow
high-tech talents from the mainland who have green cards -- or
telecommunications talents from Russia or software talents from India
-- to come to work in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Two leaders and 30 members of Falun Gong
were sentenced recently to prison terms ranging from four months to
seven years, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights
and Democratic Movement in China said Monday.</P>
      <P>They were tried in secret by a court in Beijing on Jan. 28, the

      <P>Li Xiaobing and her sister Li Xiaomei were given six and seven
years in prison respectively on charges of "managing business
illegally." The two sisters, who were leaders of Falun Gong, had sold
1.8 million volumes of Falun Gong books before they were arrested,
the information center said.</P>
      <P>The 30 Falun Gong members, who are from Beijing and Jinzhou city
in northeastern Liaoning province, were given prison terms ranging
from four months to two years on charges of "using an evil cult to
undermine the enforcement of law," because they took part in public
protests in Beijing against government crackdown on Falun Gong,
which began in July, 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US REPORTEDLY TO SELL ANTI-SUB PLANES, MISSILES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  1  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is likely to sell
anti-submarine P-3 airplanes and anti-tanker missiles to Taiwan,
according to the latest issue of the US Defense News magazine.</P>
      <P>However, the United States will likely turn down Taiwan's request
for several other items at a meeting between military officers of the
two sides to be held in April, the report said.</P>
      <P>The weekly magazine said that Taiwan's request to acquire four
AEGIS radar systems has caused a fierce debate within the Clinton
Administration.</P>
      <P>Defense News quoted both government and national defense
industrial source as saying that the Pentagon agrees with the sales
and the National Security Council and State Department officials
object to the proposal.</P>
      <P>An industrial source said that Taiwan hoped to acquire the AEGIS
system and US-made destroyers. Taiwan may just acquire the AEGIS
system and use another type of warship to carry the system, the
source said.</P>
      <P>The magazine further said that Taiwan's military acquisitions
will also include a diesel-engine submarine, AMRAAM medium-range
air-to-air missiles, and AGM-65G air-to-surface missiles.</P>
      <P>The US government turned down Taiwan's request last year, it
reported.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that facing the escalating military threat from
Beijing, Taiwan began to acquire the weapons for defensive purposes.
Taiwan has not only worked to acquire new weaponry systems but has
also reactivated its program for domestic missile development.</P>
      <P>The magazine quoted foreign wire services dispatching from Taipei
as reporting that Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan, who is
also the presidential candidate for the ruling Kuomintang, said on
Dec. 9 that Taiwan should develop long-range missiles so as to deter
the military threat from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lien's statement indicated that Taiwan doubted whether the US
would sell sufficient defensive weapons to Taiwan, it said.</P>
      <P>Beijing recently acquired some long-range missiles and airplanes
frustrating Taiwan very much, it said.</P>
      <P>A former US military attache at the US Embassy in Beijing said
recently that SU-27 jet fighters and R-77 air-to-air missiles
acquired by Beijing will enable Beijing's air force to destroy
Taiwan's air force planes taking off from air bases.</P>
      <P>Beijing will also double its naval-strike capability once it
acquires a new electronic war operation base, a US official said.</P>

      <P>Taipei police on Tuesday announced the
breaking of the largest fraud group yet to be discovered in Taiwan,
arresting 11 suspects and confiscating 13 kilograms of gold ingots
and over NT$100 million (US$3.23 million) in bank deposits.</P>
      <P>According to police accounts, a bank clerk reported to police
last year that she had been cheated of NT$9.37 million (US$302,000)
in three days.</P>
      <P>The clerk told police that she received a piece of junk mail from
the "Chingshun Asian Investment Management Co. Ltd.," which contained
a lottery ticket. After scraping the seal on the lottery ticket, she
found she had won a cash prize of NT$500,000 (US$16,100).</P>
      <P>The clerk dialed the telephone number included in the mail to try
to obtain the cash prize. However, she was told that in order to
claim her prize, she would have to pay a 15 percent "income tax" and
a NT$100,000 "membership fee."</P>
      <P>Unbelievably, the fraudsters then managed to induce her to remit
money for various profit-making investments through paper companies
set up by the group. In three days, the clerk lost NT$9.37 million.</P>
      <P>The police investigation found that the group had set up three
paper companies purporting to engage in gold and stock investments,
and that more than 1,000 people had been duped.</P>
      <P>The mastermind of the group is 25-year-old Fu Hsing-lung, who set
up an office in mainland China's offshore island of Amoy, and
controlled the operation in Taiwan via Kinmen using cellular

mass-transit vehicles on Tuesday, offering some hope that the air of
the country's most-populated city might become at least a little

      <P>The two buses are equipped with batteries and have auxiliary

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE BUDGET WILL BULGE BECAUSE OF TAIWAN'S MILITARY BUILD-UP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will build up its offensive
capability in an effort that will be mirrored in the nation's defense
budget for next year, Minister of National Defense Tang Fei said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In remarks vindicating the time-tested proverb that offense is
the best defense, the minister told local reporters at a regular
year-end press conference that the distinction between offensive and
defensive weapons is vague, and that offense is a vital part of
effective defense.</P>
      <P>Modern weapons developed exclusively for defensive use are rare,
and most arms are both defensive and offensive, said Tang.</P>
      <P>Describing his ministry's strategy as an active defense policy,
Tang asked that if under amphibious attack from Beijing, "should we
wait until they land on our shores before we fight, or should we
launch a preemptive attack as soon as their fleets leave their coast?
The answer is clear."</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks in response to questions as to whether
Taiwan is shifting away from defense to offense in light of its
aggressive arms procurement and weapons development programs.</P>
      <P>In addition to the planned purchase of six US-made patriot
anti-missile systems aimed at shielding central and southern Taiwan
from Beijing missile attacks, Taiwan is trying to acquire four
US-made destroyers armed with Aegis anti-missile systems.</P>
      <P>The island has an ambitious home-made arms program focusing on
the development of the surface-to-air anti-missile missile Sky
Sword-II which will be capable of shooting down incoming cruise
missiles.</P>
      <P>Tang said his ministry will soon finish an assessment of the
low-altitude missile defense system which consists of a long range
early warning system, ground-based anti-missile missiles and
ship-based anti-missile missiles.</P>
      <P>This build-up of offensive capability as well as the preparation
for the development of a low-attitude anti-missile system will swell
next year's defense budget, said the minister.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S DECEMBER FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS HIT SEVEN-MONTH LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average daily trade volume on Taiwan's
foreign exchange market dipped to a seven-month low of US$3.96
billion in December, according to statistics released on Tuesday by
the Central Bank of China (CBC).</P>
      <P>A total of US$87.1 billion-worth of currency changed hands in
December, working out at US$3.96 billion per day, or US$150 million
less than the turnover of the previous month.</P>
      <P>A CBC official attributed the low trade volume mainly to the
relative steadiness of the new Taiwan dollar, the Christmas holiday
season, and the much-hyped Y2K computer glitch.</P>
      <P>A breakdown of the trade showed that transactions between banks
and their customers made up 46.9 percent of the total, with the other
53.1 percent consisting of inter-bank transactions, including 19.5
percent between domestic banks and 33.6 percent between domestic
banks and foreign banks.</P>
      <P>Most of the transactions, or 53.5 percent, were exchanges between
US dollars and NT dollars, while exchanges between NT dollars and
other foreign currencies accounted for 5 percent. Exchanges between
greenbacks and yen accounted for 22.4 percent, exchanges between US
dollars and euros made up 10.5 percent, exchanges of US dollars and
Swiss francs represented 2 percent, and exchanges between US dollars
and British pounds accounted for 1.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Spot exchange trading made up the bulk of the volume, at 67.8
percent, while swapping of foreign currencies made up 15.3 percent,
forward exchange trading stood for 7.5 percent, and the other 8
percent was made up of trade in options.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WELCOMES US HOUSE PASSAGE OF TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government welcomes
Tuesday's passage by the US House of Representatives of the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act (TSEA) which calls for stronger military
ties with Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said the ROC government and people
appreciate the efforts that the US House of Representative lawmakers
have made by voting overwhelmingly to pass the TSEA, but he added
that the legislative process is an internal affair of the United
States and the MOFA is in no position to comment on it.</P>
      <P>National Defense Minister Tang Fei also welcomed the passage of
the TSEA, saying that the ROC Ministry of National Defense (MND)
welcomes any and all acts and moves that help boost Taiwan's
defense. He also noted that the TSEA legislation is an internal US
matter and the MND is in no position to comment on it.</P>
      <P>Tang said the act still needs to be passed by the US Senate and
receive the endorsement of the US president before becoming law,
mentioning that the Clinton administration is likely to veto it.</P>
      <P>Despite this backdrop, he said the MND will continue to
communicate with the Pentagon, explaining the factors affecting
Taiwan's national security and asking for more US assistance in
addressing Taiwan's defense capability needs.</P>
      <P>The House of Representatives rallied vast Democratic support to
pass the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act by a margin of 341-70 amid
opposition from the White House and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The act calls for direct military-to-military contacts between
Washington and Taipei, expanded training opportunities for ROC
officers, an annual Pentagon assessment of threats to Taiwan's
security and periodic reports on Washington's ability to respond to
them. The act also increases the number of technical staff at the
American Institute in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOFA officials declined to comment on the recent
visits to the United States by Ding Mou-shih, secretary-general of
the Presidential Office, the former secretary-general of the National
Security Council who maintains close connections with the US
government and security authorities, and Vice Foreign Affairs
Minister David Lee, who also has close American links.</P>
      <P>Ding and Lee's secretive US visits were reported by local media
as being connected to the TSEA legislation.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President and Kuomintang
Chairman Lee Teng-hui on Wednesday sent his New Year's greeting to
all the members of the ruling party, wishing them a happy New Year
and the realization of their dreams.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year which falls on Saturday,
Lee expressed his wish that the country will become more prosperous,
society will become more stable, and the people will be happier and
healthier in the coming year.</P>
      <P>As the KMT chairman, Lee did not forsake the opportunity of
speaking to all KMT members in support of Vice President Lien Chan,
the KMT presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Lee said one of the top missions of the Kuomintang in the new
year is to secure victory in the March 18 presidential election,
which will produce the 10th president and vice president of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes that all KMT members will have a nice holiday
with their families. He also said he hopes they will use some of
their free time to drum up support for Lien and his running mate
Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>He added that although the election is seen as an up-hill battle
for the KMT, "as long as we persist, the victory will be ours and as
long as we are determined, success will be with us."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAPA WELCOMES US HOUSE PASSAGE OF TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Formosan Association for Public
Affairs (FAPA), a pro-Taiwan independence organization, on Tuesday
welcomed the passage by US House of Representatives of the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act (TSEA).</P>
      <P>FAPA said in a statement that the biggest point in passing the
act is that it will "strengthen Taiwan's defense ability and protect
the independence of Taiwan's sovereignty and the initiative in the
development of democracy through the Congress supervision of the
substantive military exchanges between the United States and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>FAPA President Chen Wen-yen said in the statement that coming as
it does on the eve of Taiwan's presidential election, the passage of
the TSEA will help promote the confidence of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>FAPA noted that for six months it has mobilized all of its
members in the United States, social community organizations, as well
as Taiwanese compatriots in the United States and in Taiwan to engage
in large-scale lobbying, and has held two seminars on the TSEA. It
has also encouraged Taiwanese-Americans to go to US Capitol Hill to
seek support from US congressmen.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the House of Representatives on Tuesday afternoon,
Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D-NY) said that in her constituency, many
Taiwanese-Americans are concerned about the TSEA and had sought her
support for the passage of the act.</P>
      <P>Sources in the US Congress indicated that despite the fact that
Beijing has achieved great progress in lobbying on Capitol Hill, it
is unlikely that Beijing can catch up with the pace of
Taiwanese-American footsteps in grassroots-level canvassing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK A LITMUS TEST FOR `ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS': ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong is a litmus test to gauge
Communist China's likely behavior in the event of the mainland's
reunification with Taiwan under the "one country, two systems"
formula, according to an analysis published Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Stratfor, Inc., a private global intelligence services company
based in Austin, Texas, wrote that if Beijing appears to bully Hong
Kong in blatant disregard of its autonomy, Taiwan's public will
become increasingly nervous,</P>
      <P>The analysis pointed out that this can only fuel President Lee
Teng-hui's campaign to redefine cross-strait relations as special
"state-to-state," easing the concept of Taiwan's independence into
the political mainstream.</P>
      <P>The issue of extradition has become the latest issue in relations
between Beijing and Hong Kong based on the `one country, two systems'
formula. Under existing laws, Beijing cannot extradite suspects from
Hong Kong, raising concerns that top officials implicated in a
months-long corruption shakedown may flee to Hong Kong for safe
haven.</P>
      <P>Now that the corruption has become major news worldwide and
threatens to destabilize Communist China, Beijing will likely force
Hong Kong to change the rules, said the analysis, adding that Beijing
will protect the illusion of autonomy, but in the end Hong Kong will
have to capitulate.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Zhu Rongji is all too aware that a crackdown on
Hong Kong could send investors fleeing and could have grim
implications on the prospects of reunification of Taiwan with the
mainland under a 'one country, two systems' formula. When the British
handed over Hong Kong in July 1997, China promised to leave the its
autonomy largely intact under this framework so as to prevent a
large-scale investment exodus.</P>
      <P>"But Beijing's behavior toward the island over the last several
years reflects the obvious: China's sovereignty takes precedence over
Hong Kong's autonomy," noted the Stratfor, Inc. analysis.</P>
      <P>China's relationship with Hong Kong has already been tested. Last
July, Hong Kong's highest court issued a ruling on immigration that
both Beijing and the local government disliked. Under Beijing's
demand that it alter its decision, the court capitulated and issued a
statement agreeing to Beijing's right to reinterpret the Basic Law
developed when Britain ruled Hong Kong, said the analysis.</P>
      <P>By intervening in Hong Kong's judicial process, the analysis
continued, "Beijing has highlighted the thin veneer of autonomy."</P>
      <P>A more recent event suggests that the interference will continue.
On Jan. 17, the Chinese government announced that Xinhua's Hong Kong
bureau would no longer double as the Chinese Communist Party's
surveillance unit in Hong Kong and proceeded to set up an official
Liaison Office to watch over the local government.</P>
      <P>Now the extradition issue may prompt Beijing to pull rank once
again. The two sides have been negotiating, but Beijing will
ultimately persuade the Hong Kong government to accept the change,
concluded the analysis.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian researchers have discovered the
cause of a strange disorder afflicting a disproportionate number of
Quebecois.</P>
      <P>Scientists from two Montreal hospitals, Montreal General and
Ste-Justine, used molecular-cloning technology to identify the
defective gene that causes autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of
Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS). Symptoms of the disease include slow
and jerky movements as well as deteriorating eyesight.</P>
      <P>The researchers traced the faulty gene to two French pioneers who
settled in northeastern Quebec between 1608 and 1760. They each
carried a different mutation of the gene. This was passed from
generation to generation within the isolated population of
Charlevoix-Saguenay.</P>
      <P>Doctors have developed a genetic blood test to screen couples
from the region who might be thinking of having children.</P>
      <P>The disease can only develop in a child if both parents carry

      <P>Five gunmen assaulted and
robbed two guards near the gate of the Taoyuan air force base on
Wednesday morning, before speeding away in a stolen sedan with one of
the soldiers' rifles, according to military sources.</P>
      <P>Soldier Lin Ming-cheh, 23, who was riding a bicycle with another
soldier toward the base entrance to prepare for a sentry change, was
attacked and knocked unconscious by the five men, three of whom were
armed with pistols. The robbers made away with Lin's .65 rifle, which
was unloaded.</P>
      <P>According to Lin's colleague, Lee Shao-hsien, the gunmen also
tried to steal his rifle, but failed because he held on tight to his
weapon and protected it with his body until other sentries heard the
commotion and rushed to their rescue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLARIS TAKES LEAD IN TAIWAN'S SECURITIES ON-LINE TRADING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   2   (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While on-line trading has become
increasingly prevalent in Taiwan's securities brokerage market,
Polaris Securities Group, a pioneer in this sector, took the lead in
1999 by grasping 27.71 percent of the market share.</P>
      <P>Polaris Group President Wayne Pai said that with the coming of
the Internet era, Polaris has expanded its services by introducing an
electronic trading system combining a virtual trading floor and
on-line/voice order placement modules. The system has expanded
Polaris' brokerage operations and an increasing number of clients are
using the system.</P>
      <P>By the end of January, 170,000 on-line trading clients were using
the Polaris services. In January, the company's on-line trading
business was estimated to exceed NT$70 billion, and Pai said that the
company has set a target of NT$100 billion.</P>
      <P>Commissions from on-line trading sales amounted to NT$7 million
monthly, representing only 25 percent the company's monthly revenues.
However, Pai said he believes that if current trends continue, income
from on-line trading will soon account for 40 percent of the
company's overall revenue.</P>
      <P>Since Polaris began on-line trading in December 1997, some 40
other securities brokers have joined the competition, but Pai said
Polaris has been able to maintain its competitiveness by facilitating
its services with an islandwide high-speed network.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1999, securities brokers in Taiwan had 8.28 million
on-line trading clients, with monthly trading volume amounting to
NT$210 billion. Last December, Polaris alone had 1.15 million on-line
trading clients, with trading volume amounting to NT$46.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Pai said that to facilitate Polaris' on-line trading services,
the company has been trying to offer its clients a "decision support
system." Russell Co., Ltd., a company affiliate, for instance, is
providing financial information services for securities, futures and
financial derivatives.</P>
      <P>In addition to its success in the domestic securities market, the
Polaris Group in recent years has made impressive expansions
overseas. Polaris Holdings (Cayman) Ltd. was set up in December 1996
to consolidate international activities. In April 1998, the Shanghai
office started operations and the following month, the company
inaugurated its Hong Kong stock brokerage business. On July 30
1999, the company marked the commencement of indirect brokerage
services in the Japanese securities market.</P>
      <P>Pai added that with the maturing of the Internet environment,
Polaris' far-sighted and persistent R&amp;D will guarantee the continuous
growth of the company and benefit the financial market as a whole.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSEA PASSAGE AIMED AT PUSHING FOR AEGIS SALES TO TAIWAN: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The passage of the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act (TSEA) through the US House of Representatives is
aimed at prompting US sales of the Aegis combat system to Taiwan,
China expert Paal Douglas said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing its firm support of Taiwan, Douglas
analyzed that the House might want to send a message to the US
administration with the vote in hope of pushing it to consider the
sale of the weapons system to Taiwan, a final decision on which is
expected within the coming two months.</P>
      <P>According to Douglas, who maintains close contact with US
officials, the Clinton administration is aware of the House's attempt
to push for the sale to Taiwan with the passage of the act, which won
bipartisan support with a vote of 341-70.</P>
      <P>The TSEA calls for increased military contacts between the United
States and Taiwan, enhanced training and exchanges between the two
militaries, and annual reports from the Pentagon to Congress on
Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Both the US Department of State and the National Security Council
(NSC) are reportedly opposed to the transfer of the Aegis combat
system to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Douglas, who served as head of the Asian affairs department at
the NSC during the Bush administration, said the vote will be sent to
the Senate for approval, and noted that Senate Republican leader
Trent Lott is from Mississippi, home to one of the two companies that
build the Aegis-class destroyers.</P>
      <P>Regarding speculation that US President Bill Clinton promised
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin last year in New Zealand not
to transfer more weapons to Taiwan this year, the China expert said
White House officials have categorically denied the allegation.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he is unable to forecast the US government's final
decision on arms sales to Taiwan, Douglas said he believes that the
Clinton administration will undermine its efforts to grant mainland
China permanent normal trade relations status if the issue blows up.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OIL PRICE HIKE EXPECTED IN MID-FEBRUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) on
Wednesday announced that it will probably raise domestic oil prices
on Feb. 15, due chiefly to the continuous increase in the cost of
imported crude.</P>
      <P>The price of gasoline and diesel is expected to increase by 2.9
percent, or NT$0.4 per liter.</P>
      <P>According to the CPC, the average price of imported crude in
January reached US$24.57 per barrel, a rise from the preceding
month's US$23.79 and the highest price since 1991. In addition,
January's exchange rate was NT$30.90 against the US dollar, a slight
appreciation over the previous month's NT$31.60.</P>
      <P>CPC's NT$6.8 billion cumulative profit deficit from June to
November 1999 has put further pressure on the corporation to raise
prices after the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>International oil prices have fluctuated recently between US$28
and US$29, with the price of crude in west Texas on Feb. 1 quoted at
US$28.22 per barrel.</P>
      <P>One CPC executive also pointed out that the international crude
market is still bullish, leaving room for the possibility that prices
will surpass the peak of US$29.66 per barrel reached on Jan. 20.</P>
      <P>The CPC last raised its prices on Dec. 8, calculating on the
basis of a cost of US$19.5 per barrel and an exchange rate of
NT$31.64 against the greenback, and so far, local petroleum prices
have not yet reflected the increased cost of imported crude.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman and President Lee
Teng-hui on Wednesday said he approved of plans to increase the
pension fund for veterans and "inspire patriotism" in their
offspring.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement during the regular weekly meeting of the
KMT Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The KMT has been losing its support from veterans who arrived in
Taiwan in 1949 and their descendants, and is keen to find ways to
halt this loss of its traditional voter base.</P>
      <P>Lee Chen-lin, Chairman of the Vocational Assistance Commission
for Retired Servicemen (VACRS) under the Executive Yuan briefed the
president on a package of measures designed to take care of the
nation's veterans, most of whom are now in their seventies and
eighties.</P>
      <P>The measures include adjusting the functions of Homes for Retired
Servicemen, increasing the pension fund for veterans, and enhancing
economic assistance to the families of deceased veterans.</P>
      <P>In response to the organization's plan, President Lee said the
government always appreciates and respects what the veterans have
contributed to the country, and feels that the government "has done
everything it can to take care of them and to understand their
needs."</P>
      <P>Apart from instructing the VACRS to thoroughly implement the
plans to care for the country's old soldiers, President Lee said the

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL SECURITY CANNOT BE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN LAWS: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of National Defense (MND) officials
on Wednesday welcomed the passage through the US Congress of an act
designed to boost Taiwan's security, but stressed that the nation's
security cannot be dependent upon the laws of a foreign country.</P>
      <P>The US House of Representatives on Tuesday passed the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act (TSEA), which was introduced by one of the
most powerful Republicans in the House, Texas Representative Tom
DeLay.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of National Defense Tang Fei said at a
news conference that the TSEA is an internal affair of the United
States, and that the MND is no position to comment on it.</P>
      <P>However, in his evaluation of the act before the Legislature
during its last session, Tang pointed out that one possible outcome
of the bill, regardless of its eventual ratification or not, could be
"a misunderstanding of the US executive branch toward Taipei which
could in turn affect US arms sales to the country."</P>
      <P>The act is designed to allow Congress to take part in the process
of making decisions on arms sales to Taiwan. It would require the
president to report to Congress annually on Taiwan's defense
requests, and would demand that the president give reasons for his
approval or disapproval of the nation's defense requests.</P>
      <P>The TSEA would also require the US Department of Defense to
conduct training of Taiwan military officers, and would permit direct
military communications between Washington and Taipei.</P>
      <P>The act must still be approved in the Senate, and even then will
face the possibility of a presidential veto, according to informed

    <HEADLINE>OK FOR ROC &amp; PRC TO ENTER WTO TOGETHER: US HOUSE MEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is definitely no problem with
Taiwan and mainland China being granted World Trade Organization
(WTO) membership simultaneously, said Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Trade Phil Crane (R-Ill.) of the US House of Representatives on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Crane, who is also vice chairman of the full Ways and Means
Committee, added that Taiwan would have completed all the procedures
required for WTO membership years ago if mainland China had not
insisted on entering before Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the Asian Association, Crane pointed out
that both parties across the Taiwan Strait should be allowed to enter
the global trade authority, while the United States should grant
mainland China permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status.</P>
      <P>Mainland China must race against time to conclude all the
bilateral trade talks required by the WTO so that the US House can
then pass the mainland's NTR status, Crane said, adding that the
talks should be completed by June or July, so the House can review
them before adjourning in August, in order to make it in time for
both Taiwan and the mainland to simultaneously enter the WTO this
year.</P>
      <P>When asked whether simultaneous WTO entry would hamper the House
vote on the mainland's permanent NTR status, and whether the House
has long held the tacit understanding of supporting simultaneous
entry, Crane denied being aware of any hindrance of NTR status for
the mainland, but said he reckoned Taiwan would have finished all
necessary trade talks had it not been for the mainland China factor.

    <HEADLINE>BILL STRENGTHENING MILITARY TIES WITH TAIWAN CRUISES THROUGH US HOUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US House of Representatives passed a
bill on Tuesday aimed at strengthening military ties with Taiwan,
despite warnings from Beijing and the White House.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, introduced by Republican
Whip Tom Delay of Texas, passed by a vote of 341-70, well over the
two-thirds majority needed to override a veto from the White House,
which President Bill Clinton's aides have suggested is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The legislation would strengthen Washington's military ties with
Taiwan by creating military-to-military contacts, giving Taiwan
officers training opportunities at US military academies and stepping
up military exchanges.</P>
      <P>It calls for yearly government reports on Taiwan's security,
including Beijing's military threat to the island, and US capability
of responding to crisises in the Asia-Pacific region when US
interests in Taiwan are in danger.</P>
      <P>The act also asserts the precedence of the 1979 Taiwan Relations
Act, which provides for US arms sales to Taiwan for its self-defense,
over the 1982 communique in which Washington pledged to gradually
reduce its arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The measure's supporters in the House said that it is a reaction
to the reported buildup of Beijing's missile arsenal along the Taiwan
Strait, and that Congress must make clear that the United States will
continue its long-standing commitment to a peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>The act is a watered-down version of the original draft which had
also stipulated the sales of specific arms to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the bill, even after being diluted, has been frowned on by
the Clinton administration. White House national security spokesman
David Leavy said earlier on Tuesday that if the bill passed, "the
president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto it," because
"it would decrease rather than enhance Taiwan security and risk the
stability of the entire East Asian region."</P>
      <P>US State Department spokesman James Foley said after the vote
that the measure "would seriously diminish Taiwan's security and
undermine overall US objectives of stability in Asia."</P>
      <P>Beijing has repeatedly opposed the act. A representative from
mainland China's embassy in Washington warned on Monday that the
bill's passage "will bring about serious damage" to Sino-US relations
and will undermine the US commitment to recognizing only one China.</P>
      <P>A similar act has been introduced in the Senate by the
influential Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, but it
hasn't seemed to enjoy as much support, and its fate is less certain.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senate approval of the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act by an overwhelming margin would send Beijing a clear
message that the United States will not tolerate use of force to take
or threaten Taiwan, said Taiwanese Legislator Parris Chang here on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang, of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, made the
remark when he delivered the keynote speech at a meeting of the
private think tank the US Enterprise Institute on Tuesday afternoon,
after the House of Representatives approved the act 341-70. The act
will soon be sent to Senate for approval.</P>
      <P>Even if the act fails in the Senate and goes no further, Chang
said, it will still serve to reiterate the official US policy of zero
tolerance for any intention by mainland China of using force to
settle the cross-Taiwan Strait issue, when the United States again
holds talks with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Mentioning Taiwan's March 18 presidential election, Chang said
the ruling Kuomintang has been in power for more than 50 years and
now the time has come for an alternative political party, adding that
the KMT's candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, is favored to win
because people believe that the KMT possesses rich resources.</P>
      <P>Chang said that former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, who was
favored to win last year's Taipei mayoral election, was actually
defeated by his KMT rival, Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chang strongly endorsed Chen, who is the
Democratic Progressive Party's presidential candidate. The DPP's
words and actions are consistent, Chang stressed, adding that if Chen
is elected, it will not cause war to break out between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that Chen attaches great importance to
Taiwan-US relations and that if elected, Chen will strengthen
dialogue with the US executive and legislative branches.</P>
      <P>Chen has expressed his goodwill to Beijing by proposing direct
marine and air links across the Taiwan Strait, Chang said, adding
that if Chen is elected, he will break through the deadlock of
strained relations between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Regarding talks between Taipei and Beijing, Chang said dialogue
should be held on a basis of equal footing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The amount of Taiwan currency in circulation
broke the NT$1 trillion mark Wednesday in the seasonal rush on New
Taiwan dollars before the Chinese New Year, and is expected to keep
growing before banks close for the holidays on Friday, said the
Central Bank of China (CBC).</P>
      <P>A total of NT$1.006 trillion was circulating on the market on
Wednesday, or NT$38.6 billion more than Tuesday's amount.</P>
      <P>Circulating currency last peaked on Dec. 30 when the nation was
bracing for potential Y2K computer glitches. A total of NT$806.9
billion was on the market then.</P>
      <P>The run on currency subsided after early January, and the amount
in circulation dipped to NT$ 796.9 billion on Jan. 21 before the next
upward trend.</P>
      <P>A total of NT$209.6 billion in additional currency has streamed
into market since that time, and that figure is expected to rise to
NT$300 billion by Friday, said the CBC.</P>
      <P>The largest-ever amount of currency in circulation -- NT$1.25
trillion -- was recorded in 1998 on the eve of the Chinese New Year,

circulating currency will be returned to the banking system after the
New Year holidays.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW COLLEGE OF MEDICINE TO CARE FOR HEALTH OF SENIOR CITIZENS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3   (CNA)
(By Chen Ching-fang &amp; Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly established Fu Jen Catholic
University College of Medicine, the 11th such school in Taiwan, will
soon begin enrolling its first 50 students.</P>
      <P>Both the Catholic Alzheimer Social Welfare Foundation and the
Catholic Sanitax Socio Medical Service and Education Foundation under
the Chinese Regional Bishops Conference have agreed that the new
college should set improved research on the aged, as well as
community health care, as its principal goals.</P>
      <P>Sr. Mary Ann Low, the newly appointed dean of the college,
revealed that although care for the aged and community health service
are not profitable undertakings, both the foundations agree that as
Taiwan is a graying society, Fu Jen College of Medicine should take
on the job which others are unwilling to tackle.</P>
      <P>"Why would you like to be a doctor?" Low once asked while
interviewing youths applying to enter a medical college in the United
States. Some of them answered honestly: "Because doctors make more
money." Asked in Taiwan, however, the same question may have drawn
the answer: "Because it is the top choice on the joint entrance
examination" -- a reference to the local belief that status in
society is all-important.</P>
      <P>Because of this, Low said she has decided to run a different kind
of medical college -- one which puts equal emphasis on professional
medical training, humanism and all-round education.</P>
      <P>According to Low, who is currently head of the Cardinal Tien
Center, a hospital in Hsintien City, Taipei County, "the meaning of
`patient' is `ill person,'" but current medical education focuses on
the "disease" and ignores the "patient."</P>
      <P>The business of doctors is not merely to prevent and cure
diseases. They have to deal not only with the illness itself but also
with the patient's psychological, family and economic situation.
According to Low, doctors should treat their patients like parents
care for their children.</P>
      <P>All these social skills, Low stressed, should start with
education. Prior to teaching at the college of medicine, a teacher
should remember what it is like to be a student and should learn how
to educate a college student. Low expressed her hope that her college
will adopt a system based on mutual interaction between teacher and
student, instead of the traditional "rote-learning" style of
teaching.</P>
      <P>As for students who hope to enter the Fu Jen Catholic University
College of Medicine, Low said, they must first get rid of their
superiority complexes and egos. She added that it would also be
better for them to do some volunteer work in order to gain some
experience of community service.</P>
      <P>Low said students should be able to think about the need for
social support in their medical studies and they should also know
about labor and social welfare systems. More importantly, they should
learn how to think independently, and should posses the ability of
self-education and self-growth.</P>
      <P>Low expressed her belief that without a good doctor-patient
relationship, there is no way to completely cure and settle a sick
person. She said that cases have shown again and again that only
cooperation and team work can create a win-win situation, prevent
medical disputes, and raise the quality of medical treatment.</P>
      <P>The Catholic nun also said she believes that only through
all-round education, humanism and medical training for doctors can
patients obtain complete care for both their bodies and souls, and
added that in the future she will stress that not only end-stage
cancer patients need peaceful care, all medical workers should pay
more attention to the mental and physical needs of all patients.</P>
      <P>Low noted that when the Sept. 21 earthquake rocked Taiwan,
medical workers flocked to disaster areas to save lives. She
expressed her hope that students who graduate from Fu Jen Catholic
University College of Medicine will not only go to villages and other
remote areas with the same purpose and touching enthusiasm, but also
with better ideas and work techniques.</P>
      <P>She said she believes that if doctors in remote areas can retain
their ability to think and study independently, using tools such as
Internet technology, they will not fall behind in their medical
knowledge.</P>
      <P>PHOTO CAPTION: Sr. Mary Ann Low, head of the Cardinal Tien
Center, has been appointed dean of the newly estalbished Fu Jen
Catholic University College of Medicine. She said it is time for
Taiwanese medical workers to take care of their own people in remote
areas of Taiwan, which has depended on foreign missionaries to do the
job for years.</P>

      <P>An A300-600R airbus of

Manila on Thursday morning, formally resuming direct air links
between Taiwan and the Philippines after they had been suspended for
four months.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways, another Taiwanese carrier providing international

to offer a provisional flight Friday from Taipei to Manila to
transport Filipino workers home for the Lunar New Year holidays, said
air industry sources on Thursday.</P>

from Manila to Taipei on Feb. 10 for Taiwan-bound passengers from the
Philippines, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Regular two-way flights between Taiwan and the Philippines are
not expected to fully resume until Feb. 21, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>After a four month suspension of direct air links since last Oct.
2 and numerous rounds of talks, Taiwan and the Philippines decided to
restore bilateral aviation relations on Jan. 28.</P>
      <P>None of the carriers on either side, however, was ready to begin
actual services on Jan. 28 due to the need for logistical

    <HEADLINE>PAULINE LEUNG: A PIONEER IN TAIWAN'S PR SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By T. P. Lee and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pauline Leung has been credited as the most
distinguished Chinese public relations officer in the Asia-Pacific
region, but she still says home is her first priority.</P>
      <P>Asked about the secret of her success, Leung, who is chief
executive officer of Compass Public Relations, says: "Modern woman
should know what she is after, and so long as she sticks to her
ideals, she will have a chance to succeed."</P>
      <P>Leung, who seems to mingle naturally with others, said: "I love
being around people," and it is maybe her passion about people that
has enabled her to stick to her work for so long.</P>
      <P>Born and educated in Hong Kong, Leung began her career in the
service industry at Cathay Pacific Airways' head office in Hong Kong,
where she established herself quickly in the areas of customer
relations.</P>
      <P>In 1980, Leung moved to Taipei and joined Hilton International
Taipei as Public Relations Manager. She launched Compass Public
Relations only a decade ago. From a manager to a chief executive
officer, she has immersed herself in the field of public relations,
and says that the trade is about "care," putting your heart into your
work, and dealing sincerely with others.</P>
      <P>Possessed of a cheerful and optimistic nature, she looks much
younger than her 50 years. She is also active in community and social
service activities.</P>
      <P>Already at top of her trade when public relations were still
quite unknown to the general public in Taiwan, she has plowed her
furrow and earned great accolades.</P>
      <P>Still, she remains modest, saying that she has got where she is
today simply because "I have worked longest in the field."</P>
      <P>She also attributes her fame to her active role in public service
activities. Her husband is also considerate enough to shoulder part
of the household chores so that she can concentrate on her work.</P>
      <P>Public relations have long been considered a job for women, but
according to Leung, Taiwan is still a conventional society, and
Taiwan women must find a balance between the responsibilities of
career and family.</P>
      <P>Leung defines PR work as obtaining support from others, and
trying to develop harmonious relations and good exchanges with all
related personnel, adding that enterprises need to succeed to
survive, and that they need to obtain trust and give a good
impression to promote understanding and upgrade the image of the
companies.</P>
      <P>"The difference between PR and advertising, is that the latter
tries to influence a person's way of thinking about something, while
the former tries to influence a person's thinking completely," Leung
said.</P>
      <P>As government agencies and private enterprises have begun setting
up their own PR departments, Leung was asked about how a PR company
can find a niche and survive the competitive pressure.</P>
      <P>She says maintaining a nice relationship with the media is only
one of the businesses of PR work, and that most businesses have now
shifted the focus to marketing, so that the situation is "not so
pessimistic after all."</P>
      <P>But she does worry that PR is a tough job with few rewards, so
that not many stay in the profession. "If a person is a rolling
stone, it means that it will be hard for him or her to gather
experience," Leung says.</P>
      <P>She added that in today's "fast food culture," most young men in
Taiwan aspire to succeed in a short time, and that they are not
willing to put more effort into PR, adding that the PR sector is
facing a personnel shortage.</P>
      <P>Despite a hectic schedule, Leung says she cherishes time spent
with her two children and her husband, saying that her biggest dream
this year is a week abroad with the whole family.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN, OVERSEAS CHINESE INVESTMENT IN TAIWAN BRISK IN 1999</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The amount of foreign and overseas Chinese
investment in Taiwan in 1999 was the second highest annual total
since the ROC government began allowing investment from abroad into
Taiwan, according to statistics released by the Investment Commission
(IC) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the IC statistics, the government approved a total
of 1,068 foreign and overseas Chinese investment projects in 1999,
worth a combined total of US$4.185 billion. These figures represent a
16.34 percent increase in the number of projects and a 27.03 percent
increase in the total value of investments from 1998 figures.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that a total of 683 foreign and overseas
Chinese investment projects with a total value of US$4.3 billion were
approved in 1997, hitting a new record high at the time. The figure
represented a 73 percent increase over that of 1996.</P>
      <P>The IC said the main reason why foreign and overseas Chinese
investment in 1999 was so brisk was the ROC government's large-scale
loosening of restrictions on foreign investment in the local
financial and insurance sectors and in the services and
telecommunications industries in a bid to join the World Trade
Organization as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The growth rate in the amount of foreign and overseas Chinese
investment in Taiwan in 1999 was highest in the telecommunications
industry. The official figures showed that the amount of foreign and
overseas Chinese investment in the local telecommunications industry
in 1999 was US$294 million, representing an increase of 501.13
percent over that of the previous year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's electronics and electric appliance industry
was still the most attractive to foreign and overseas Chinese
investment. A total of US$1.033 billion worth of investment projects
in this industry was approved last year, accounting for 24.69 percent
of the total amount invested in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The IC's figures also showed that a total of 104 foreign and
overseas Chinese investment projects worth a total of US$674.06
million were approved in December 1999.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   3  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officially approved indirect Taiwan
investment on the Chinese mainland totaled US$1.252 billion in 1999,
representing a decrease of US$266 million, or 17.54 percent, from the
previous year's total, sources at the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The capital channeled into the mainland by Taiwanese businesses
last year went towards 641 investment projects, a decrease of 153
projects from a year earlier, according to officials from the MOEA's
Investment Commission.</P>
      <P>Commission officials attributed the decline to the aftermath of
the Asian economic crisis that began to batter the region in late
1997 and also to the unclear and complicated investment environment
in mainland China. The amount of investment by Taiwanese businesses
on the mainland has been declining for several consecutive years.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that Taiwanese investment in mainland China's
electronics and electrical engineering sector also declined US$537
million, or 17.7 percent in 1999, thereby dismissing allegations that
there had been a feverish relocation of investment to the mainland in
Taiwan's high-tech industry sector.</P>
      <P>All Taiwanese industries, including the high-tech industry,
reduced their mainland-bound investment last year, the officials
concluded.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan could eventually become one of the
world's major markets for art and antiques, given its solid wealth
and the knowledge local collectors have accumulated, said one of the
world's leading connoisseurs on Thursday.</P>
      <P>To reach that point, Taiwan's collectors will have to see the
country's statutes governing export, import and taxation become
liberalized, said J.J. Lally, formerly a top broker/manager with
Sotheby's who now runs his own business.</P>
      <P>Lally, who is here at the invitation of a Taipei antique
brokerage company, said that unless Taiwan deregulates its import and
export restrictions and its tax on sales of antiques and artifacts,
Taiwanese collectors as a group will find it hard to turn Taiwan into
the driving force behind Asia's international art market.</P>
      <P>Once the relevant regulations are liberalized, Lally noted,
Taiwan could become another New York, attracting both funds and
world-class art mavens.</P>
      <P>Despite the existing situation, Taiwan is still promising to
become one of the major markets in Asia on the grounds that the
global market for Chinese antiques and artifacts has just started its
engine and average auction prices are still relatively low compared
with Western works of art, Lally said.</P>
      <P>In Lally's eyes, Taiwanese collectors on the whole are a mature
and sophisticated group. "Many of them were seen at auctions in New
York and London over the past years. Their possession of a great
number of top-notch artworks is positive," Lally said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lally added that he has noticed over years of
experience and observation that Taiwanese collectors do not seem very
enthusiastic about selling their collections, especially top-notch
articles. "They only buy, and seldom sell," he commented.</P>
      <P>The habit has thus resulted in a great challenge for professional
brokers like himself, he pointed out.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Thursday issued a
sternly worded statement condemning independent presidential
candidate James Soong for making allegedly false accusations about
the Republic of China's arms purchases.</P>
      <P>Quoting a report by the California-based research institute the
Rand Corporation, Soong said at a recent campaign forum that the
ROC's weaponry purchases were not for defense needs, but to satisfy
demands of high-ranking Presidential Office officials.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office statement said Soong's inappropriate
remarks marked a serious insult to both the Presidential Office and
all of the ROC's military servicemen.</P>
      <P>The statement further said Soong had quoted erroneous information
and fabricated rumors about the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has consistently conducted very
careful and prudent evaluation of every arms deal, the statement
stressed that Taiwan has drawn up weaponry procurement plans based on
defense needs and arsenal modernization projects.</P>
      <P>The statement also pointed out that the Rand report contains a
lot of erroneous information about the ROC's arms procurement
planning and operations.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable that Soong has deliberately disseminated the
erroneous Rand Corporation report even after the Ministry of National
Defense and other relevant government agencies had refuted the
report," the statement said, adding that Soong should assume legal
responsibility for airing false allegations against the ROC
government.</P>
      <P>Michael Swaine, a Rand Corporation researcher, compiled the
78-page report last year, criticizing the ROC's military procurement
policy as being often based on political rather than military
considerations.</P>
      <P>Swaine's report also described the ROC military's procurement
procedures as poorly coordinated. It further claimed that as Taiwan's
military personnel are insufficiently trained, its advanced weapons
are not used to their fullest extent.</P>

      <P>Daytime weather on Friday, the eve of the
Chinese New Year, and Saturday, New Year's Day, will be fine, the
Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Because the strength of seasonal northeasterly winds has

Taiwan, the weather over the last two days before the holiday was
fine, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>The bureau forecast Thursday's high temperature in northern
Taiwan at 23 degrees Celsius, reaching 24 degrees to 25 degrees in
central, southern and eastern Taiwan. The CWB predicted Friday's
temperature will further rise by 1 degree to 2 degrees islandwide.</P>
      <P>The CWB said fine weather will last until Saturday afternoon. The
weather will turn unstable Saturday night when another cold air mass
will approach.</P>
      <P>Rain is expected in northern and northeastern Taiwan Saturday

      <P>With the landmark meeting of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ending in recess in Seattle two months ago, the
world trade body will convene a general meeting of its board members
Monday, which Taiwan officials feel will not go smoothly.</P>
      <P>Subcommittees designed for negotiations regarding agricultural
and service sectors are set to be established in the WTO. Since
member states differ in their positions on agricultural talks,
consensus will not be easily reached, said officials of the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Ministers of the WTO's leading member states, such as the United
States, the European Union, Japan and India, recently exchanged
opinions about how to make the new round of talks a success,
according to BOFT officials.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, said the officials, WTO Secretary-General Mike
Moore met with US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on Jan.
19 to talk about the resumption of the WTO ministerial conference.</P>
      <P>Despite the aggressive promotion efforts by the US officials, the
new round of WTO talks has still hit snags, just like what happened
in the Uruguay round, said the BOFT officials.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not currently a member of the WTO, Taipei is
allowed to take part in the negotiations, and if nothing unexpected
occurs, Taiwan is likely to join the global trade regulatory body by
the middle of 2000, and could then formally join the new round of
talks, the BOFT officials added.</P>

      <P>The approval will enable the ROC head of state to take part in
the summit meetings of SICA, as the group is known by its Spanish

Central America in 1997.</P>
      <P>The approval of the ROC as a SICA observer will further enhance
bilateral relations between the ROC and the Central American region,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The group's members are Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa

observer, and the ROC is now the first nation outside the region to
be approved for observer status.</P>
      <P>SICA was organized by Central American countries in 1972 with the
aim of promoting economic integration with each other. It will
promote political cooperation among member-nations in the future.</P>

country. Belize's prime minister also attended that meeting as an

      <P>A Boeing 737-800 passenger plane to
be used by top Republic of China leaders will arrive in Taiwan on
Feb. 7, authoritative sources said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Seattle-based Boeing Co. originally delivered the specially

      <P>However, the sources said, air force authorities then sent the
plane to San Antonio, Texas, for undisclosed equipment modifications,
after which it was flown back to Seattle.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the ROC version of "Air Force One" is
equipped with cutting-edge electronic communications and security
protection systems, which will allow the head of state to
communicate with the maximum-guarded Hengshan Commanding
Headquarters, the military's nerve-center, and command all the three
branches of the military aboard the plane to cope with any
emergencies.</P>

drafts of three bills, a move which Premier Vincent Siew said will
lay a sound foundation for the future of Taiwan's democratic
development.</P>
      <P>The three bills -- a law on political parties, regulations
governing political donations, and a law relating to lobbying --
which still need to be approved by the Legislative Yuan, form part of
the so-called "sunshine legislation" package being promoted by the
government in its effort to ensure Taiwan's continued
democratization, according to Siew.</P>
      <P>Other "sunshine laws" such as the Public Functionary Assets
Disclosure Law and the law governing the transparency of government
information, have already been approved.</P>
      <P>The law of political parties will clearly define the extent of
the activities a political party can conduct, in order to build a
fair system for competition among different political parties. Since
the ban on political assemblies was lifted in 1989, a total of 89
political parties have officially registered their names with the
Interior Ministry.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the regulations governing political donations is
to set rules to effectively administer political funds and minimize
the possible adverse effects of political contributions, while the
aim of the legislation of the lobby law is designed to avoid illegal
influence trafficking and money politics by setting up open and
transparent game rules for all parties involved.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RATE HIKE BY US FED HAS LIMITED IMPACT ON TAIWAN: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) said on
Thursday that the US Federal Reserve Board's decision to raise
interest rates by 0.25 percent would have a limited impact on
Taiwan's financial market.</P>
      <P>According to CBC officials, the Fed's move is only a moderate
adjustment, leaving room for further rate hikes in the future, which
may be necessary due to the consumer price index's growth-rate
increase of 2.7 percent last year and the 5.8-percent economic growth
rate in the fourth quarter -- two facts that imply growing pressure
toward retail price increases.</P>
      <P>However, future rate increases would stay within the scope of a
quarter percentage-point, with the hope of curbing inflationary
pressure on one hand and avoiding harm to the recovering global
economy on the other, CBC officials said.</P>
      <P>The CBC currently has no plan to raise rates as the local market
is relatively stable and foreign capital inflows are continuing;
however, a rate hike after the Lunar New Year holidays is likely in
light of the solid gains experienced by the stock market and the
exchange market, CBC officials noted.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Use of the death penalty in China is
apparently widespread as Amnesty International has confirmed that the
number of people executed there is higher than in the rest of the
world combined, the Australian reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily reported that 1769 mainland
Chinese citizens were executed in 1998 alone. It added that the
figure was collated from public reports and is probably far lower the
actual number of executions as national statistics on the death
penalty are a state secret.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that children, drunk drivers, thieves and
political prisoners were among those executed and that torture was
often used to extract confessions. Trials of political prisoners were
often held behind closed doors and appeals were invariably rejected.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Chinese police and judiciary have been gearing
up for the Lunar New Year in traditional style with an upsurge in
executions of criminals as authorities try to burnish their image
ahead of the country's most important holiday.
 The number of reported death sentences and executions
generally increases ahead of public holidays, anniversaries and
important events as authorities seek public favor for their efforts at
reducing crime across the mainland, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US WILL CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE FREEDOM AND REFORM IN CHINA: BERGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  2 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With or without the Washington-Beijing
agreement on China's accession to the World Trade Organization, the
United States will continue to press Beijing to respect global norms
on non-proliferation and encourage a peaceful resolution to the
Taiwan issue, stressed White House National Security Adviser Samuel
R. Berger Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Berger said in his remarks delivered at The Woodrow Wilson Center
for Scholars here that "our interest lies in encouraging both
stability and change in China by encouraging it to meet, not stifle,
the growing demand of its people for openness, accountability,
freedom and reform."</P>
      <P>He said that bringing Communist China into the WTO will help this
in three ways. First, he explained, this is not just an agreement to
expand trade between the United States and mainland China, but "will
oblige China to deepen its market reforms and open its economy to the
world. It will also increase the pace of change in China."</P>
      <P>Second, he said that by accelerating economic reform, the
agreement also "has the potential to encourage China to evolve into a
more open society."</P>
      <P>Finally, by opening mainland China's telecommunications market to
cutting-edge American technology and international firms, the WTO
agreement will help bring the information revolution to cities and
towns across mainland China. And as they become more mobile, more
prosperous and more aware of alternative ways of life, "I believe
they will seek a stronger voice in shaping their destiny," he said.</P>
      <P>Berger admitted that all the changes in mainland China over the
past years "do not mean that the people of China enjoy political
freedom. Chinese authorities still tolerate no organized political
dissent or opposition, and no challenge to the Communist Party."</P>
      <P>He added that "because the Communist Party's ideology has largely
been discredited in China, and because it lacks the legitimacy that
can only come from democratic choice, it seeks to maintain its grip
by suppressing other voices."</P>
      <P>This agreement is not, by itself, a human rights policy for the
United States, noted Berger, but he stressed that "we must and we
will continue to speak out on behalf of people in China who are
persecuted for their political and religious beliefs. That's why the
United States will sponsor a resolution in the UN Human Rights
Commission condemning Communist China's human rights record again
this year."</P>
      <P>"We will continue to press China to respect global norms on
non-proliferation, to encourage a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan
issue, to urge China to be part of the solution to the problem of
global climate change. At the same time, I believe this agreement
will reinforce and complement these efforts, and help move China in
the right direction in fundamental ways," said Berger.</P>
      <P>He added that "it is our shared conviction that supporting this
agreement is a new beginning. It is the right thing for America, for
China, for Asia, and for the world. It will increase the chance that
China will define its future within the international community, and
move toward a more open society that upholds the rule of law."
Therefore, Congress must grant Communist China permanent normal trade
relations status to help Beijing join the WTO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S0COG FACING FINANCIAL SHORTFALL AND MORE SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Organizers of Sydney's 2000 Olympic Games
are facing more problems with a larger-than-expected financial
shortfall and another brewing scandal ahead of the event scheduled
for mid-September this year.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG)
reported Wednesday that the budget situation has worsened with its
board members being told that the financial shortfall is close to
A$180 (US$120) million, much higher than the earlier estimate of
A$100 (US$63) million.</P>
      <P>The revised estimate is due to ticketing problems. The SOCOG
ticketing team reported that it has found less tickets are available
for sale than originally projected.</P>
      <P>In addition, the media has been focusing on allegations against
Australia's most senior member of the International Olympic
Committee, Kevin Gosper, that his wife and two daughters took
expensive trips to the Salt Lake City in 1993.</P>
      <P>Despite his denial of the allegations on Wednesday, Gosper is
facing immense pressure in his bid for the IOC's top job once the
present president Antonio Samaranch retires from the position in a
year or two.</P>
      <P>The SOCOG has already lost some major sponsors, including Reebok,
because of earlier allegations that another senior Australian IOC
member, Phil Coles, accepted expensive gifts and paid trips to Salt
Lake City nearly a year ago.</P>
      <P>Coles was relieved of his position on the SOCOG board and
stripped of other major titles as a result of the allegations.</P>
      <P>That scandal seriously tarnished Australia's image ahead of the
Sydney games and the latest allegations against Gosper will only
increase the damage, sports commentators here said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN WANTS POWER SHIFT TO BRING NEW CLIMATE TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung urged voters to help realize a transfer of power by
abandoning the long-ruling Kuomintang, when he offered New Year's
greetings on behalf of his party Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the statement in a festival welcome speech dubbed
"Promoting a power shift, receiving Taiwan's spring," saying he hopes
that a brand new political atmosphere resulting from a party shift
and a power switch will be realized this year.</P>
      <P>The KMT has been seriously burdened by its money- and
gangster-ridden politics since it seized power over a half-century
ago and subsequently took advantage of its privilege, making itself
the largest hurdle standing in the way of national development and
realization of social justice, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Lin further accused the KMT of widening Taiwan's gap between the
rich and poor to 5.5 times, the largest differential in history, and
of allowing the unemployment rate to deteriorate to a record high of
2.92 percent, while making a fortune for itself through illegal means
and privileges.</P>
      <P>KMT party assets are estimated at NT$600 billion, making it the
richest political party in the world, he said</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that the wealthy KMT alienates itself from the
real lives of ordinary people and that the KMT's deeds have further
estranged it from public opinion. To sum up, Lin said, the KMT is no
longer entitled to represent social justice or the people's
interests.</P>
      <P>In a bid to drum up more support, Lin recommended the DPP as the
best party to stand for the people, saying that it is ready to govern
the country with plenty of platforms in all areas to create a
peaceful and stable environment for Taiwan to march toward a globally
competitive future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a good chance to make the dream of a power shift a
reality in the 2000 presidential election, Lin said, urging people to
give the KMT the thumb's down through their votes.

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S ELECTION THREAT WOULD BE 'TERRIBLE BLUNDER': ROC ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It would be a "terrible blunder" for
mainland China to threaten Taiwan in the run-up to the Republic of
China's March 18 presidential election as it did in 1996, a senior
ROC presidential adviser said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Any act of intimidation or use of force against Taiwan during
our presidential campaign period would simply be counterproductive,"
said John Chang, a senior adviser to ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chang, a member of the ROC delegation to an annual prayer
breakfast meeting at the White House to be held on Thursday, made the
remarks in a speech delivered at the US National Press Club.</P>
      <P>Beijing lobbed missiles and conducted live-fire war games at
Taiwan's doorstep in the run-up to the ROC's first-ever direct
presidential election in 1996. That intimidation campaign backfired
with Taiwan voters overwhelmingly electing Beijing's nemesis,
President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Chang said if mainland China would try again to threaten people
in Taiwan in the run-up to the upcoming presidential election, it
would be a terrible blunder.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former foreign minister and secretary-general of the
ROC's ruling Kuomintang, pointed out that the ROC government is
willing to discuss with mainland China any issues, as long as the
discussions take place on a basis of parity for both sides.</P>
      <P>He explained this stance by noting that two different governments
now exist on Chinese soil, and pointing out that Taiwan's basic
stance is that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait share China's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Turning to the ROC's presidential campaign issue, Chang said the
competition is very fierce. He predicted that no single presidential
hopeful can garner more than 45 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Chang said the new ROC president must meet three indispensible
conditions. "First, the new president must be wholeheartedly
identified with Taiwan's land, people, history and culture. Second,
he must have an international vision or perspective. Third, He must
be able to maintain and promote peaceful cross-strait relations," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Chang said he believes that KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan
would be able to win the election. "In addition to Lien's superb
personal qualities, he has the full support of the KMT's
well-organized campaign apparatus," Chang said, adding that he
believes 60 percent to 70 percent of swing voters would eventually
throw their support behind Lien.</P>
      <P>Chang also pointed out that Taiwan's democratization has
produced two "by-products" which have often prompted mainland China
to misunderstand Taiwan's basic stance on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"One of them is that public opinion has played an increasingly
important role in Taiwan's decision-making process, and the other is
the rise of a 'new Taiwan' culture which is characterized by three
features -- pragmatism, gradualism and compromise," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>He further said mainland China's claim that Taiwan's political
metamorphosis is aimed at seeking de jure independence is totally
unfunded.</P>
      <P>Noting that the greatest obstacle to cross-strait relations lies
in the fact that each side of the Taiwan Strait has its own
definition of the "one China" principle, Chang said Beijing's
definition totally ignores the political realities on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Beijing insists that one China refers to the People's Republic
of China and that the ROC is a local-level government under the PRC
jurisdiction. Chang said Beijing's stance is completely
unacceptable to the ROC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIA SEES POSSIBLE MILITARY FLARE-UP IN TAIWAN STRAIT THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is a high potential for another
military flare-up across the Taiwan Strait this year, Director George
Tenet of the US Central Intelligence Agency said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This is because of Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition on July 9 of ties with mainland China as "a special
state-to-state relationship," an idea which has Beijing leaders
deeply worried that Taiwan's return to rule by mainland China is less
likely than before. Beijing, argued Tenet, seems to think a show of
force is required if they are to preserve any hope of reunification.</P>
      <P>The CIA head said in a statement on worldwide threats to peace
delivered to a Senate committee that the catalyst for this tension is
the Taiwan election on March 18, which Beijing will be monitoring for
signs that a new president will retreat from Lee's statements, or
further extend the political distance from reunification.</P>
      <P>Tenet went on, however, that Beijing today still lacks the air
and maritime capability to successfully invade Taiwan, despite its
increase in the size and sophistication of its forces arrayed along
the Strait, most notably its short-range ballistic missiles, and its
order for four state-of-the-art Russia-made destroyers.</P>
      <P>A senior military intelligence official who attended the hearing
supported Tenet's opinion, saying that the Taiwan issue will remain a
major potential flashpoint, particularly in the short term.</P>
      <P>As tension between China and Taiwan remains high, the official
predicted an increased risk of small-scale military "incidents" --
intimidating exercises, heightened force readiness in border regions,
accidents involving opposition air or naval forces in close
proximity, etc.</P>
      <P>However, he said, it is doubtful, unless Taipei moves more
directly toward independence, that mainland China will attempt a
larger-scale military operation to attack Taiwan outright.</P>
      <P>Beijing recognizes the risk inherent in such a move and, at least
for the near term, probably has questions about its military ability
to succeed.</P>
      <P>He predicted that by 2015, mainland China's conventional force
modernization will provide an increasingly credible military threat
against Taiwan, but probably not the large amphibious capability
necessary for invasion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Friday he
earnestly hopes that Taiwan will continue carrying out political
reforms to consolidate its fledgling democratic system after his
presidential term ends in May.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a Chinese New Year's Eve speech, which
was broadcast in Mandarin, Taiwanese dialect and Hakka via television
and satellite to people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and
overseas Chinese.</P>
      <P>After five decades of incessant efforts, Lee said, Taiwan has
managed to achieve economic prosperity and establish a democratic
political system and liberal society.</P>
      <P>Lee recalled that the thing he is most proud of in his 12 years
as the Republic of China's head of state is working together with all
citizens to overcome a variety of adversities and accomplish
democratic reform in a gradual manner.</P>
      <P>"Nowadays, people on this island enjoy economic affluence,
democracy and greater freedoms to express opinions and develop their
own potential to the fullest extent," Lee said, adding: "This is the
fruit of our concerted efforts and the most valuable legacy that we
can leave for posterity."</P>
      <P>Noting that the road to a mature democracy is bumpy and full of
challenges, Lee said he hopes the nation will not stop its pursuit of
continued democratic reform after he steps down from the presidency
this May.</P>
      <P>"We must continue promoting political reforms and economic
liberalization so that our people can lead a life free from fear and
poverty," Lee said, adding that he believes all the people of Taiwan
will treasure its achievements and work even harder to sustain the
nation's development and further upgrade its competitiveness in the
global market.</P>
      <P>This year marks the beginning of a new millennium in the Western
calendar and it is also the Year of Dragon in the Chinese zodiac, Lee
noted. For Chinese people, Lee said, this should be an auspicious
year of special significance.</P>
      <P>As Chinese New Year is the most important festival on the lunar
calendar, Lee said he would take advantage of the occasion to wish
all fellow citizens a prosperous and happy New Year.</P>
      <P>"I would also pray for our country's good fortune," Lee said,
adding that he would continue working hand-in-hand with the people of
Taiwan for the nation's well-being.</P>

several US senators, including Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) and Sen.
Timothy P. Johnson (D-S.D.)</P>
      <P>Johnson said the US Congress hopes that Taiwan's upcoming
presidential election can proceed smoothly, adding that mainland
China should not take any action to threaten or intimidate Taiwan
voters in the run-up to the critical election.</P>
      <P>The US House of Representatives passed the controversial Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act with a bipartisan vote of 341-70 on

issue.</P>
      <P>Members of the ROC delegation included John Chang, a senior
adviser to the President, Legislator Chen Hung-chi, National
Assembly Deputy Wu Tung-sheng, and Cheng An-kuo, vice chairman of the

      <P>In addition to meeting with Clinton administration officials,
the delegation will pay courtesy calls on senior officials of both
the Republican Party and the Democratic Party on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LATEST POLL ON US-TAIWAN TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  3  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 60 percent of Americans
believe the United States should expand military ties with Taiwan
even though that would anger mainland China, according to the results
of a recent opinion poll released by CNN on Thursday.</P>
      <P>After the US House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly
passed the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act to strengthen formal
military relations with Taiwan, CNN conducted an Internet-based
"Quick Vote" on whether the United States should expand military ties
with Taiwan despite Beijing's angry response and strong opposition by
the Clinton administration.</P>
      <P>Of the 2,674 responses registered by noon on Thursday, 1,705
participants, or 64 percent, answered "Yes" to the question, while
there were only 969 "No" votes, or 36 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>CNN pointed out, however, that the poll is not scientific and
reflects the opinions of only those Internet users who chose to
participate. "The results cannot be assumed to represent the opinions
of Internet users in general, nor the (American) public as a whole,"

    <TEXT>
      <P>Government economic measures designed to
fortify the economy have started to bear fruit one year after
implementation, sources from the Executive Yuan said on Friday.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to resolve many systemic and structural flaws faced
by the domestic economy, last February the Executive Yuan approved a
set of reform measures meant to solve problems in the fields of
finance, enterprise, labor, housing and land. A total of seven
measures and 107 specific steps were designed with the hope of
creating an environment favorable to economic development.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew presented the package of measures on
numerous occasions, including the ruling Kuomintang's 15th National
Congress, legislative sessions and meetings with committees of the
Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The measures' effect can be detected from last year's increased
exports, improved financial sector and heightened industrial output
-- in spite of the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake -- said committees
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, adding that the
economy is expected to continue improving as both domestic demand and
exports should expand as post-quake reconstruction progresses.</P>
      <P>The economic reform measures will be a focus for the government
in 2000, with the hope of continuing to ameliorate the economic
situation.

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN SWIMMERS WANT BLOOD TESTING BY IOC BEFORE OLYMPICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  4 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The organization Australian Swimming has
strongly urged the International Olympic Committee to introduce some
form of blood testing ahead of September's Olympic Games in Sydney,
saying it is highly likely drug cheats will walk away with gold
medals.</P>
      <P>Australian Swimming president Terry Gathercole said blood testing
will not only catch drug cheats, but will also prove the innocence of
those swimmers who don't take performance-enhancing drugs.</P>
      <P>After Australian swimming ace Ian Thorpe won a championship in
London this week, the head coach of the German men's team accused him
of taking drugs. Thorpe was upset and shot back on Thursday, calling
for blood testing to be introduced to protect swimmers from
unsupported allegations of drug use.</P>
      <P>"I've never taken drugs and I won't take drugs because it is
purely cheating. This brings up again the need for blood testing in
international swimming to prove the innocent to be innocent. I have a
urine test every two weeks at home and it's being done quite
religiously now and I am more than happy to accommodate it to make
sure that this is a clean sport in the future," Thorpe told
reporters.</P>
      <P>Gathercole said Australian Swimming has been pushing the sport's
governing body, known as FINA, and the IOC to introduce blood testing
as a way of detecting the performance-enhancing drug erythropoietin
and human growth hormones.</P>
      <P>He said he had urged IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch to
consider two blood testing options for Sydney. "The first scenario
was everybody be required at accreditation to give blood. That blood
would then be frozen and tested at a later date when the testing did
become available," said Gathercole.</P>
      <P>"My second scenario -- if the first was too hard -- is that they
should set up blood-giving on a volunteer basis at the accreditation
at the Olympics. ... Those who didn't volunteer would be given an
accreditation which clearly shows they did not give blood, and from
there we could let their fellow competitors, the public, and their
sponsors draw their own conclusions as the Games results came
through," he added.

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior economics minister has told
foreign investors to make careful assessments before investing in
Indonesia because it could be risky, reported the Australian
Financial Review on Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a gathering of international investors in Jakarta on
Thursday, Kwik Kian Gie, the only ethnic Chinese in Indonesian
President Abdurrahman Wahid's Cabinet, said: "Before you come, please
calculate carefully if you can make profits in Indonesia."</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Jakarta, the daily reported that Kwik's candid
remarks may undermine Wahid's efforts to woo foreign investors to set
up shop in Indonesia. Wahid is currently visiting Europe to attract
European investors.</P>
      <P>But Kwik said he was surprised there was not more public outrage
in Indonesia over revelations of banking abuses, such as
related-party loans, violations of lending limits and loans to
companies that do not exist.</P>
      <P>Kwik said he is determined to fight against financial corruption
and for economic recovery for Indonesia.</P>
      <P>He said the Indonesian government would tackle share-market
corruption with an overhaul of securities laws and stock market
rules. He accused foreign fund managers of joining in share practices
that were "illegal in the United States."

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S 'ONE CHINA' POLICY UNACCEPTABLE TO TAIWAN: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Unless Taiwan is allowed to define "one
China" in its own way, whoever is elected its next president will not
accept Beijing's claim that it is the sole "China" and Taiwan is a
part of it, said a visiting Kuomintang senior official on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shaw Yu-ming, vice secretary-general of the ruling KMT, delivered
a speech at the Washington-based think tank the American Enterprise
Institute for Public Policy Research, saying that although
reunification is the ultimate goal pursued by Taiwan, it will be
achievable only after the democratization of mainland China and the
leveling of the living standard on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said Washington should understand Taipei's stance and should
convince Beijing of the Republic of China's dedication to national
reunification.</P>
      <P>The former director of the ROC Government Information Office
categorically denied that Taiwan is little by little moving toward
independence, saying its geographical proximity to mainland China
prohibits it from having its own way politically, and independence
would hardly earn it more diplomatic friendship than it has now.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Shaw outlined the government's efforts to
establish a clean image of the government.</P>
      <P>Admitting that Taiwan is plagued by the close association between
politicians and business magnates, emergence of
mobster-turned-politicians, secret political contributions, and huge
assets accumulated by KMT, Shaw ascribed the situation to negligence
of the ruling party, which has been fully occupied with developing
the economy and coping with Beijing's military threat while galloping
along the road to democracy over the last decade.</P>
      <P>However, a bill regulating political parties' activities has been
introduced in the Legislative Yuan, which would help address these
problems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GLOBAL PP PRODUCTION TO INCREASE BY 3.4 MILLION TONS IN 2000</HEADLINE>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Global polypropylene (PP) production will
increase by 3.4 million metric tons this year, thus putting pressure
on suppliers, according to a chemical-industry source on Friday.</P>
      <P>The industrial source said that global production of PP, commonly
used in manufacturing plastic shopping bags and in packaging, totaled
32.44 metric tons in 1999.</P>
      <P>Because the main PP producers are concentrated in the Asian
region, competition will be more fierce in this area than in others,
the source said.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that Asia is expected to increase its PP
production by 1.35 million metric tons this year, of which Taiwan's
increase will account for 300,000 metric tons. Increases are also
expected in mainland China, India, Indonesia and Singapore.</P>
      <P>The same statistics show that the Asian region will produce a
total of 8.55 million metric tons of PP in 2000.</P>
      <P>PP is quoted at US$600 per ton at the present time, but the price
and profits will be further cut in the second half of the year as
supply may surpass demand, the source said, adding that the price
will depend on the demand of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mainland China was the largest consumer of PP last year,
importing 1.3 million metric tons.</P>

      <P>Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong pledged on
Friday that she will do her utmost in the New Year to make Taiwan
an island where rule of the law prevails.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who assumed her current post on Feb. 1, 1999, made the
promise in a news conference held on the Chinese New Year's Eve.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Chinese New Year is the most important festival
on the lunar calendar, Yeh said she has ordered prosecution
authorities to cooperate closely with police officers to crack
down on burglary during the lunar New Year's holiday.</P>
      <P>"We will take concrete action to create a safe living environment
and enable our people to lead a life free of fears," Yeh stressed.</P>
      <P>Since taking the helm at the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), Yeh said
she has received petitions from many local residents asking the
ministry to step up anti-burglary campaign to ensure a secure living
environment.</P>
      <P>In response, Yeh said the MOJ has worked out a comprehensive
anti-burglary action plan to crack down on the crime. "We hope local
residents will coordinate and cooperate with police and prosecution
authorities to help upgrade the efficiency of the anti-burglary
operations," she urged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh said all law-enforcement officers will also make
concerted efforts to crack down on other criminal activities and
improve public order.</P>
      <P>Yeh further said the MOJ will continue promoting judicial
reforms and imposing stricter discipline to prevent irregularities
or corruption on the part of judicial personnel.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yeh said the MOJ has long promoted a campaign to
enhance local youngsters' legal knowledge by explaining difficult
legal provisions in simple language. "We hope local parents will

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WISH EVERYONE A HAPPY NEW YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four pairs of presidential candidates on
Friday, the eve of the lunar Chinese New Year, made public
appearances to deliver new year's greetings, and none of them forgot
to use the occasion to canvass for themselves.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen
Shui-bian had a busy schedule Friday, first wishing everyone a happy
new year at a press conference in Taipei, and then going to several
produce and meat markets to personally greet local citizens.</P>
      <P>During the press conference, Chen focused on criticizing the
government, saying that the ruling Kuomintang has usually failed to
honor its promises and the KMT's presidential candidate, current Vice
President Lien Chan, even presented many irresponsible platforms that
would cost several hundreds of billions of taxpayers' dollars in
exchange for votes.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the people to forsake Lien, who Chen regards as
representative of money- and violence-ridden politics, by not
supporting him and thereby creating a fair society through their
votes, saying that only when the KMT regime is terminated can Taiwan
start to enjoy a fair and just society.</P>
      <P>Chen shifted his campaign venue to traditional markets, areas
that are host to his major voting base. Surrounded by enthusiastic
supporters and crowds busy buying groceries, Chen shook hands and
waved while offering New Year's greetings and, most importantly,
urging people to vote for him.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Lien Chan did not spend New Year's Eve resting, either.
Following arrangements by his campaign staff, Lien visited several
Taichung communities of veterans, servicemen and their families, who
had traditionally been the KMT's primary voter base but have recently
been shifting their support to other parties.</P>
      <P>Warmly greeted by the central Taiwan military community members,
Lien was encouraged and stressed that the KMT has designed a package
of measures boosting veterans and servicemen's welfare, including a
raise in their pension checks, job arrangements for retired
servicemen and timely reconstruction of older community facilities.</P>
      <P>Lien, while assuring that all his platforms will be realized,
hoped all the veterans and their families would unify in support of
the KMT and disregard rumors and allegations spread by his rivals.</P>
      <P>Lien will have a busy day on New Year's Day. Apart from visiting
senior KMT officials and the widow of late President Chiang
Ching-kuo, he will pay tribute to on-duty staff at the Taipei Airport
and area hospitals.</P>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate James Soong and his wife, Chen
Wan-shui, also made use of New Year's Eve to drum up support. She
went to Taipei's Tung-Men (East Gate) market to greet the busy
grocery-shoppers and urge them to vote for her husband. The
easy-going Chen was showered with many greetings in return and heard
voices of support from many women.</P>
      <P>The couple will reportedly spend their New Year's Eve with
earthquake victims in central Taiwan's Nantou County, which was
seriously jolted by the Sept. 21 quake.</P>
      <P>The other independent presidential candidate, Hsu Hsin-liang,
spent the day visiting patients and workers at Taipei's Veterans
General Hospital, wishing patients a happy New Year by presenting
them with red envelopes, traditional tokens of good luck for the
coming year, which contained plastic value-storage cards worth NT$50
(US$1.50) for use on city busses and the mass rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>Later, Hsu and running mate Chu Huei-liang were scheduled to
visit Taipei city street cleaners, Taipei Municipal Yangming Hospital
and squatters on government-owned land at Chi-nan Mountain in
Taipei's Ta-chi district.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves are
expected to hit a record high in the first month of this year, thanks
to various factors including brisk export trade, said officials from
the country's central bank on Monday.</P>
      <P>The country's forex reserves are expected to top US$110 billion
in the month of January as a result of continuous month-on-month
growth, officials from the Central Bank of China (CBC) said. The
exact figure, however, is expected to be made known later this week.</P>
      <P>Reserves have increased every month since last August when the
figure broke the US$100 billion mark, CBC officials said. The total
was US$100.13 billion in August, and gradually increased to US$101.65
billion in September, US$102.68 billion in October, US$103.54 billion
in November and US$106.2 billion in December.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the remarkable growth mainly to better
export performance, the appreciation of the Taiwan currency against
the US dollar and greater inflow of foreign capital.</P>
      <P>Taiwan remained the world's No. 3 cash-hoarding country behind
Japan and mainland China. If the forex reserves that are held in the
private sector, estimated at around US$70 billion, are included in
the January total, Taiwan's forex reserves and assets actually come
to US$180 billion, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The greenback accounts for the highest portion of the reserves,
at about 57 percent, followed by the EU currency, the Japanese yen
and others, they noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAKES BREAKTHROUGH IN WILDLIFE CONSERVATION EFFORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Specialists with the Ministry of Justice's
Investigation Bureau (MOJIB) have successfully developed technology
to identify certain characteristics of smuggled bear gall bladders so
as to detect and trace the sources of the illicit trade.</P>
      <P>The technology, which primarily identifies whether a gall bladder
is from an Asian or a North American bear, marks a breakthrough for
the effort to track down sources of the animal-organ trade, with the
world's first solution to the problem of how to make such an
identification, according to Huang Yi-ho, chief of the MOJIB's
department for toxicological and biochemical analysis.</P>
      <P>The method, based on advanced gas chromatography and mass
spectrometry technology, is used to analyze the amount of taurocholic
acid in a gall bladder to determine whether the bile belongs to an
Asian bear or one from North America, said Huang.</P>
      <P>According to MOJIB studies, about 70 percent of the bear gall
bladders found or confiscated in Taiwan are fake and are actually the
gall bladders of tigers or pigs. And most of the "gall bladders" that
really do come from bears are artificially made and contain bile
collected from bears raised in mainland China. The process of
gathering bile from the living creatures is cruel and inhumane, said
Huang.</P>
      <P>The method of identification has roused the attention and
interest of wildlife conservationists and of relevant authorities in
the United States, he added.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, MOJIB chemists have been using the same technology to
detect drug use by analyzing strands of human hair, a first in
Taiwan. The method can be employed to not only determine whether a
person has used narcotics, but for how long.</P>
      <P>The same method is also used to analyze smuggled glands from musk
deer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL ANNUITY PROGRAM TO BE TOP PRIORITY FOR GOV'T</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Establishment of a national annuity program
will be among the top priorities of the government's administrative
policies for the year 2001, even if the proposed program is postponed
for another year, the government said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Sources from the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said that completing plans for the monthly pension
program and carrying it out are among the most important policies of
the government in the new century.</P>
      <P>The much-discussed national annuity program was originally
scheduled to be launched in 2000, with estimated per capita monthly
contributions of NT$870 (US$28) to be paid by eligible ROC nationals
between the ages of 25 and 64. People aged 65 and over could receive
a monthly pension of NT$2,000 (US$65) for the rest of their lives,
according to preliminary CEPD plans.</P>
      <P>The program was postponed as the country is now in dire need of
vast quantities of cash to finance post-earthquake reconstruction.
President Lee Teng-hui estimated last year that it will take about
NT$250 billion to finance post-disaster rehabilitation. A devastating
earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale struck central Taiwan
on Sept. 21, leaving at least 2,200 people dead, more than 8,800
injured and some 100,000 others temporarily homeless.</P>
      <P>The national annuity program was envisioned with the goal of
taking better care of all ROC citizens, particularly the 4 million
who have not purchased private insurance and are not covered by any
social insurance, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>An aging society, Taiwan is expected to see 10.3 percent of its
entire population, or 2.48 million people, be 65 years old or older
by 2011, a factor which makes a national pension program vitally
necessary, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The CEPD estimated that the government will need an extra NT$20
billion to NT$30 billion to finance the program in the first year of
its inception.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials thus suggested that the Ministry of Finance hike
the level of Taiwan's sales tax by one percentage point (from the
present 5 percent to 6 percent) as a means of generating more money
to help finance the proposed national annuity program.</P>

possess what they really do not possess; pretend to have plenty, when
they have really nothing; and pretend to be in affluence when they
are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is difficult to
be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate James
Soong has a strong team for campaign literature judging from the fact
that there are three former deputy director-generals of the
Government Information Office (GIO) serving in his camp.</P>
      <P>Yen Jung-chang, a spokesman for Soong's camp, said that after
being joined by former Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao, he became
aware of the coincidence when discussing campaign strategy with Soong
and Liao one day.</P>
      <P>Yen, who rose steadily from the grassroots to the position of GIO
deputy director which he held at retirement, said that he was also a
former subordinate of both Soong and Liao.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that while he was serving in the GIO's Domestic
Information Service Department, Soong was deputy director-general of
the GIO. Soong's popularity grew rapidly when he spoke on behalf of
the government when the United States decided to sever diplomatic
relations with the Republic of China in 1978.</P>
      <P>Many young people were attracted by Soong and joined the GIO at
the time, Yen recalled.</P>
      <P>Yen said he was the GIO's director of the Radio &amp; Television
Affairs Department when Liao was serving as GIO deputy
director-general.</P>
      <P>In related news, young supporters of Soong are scheduled to go
around the island during a weeklong period to drum up support for the
candidate.</P>
      <P>The youthful team will depart from Taipei on Tuesday and will go
visit eight cities and counties.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, the youth will visit Ilan, Hualien,
Taitung, Pingtung and Kaohsiung before arriving in Tainan on Feb. 13
where a meeting is scheduled between Chang Chao-hsiung, Soong's

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) said on Tuesday that with the continued increases in the world
price of crude, it will have to hike its oil price next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CPC Chairman Chen Chao-wei made the remarks on the first day of
work after the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the current price of world crude stands at
between US$27 and US$28 per barrel. The CPC's last adjustment however
was based on estimates of US$19.5 per barrel for world crude, which
he said has not fully reflected the actual cost of purchased oil.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that petroleum prices will rise by NT$0.4 per
liter, or about 2.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he hopes there won't be any more increases after
next Tuesday's hike. He also noted that the modest adjustment of less
than three percent won't have much of an effect on domestic prices.</P>
      <P>In addition to the rising cost of purchasing crude, the CPC is
also lagging behind its profit target of NT$6.86 billion by the end
of the year set by the government, CPC officials said.</P>

      <P>Lius Alberto Wong Chan, the new Nicaraguan
ambassador to the Republic of China, stands out in the diplomatic
corps because of his Chinese roots.</P>
      <P>The ambassador's father Juan Wong emigrated from mainland China
to Nicaragua in the 1930s and he was born in Managua, Nicaragua in
1959.</P>
      <P>The ambassador said that his father came from Zhongshan in
Guangdung province, the same place as the ROC's founding father Sun
Yat-sen. He added that overseas Chinese in Nicaragua are proud to see
him return to the ROC to serve as the ambassador.</P>
      <P>The 41-year-old ambassador, who arrived here last month to assume
the new post, graduated from Georgetown University in Washington
D.C., majoring in finance and international management.</P>
      <P>The ambassador said that he has fond memories of Taiwan, adding
that he studied Chinese for 15 months in 1997. He said he attended
the leadership meeting between the heads of Central American
governments and the Republic of China in September 1999.</P>
      <P>Wong said the embassy will introduce the works of Latin American
writers to Taiwan in the middle of the month in order to enhance
Taiwanese people's understanding of Latin American literature.</P>
      <P>He said that with the assistance and cooperation of the

be held in Taipei at the World Trade Center in mid-February.</P>

      <P>After the exhibition, the embassy will donate the books to
libraries in Taiwan and to universities that have set up Spanish
language and literature departments.</P>
      <P>Wong said that local people may not be aware that there are many
distinguished artists and poets from Central America, and he is
hoping that through cultural exchanges such as the book exhibition,
more people will learn about Spanish-language writers.</P>
      <P>He also said that the embassy is now considering working with

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FOREX RESERVES HIT NEW RECORD HIGH IN JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a new
record high in the first month of this year, the Central Bank of
China (CBC) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The country's forex reserves totaled US$110.05 billion in
January, ranking third in the world, behind only Japan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's forex reserves in January increased by US$3.85 billion
from the previous month, or US$18.13 billion higher than the same
month last year.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that forex reserves have increased for 19
consecutive months and have topped the US$100 billion figure for each
of the last six months.</P>
      <P>Forex reserves have increased every month since last August when
the figure broke the US$100 billion mark, CBC officials said. The
total was US$100.13 billion in August, and gradually increased to
US$101.65 billion in September, US$102.68 billion in October,
US$103.54 billion in November and US$106.2 billion in December.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the five consecutive months of
registering new record highs to increasing exports, the inflow of
foreign capital, and discontinued foreign currency deposits.</P>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate James
Soong announced the five guidelines for his youth policy, stressing a
multifaceted peaceful environment for the development of Taiwan's
youth.</P>
      <P>Soong pointed out that the 5-E guidelines of his youth policy for
the so called "E Generation" are: environment (for growth);
education; employment; entertainment; and enrichment.</P>
      <P>The independent presidential hopeful also reiterated the
importance of maintaining peace, adding that the youth on the island
want "a fair chance to succeed" rather than have to "fight a war."</P>
      <P>Soong and his running mate Chang Chao-hsiung made the
announcement during a news conference.</P>
      <P>Soong emphasized that the principle of his campaign's youth
policy is to never impose the opinions of the older generation on
Taiwan's youth. He cited Morris Chang, chair and CEO of Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, as saying that those of the
younger generation have their own ideas and will achieve their own
goals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN UNCHANGED: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's basic stance on the Taiwan issue
remains unchanged despite the Chinese Communist Party's greater
display of pressure on Taiwan, said officials with the ruling
Kuomintang on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Judging from the remarks made by mainland Chinese Vice Premier
Qian Qichen on Jan. 28 at a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's "eight-point statement,"
KMT officials in charge of research on mainland China affairs said
Beijing remains firm on its approach to the Taiwan question on both
the political and economic fronts.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT officials, Qian did make it clear that the
mainland authorities must step up the pace of settling the Taiwan
issue, but he did not mention a specific "time table."</P>
      <P>The officials opined that in the current international climate,
where Beijing is still seeking to increase its status and image on
the world stage and where it still cannot ignore pressure from the
United States, it will not recklessly change its attitude of favoring
a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>The KMT officials described Qian's comment that a move by Taiwan
toward independence can only mean war in the Taiwan Strait, as the
sternest statement ever made by the mainland Chinese authorities
toward the Taiwan independence movement.</P>
      <P>Qian's comments may have been aimed at putting greater verbal
pressure on Taiwan by warning Taiwan's future president on the one
hand, while attempting to influence the outcome of the presidential
election on the other hand, said the officials.</P>
      <P>As to Beijing's rhetoric that cross-strait negotiations based on
the "one country, two systems" formula will fully respect Taiwan's
position and that talk of Taiwan's political status can also be
included in bilateral negotiations, further illustrates the Beijing
leadership's lack of sincerity, claimed the KMT officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE ECHOES POPE'S CALL FOR PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday said that
the Republic of China and the Vatican should join hands to strive for
freedom and democracy for the enslaved people in mainland China and
other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>President Lee made the remarks during his official response to
"World Day of Peace" message issued by Pope John II at the beginning
of the new millennium.</P>
      <P>He said that the 20th century will be remembered as an age of the
rise and the fall of the Communist Soviet Empire, particularly the
defeat of Communism in Europe and the fall of the Berlin Wall.</P>
      <P>"This was made possible thanks to the great leaders like Your
Holiness, President Reagan, President Bush, Prime Minister Thatcher
President Gorbachev. All of you will be remembered by people around
the world for your contribution to world peace," the president said.</P>
      <P>Entering the new millennium, Lee said, communism is still
prevalent on the Chinese mainland, in North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba.
He added that it is most unfortunate that China and Korea are still
divided.</P>
      <P>"Even worse, the Catholic Church, which your holiness so
devotedly represents, is still divided in mainland China where our
brothers and sisters are denied human rights and the freedom of
religion. A one-party rule still exists in the People's Republic of
China (PRC), whereas just on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, the
people of the Republic of China (ROC) enjoy freedom and democracy,"
Lee added.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that this disparity is an aberration in China's long
history, the president said that the ROC is trying its best to see an
end to this tragedy as it firmly believes that after a quarter
century of economic reforms, Communist China must move on to
political reforms by embracing the road to democratization.</P>
      <P>"We know very well that this will take time. Our hopes grow
stronger as many people on mainland China are pushing their Communist
government to change from a one-party rule to multiparty democracy,"
President Lee said.</P>
      <P>Saying the ROC and the Holy See share the same values on the
protection of human rights and human dignity, Lee urged the Pope to
join hands in "promoting freedom and democracy for the enslaved
people elsewhere in the world and particularly on mainland China."</P>
      <P>Citing the Pope's remark that "the Chinese people are speaking to
one another," which he made when addressing the Diplomatic Corps
accredited to the Holy See on Jan. 10, the president said that he
truly wishes cross-strait dialogue will resume soon and the mainland
will take steps toward democratization so that China can be reunified
under a democratic system some day.</P>
      <P>"All human beings on earth are brothers and sisters", Lee quoted
Confucius as saying, and he urged all freedom-loving people to unite
to make enslaved people free from oppression.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RANKS THIRD IN INTERNATIONAL RICE GENOME SEQUENCE RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been one of the most active
members in an international rice genome sequence project to decode
the plant's genetic secrets, Academia Sinica sources said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Scientists at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research institute,
have recently completed part of the International Rice Genome
Sequence Project and announced their research results at a symposium
in Japan.</P>
      <P>The announcement made Taiwan the third leading country in the
world in rice genome sequence research and the third research group
to have the patent for its rice genome research formally registered.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the international project, Taiwan is
authorized to carry out research and decoding of the fifth out of the
11 genome sets of rice. The fifth set has 35 mega bases of
chromosomes with associated genes.</P>
      <P>In order to take part in the cross-border project, each
participating country is committed to completely decode at least one
mega base of chromosomes in a year and to publicly announce the
research results, said Hsiao Chieh-fu, director of Academia Sinica's
Institute of Botany.</P>
      <P>The International Rice Genome Sequence Project, which is headed
by scientists from the United States and Japan, is a plant
infrastructure aimed at improving rice production and diminishing
genetic defects and blight.</P>
      <P>Currently, 11 countries -- the United States, Japan, South Korea,
Britain, Canada, India, Thailand, France, Singapore, Taiwan and
mainland China -- are taking part in the project.</P>
      <P>Once the project is completed, hopefully by 2007, scientists
around the world will have a better understanding of the genes of
rice and consequently be able to find the genes' functions and then
scientifically control them. The technology will not only help solve
rice blight such as the most prevalent Bacteria Blight, but will also
help improve rice production genetically, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Bacteria Blight is the most common disease of rice in Taiwan and
so far there is no cure for it, according to Hsiao.</P>
      <P>Once scientists decode all the rice's genes, the technology --
Genome-based biotechnology -- can be applied to research of other
plants, particularly grains of all kinds, so as to help global
production of grains and improve standards of living around the
world, he said.</P>
      <P>Planning for Taiwan's rice genome sequence research began in 1998
and research work formally kicked off in February 1999 at the
Institute of Botany, with financial support from the Cabinet-level
National Science Council and the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that the project not only requires research personnel
with expertise, but is also very expensive -- it cost US$1 million
for the institute to complete the research of only one mega base pair
of rice genes.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-produced wendan and bai pomelo
varieties can now be exported to Japan as the Japanese government has
formally approved Taiwan's quarantine inspection on the fruit,
officials from the Council of Agriculture (COA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two varieties of the grapefruit-like fruit join a list of

      <P>As Taiwan remains an oriental fruit fly-affected area, few fruits
produced in the country can enter the Japanese market, but COA
officials said that following the implementation of improved
quarantine and sterilization technology and facilities in Taiwan,
bananas, mangoes, lychees, tangerines, grapes and now bai and wentan
pomeloes can now be shipped to Japan.</P>
      <P>Japanese agriculture officials were in Taiwan between Dec. 30 and
Feb. 1 to inspect Taiwan's quarantine system and sterilization work,
during which period they also approved the export of 87 metric tons
of tangerines and 230.4 metric tons of grapes from Taiwan to Japan,
marking an increase of 200 percent over 1999 export figures,

    <HEADLINE>TAIEX MULLS PROLONGING TAIWAN STOCK MARKET TRADING HOURS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TAIEX) is mulling
the feasibility of extending the daily trading sessions of the Taiwan
stock market, TAIEX officials said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The TAIEX decided to conduct the study in reaction to Finance
Minister Paul Chiu's announcement on Tuesday that his ministry will
push for the implementation of three major plans concerning the local
stock market after the Chinese New Year holiday that ended on Monday.</P>
      <P>The three plans are: the listing of second-tier stocks on the
over-the-counter (OTC) market; the practicing of post-session
fixed-price trading; and the extension of trading hours.</P>
      <P>The officials said the TAIEX will complete its own evaluation of
the feasibility of the extension measures within two months, and will
then hear opinions from scholars, experts and related government
units before submitting a study report to the Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC) under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to be used by
the MOF as a policy-making reference.</P>
      <P>TAIEX officials disclosed that the SFC has completed the
preparations for post-session trading, and it is expected that the
TAIEX will usher in the post-session fixed-price trading in March
this year.</P>
      <P>At present, the local bourse is open from 9 a.m.-12 noon five
days a week on the second and fourth week of each month, and six days
a week on the other two weeks of the month.</P>
      <P>With a weekly trading time of either 15 hours or 18 hours (much
less than the 20-30 hours of the world's major stock markets), the
government is hoping its plans will extend the local bourse's daily
trading hours in a bid to eventually adopt an overall five-day
system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALBRIGHT: US WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT TRA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said on Tuesday that the United States will continue to implement
faithfully its obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>She also said she is concerned that if the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act (TSEA) is enacted, it could undermine, not enhance
Taiwan's security by disrupting the careful cross-Taiwan Strait
balance struck by the TRA.</P>
      <P>Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
foreign affairs budget, Albright noted that the United States has to
maintain its efforts to engage mainland China, an emerging great
power in Asia, and that engagement is neither a slogan nor a
strategy. "It's a hard-headed means of advancing our national
interest in the region. But we can hardly ignore China, and it's
folly to think we can isolate it. I think we have to be very
careful," she said.</P>
      <P>Of the TSEA which passed the House last week, she said: "I am
concerned that if it is enacted, it could yield results not intended
by its authors, and that is undermining, not enhancing, Taiwan's
security by upending the careful balance struck two decades in the
TRA."</P>
      <P>Albright added that Washington will be consulting closely this
year with Beijing on global and regional security issues, including
proliferation. But "we support the protection of Tibet's heritage and
will continue to urge Beijing to open a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.
In Geneva we will seek international support for a resolution calling
upon China to increase respect for human rights," she said.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to implement faithfully our obligations under
the TRA. And we will be asking Congress to support the
administration's agreement to bring China into the World Trade
Organization. If we do not, we will risk losing market access
benefits and the right to enforce them through the WTO. We would also
lose the opportunity to help move China further in the direction of
openness and the rule of law," said Albright.</P>
      <P>She also said: "We have to encourage China to cooperate with us
in seeking regional stability in South Asia. I, quite frankly, don't
know how we reach a reasonable resolution for the world ... between
India and Pakistan, without China playing a constructive role ... Nor
do I think that we're likely to peacefully resolve ... what's going
on in North Korea without China's constructive participation."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has emerged as the world's
largest share-owning country, overtaking the United States and
Britain, with new research showing that more than half the adult
population has invested in the stock market.</P>
      <P>The research, conducted by the Australian Stock Exchange, shows
that 7.2 million adults aged between 25 and 44 now own shares
directly or through a share investment fund, representing 53.7
percent of the adult population.</P>
      <P>The exchange attributed the increase in the share-owning
population to a surge of 13 percent of the adult population who took
to the stock market for the first time between October 1998 and
November 1999 because they bought shares of the government-owned
telecommunications giant, Telstra Corporation.</P>
      <P>The research shows that more than 40 percent of adults own shares
directly, making them a more popular option than investment
properties, which are owned by 27 percent of the population.</P>
      <P>Share-owning in Australia now ranks third in popularity of

(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the Clinton administration is
trying very hard to persuade the US Congress to support its agreement
with Beijing on World Trade Organization (WTO) accession, a leading
trade union on Tuesday advertised its strong opposition.</P>
      <P>In a half-page advertisement carried by both The Washington Post
and The Washington Times, the Union of American Workers (UAW) also
urged the American people to tell their representatives and senators:
"Vote `No' on permanent `normal trade relations.' Don't give China a
blank check."</P>
      <P>The UAW pointed out that in mainland China, citizens are sent to
prison for speaking freely, for advocating independent unions, for
worshipping the faith of their choice. Whatever their "crimes,"
mainland Chinese prisoners are forced to work -- without pay --
making shoes, machine tools, diesel engines and other products. "Such
products, although officially `banned' for export, frequently wind up
on US shores."</P>
      <P>With a big picture showing two mainland Chinese armed policemen
arresting a man and holding him in a chokehold, the advertisement
said: "The picture is about to get worse. China wants to join the
WTO, the secretive corporate-dominated global trading body which
refuses to consider basic labor or environmental standards."</P>
      <P>"To facilitate China's entry into the WTO, Congress has been
asked to grant China permanent `normal trade relations' status. That
means the United States will lose its ability to review China's trade
status each year, and to withdraw NTR status if China continues to
oppress basic human rights and threatens US workers and companies
with unfair competition," said the advertisement.</P>
      <P>"It's a bad deal all the way around -- for Chinese citizens, who
get no human rights guarantees, and for US workers, forced to compete
with repressed labor. The sad truth is that China's rulers are not
running a `normal' country. So why treat them as `normal' trading
partners?"</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The owners of a Taiwan squid trawler
which was fired on and seized by the Argentine Navy last Friday will
fight for justice for the vessel and its crew, fishery industry
sources said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sources claimed that the incident was caused by
misunderstandings and the language barrier.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung-based Hou Chun 101 was fired upon and seized by the
Argentine Navy after it was accused of illegally fishing in
Argentinean economic zone and attempting to flee upon being
discovered.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Shu-ping, secretary-general of the Taiwan
Ocean-Going Squid Association, Hou Chun 101 was operating near
Argentina's waters last Friday when it received warning shots from a
naval vessel.</P>
      <P>The trawler manned by four officers from Taiwan and 24 mainland
Chinese crew, which was just preparing to anchor in an area nearing
Argentina's 200-mile economic zone, in a gray area of demarcation,
left the area immediately after being warned, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The Hou Chun 101 tried to talk with the naval boat but failed to
communicate because of the language barrier. The trawler was then
fired on after a 12-hour chase.</P>
      <P>The trawler suffered damage to its engine and communications
system, but no one aboard was injured, Chang said, quoting
information received in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the trawler has a global positioning system
and all the data until Feb. 4 showed that it had not intruded into
Argentina's economic zone. It fled after being warned because it
believed that it had accidentally entered a "gray area," he said.</P>
      <P>Chang said the trawler will fight for its rights and justice
using the maritime data it has recorded as evidence.</P>
      <P>Sources from Buenos Aires said the navy had towed the trawler to
Silver Sea Port, the largest seaport in southern Argentina, early on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Hou Chun 101's owners in Kaohsiung have contacted Taiwan's
representative office in Argentina for help and are hiring legal

      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (TAIEX) registered
a sound performance on Wednesday, the first trading session after the
Chinese New Year holiday, with the market's weighted price index
breaking through the 10,000-point level at the close.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange weighted price index advanced
152.49 points to reach 10,008.88, the highest level since Aug. 27,
1997, on a turnover of NT$231.15 billion (US$7.52 billion).</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S RUKAI ABORIGINES TO PERFORM AT OLYMPIC GALA IN SYDNEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Performers from Taiwan's Rukai aboriginal
tribe will put on an opera during Olympic gala activities in Sydney
in August to tell a legend shared by the mountain aborigines from
generation to generation.</P>
      <P>The opera, the first of its kind ever written and performed by
Taiwan aborigines, tells the story of the romance between a princess
of the Balen clan and a "snake king" in the shape of a handsome young
man, according to Ke Li-mei, director of the Yuan Yuan Taiwan
Aborigine Cultural and Arts Company, the chief organizer of the
opera.</P>
      <P>After working for four years on the adaptation of the Rukai
legend, Ke, several Rukai composers and a drama professor from
National Taiwan College of the Arts, decided to invite a Rukai tribal
elder from deep in the mountains of southern Taiwan to personally
tell the story that has been orally passed down through the
generations, to lend proof of the opera's authenticity.</P>
      <P>Lahrei, an 88-year-old Rukai tribeswoman, arrived in Taipei on
Wednesday after a three-day laborious journey from her home on the
banks of Ghost Lake located in a remote mountain area bordering
Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties.</P>
      <P>The opera will feature soprano and tenor parts, dances, and a
chorus of Rukai men and women, making it a magnificent and beautiful
performance, said Ke.</P>
      <P>The Rukai opera will be staged during the gala activities to mark
the opening of the Games while the Olympic torch is being relayed. It
will also be staged at the prestigious Sydney Opera House in the days
after the opening of the Games, according to Ke.</P>
      <P>The Rukai performers will give two preview performances to Taiwan
audiences on Feb. 12 and 13 in Taipei County and Taipei City,
respectively, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANILA REGRETS ROC PRESIDENT'S REMARK ON FILIPINO WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Manila on Wednesday expressed regret at
remarks made by Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Philippine laborers working abroad.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable that the Philippines is drawn into what is
obviously a matter of Taiwan internal politics," said Philippine
Presidential Spokesman Jerry Barican in a statement.</P>
      <P>Lee, who doubles as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, said on
Tuesday at a lunar new year gathering at the campaign headquarters of
KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan that Taiwan voters should "see
clearly among the presidential hopefuls and choose the best one,
otherwise the consequences will be terrible."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is to hold its second direct presidential election on
March 18.</P>
      <P>Citing the Philippines as an example, Lee said that because of
the wrong choice of their parents, many Filipinos now have to leave
their hometowns to work in Taiwan and other foreign countries.</P>
      <P>"The Philippines' economy has become what it is today because
they elected the wrong man as president ... and as a result, it's
foreign debt has skyrocketed from US$2 billion to US$50 billion," Lee
said, without referring by name to late Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos.</P>
      <P>Barican said that he cannot agree with Lee's view that Filipinos
have to migrate abroad as foreign laborers just because their parents
did not choose the right president.</P>
      <P>He said that Filipinos seeking employment abroad is not a "recent
phenomenon," as many Filipinos have worked in foreign countries since
the 1960's, when the Philippines was one of the leading Asian
economies.</P>
      <P>"This (migration) was in response to the demand for highly
skilled labor which the Filipinos could amply supply," the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Currently, about 100,000 Filipinos are employed in Taiwan, mostly
as factory workers and domestic helpers.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A move to enlist help from the private
sector to ease the government's burden of running elementary and high
schools is afoot in Taiwan County.</P>
      <P>A measure is being mulled by the Taipei County Government that
will break the government's monopoly on basic education by allowing
private educators to run public-owned schools with public or private
funds.</P>
      <P>This will enable local governments to harness the private
sector's skills and financial resources to relieve some of its burden
in providing compulsory schooling to children, said officials at the
Education Bureau of the Taipei County Government, which put forward
the idea.</P>
      <P>It will also inject new energy into the strictly regulated system
by enriching the school's curriculums. Moreover, experimental
schools, which have not been accredited because their pioneer
programs have not received approval, will be able to be brought into
the system, said educational officials.</P>
      <P>Private educators will be able to set up foundations to open
pilot programs at existing public schools. These concession schools
will be able to either charge students tuition and fees at the same
level as at public schools or raise funds from outsiders. They will
also be able to bid to run schools financed by the government.</P>
      <P>Potential school operators may also rent school buildings and
educational facilities from the government and run them at their own
risk. They will be allowed to charge fees as they wish and take the
profits or bear the losses.</P>
      <P>Another form of cooperation will allow private operators to build
schools on government-owned land and turn them over to the government
after a certain period of operation.</P>
      <P>All public-owned private-run schools will be partially exempted
from regulations concerning teacher qualifications, curriculums,
school districts, and the measurement of students' academic
achievement, said the officials.</P>
      <P>Baring unexpected problems, the new measures will take effect
this July after being approved by the county council.</P>

      <P>The reported passage in the coming days of
a mainland Chinese warship through the Taiwan Strait is an attempt at
psychologically intimidating Taiwan, said an official in charge of
mainland affairs on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, the highest government agency charting Taiwan's

scheduled for March 18.</P>
      <P>The foreign media has reported that a new Russian-built
Sovremenney-class destroyer is slated to sail through the Taiwan
Strait in the early morning hours on Saturday on its way from
Saint-Petersburg, where it departed on Dec. 25, to a mainland Chinese
naval base in the southeastern province of Zejian.</P>
      <P>The destroyer will perform tests during its passage through the
strait in an attempt to increase psychological pressure on Taiwan,

      <P>Stressing that they have been closely monitoring all mainland
Chinese military movements, ROC military authorities predicted that
the Sovremenney-class destroyer will sail through the west side of
the strait as other PRC naval ships have in the past, using the cover

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAUNCHES NEW CAMPAIGN TV AD FOCUSED ON YOUNG PEOPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The presidential campaign center of the
Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Shui-bian launched a new TV
commercial on Thursday featuring young people in a bid to drum up
support among young voters.</P>
      <P>The TV commercial, whose theme is "the world trend is for young
leaders", gives many examples of young globally renowned figures to
illustrate that young people with great aspirations, such as Chen,
are the most qualified for leading a country into a new era.</P>
      <P>Bill Gates, who started up Microsoft at the age of 20, Jerry
Yang, who created Yahoo at 26, and Albert Einstein, who put forward
the theory of relativity at 36, are three prominent figures from the
field of science and technology given as examples to support Chen's
platform of allowing young people to lead Taiwan.</P>
      <P>J. F. Kennedy, who was elected as president of the United States
at the age of 43, Tony Blair, who became British prime minister at
43, Bill Clinton, who began his term as US president at 46, and the
father of the Republic of China Sun Yat-sen, who became the country's
temporary president at the age of 46, were given as examples of
youthful political figures.</P>
      <P>At a press conference launching the new TV ad, Chen, while
aggressively promoting his candidacy, said he will propose lowering
the voting age from 20 to 18 in the hopes of encouraging more young
people to engage in public affairs. He also encouraged the youth of
Taiwan to take part in non-government organizations and non-profit
organizations to foster a stronger sense of social responsibility.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that he will establish a foundation dedicated to
generating opportunities for the young people of Taiwan to
participate in international affairs and in humanitarian relief
efforts.</P>
      <P>After presenting the new campaign ad, Chen visited the famous old
Taoist Tzu-Shi Temple in Sanhsia where he reiterated his promise of
giving NT$3,000 to people over 65 years of age every month.</P>
      <P>He stressed that he would take care of older citizens who have
devoted their entire lives to the society by beginning the monthly
payments on July 1 if elected.</P>
      <P>While reiterating his promise, Chen did not forget to point out
that Lien Chan, the Kuomintang's presidential candidate, has failed
to honor his promise of implementing a living subsidy for older
citizens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHARE PRICES UP 0.5 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices moved up 0.5 percent on
Thursday in the third trading session after the Chinese Lunar New
Year, with speculative buying in low-price stocks in traditional
manufacturing sectors.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index advanced
48.79 points to finish at 10,057.67, on a turnover of NT$214.70
billion (US$7.01 billion), with 5.26 billion shares changing hands.</P>
      <P>The rising trend shifted to traditional manufacturing sectors
from electronics shares and technology issues after the index
breached the 10,000-point level on Feb. 9, suggesting to dealers that
the overall economic climate is expected to further improve.</P>
      <P>Government support and low interest rates are the two major
factors supporting the index, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The government has encouraged the issuance of stock options in
conventional sectors, and has allowed excessive liquidity in the
market before the upcoming presidential elections, as traditional
manufacturers are usually seen as supportive to the ruling
Kuomintang, dealers added.</P>
      <P>The stock market's ups and downs have been seen as an indicator
of public satisfaction with the government and there are no signs
that the local bourse will cool down in the near term, because the
government will take care of the stock market to avoid any negative
news affecting the popularity of Lien Chan, the KMT's presidential
candidate, dealers claimed.</P>
      <P>Most of the eight major stock categories posted gains, with
foodstuff issues taking the lead, ending the day with a 4.7-percent
gain, followed by construction issues, at 4.2 percent and cement
shares, at 2.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Electronics shares and plastics and chemical stocks suffered
minor losses of 0.1 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Advancers led decliners 402 to 166, with 32 issues remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) experienced poorer performance than the stock market closing
with mixed results. September and December futures recorded no
transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for February shed four points to finish at
10,145, with 1,336 contract transactions. Those for March rose 27
points to close at 10,200, with 339 contract transactions, while
those for June declined 20 points to finish at 10,310, with seven
contract transactions.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Thursday were 10,149
points for February, 10,173 points for March, 10,330 points for June,
10,213 points for September, and 10,510 points for December.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, reported falls and gains, respectively.</P>
      <P>February TE futures shed 3.15 points to close at 509.8, with 547
contract transactions, March TE futures moved down 4.2 point to close
at 517.8, with 114 contract transactions, and June TE futures moved
down 5.95 points to close at 525, with one contract transaction.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for September or
December.</P>
      <P>February TF futures climbed three points to close at 1,256, with
430 contract transactions, and March TF futures moved up 10 points to
close at 1,290, with 83 contract transactions, June TF futures
advanced 89 points to close at 1,373, with one contract transaction.
No transactions were recorded for TF futures for other months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER CALLS FOR END TO KMT RULE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislator published a new book on Thursday in which he accused
the ruling Kuomintang of having nurtured "black gold" politics in
Taiwan during its 50 years in power.</P>
      <P>Noting that "black gold" politics refers to the connection
between organized crime and the government, Legislator Chang
Ching-fang said he published the book to shed light on the KMT's
"true nature" and to push readers to vote down the KMT in the March
18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chang claims in his book, titled "Disband the KMT -- Terminate
the Nightmare of the Taiwan People," that the KMT has "fed" lawmakers
with links to underworld criminal rings as well as cultivated
compliant technocrats who always place the top priority on KMT
interests instead of national interests.</P>
      <P>Chang said he hopes his book will help the general public
understand the KMT's "black gold" nature so that they can make a
prudent choice in the election.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hope that the voters will use their ballots to drive
the KMT out of power in the upcoming critical election," Chang told a
news conference.</P>
      <P>In response to Chang's accusations, Chu Li-lun, a spokesman for
the KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan's campaign headquarters,
said the KMT's contributions to Taiwan's development over the past
five decades are undeniable.</P>
      <P>"Under the KMT leadership, Taiwan has emerged as an economic
powerhouse in East Asia and has also accomplished democratic reforms
known as the `quiet revolution,'" Chu stressed, adding that he
believes local voters are wise enough to understand that the DPP
lawmaker's accusations are false and totally unfounded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BANK WORKER DENIES HELPING PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL LAUNDER MONEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An employee of the Taiwan Bank denied on
Thursday that he helped independent presidential candidate James
Soong to launder money.</P>
      <P>Lin Hisao-ping, who was the personal secretary of Taiwan Bank
General Manager Ho Kuo-hua, said he did not know the former Taiwan
Provincial Governor personally, and would not help him launder money
in such a clumsy way.</P>
      <P>He admitted, however, that Soong's secretary, Yang Tai-yun,
asked him to transfer NT$30 million (US$928,000) for Soong to the
United States on Dec. 18 1998, two days before Soong's term as
governor expired.</P>
      <P>Lin was blamed by the Control Yuan for using front-men to send
the money to the United State for Soong.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan found in its investigation of Soong's secret
bank accounts that all 20 of these front-men were Taiwan Bank
employees. Lin used their names, without their knowledge, to buy US
dollars from the bank at the preferential employee rate, said the
Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The money was scattered among the 20 front-men and sent overseas
in 23 batches, all of which, apart from two, were below NT$1.5
million (US$46,875), the threshold beyond which the transaction must
be registered with the authorities as a precautionary measure against
illegal money laundering.</P>
      <P>Lin was also blamed for failing to report the two batches of
remittance which exceeded NT$1.5 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a senior Taiwan Bank official said the bank was
unaware of Lin's involvement in the case and had not yet received the
Control Yuan's report.</P>
      <P>Usually, government employees taken to task by the Control Yuan
are allowed to defend themselves in writing reply before being
referred to an internal panel for assessment of possible punishment.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan was expected to announce later in the day the
results of another investigation into allegations that Soong siphoned
off money from ruling Kuomintang while serving as KMT
secretary-general from 1987-1989.</P>
      <P>The money, totaling as much as NT$200 million, was allegedly kept
in secret bank accounts opened in the names of Soong's son and
sister-in-law. The accounts came to light on Dec. 9 after an
accusation was made by a KMT legislator.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's presidential
campaign chief Jason Hu said on Thursday that the party's
presidential candidate, Lien Chan, will announce his policy on
cross-Taiwan Strait relations this month.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a radio interview, the former foreign minister said
that Lien's cross-strait policy has been under discussion by a think
tank for about one year, and added that he expects the policy will be
able to break the present deadlock on the development of cross-strait
relations and will bring a feeling of relief to the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>On the proposed entrustment of KMT assets, Hu noted that the plan
has proceeded smoothly, but pointed out that at the present stage,
the party plans to entrust only its profit-making enterprises.</P>
      <P>As the March 18 election day approaches, Hu urged all the
presidential candidates to solicit support through their election
platforms, rather than engaging in verbal attacks.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the various policies presented by Lien have been
discussed at great length by a great number of scholars, specialists

are therefore practical and acceptable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TRAILING IN BID TO BECOME REGIONAL TRANSPORT HUB: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not be able to build itself
into a regional aviation hub if it cannot grab the opportunities
presented, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although the government has stated its policy to develop Taiwan
into an air transport center in the Asia-Pacific region, the report
made by the MOTC's Institute of Transportation shows that the island
will not achieve this goal if it fails to step up its efforts in the
face of fierce competition from neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>According to the report -- which assesses the competitive edges
of ten major airports in nearby countries and areas such as Japan,
South Korea, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Singapore -- Chiang
Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport in northern Taoyuan County,
Taiwan's largest airport, currently ranks fourth and seventh,
respectively, in the areas of "passenger transshipment ability" and
"cargo transshipment ability."</P>
      <P>Should CKS fail to have accomplished all its expansion projects
within three years, Taiwan's positions in these two areas will drop
to ninth and eighth spots, respectively, by 2005 when expansion
projects or construction of new airports are completed in neighboring
countries, the report indicates.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan will be put at a disadvantage in
competing with other countries to transform itself into a regional
aviation center, despite its excellent geographic location, if the
ban on direct transport across the Taiwan Strait is not lifted, it
says.</P>
      <P>The report further points out that Taiwan will be negatively
affected should CKS be denied the use of the mainland as its
hinterland, given the fact that Japan and South Korea have become
mainland China's major outlets for its northeastern and northern
areas, while Hong Kong has also been transformed into a springboard
for the mainland's southern and southwestern regions.</P>
      <P>Citing an evaluation carried out by an international
transportation association, the report says mainland China will
become the largest air traffic market in the Asia-Pacific region, and
adds that Taiwan will fail in its efforts to build CKS into a
regional transport hub if cross-strait political barriers cannot be
removed.</P>
      <P>Against such a backdrop, the chances of Taiwan accomplishing the
goal lies principally in the "timing," which means that Taiwan must
move more quickly than other countries and complete the airport
expansion projects at CKS in 3-5 years.</P>
      <P>The report also advises the government to conduct detailed
studies of the mainland Chinese market in case direct transport links
between the two sides are opened.</P>
      <P>In line with Taiwan's booming foreign trade sector, the
government should first build CKS into a cargo transport center and
improve its operational efficiency, the report also suggests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO BACK ROC'S BID TO JOIN WORLD BODIES, SECURITY DIALOGUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By J.J. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to the
United States Stephen Chen said on Thursday that the ROC hopes the US
government will help Taiwan take part in regional security dialogues
and major international organizations.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the United States can actively assist in our bid to
join the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World
Health Organization, just as it has done in supporting Taiwan's entry
to the World Trade Organization," Chen said in a speech delivered at
Grinnell University in Iowa during a seminar on cross-strait
relations, and democratic and social changes, in the run-up to
Taiwan's presidential election.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC ambassador to the United States said he believes
that the ROC's accession to these organizations would also be in the
best interests of the United States itself.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he is convinced that ROC-US relations will
become even closer in the 21st century based on their current
foundation, so long as the 20-year-old Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) can
continue to be implemented appropriately.</P>
      <P>Over the past two decades, Chen said, the TRA -- the US law that
regulates exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of official ties --
has contributed much to the stability, prosperity and freedom of
Taiwan and even large parts of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He said that although the ROC and the United States do not
maintain formal diplomatic relations, the two countries share common
interests, values and goals under the framework of the TRA.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC will hold its second direct presidential
election next month, Chen said he believes common experience in
democratic elections will help further cement ROC-US relations.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the election result, Chen said, Taiwan's March 18
election will mark yet another major democratic achievement in the
Asia-Pacific.</P>
      <P>In addition to sharing the ideals and values of upholding
freedom, democracy, human rights, free trade and rule of law, Chen
said, Taiwan and the United States share many common economic
interests.</P>
      <P>At present, Chen said, Taiwan is America's second-largest export
market in Asia, and its seventh-largest trade partner in the world.
Taiwan purchased more than US$18 billion-worth of US products in
1998, and annual bilateral trade far exceeds US$51 billion.</P>
      <P>Turning to security issues, Chen said the ROC holds great
confidence in the US security commitment to the country. In July
1982, the US government offered "six guarantees" to Taiwan, including
no deadline for US sales of defensive weapons to Taiwan, no prior
consultation with Beijing concerning arms sales to Taiwan, no
involvement in Taiwan-mainland China negotiations, no revision to the
TRA, and no pressure on Taiwan to negotiate with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that continued US supply of defensive arms to
Taiwan is extremely important because Beijing still refuses to
renounce the threat of force against Taiwan, and has stepped up its
military buildup.</P>
      <P>As democratic Taiwan occupies a strategic position in the western
Pacific, Chen said, any threat to Taiwan's security will seriously
affect Asia-Pacific peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that the US government has consistently expressed grave
concern about Beijing's mounting military threat to Taiwan, Chen said
the ROC wants to maintain diverse, pragmatic cooperative ties with
the United States in order to cope with any security threat in the
future.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ROC has no intention of interfering with
Washington-Beijing exchanges, but noted: "We hope the United States
will maintain balanced engagements with both Taipei and Beijing and
will reject Beijing's attempt to influence US policy toward Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen also explained that ROC President Lee Teng-hui's definition
of relations across the Taiwan Strait as a "special state-to-state
relationship" was mainly aimed at stressing Taiwan's need for parity
and equality between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>"Any cross-strait engagement or negotiation must be conducted on
the basis of parity and equality. Otherwise, the results will not win
wide support from the Taiwan people," Chen said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian geography
textbook has profiled Buddhist Master Cheng Yen, head of Taiwan's
largest charity -- the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation.</P>
      <P>The new textbook, published by Oxford University Canada Printing
Co., will be used by ninth- to 12th-grade students in the
southeastern Canadian province of Nova Scotia starting this year.</P>
      <P>The textbook, titled "Global Connections -- Geography for the
21st Century," contains a description of Master Cheng Yen's charity
and humanitarian relief work around the world in a chapter titled
"Religious Leaders Making a Difference."</P>
      <P>The textbook chronicles how Cheng Yen became a nun while in her
mid-20s, and how in 1966 she founded the Tzu-Chi (Compassionate
Giving) Foundation with five disciples and thirty followers. It goes
on to note that she has inspired countless people throughout the
world to help others in need.</P>
      <P>Since that time, the textbook goes on, the foundation has
developed into the largest and most trusted charity in Taiwan. "Its
members devote themselves to charity, health care, education, and
social and cultural programs for humankind."</P>
      <P>It further notes that Cheng Yen's devotion to her religion and to
the goals of the foundation has inspired a following of over 4
million people around the world.</P>
      <P>The foundation has raised a great deal of money to help people in
need, the textbook says. "In addition to providing clothing, food,
and shelter to poor and homeless people, the foundation sponsors
several major community projects."</P>
      <P>These include a nursing home for elderly people, the Tzu-Chi
Hospital dedicated to serving the poor people of Taiwan, the Buddhist
Tzu-Chi Free Clinic in the United States, the Tzu-Chi College of
Medicine, a Buddhist cultural center, and a nursing school for young
women from poor families, according to the textbook.</P>
      <P>The textbook quotes Claes Nobel, founder and chair of United
Earth, as having said: "Master Cheng Yen's healing love and guiding
light set the stage for a 'New World Culture' where people can live
in harmony with each other and in harmony with the Earth."</P>
      <P>The textbook also notes that whether or not this new world
culture comes to pass, Cheng Yen's efforts have certainly made the
world a better place for millions of people.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Tzu-Chi Foundation, headquartered in the
eastern Taiwan city of Hualien, said on Thursday that the article on
Cheng Yen in the Canadian textbook was written by John Trites, a
geography teacher responsible for compiling the "Religious Leaders"
chapter.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 2,000 Falun Gong practitioners
have been arrested in 40 mainland Chinese cities since the Chinese
New Year holiday season began last Saturday, according to a report
by a human rights group in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China said that during the holiday season at least 500 practitioners
of the outlawed spiritual sect were arrested in Beijing.</P>
      <P>It added that at lease 100 were arrested in each of the following
cities: Shijiazhuang, the capital city of northern Hebei province;
Changchun, capital of northeastern Jilin province; Chengdu, capital
of southwestern Sichuan province; Dalian, a harbor city of
northeastern Liaoning province; and Chongqing Municipality in
southwestern China.</P>
      <P>They were arrested when they practiced Falun Gong in groups or 
when they staged public protests against government persecution of
the sect. Two soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were arrested
on Feb. 7 when they practiced Falun Gong on Tiananmen Square in
Beijing, it added.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong, which was believed to have 100 million followers at
its height in China, was outlawed last November. Since then, some 300
practitioners have been sentenced to prison, 5,000 others have been
sent to labor camps for "re-education", and at least 10,000 have been
detained briefly by police, the information center said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S JANUARY EXPORTS SET NEW SINGLE MONTH RECORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's customs-clearance exports in
January totaled US$11.89 billion, up 21.4 percent over the
corresponding month a year ago, to set a new single month record
high, said the Finance Ministry on Friday.</P>
      <P>Imports for the same month increased 18 percent to US$10.96
billion, the second highest figure ever for a single month. This
resulted in a surplus of US$930 million, up 82.1 percent over that of
January of 1999.</P>
      <P>An official with the Finance Ministry attributed the sharp
increase in January exports mainly to the recovery of Asian economies
and to continued and steady growth in the United States and Europe.</P>
      <P>Because the demand for Taiwan's products was on the rise, the
official said, exports of electronics, heavy industrial and chemical
industrial products increased by as much as 27.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The increase in exports also triggered a rise in imports. For
instance, imports of capital equipment increased 39.1 percent, and
imports of agricultural and industrial products went up 15.4 percent.</P>
      <P>The island's January exports to Japan and Southeast Asian
countries registered a 43 percent increase, while those to South
Korea increasing 85.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Imports from the US, Japan and Southeast Asian countries
increased by more than 16 percent. But those from Hong Kong and
Europe decreased.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics has predicted that Taiwan's exports and imports will
increase 7.9 percent and 9.8 percent respectively this year</P>
      <P>In view of the better-than-expected performance over the past few
months, the Finance Ministry said that the figures will be revised

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE TRAWLER SINKS AFTER BEING FIRED UPON BY ARGENTINE NAVY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung-based squid trawler "Hou
Chun 101" sank offshore Argentina Thursday while being towed to a
southern Argentinean seaport in the wake of an accident during which
the boat was fired on by Argentine Navy gunboats, fishery industry
sources here said on Friday.</P>
      <P>None of the 28 people aboard, including four officers from Taiwan
and 24 mainland Chinese crew members, were injured, said Chang
Shu-ping, secretary-general of the Taiwan Ocean-Going Squid
Association, of which "Hou Chun 101" was a member.</P>
      <P>Chang said his office is actively arranging for the crew members
to return to Taiwan, adding that the captain, however, may have to
remain in Argentina to await possible trial and other judicial
procedures in the wake of the accident.</P>
      <P>"Hou Chun 101" was fired upon and seized by the Argentine Navy
last Friday after allegedly illegally fishing within the Argentinean
economic zone and attempting to flee upon being discovered.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, "Hou Chun 101" was operating near Argentina's
waters when naval vessels fired warning shots last Thursday.</P>
      <P>He added that the trawler was just preparing to anchor in a gray
area of demarcation near Argentina's 200-mile economic zone when it
heard the warning shots and immediately left the area after being
warned.</P>
      <P>The "Hou Chun 101" crew tried to communicate with the naval boats
but failed because of a language barrier. The trawler was then fired
upon after a 12-hour chase.</P>
      <P>The bow of vessel was damaged by the gunfire and sea water
started to flow in. The boat's cooler tanks also began leaking
ammonia and its engines and communications system broke down.
Fortunately, no one on board was hurt, said Chang.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the trawler had a global positioning system
and all the data it had received up to Feb. 4 showed that it had not
entered into Argentina's economic zone. He said the boat fled after
being warned because the crew believed they had accidentally entered
a "gray area."</P>
      <P>Chang said the captain told him that he will fight for his and
the boat's rights in Argentina's courts by using the maritime data
the boat recorded as evidence.</P>
      <P>Now that the trawler has sunk, and the evidence along with it,
Chang said the fate of the crew has become even more uncertain.</P>
      <P>Sources from Argentina said the Argentine Navy began to tow the
trawler to Silver Sea Port, the largest seaport in southern Argentina
on Wednesday, but the boat sank along the way due to the extra water
it had taken on.</P>
      <P>Chang said his association has contacted Taiwan's representative
office in Argentina for help and is hiring legal personnel and
translators for the case.</P>

      <P>The United States is calling on
Communist China to immediate release a prominent Muslim businesswoman
who has been jailed since last August, and Sen. William Roth (R-DE),
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Thursday he plans to
seek congressional support for a resolution calling for her release
and an investigation by the UN Human Rights Commission.</P>
      <P>Rebiya Kadeer, a 58-year-old department store owner and trading
company official in Xinjiang, western China, was detained Aug. 11
along with her secretary and two sons when they were to meet a
visiting US congressional delegation. Later Beijing accused her of
providing foreign organizations with "state secrets."</P>
      <P>US congressional leaders and human rights groups have condemned
the arrest, saying the case against Kadeer is weak and appears to be
aimed at her husband, who now lives in the United States and has been
an outspoken advocate of mainland China's Muslim Uighur minority.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman James Rubin said Thursday that there
is nothing to back up the allegations against Kadeer and she should
be released immediately.</P>
      <P>"We are deeply disturbed by her arrest and long detention without
formal charges, as well as the fact that she was arrested on the way
to a meeting with congressional staff," said Rubin.</P>
      <P>He added that the United States has repeatedly raised the issue
with Communist Chinese officials, and that the detention is a

planning to work with the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp. to set up
orchid farms in the United States in order to tap the North American

      <P>Ling said the COA and Taisugar had discussed the plan and both
sides reached initial consensus on selecting a location in Las Vegas
in order to lure tourists.</P>
      <P>Ling noted that several of Taiwan's orchids are highly
competitive, including its moth orchids, dancing lady orchids and
lady-slipper orchids, and that Las Vegas, as a worldwide tourist
location, will help promote Taiwan's orchids to the world.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's moth orchids have already been
successfully introduced into Japan and Hong Kong, but North America
remains an untapped market.</P>
      <P>Ling said that National Chunghsing University, at the commission
of the COA, has successfully developed an automated greenhouse
management and control system for the seedlings and pot plants of
moth orchids, dancing lady orchids and other orchids.</P>
      <P>He said the automated greenhouses can help increase the rate of

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The reported passage of two new mainland
Chinese destroyers through the Taiwan Strait during the early morning
hours of Saturday has nothing to do with Taiwan's presidential
election scheduled for March 18, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>However, MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin said the passage is seen
as an apparent attempt by the People's Liberation Army to flex its
muscles and psychologically intimidate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin pointed out, if Taiwan's presidential election
in March is conducted smoothly, it will demonstrate that the power of
the democratic process is far more invincible than mainland China's
military modernization.</P>
      <P>Two new Russia-built Sovremenny-class destroyers are scheduled to
sail through the Taiwan Strait Saturday on their way to a mainland
Chinese naval base in the southeastern province of Zhejiang. The
naval vessels began their voyage from Saint-Petersburg on Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of National Defense (MND), the mainland
Chinese destroyers, which will perform tests during their passage
through the strait, will be flanked by the PLA's Donghai Fleet and
accompanied by Air Force jet fighters for cover.</P>
      <P>While closely monitoring the situation, the MND said all three
branches of the ROC Armed Forces will be on stand by to deal with any
possible scenario.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin noted that Beijing is using the passage of the
naval vessels through the Taiwan strait as a way to put psychological
pressure on Taiwan while conveniently being able to officially deny
it afterwards.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Editor-in-Chief of Forbes magazine on
Thursday sternly condemned Beijing's oppression of Falun Gong and
also US politicians' fear of expressing their protests to Beijing
over the matter.</P>
      <P>The widespread rise of the Falun Gong in mainland China means the
regime in Beijing has lost its legitimacy in the hearts and minds of
the Chinese people, says Steve Forbes in the latest issue of the
magazine.</P>
      <P>The US publishing industry tycoon indicated that in addition to
the crackdown on Falun Gong, Beijing even lodges warnings to US state
and city government officials who demonstrate any support for Falun
Gong founder Li Hongzhi by threatening to cut bilateral trading
relations.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, some US officials, such as the mayor of Seattle and
the governor of the state of Maryland, have succumbed to the threats
and have openly expressed their apologies to Beijing, said Forbes.</P>
      <P>The city of Baltimore has withdrawn a certificate of merit to Li
Hongzhi, while the city of San Francisco has shelved its plan to
confer a certificate of merit on Li. Even the US State Department has
provided consulting services on how to word apologies to Beijing,
Forbes added.</P>
      <P>Forbes said at the close of the article that Beijing has on each
occasion boasted about its success in persuading US politicians to
give up their support for Falun Gong practitioners. This has led US
Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-NJ) to comment that the US policy of
appeasement is equivalent to agreeing with Beijing's oppression of
mainland Chinese dissidents.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong, a body-strengthening method which blends Buddhist and
Taoist principles, has been outlawed in mainland China, and Beijing
has also issued a circular for the arrest of Li.</P>

      <P>Chang said that if these employees, which include armed forces
personnel, public functionaries and teachers, do not get a pay raise,
it will be tantamount to a salary cut for them given that inflation

      <P>According to Wei Duan, director-general of the Directorate

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT UNVEILS MAJOR PLANS FOR HIGH-TECH DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Friday unveiled
major plans for high-tech industrial development as he geared up his
campaign for the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien made the announcement as he attended a New Year party for
the high-tech industry at the Nankang Software Park in suburban
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lien's plans include the construction of Kaohsiung and Taichung
Science-based Industrial Parks to complement Taiwan's two major
existing industrial parks in Hsinchu and Tainan.</P>
      <P>National Science Council (NSC) Chairman Huang Cheng-tai, who
accompanied Lien to the party, elaborated that the NSC is now
studying the feasibility of merging the Tainan and Kaohsiung parks
into a single giant industrial park, a job which is expected to take
four years to complete.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taichung industrial park it is still on the
drawing board, as the problem of supplying water to the park has yet
to be solved.</P>
      <P>Other major points in Lien's remarks on Friday include a planned
10-percent annual increase in government spending on research and
development (R&amp;D), while the ratio of R&amp;D spending will be increased
to 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) by 2010, up to the
level of the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>The government is also planning to ease the restrictions on
mainland China high-tech talent who come to work in Taiwan, so that
mainland researchers will account for 0.35 per cent of the total by
2010, Lien said.</P>
      <P>The government will also begin allowing university professors to
serve as advisors to the industry or even to open their own
companies, he went on.</P>
      <P>Other plans mentioned by Lien include turning Taiwan into an
Internet- and multi-media hub, as well as a stronghold of
Chinese-language Internet.</P>
      <P>In addition, international and long-distance telephone fees will
be reduced dramatically, while Internet access fees will be cut by
more than 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>The government will also push for the integration of "the three
C's" -- computer, communications and consumer electronics.</P>
      <P>It will also push for second-tier stocks so that the high-tech
industry can get necessary funding and Internet companies get listed
by June this year.</P>
      <P>Lien said that through these plans, he envisions Taiwan becoming
a "high-tech island."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHARE PRICES UP 0.7 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices moved up 0.7 percent on
Friday with some of the abundant liquidity shifting from the
low-price traditional manufacturing sector to the already high-price
electronics sector.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index advanced
71 points to finish at 10,128.67, on an expanded turnover of
NT$253.07 billion (US$8.26 billion), compared to the previous
session's NT$214.70 billion.</P>
      <P>The index breached the 10,000-point level on Feb. 9, the first
trading session after the Chinese Lunar New Year, and has not
experienced the downward correction predicted by many stock analysts,
which suggests that the index has a chance to challenge the historic
high level of 10,256 points.</P>
      <P>The reasons supporting the index's buoyancy above 10,000 points
include abundant capital, an upbeat sentiment as the March
presidential election approaches, strong foreign buying, and an
improving economic climate, dealers said, adding that the bullish
situation is expected to be maintained for the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors have been active in building up portfolios
recently, as Morgan Stanley Capital International is to increase its
weighting of Taiwan shares in May.</P>
      <P>Conventional sectors are buying targets, as stocks in these
sectors have been sluggish for a long time and are expected to turn
around this year due to strong economic fundamentals, the dealers
noted.</P>
      <P>Among the eight major stock categories only textile issues,
paper-making shares and financial stocks performed poorly.</P>
      <P>Advancers led decliners 364 to 198, with 44 issues remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) experienced poorer performance than the stock market,
closing with mixed results. September and December futures recorded
no transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for February advanced 22 points to finish at
10,167, with 1,463 contract transactions. Those for March rose 35
points to close at 10,249, with 798 contract transactions, while
those for June climbed 60 points to finish at 10,370, with eight
contract transactions.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Friday were 10,145 points
for February, 10,214 points for March, 10,310 points for June, 10,209
points for September, and 10,506 points for December.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, reported gains and mixed results,
respectively.</P>
      <P>February TE futures rose 1.4 points to close at 511.2, with 702
contract transactions, March TE futures moved up 0.2 points to close
at 518, with 246 contract transactions, and June TE futures moved up
one point to close at 526, with one contract transaction.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for September or
December.</P>
      <P>February TF futures shed 8.8 points to close at 1,247.2, with 338
contract transactions, March TF futures moved down 10 points to close
at 1,280, with 135 contract transactions, and June TF futures
remained unchanged at 1,373, with one contract transaction. No
transactions were recorded for TF futures for other months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPORTS IN FIRST QUARTER SHOW GREEN LIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seventy-seven percent of manufacturers in
Taiwan's export processing zones are optimistic regarding the export
climate in the next three months, according to the results of a
survey released on Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs revealed
that only 23 percent of the respondents were conservative with their
estimates of first-quarter exports for this year.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, most electronics, chemical products, and
general products industries expect promising exports, while the
mechanical equipment manufacturing industry and the foodstuff
manufacturing industry are expected to experience moderate progress.</P>
      <P>Most manufacturers of precision machinery, metal products and
garments foresee slow exports ahead, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the number of orders in the first quarter
has not increased much, strong demand from the international market,
demand for newly invented products, and the emergence of new markets
are the reasons given by the manufacturers for their optimism,
according to the Export Processing Zone Administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UP TO 25 PERCENT OF VOTERS SUPPORT SOONG AFTER REPORT: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Between 20 percent and 25 percent of voters
remain supportive of independent presidential candidate James Soong,
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party estimated on Friday, one
day after a report on Soong's financial dealings was released.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, manager of the DPP presidential campaign, made the
estimate after the Control Yuan, the nation's highest-level watchdog
body, released a report on Soong's financial dealings in Chung Hsing
Bills Finance Corp. on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that the support rates for the three major rivals in
the presidential election -- Chen Shui-bian of the DPP, Soong and
Vice President Lien Chan of the ruling Kuomintang -- are pretty close
in the runup to the March 18 presidential election, with the gap
among the three possibly as small as between 100,000 and 300,000
votes.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the presidential election, Chiou said that the ruling
KMT has produced fake polls in an attempt to boost Lien's support
rate before Feb. 18, knowing that the law has prohibited the
publication of polls in the last month of the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chiou also said that between 20 and 25 percent of voters will
still support Soong despite the report by the Control Yuan, citing
the last presidential election as an example that independent
presidential candidates Lin Yang-kang and Chen Li-an
garnered 25 percent of the votes to show that around 25 percent of
the voters will support either of the two major parties anyway.</P>
      <P>Lo Wen-chia, another DPP campaign official, said that the DPP
will begin at least three waves of a campaign blitz targeting Lien.</P>
      <P>Lo said Lien has many vulnerable points, such his unpopularity
among voters under the age of 40, and his failure to galvanize the
support of the military, civil servants and teachers, traditionally
the backbone of the ruling party's support in previous elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US COMMITTED TO ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will continue to
closely monitor the military balance in the Taiwan Strait and will
honor its promise to sell arms to Taiwan for the island's defensive
needs, State Department spokesman James Rubin said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Reporting at a regular State Department news briefing on the
increased military cooperation between mainland China and Russia,
Rubin said that the United States has made clear its concerns to
Beijing regarding mainland Chinese developments and their influence
on the situation across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Rubin, the United States will retain and continue to
have a strong interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in
the Taiwan Strait, and that is the reason why Washington has approved
defensive arms sales to Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act and with various communiques signed by Washington and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Regarding the recent sales of Russian military equipment to
mainland China, Rubin said that these issues have been reported for
several years and that "we are well aware of these developments."</P>
      <P>"We don't want to either minimize the potential threat nor
exaggerate that threat," he noted, adding that "we maintain an active
dialogue with Russia on the issue of arms sales, reflecting our
concern about proliferation. We closely monitor the development and
modernization of China's military and its potential impact on US
security."</P>
      <P>Turning to media reports that the mainland has acquired a new
Russian-built destroyer, the State Department spokesman claimed that
the acquisition of a particular ship by mainland China poses no
significant threat to the US military posture in Asia.</P>
      <P>"While clearly improving China's military naval capabilities, it
is fair to say the appearance of one additional modern warship will
not fundamentally alter the regional balance of power," he explained.</P>
      <P>International media have reported that one of the two
Russian-built Sovremenney-class destroyers purchased by mainland
China will sail through the Taiwan Strait in the early morning hours
on Saturday on its way from Saint Petersburg to a naval base in the
mainland's southeastern province of Zejian.</P>
      <P>Russia is slated to deliver another destroyer later this year.</P>
      <P>At a regular Defense Department briefing, Adm. Craig Quigley
pointed out that "this is something that we've been watching for ...
a number of years, while the ship was being built and the crew
trained ... Taken in isolation, this is a good ship. It's a modern
warship. But it does not significantly change he balance of power in
that part of the world ..."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FALUN GONG-PRACTICING JUDGE LOCKED UP IN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civil court judge at the Intermediate
People's Court of Beihai city in southern China has been locked up in
a psychiatric hospital in the city since last November because he
refuses to quit practicing Falun Gong, a human rights group said here
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said the judge, Huang Jinchun, took part
in a demonstration in Beijing last September in protest against
government crackdown on Falun Gong, which was outlawed last July. As
a result, he was sent to the psychiatric hospital by the public
security authorities of the city.</P>
      <P>The hospital is giving the 34-year-old judge a daily injection of
sedative medicine, because he insists on practicing Falun Gong in the
hospital, the information center said.</P>
      <P>Huang, who was allowed to go home on Feb. 4 for Chinese New Year
celebrations, informed the information center of his experience in
the hospital through a friend of his, in the hope that the world
community will pay attention to China's violation of human rights by
sending mentally normal people to psychiatric hospital as a means of
punishment for dissidents.</P>
      <P>The information center also said that Falun Gong practitioners
are being locked up in psychiatric hospitals in various parts of the
country. For example, 50 normal practitioners living in Huangshan
District in Beijing were sent to a near-by psychiatric hospital last
December.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate James
Soong on Friday welcomed the outcome of the Control Yuan
investigation into his financial dealings, saying that it proves he
never embezzled any public funds.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the country's highest-level watchdog body
should also investigate the other presidential hopefuls' financial
dealings, as it did his.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks to reporters at a rally at a recreation
park in Ilan County when asked what were his opinions about the
report released by the Control Yuan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Asked whether an investigation should be conducted on President
Lee Teng-hui's campaign expenditures during the last presidential
election, Soong responded that this should be decided by the general
public.</P>
      <P>Soong put heavy emphasis on what he called "the Ilan spirit"
during his electioneering activities, defining it as a non-partisan,
supra-ethnic, and sincerely dedicated spirit.</P>
      <P>The independent candidate also announced that Chang Chun-yi,
former chairman of the Mongolian &amp; Tibetan Affairs Commission, will
soon join his team, and said that "it is a good start."</P>
      <P>After a 50-day investigation into the Soong financial scandal,
the so-called Chung Hsing Bill Finance Case, a Control Yuan special
task force said on Thursday that he violated a law requiring him to
declare all of his family's assets when he was Taiwan governor.</P>
      <P>The assets Soong hid reportedly amounted to NT$356 million,
including donations for his 1994 gubernatorial race, real estate
jointly owned by his wife and only son, and money placed in accounts
of close aides and relatives.</P>
      <P>The Asset Disclosure Law requires ranking government officials to
report all personal wealth, including that of their family members,
to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Soong admitted that he has a responsibility to obey the law, but
he laid blame on the island's political contribution system, and
defended his actions by saying that never before have politicians
declared election contributions as their own personal income for tax
purposes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BE FULLY REMOVED FROM JAPAN'S GSP TREATMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA0 Taiwan is to be fully removed from Japan's
"generalized scheme of preferences" (GSP) list from April 1, the
Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The decision to cancel the preferential trade treatment was made
when Japan opted to remove the remaining 37 GSP-listed Taiwan-made
products, according to the BOFT.</P>
      <P>However, the board pointed out that the impact will be limited,
although it acknowledged that some industries, such as
food-processing, chemical materials, paper-making, textiles and metal
processing, will be affected in the short term.</P>
      <P>With the planned cancellation of the GSP treatment, the BOFT said
the entire Taiwan export sector will no longer enjoy trade privileges
in Japan, joining Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong among the 19
countries and areas which have been fully removed from the list.</P>
      <P>The last time Japan altered its GSP list -- in April 1999 -- a
total of 29 items of locally manufactured export goods were removed,
according to the BOFT.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has been transformed into a developed country, it is
natural that the country should not continue to enjoy the treatment
indefinitely, BOFT officials said, stressing at the same time that
Taiwan products will not be largely influenced by the change in
Japan.</P>
      <P>The semi-official China External Trade Development Council also
assessed that the move will have only a limited impact on Taiwan
industry, despite the fact that some industries will face tax rates
which are between 3 percent and 8 percent higher.</P>
      <P>This is because many local factories have relocated to mainland
China or Southeast Asian countries which are still GSP-listed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hardline People's Liberation Army former
generals have criticized mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin for
being "too soft" on Taiwan and the United States, the South China
Morning Post reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The criticism came when a group of retired generals met to
discuss the recent decision by the US House of Representatives to
support closer military ties between America and Taiwan, said the
report.</P>
      <P>However, Jiang is understood to be sticking to his policy of
offering an olive branch to the next Taiwan president, provided the
new leader is willing to shelve President Lee Teng-hui's "two states
theory."</P>
      <P>The report quoted a Beijing source as saying that two former
vice-chairmen of the Central Military Commission, Generals Liu
Hua-qing and Zhang Zhen led the former PLA hardliners.</P>
      <P>Despite being in retirement, the two still wield considerable
influence among officers, particularly nationalists.</P>
      <P>One general said the strong support the US congress had given
Taiwan was an indication that the "hegemonists" will never stop using
the "Taiwan card" against the mainland, and compared the island to a
"cancer" that has to be removed as early as possible.</P>
      <P>A source familiar with Beijing's policymaking on Taiwan said PLA
hardliners, including many serving officers, have privately blamed
Jiang for lacking the guts and resolve of Mao Zedong and Deng

      <P>However, at the end of last year, he did undergo surgery to
remove a cataract which threatened to lead to blindness and thereby
render him unable to screen articles for his publication.</P>
      <P>The surgery greatly sapped his strength and worsened his
condition. Liu was admitted to the Tri-service General Hospital early
this year and never left.</P>
      <P>Born Liu Tsung-hsiang in 1921 in northeast China, he spend his
childhood and teenage years drifting around mainland China as a
student while the country was engaged in persistent internal fighting
and the eight-year war against Japanese imperialists.</P>
      <P>He graduated from Beijing University in 1950 and worked briefly
as a correspondent for Xinhua news agency.</P>
      <P>However, he managed to escape to Hong Kong that same year and
wrote his first book, "The Traitor of Red China," which condemned the
recently-established dictatorship of the Chinese Communist regime.</P>
      <P>The book, considered a strongly anti-Communist publication, has
been translated into a dozen foreign languages.</P>
      <P>After moving to Taiwan, he worked for a short period as a
personal aide to his Beijing University mentor, Tsui Shu-ching, who
then chaired the now-defunct Kuomintang Design, Development and
Evaluation Commission.</P>
      <P>That job enabled Liu to come into contact with many governmental
and military officials who fled to Taiwan with the Kuomintang and who
had played significant roles in history, inspiring him to create a
magazine to record their stories, which would otherwise sink into
oblivion after their deaths.</P>
      <P>Biographical Literature published its first issue in June of
1962. It focused on the individual memoirs of modern historical
figures and on the events that occurred in China after 1911, and soon
become a popular journal among intellectuals, historians and literati
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Up to the present time, the magazine has published a total of 453
issues and more than 100 million Chinese characters, making it a
legend in the island's rapidly changing publications market.</P>
      <P>Stories in the magazine have often contradicted the government's
claims about historical events, and Liu was therefore referred to as
the president of the civil version of Academia Historica, which is in
charge of documenting "official" history.</P>
      <P>For the last four decades, Liu was the backbone of the magazine.
He even amassed enough materials for it to be published through
August of this year. He once said he would retire and pass his
journal on to others by 2000, but was forced by his enthusiastic
readers to withdraw the proposal.</P>
      <P>When Liu passed away, Wang Ai-sheng, his wife, was at his
bedside.</P>
      <P>A funeral service has been scheduled for Feb. 23 at Taipei City's
First Funeral Hall.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINES DEFENDS HANDLING OF SCARBOROUGH SHOAL DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila, Feb. 11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs on Friday
defended its decision to send Beijing photos of dynamite and coral
confiscated by the Navy from mainland Chinese fishermen, saying the
move was routine diplomatic conduct and not an act of slavery to a
bigger country.</P>
      <P>"The Department hopes the level of rhetoric on the Scarborough
Shoal area can be reduced and wishes to assure all concerned that
Philippine diplomacy will continue to energetically but quietly push
for the peaceful resolution of conflicting claims in that zone," a
DFA statement said.</P>
      <P>Bohol Congressman Ernesto Herrera had previously criticized the
DFA and Secretary Domingo Siazon Jr. for the department's "political
genuflection" in explaining to Beijing the Navy's action against the
Chinese fishers who were allegedly poaching in the Scarborough Shoal
area.</P>
      <P>"I don't see why we have to order our ambassador to Beijing to
deliver photographs of Chinese violations of the status quo in the
South China Sea, like some vassal making representations before a
feudal lord," Herrera said.</P>
      <P>The DFA noted that "foreign policy is never undertaken in a
vacuum, since the alternatives available to each country are shaped
by both external forces as well as the strengths and weaknesses of
individual nations. This is what real politic is all about."</P>
      <P>Herrera suggested that the proper response to mainland China's
demand for an explanation about the recent incident involving Chinese
fishermen would have been to summon Chinese ambassador Fu Ying.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, Fu has been in her home country on a 45-day leave,
and Siazon said that the photographs would be handed over to her by
Philippine Ambassador to Beijing Romualdo Ong.</P>
      <P>The DFA pointed out that "far from constituting an act of
vassal-bowing and bringing gifts to a feudal lord, the procedure of
instructing one's envoy to respond to a host country's request for a
meeting on a contentious issue and to present one's side forms part
of the normal and internationally-recognized conduct of diplomatic
relations."</P>
      <P>The submission of evidence, the DFA added, would buttress the
Philippine contention that the fishermen concerned had indeed
illegally taken coral protected by both Philippine law and
international conventions on the protection of the marine
environment.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Siazon had said the move would also justify the Navy's
patrolling of the sea.</P>
      <P>Herrera also blasted Siazon for saying that Chinese fishermen
found poaching in Philippine waters would no longer be arrested, in
order to avoid tension. "That is really stupid," Herrera said, adding
any foreigner encroaching on Philippine territory should be
apprehended and dealt with accordingly.</P>
      <P>But the secretary explained that Philippine fishermen had also
been apprehended in neighboring countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia
and Palau, and that DFA appeals for a more lenient policy toward the
Philippine nationals have been accommodated.</P>
      <P>Siazon said the Navy used to arrest illegal fishermen in
Philippine waters but the government has had to face the problem of
where to keep them and how to feed them.

    <HEADLINE>VIETNAMESE WORKERS EDGING OUT FILIPINOS IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  11  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vietnamese workers are now edging out
Filipinos in terms of employment in Taiwan -- one repercussion of the
souring of Philippine-Taiwan relations over the recent air-agreement
dispute, a Philippine statesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>The chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Francisco
Tatad, said the recent development showed "we need a good repair job"
on the country's relations with Taiwan, before more economic
repercussions are incurred.</P>
      <P>Quoting unspecified Taiwanese sources, Tatad said Vietnamese
workers are now preferred for employment over Filipinos by Taiwan
employers, despite the fact that they remain the more competitive
workers.</P>
      <P>"But because relations between the two neighbors had declined,
Vietnamese workers are coming in droves in place of usual Filipinos,"
Tatad said.</P>
      <P>The repercussion, he said, was not only felt in Taiwan but also
in the Philippines. Tatad noted that some Taiwanese firms, which had
earlier established roots at the former US naval base, are now
pulling out.</P>
      <P>And, he said, Taiwanese tourists have apparently stopped coming.</P>
      <P>The senator earlier disclosed that the 23-member Association of
Asia-Pacific Airlines, which has been based in the country since its
inception, is pulling out, in reaction to the Taiwan-Philippine air
dispute.</P>
      <P>The pull-out, he said, was the airline group's way of expressing
dissatisfaction over the country's aviation policy, which they noted
was apparently being disregarded to favor Philippine Airlines (PAL)
to the detriment of foreign airlines.</P>
      <P>Tatad said the Taiwan-Philippine air dispute involving PAL and
the Taiwanese EVA Air and China Airlines over passenger transport,
was also the apparent immediate reason why Taiwanese politicians are
hurling "ugly references" to the Philippines in their campaign
speeches.</P>
      <P>To restore Taiwanese confidence as well that of neighboring
countries, Tatad said "an urgent and thorough review of aviation
policy, particularly as it affects the carriers of our immediate
neighbors might help."</P>
      <P>The air dispute resulted in the suspension of flights between
Taiwan and the Philippines in October. It was settled only on Jan.
28, when Taiwan agreed to cut by half the number of customers its
airlines fly to and from the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The incident, however, "has obviously left a deep wound" in the
relations of the two countries, Tatad said. "It has embittered many
businessmen and politicians."

    <HEADLINE>WATCHDOG FAULTS SOONG FOR IMPROPER DECLARATION OF PROPERTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's watchdog agency on
Thursday blamed independent presidential candidate James Soong for
not properly registering his personal property and not honestly
reporting funds related to his 1994 campaign to become Taiwan
provincial governor.</P>
      <P>The five-member panel of the Control Yuan made public their
one-month investigation into Soong's secret bank accounts, finding
that the former ruling party secretary general and former Taiwan
provincial governor had stashed more than NT$1.17 billion (US$39.2
million) in more than 20 bank accounts that were opened in the names
of his relatives and staff members.</P>
      <P>The report said most of the funds came from political donations
to the ruling Kuomintang, campaign funds that Soong solicited from
businessmen during his bid for governorship, and the government's
compensation for his campaign spending.</P>
      <P>Since all of those were assets that Soong could control and
manage, the former Taiwan provincial governor should have registered
with the Control Yuan at least four times during his gubernatorial
term.</P>
      <P>The report also said Soong remitted US$12 million to the United
States during 1995 and 1999, and purchased a house in Mountain View,
Santa Clara County, California, that was not included in the property
declaration with the Control Yuan that he made while serving as
governor.</P>
      <P>Soong could face a fine of NT$300,000 (US$10,000) for each of the
violations.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Soong had solicited NT$520 million for his 1994
campaign for governorship, but only NT$104 million (US$3.46 million)
was registered with the Taiwan Election Committee.</P>
      <P>However, the existing law didn't punish that dishonorable
behavior, said the report.</P>
      <P>The report stopped short of delving into the legal troubles Soong
might have invoked by making off with political donations that were
destined for the KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US INTERESTS BETTER SERVED BY TSEA: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US interests are better served by
timely Senate consideration of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
(TSEA), a senior US policy analyst said on Friday.</P>
      <P>By voting before Taiwan's forthcoming presidential election, the
Senate assures Taiwan's people that mainland China's military
coercion will not be unnoticed or unchecked by the United States,
said Stephen Yates of the Washington-based Heritage Foundation in an
analysis titled "Time to Act on Taiwan's Security."</P>
      <P>He noted that faced with Beijing's rebuke and President Bill
Clinton's veto threat, some US senators have suggested not taking up
the TSEA until after Taiwan's March 18 election. Many have expressed
concern that it might upset consideration of granting mainland China
permanent normal trade relations status.</P>
      <P>However, Yates pointed out, US interests are better served by
timely Senate consideration of the TSEA, which was passed by the
House of Representatives with an overwhelming 341-70 vote on Feb. 1,
for the following reasons:</P>
      <P>-- Security supports democracy. By voting before Taiwan's
presidential election, the Senate "assures Taiwan's people that they
can exercise their democratic franchise, confident that China's
military coercion is not going unnoticed or unchecked by the United
States;"</P>
      <P>-- Enhanced security leads to flexibility in the cross-Taiwan
Strait dialogue. Arguments that enhancing Taiwan's security will
encourage "moves toward (Taiwan's) independence" and a regional arms
race "ignore the history of cross-strait dialogue, which progresses
when Taiwan feels secure;" and</P>
      <P>-- The TSEA will help, not hinder, passage of permanent normal
trade relations with mainland China. It demonstrates that the United
States will not relent on important security and political interests
in pursuit of trade with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yates noted that as House majority leader Richard Armey (R-TX)
said: "Friends of Taiwan should have no fear of our greater trade
with China, just as those who want more trade with China should not
object to us helping Taiwan. Both measures serve exactly the same end
-- to advance the cause of freedom in East Asia."</P>
      <P>The TSEA is largely a matter of the implementation of US law. "At
its heart is the question of whether Congress will reclaim for itself
a portion of its authority and responsibility under the Taiwan
Relations Act. The TSEA advocates a form of implementation of the
TRA, not a change in substance," stressed the analyst.</P>
      <P>Yates concluded: "Clearly, the United States should enhance its
own ability to determine and provide for Taiwan's self-defense needs.
This is the purpose of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act. The
alternative -- Taiwan's total vulnerability to Chinese attack or
total reliance on American intervention -- is unacceptable."</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS DPP CANDIDATE MOST POPULAR AMONG 20-SOMETHINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of an opinion poll released on
Saturday show that opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian is most popular among voters
aged between 20 and 29.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,081 eligible voters in this age group
found that 31.7 percent of the respondents would vote for Chen if the
presidential election were to take place the following day.</P>
      <P>In the same survey, 28.8 percent said they would throw their
support behind independent presidential hopeful James Soong, and just
12.9 percent said they would cast their ballots for ruling Kuomintang
candidate Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted by Gallup Taiwan Co. on the commission of
Sanlih Entertainment Television from Feb. 1-3 with the aim of gaining
an understanding about local 20-somethings' voting preferences.</P>
      <P>The poll results show that Chen enjoys the highest popularity
rating among young voters, with 83.1 percent of those interviewed
saying they think that Chen has the greatest appeal to young voters.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, Chen also led the pack in many other
fields. For instance, 75 percent said they believe that Chen will be
most daring in carrying out sweeping reforms if elected.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 73.1 percent said they think that Chen will be most
capable of bringing new hope to the younger generation, and 53.5
percent said they are convinced that Chen can create better job
opportunities for the young.</P>
      <P>Asked which presidential candidate will be most adroit in leading
Taiwan into the 21st century, 31.8 percent chose Chen; 27.3 percent
opted for Soong, and 18.6 percent selected Lien.</P>
      <P>As for the most important personal qualities of the country's
next president, 28.2 percent said the ability to maintain domestic
social stability is most important; 26 percent said an international
vision is most critical; 24.1 percent said integrity is most crucial;
18.8 percent gave the top priority to the ability to handle relations
with mainland China; and 18.7 percent said the ability to promote
Taiwan's economic growth is most important.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 46.5 percent of the respondents
support a 12-year compulsory education reform proposal, and 34.2
percent are in favor of a 13-year compulsory education reform program
which would include one-year mandatory preschool education for
youngsters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian urged his supporters on
Saturday not to be influenced by what he said are the "tricks the
ruling Kuomintang are going to use" against him.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as polls have shown that he and his running mate
Annette Lu have the highest support rate among the voters, he is
confident of winning March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>But he added that as the victory draws near, the DPP election
camp should not let up its guard.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the ruling party will soon employ three tricks
against him, saying that from next week, the KMT will try to produce
"fake polls" which show that KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan is
leading among the major candidates.</P>
      <P>The ruling will also resort to personal attacks designed to smear
him, Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>The last strategy will be to intimidate voters by saying that if
Chen is elected, he will bring war to Taiwan, according to Chen. He
said that the KMT tried the same trick against him five years ago
when he was running for Taipei mayor, but he pointed out that he won
the mayoral election, and that the nation continued to prosper.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a campaign official from Chen's camp said that
independent presidential candidate James Soong, who previously served
as KMT secretary-general and used to be the right-hand man of
President Lee Teng-hui, has another trick up his sleeve to use
against the KMT.</P>
      <P>You Ying-lung, vice campaign manager of Chen's camp, maintained
that Chen is now leading among the presidential candidates, followed
by Soong, and with Lien lagging behind.</P>
      <P>You said that even though the Control Yuan, the nation's highest
watchdog body, released a report on Soong which found that he had
acted improperly in the financial dealing in the Chung Hsing Bills
Finance Corp. case, Soong has maintained a 25-percent support rate.</P>
      <P>He noted that supporters for Lien and Soong overlap, which will
be beneficial to the DPP. But he said that after the KMT party
machine moves into high gear, the gaps between Chen, Soong and Lien
will close up.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARIS MOST FAVORED DESTINATION AMONG TAIWAN TOURISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Paris has been chosen as the most favored
destination among Taiwan tourists in 2000, according to the results
of an Internet survey.</P>
      <P>Paris, which scored 15 percent of the total votes, was followed
by Tokyo and New York. All together, the three cities garnered more
than 30 percent of the overall ballots cast in the vote sponsored by
travel agencies on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Ranking from third to 20th spot were Vancouver, Vienna, Sydney,
London, Prague, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Venice, Kyoto, Seattle,
Sapporo, Amsterdam, Bali, Zurich, Florence, Rome and Las Vegas,
according to the result of the month-long survey.</P>
      <P>Media influence, especially films or television series made in
those cities, was cited as the major reason behind their popularity.</P>
      <P>Although tallies compiled by the Taiwan Tourism Bureau indicate
that the vast majority of Taiwan tourists -- 22 times the number of
those who go to Europe -- tend to travel within Asia because of time
and money constraints, business purposes and the language barrier,
local tourism sources forecast that Europe will attract growing
numbers of Taiwan tourists in the future thanks to an appreciating
local currency and the country's strong economic recovery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FEMALE MANAGING DIRECTOR HEADS COMPAQ WITH DYNAMIC LEADERSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the only female managing director of
more than 150 branches of US-based Compaq, the world's largest
personal computer manufacturer, Rosemary Ho immediately invites
attention and curiosity.</P>
      <P>Ho was general manager of Digital Taiwan and took the helm of
Compaq Taiwan when Compaq merged with Digital some 19 months ago.
Under her dynamic leadership, the newly merged company has performed
brilliantly.</P>
      <P>She admits that "being a female corporate chief gives you
advantages and disadvantages, especially in the high-tech industry
which is still male-dominated."</P>
      <P>But she also says that women leaders enjoy the advantage of being
in a conspicuous place during any occasion and that perhaps the only
disadvantage is that "perhaps you will only be given one chance to
prove yourself."</P>
      <P>Realizing a long time ago the challenges that a woman faces in
climbing the corporate ladder, Ho has trained herself for years to
prove her abilities with substantial achievements in each of her
posts in the shortest time possible, because, as she says, "only by
so doing can one impress others."</P>
      <P>She acknowledges that her leadership style is both "dynamic and
strong," and adds that the business strategy of Compaq is "fast,
tough and precise" in the ever-changing computer industry.</P>
      <P>Although under her leadership, the strength of the newly merged
company has already doubled, she is still not satisfied.</P>
      <P>Noting that the human resources and marketing networks of Compaq
and Digital are complementary to each other, she envisions that the
goal will not just be a strength of "1+1," but that Compaq will
become a company measuring "11" on the scale.</P>
      <P>The performance of the merged company is indeed impressive. In
the third quarter of last year, Compaq climbed to number one in terms
of market share, the first time an imported brand had broken the
dominance of domestic personal computer giants such as Acer and Mitac
International.</P>
      <P>In July alone, Compaq sold nearly 30,000 desktop personal
computers.</P>
      <P>Compaq was selected last year by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
to work with domestic computer companies such as Inventec, Hon Hai
Precision Industry, First International Computer, and Compaq
Electronic, to develop a national e-commerce network.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, Compaq will cooperate with supply chains to build
a comprehensive e-commerce network that offers price inquiries,
Internet ordering, and product source tracking and delivery
management.</P>
      <P>After the e-commerce network is established, it will be promoted
among other industries in order to upgrade Taiwan's international
competitive edge in "e-society."</P>
      <P>Under Ho's leadership, Compaq displays a dynamic and competitive
corporate culture. Her management philosophy is "never mind the
details, but instead set goals for the staff to achieve in their own
ways."</P>
      <P>"Compaq doesn't care whether you come from Compaq or Digital, the
point is that members from the original two companies work side by
side to face the challenges ahead," Ho emphasizes.</P>
      <P>Ho says she firmly believes that an open style of management
gives staff more leeway and more creative space to solve problems.</P>
      <P>Despite her exalted position in the company, Ho still mingles
naturally with her staff, acting as their mentor as well as their
"big sister." Her staff describe her as "kind, sincere,
compassionate, and one who likes to walk around the office."</P>
      <P>Ho also has a "sheep herding" theory, by which she means she sees
herself as a shepherd with the responsibility of keeping the sheep
moving forward at roughly the same pace so that they can reach their
destination on time. She believes that careful delegation of work is
imperative, and that the faster sheep will naturally shoulder a
bigger share of the responsibility, although she says she is careful
not to crush the faster sheep.</P>
      <P>Another noteworthy feature of her management style is that she
"encourages the younger workers not to be afraid of making mistakes,"
saying that "only those who dare to make mistakes will learn from
them," although she is quick to add that this does not mean that
Compaq condones recklessness.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DOCTOR TO BE CITED FOR PROMOTING CULTURAL ACTIVITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Chin-huang, a pediatrician in the
booming southern Taiwan township of Hsinkang, has received
international recognition for his strenuous efforts to promote
cultural and artistic activities in local society.</P>
      <P>Chen, chairman of the Hsinkang Foundation of Culture and
Education, has been selected as winner of the 2000 award of the
Foundation de Entreprise Montblanc de la Culture.</P>
      <P>This is the first time since its inauguration in 1992 that the
British foundation has cited a cultural and arts promoter from
Taiwan. Over the past eight years, the foundation has presented its
annual award to arts promoters in 10 countries and areas.</P>
      <P>Lord Douro, chairman of the foundation, is scheduled to arrive in
Taiwan on Feb. 17 to present the award to Chen in recognition of his
contribution to supporting diverse cultural and artistic activities
around the island over the past 13 years.</P>
      <P>Chen founded the Hsinkang Foundation of Culture and Education in
1987 in his Chiayi County hometown to promote grassroots cultural and
artistic education.</P>
      <P>The foundation has since sponsored a variety of arts performances
and educational programs, including an annual Hsinkang arts festival
and nationwide tours by the Cloud Gate Dance Ensemble, the
Minghuanyuan Taiwanese Opera Troupe and the Pulp Windmill Children's
Theater.</P>
      <P>Under Chen's leadership, the Hsinkang Foundation has also set up
lifelong study centers in rural Taiwan communities, financed a
historical data collection program in Chiayi County's Penkang
district, and launched a series of environmental protection projects
in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Montblanc award came as a great surprise to him.
"It is also a great honor for me," Chen said, adding that without the
assistance of many of his friends and volunteers over the past 13
years, the foundation could not have accomplished what it has.</P>
      <P>He said the award has prompted him to review the foundation's
operations and goals. "I have found the need to cultivate a new
generation of arts promoters and administrators," Chen said, adding
that he will do his utmost to ensure sustained operations of the
Hsinkang Foundation after his retirement.</P>
      <P>Chen, who will receive about NT$500,000 (US$16,393) in prize
money from the Montblanc Foundation, said he has decided to donate
all the money to the Hsinkang Foundation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SECOND BATCH OF IMPORTED RICE WINE TO HIT MARKET NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second batch of rice wine imported from
Singapore cleared customs on Feb. 9, and is expected to hit Taiwan
shelves on Monday, an official from the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsiu-lien, director of the MOF's Department of Taxation,
said that the second batch of 1.2 million bottles of rice wine will
be distributed to the more remote areas of Hualien and Taitung, to
help relieve a rice wine shortage.</P>
      <P>She noted that nearly 900,000 of the first batch of 1 million
bottles of imported wine have been sold, despite some complaints that
the flavor of the imported product cannot compare with the locally
produced red-label rice wine.</P>
      <P>Chang also noted that as the imported wine can only be stored for
one year, the practice of hoarding has also dramatically reduced.</P>
      <P>She further said that the department cooked dishes using both
local and imported wine earlier in the week, and almost no one who
tasted the results could tell the difference.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization, when rice wine, a traditional cooking staple in Taiwan
households, will be categorized as a distilled product and hence be
subject to a heavier tariff, local distributors have been illegally
hoarding the locally produced wine, further exacerbating demand which
is traditionally high in winter.</P>
      <P>In order to alleviate the shortage and thwart the hoarders, the
government decided to import rice wine from Singapore, and the first
batch hit the local market in late January, in time for the Lunar New
Year holiday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MAY ALLOW POINT-TO-POINT DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRADE: VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China does not rule out the
possibility of designating a special zone for point-to-point direct
commercial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Vice President Lien
Chan has said in a recent interview with the Washington Post.</P>
      <P>Lien gave the interview with the American paper's Beijing bureau
chief John Pomfret on Friday at his office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is also the ruling Kuomintang's standard-bearer in the
March 18 presidential election, told Pomfret that the ROC government
has consistently promoted cross-strait relations based on the
principles of "parity, peace, progress and prosperity."</P>
      <P>"We hope to reach a win-win goal through upholding these
principles," Lien said, adding that "parity" is the core of all
cross-strait engagements.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that ROC President Lee Teng-hui's definition of
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" is by no
means an indication that Taiwan will move toward independence.</P>
      <P>"What we want to signify is the long-existing reality that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been separately ruled since
1949," Lien explained, adding that if mainland China is sincere in
its desire to resolve cross-strait problems, it must first face up to
this fact.</P>
      <P>He noted that ever since the ROC's founding in 1912 it has been
an independent sovereign state, not a local-level government nor a
"province under the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Lien further said he has on many occasions expressed his
willingness to meet with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin at an
appropriate time.</P>
      <P>"I think we can meet to talk about promotion of bilateral
exchanges and cooperation. We can even exchange views on any
political issues," Lien said, adding: "I have made the overture out
of sincerity. It's not just empty talk."</P>
      <P>Lien also said he feels that the two sides should temporarily
shelve their disputes over sovereignty and should instead seek room
for cooperation on a reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>Turning to the "three links" issue, Lien said the ROC has taken
the initiative to deal with the "direct cross-strait transportation,
postal and trade links" issue.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that although Taiwan still bans the "three direct
links," cross-strait mail and telephone links through a third country
or area are no longer a problem.</P>
      <P>As for shipping links, Lien said the ROC has adopted flexible
measures to facilitate maritime cross-strait cargo transport
services.</P>
      <P>"We have opened (an offshore transshipping center in) Kaohsiung
Harbor for direct cross-strait transshipping services by
foreign-registered vessels," Lien said, adding that such
transshipping services between Kaohsiung and mainland China's Xiamen
and Fuzhou ports have increased substantially since their launch a
few years ago.</P>
      <P>Lien said that if mainland China can show goodwill and make a
pragmatic response to Taiwan's call for resumption of regular
cross-strait dialogue, the ROC would consider upgrading or expanding
the offshore cross-strait transshipping business.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, when cross-strait relations make an obvious
improvement, the ROC may consider designating a special zone for
direct point-to-point trade across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"So long as mainland China shows enough goodwill toward Taiwan,
we'll review our cross-strait trade policy in line with the
requirements of the World Trade Organization after both sides are
admitted to the world trade regulatory body," Lien added.</P>
      <P>Touching on domestic issues, the vice president said he sees no
problems in the ROC government's operations if he is elected
president while President Lee Teng-hui continues serving as KMT
chairman.</P>
      <P>Lien said both he and Lee fully understand the operational
principles of a democratic government. Stressing that the KMT has
undergone sweeping reforms in organization, concepts and goals over
the past decade, he said the outside world should not continue to
regard the party as a Leninist-style organization.</P>
      <P>He further said the KMT will certainly put its assets into trust
when the relevant legislation is complete. "After successfully
leading Taiwan to complete democratic reform, the KMT is now
accelerating its own restructuring and re-engineering," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION TO BE 3-WAY RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The March 18 presidential election will be
a neck-and-neck three-way race, according to the results of a new
public opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,081 randomly selected adult residents
from around the nation was conducted by the Public Opinion Research
Foundation between Feb. 9 and Feb. 10.</P>
      <P>The poll results show that if the presidential election were to
take place the following day, 24.3 percent of the respondents would
vote for independent presidential hopeful James Soong; 23.5 percent
would throw their support behind opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian; and 23.3 percent would opt for
ruling Kuomintang nominee Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicate that the three key contenders enjoy almost
identical support ratings," said a foundation spokesman.</P>
      <P>As for the odds of victory in the critical election, as much as
40.2 percent said they believe that the KMT ticket of Lien and
Premier Vincent Siew stands the best chance of winning the election.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 18.8 percent said they think that the pairing of
Soong and his running mate Chang Chao-hsiung will succeed in the
election, and only 14.2 percent were willing to bet on the DPP ticket
of Chen and Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Asked which team they would least like to see win, 23 percent
named the Soong-Chang ticket, compared to 20.5 percent who chose the
Chen-Lu ticket and 15.2 percent who cited the Lien-Siew team.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation's analysis, Lien's popularity has
nearly doubled since last September, when his support rating was only
12.9 percent, while Soong's support rating has declined steadily
after reaching a peak of 41.5 percent in a survey conducted by the
foundation in June 1999. Chen's support rating has remained almost
the same and has not shown any dramatic fluctuation.</P>
      <P>The latest survey also found that about 40 percent of voters may
switch allegiance if they feel their favorite hopeful has little
chance of winning and the candidate they dislike most seems very
likely to win.</P>
      <P>The survey results further show that the Lien-Siew ticket would
be the top beneficiary should such a phenomenon occur and that the
Chen-Lu team would be most likely to be dumped.</P>
      <P>However, National Taiwan University professor Lu Ya-li said this
is unlikely to happen unless the KMT manages to drive down Soong's
support rating to below 20 percent.</P>
      <P>"Numerous opinion polls have shown that Soong has a `staunch
support rating' of around 24 percent to 25 percent. As the election
laws ban the release of any public opinion polls in the month leading
up to voting day, local voters will have no information to speculate
on which of the three front-runners has little chance of winning.
Therefore, I believe the neck-and-neck three-way situation will
continue until the end of the campaign," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO STEP UP CRACKDOWN ON SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on Sunday
reaffirmed its determination to crack down on smuggling as it
reported that 2,995 tons of agricultural, fishery and livestock
products smuggled from mainland China were seized last year.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a whopping increase of 82 percent from the
previous year, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>In view of the rampant smuggling, the COA is now working with
other law enforcement authorities to step up efforts to crack down on
smugglers, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the price differentials on agricultural
products between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait -- with a gap
sometimes as high as tenfold -- is the main reason why smugglers take
the risk.</P>
      <P>Saying that the seized goods totaled 2,995 tons last year, they
said that the figure could represent only the tip of the iceberg when
compared with the amount of smuggled products that had slipped
through to the local market.</P>
      <P>The officials said that smuggled goods from the mainland have not
only disrupted market prices and undermined the mechanism of
production and distribution, but that they could also pose a serious
threat to local products, saying that the outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease in pigs and cows in Taiwan in recent years was suspected to
be linked with the smuggled mainland products.</P>
      <P>To deter smuggling, the COA is asking law enforcement authorities
to step up checks in harbors and coastal areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAA PLANNING CONSTRUCTION OF 3RD CKS TERMINAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
is now planning the construction of a third terminal at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, administration officials said on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The CAA officials said the third terminal, expected to be
operational in 2007, will help realize the nation's goal of turning
Taiwan into an aviation center in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the second terminal, scheduled to open
on Feb. 26, will expand the passenger-accommodation ability of CKS
International Airport by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that many countries in the region have in
recent years expanded existing airports or constructed new ones,
Taiwan has to keep with their efforts if it wants to realize the goal
of becoming a regional aviation hub, the officials said.</P>
      <P>A study by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
showed that the next three to five years will be crucial for Taiwan
if it wants to successfully develop itself into a regional hub.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CAA has continued to push its plan to turn the
city of Taoyuan into an aviation center surrounding CKS International
Airport. Under the project, an air cargo park is scheduled to be
completed and opened to cargo-transport companies in 2002.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) said
on Sunday that beginning March 8, which is 10 days before the
presidential election, no polls related to the race will be allowed
to be published.</P>
      <P>The CEC said the ban will be imposed so as to prevent influence
over voters' decisions in the March 18 election.</P>
      <P>CEC officials said that the revised election and recall draft
bill stipulates that starting 28 days before the presidential
election, no related polls will be allowed to be published, but as
the bill is now pending in the Legislative Yuan, the CEC is following
the original regulations which say that no such polls may be
published in the 10-day period before the election.</P>
      <P>The CEC also said that as the election draws near, it is planning
four television presentations between February 20 and March 11 to
introduce the five presidential candidates and their running mates to
enhance the public's understanding of them.</P>
      <P>The CEC on Friday completed its review of the qualifications of
the five tickets: Lien Chan and Vincent Siew of the ruling
Kuomintang; Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party; Li Ao and Elmer Fung of the New Party;
and independent presidential candidates James Soong with running mate
Chang Chao-hsiung, and Hsu Hsin-liang with Chu Huei-liang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL SHOWS SOONG, CHEN NECK AND NECK IN RACE FOR PRESIDENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the majority of people think
independent presidential candidate James Soong has not told all about
his secret slush fund, he is still neck and neck with the front
runner in the race and is well ahead of other presidential hopefuls,
according to a survey released on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the private firm the Policy-making
Public Relations Company, found that 67.2 percent of those surveyed
said they think Soong didn't clearly explain away the scandal
surrounding his huge slush fund stashed in secret bank accounts, but
the former Taiwan provincial governor still commanded the support of
25.7 percent of respondents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Shui-bian, the candidate of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), was favored by 26.1 percent of those
surveyed. However, the gap between the two is well within the 3
percent margin of error and is therefore statistically insignificant.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's candidate Lien Chan came in third place
with 20.3 percent of respondents' support, while the New Party's Li
Ao and the other independent Hsu Hsin-liang brought up the rear with
1.5 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Twenty-five percent of those surveyed were undecided.</P>
      <P>Soong had previously been considered the front runner in the
presidential race according to various polls, but his popularity was
dampened by the revelation in December that he has stashed a huge
slush fund in secret bank accounts opened in the names of his
relatives.</P>
      <P>Soong has gone the extra mile to clear up the scandal by calling
for two press conferences to explain the source of the cash and where
the money has gone. He even invited an independent legislator to head
a team of accountants and lawyers to examine his financial situation.</P>
      <P>But the poll found his efforts have only won approval from 12.7
percent of respondents, who said Soong has gotten the whole thing
"very much" or "considerably" straightened out.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-hsieh, deputy director of the Institute of International
Relations, said at a press conference called to announce the results
of the poll that Soong's secret accounts, if not cleared up in time,
will dog his presidential bid and overshadow his campaign platform
which deals with the more important issues of national security and
ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that 47.3 percent of those interviewed
think Lien Chan will follow President Lee Teng-hui's policy of
defining the island's ties with Beijing as a "state-to-state"
relationship.</P>
      <P>Although Lien has been careful to not reaffirm Lee's
"state-to-state" policy, only 19.3 percent said they think Lien, if
elected, will break from his political mentor's line which has irked
Beijing and strained bilateral ties since Lee made the claim last
July.</P>
      <P>As for DPP candidate Chen Shui-bien's campaign promise that he
will not declare Taiwan independence as long as Beijing does not
invade Taiwan with force, 40 percent of respondents approved of it,
considering it in Taiwan's interest, while 30.8 percent disapproved,
and 28.1 percent said they didn't know.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, 20.5 percent of those surveyed chose Lee Yuan-tseh,
president of Academia Sinica, as their favorite candidate to be
nominated premier after the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Senior Adviser to the President Wu Poh-hsiung, who failed to win
the opportunity to be Lien's running mate on the KMT ticket, is
supported by 13.9 percent of respondents as the most suitable
premier, while former Minister of Justice Liao Chen-hao, who is a
firm supporter of Soong, came in third place with 8 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted with the participation of 1,090 adults
in Taiwan between Feb. 9 and 11, said the researchers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Feb. 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has warned that the Falun Gong sect poses as much of a threat to the
Communist Party as the Solidarity movement did to Poland's communists
in the 1980s, the South China Morning Post reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, in a discussion with senior aides, Jiang
cited the Falun Gong movement, along with unemployed farmers and
workers and "splittists" among ethnic minorities, as the most
destabilizing factors in mainland society.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a source as saying that Jiang stressed the
party must never underestimate the threat of Falun Gong because of
its "ability to infiltrate society" and win the hearts and minds of
the people.</P>
      <P>The party chief then made comparisons between Falun Gong and the
Solidarity movement in Poland.</P>
      <P>While Beijing has detained many "ringleaders," the party
leadership was afraid of a possible rash of suicides in prisons, the
report quoted a diplomatic source as saying.</P>
      <P>"There have been reports of Falun Gong practitioners committing
suicide in jail," the report said, noting that: "Beijing has tried to
suppress such reports for fear they would fan emotions and stir up
further resistance among sect followers."

    <HEADLINE>TWO PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS LASH OUT AT RIVALS ON THE AIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A little difference is as good as a big
difference, said independent presidential candidate James Soong on
Sunday in a satellite-hookup interview at a local cable TV station.</P>
      <P>Soong said it seems that the campaign platforms aired by the
three serious contenders in the presidential race are almost the same
on the face, but that there are subtle differences among them and a
subtle difference could turn out to be an abyss of difference in
practice.</P>
      <P>By the three main contenders, Soong was referring to the ruling
Kuomintang's candidate Lien Chan, Democratic Progressive Party
candidate Chen Shui-bien, and himself.</P>
      <P>Soong criticized Chen for never asserting publicly what country's
presidency he is running for, saying that his avoidance of the name
issue is due to his long-standing preference for Taiwan independence
and his denial of the legality of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The independent hopeful also criticized his KMT rival Lien Chan
for his poor performance in his jobs as vice president and premier
over the last four years.</P>
      <P>In the absence of any concrete accomplishments, all Lien and his
party can do is make more empty promises without bothering to
consider how to deliver on them, charged Soong.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Soong said, he himself realized 95 percent of the
7,000-plus promises he made during his 1994 campaign to become Taiwan
provincial governor.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was the only other candidate interviewed by the local
TVBS station for the program, emphasized that the top priority on his
agenda as president would be to defend Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Chen said he regrets what he called KMT leaders' soft stance
toward Beijing through their debasement of Taiwan to a semi-state --
which means not a full state -- in the government's engagement with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>He refused, however, to chant "Long live the Republic of China"
as challenged by some among the studio audience in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Chen also questioned Soong's credibility, saying that more than
70 percent of people in various polls have said Soong is dishonest
following the disclosure of his secret slush fund, a revelation that
will disqualify Soong from becoming a head of state.</P>
      <P>The program was broadcast live from Los Angels to its audience
among the local Chinese community there, but Soong and Chen were
interviewed via satellite hookup in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN FUND INFLOW TO STOCK MARKET EXPECTED TO SURPASS US$ 30 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign fund inflow to the local bourse is
expected to surpass US$30 billion and set a new record soon due to
its promising future and its reweighting by Morgan Stanley Capital
International, sources from the local stock market said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Foreign fund inflow has already accumulated to over US$25 billion
after the stock market resumed trading on Feb. 9 after a one-week
closure due to the Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>Net foreign fund inflow totaled US$10.6 billion in 1998, and the
amount skyrocketed to US$24.1 billion in 1999, setting an
unprecedented growth record.</P>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Governor Perng Fai-nan said the CBC
will keep a close eye on the return of foreign capital -- one factor
leading to the general rise in stock and exchange markets across Asia
-- while Vice Governor Shea Jia-dong stressed that the CBC does not
welcome foreign capital destined for short-term stock speculation, in
a bid to prevent any negative impact on the local financial market.</P>
      <P>Boosted by abundant inflow of foreign capital, the New Taiwan
dollar has gradually shrugged off the shadow cast by the Asian
financial turmoil, and the exchange rate has advanced to 30.6 against
the greenback. The NT dollar is still likely to appreciate further in
line with more foreign funds rushing in, analysts in the exchange
market said.</P>
      <P>In light of the considerable amount of sudden foreign capital
inflow, CBC officials warned that explanations will be needed if the
inflow and outflow are unusually frequent. Measures such as a cut in
the total amount of foreign investment and a delay for applications
for stock transactions could be taken to regulate the movement of
capital, CBC officials noted.

    <HEADLINE>ROC ECONOMIC GROWTH TO BE PROJECTED AT 6.5 PERCENT THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan plans to
modify the nation's projected economic growth rate for this year from
6.04 percent to 6.5 percent.</P>
      <P>A DGBAS official said that the modification will be made at a
meeting to be held on Feb. 18.</P>
      <P>Due to the economic recovery from the recession at home and
abroad, exports of the Republic of China will reach a two-digit
growth rate in real terms. In addition, post-quake reconstruction
projects, the planned high-speed railway construction and building of
high-tech industrial parks will also be carried out this year, thus
boosting economic growth, he said.</P>
      <P>The Economic Research Institute of Academia Sinica and the Taiwan
Institute for Economic Research have projected this year's economic
growth rate at 6.37 percent and 6.28 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, deputy chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said that because the US
economy is recovering and the price of the New Taiwan dollar is at a
stable stage, the growth rate of ROC exports is expected to top the
two-digit mark for 2000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy depends heavily on exports, and growth of global
exports has been projected at around 7 percent by world-famous
economic institutions, Lee said, adding that the nation's real export
growth rate will surpass the originally projected 7.9 percent.</P>
      <P>That is why the nation's economic growth rate must be modified,
Lee added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3 MAIN PRES. HOPEFULS' CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES FOCUS ON CRITICISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three main presidential hopefuls'
campaign activities on Sunday focused on criticizing each other.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate, current Vice
President Lien Chan, and his running mate Premier Vincent Siew
presided over the inaugural ceremony of the Taipei city chapter of
their election campaign headquarters on Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou rushed back from New York on Saturday
to support Lien and Siew.</P>
      <P>Ma called on those who attended the mass rally to back the
Lien-Siew ticket, saying that the ruling Kuomintang is able to lead
the nation toward a brilliant tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lien attended a spring festival gathering of
veterans in Kaohsiung County and explained why he is taking part in
the 2000 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Lien said that he will defend the KMT's administration, safeguard
the Republic of China and maintain the nation's traditional and ethic
concepts and its moral standard.</P>
      <P>Lien criticized opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
candidate Chen Shui-bian for what he called Chen's assertion of
Taiwan independence. Lien criticized another rival, James Soong, as
being unable to distinguish right from wrong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the independent presidential candidate Soong and his
running mate Chang Chao-hsiung jointly inaugurated their election
drive headquarters in Hsinchu County on Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally, Soong criticized Chen's NT$3,000 monthly
pension proposal, calling it vote-buying since Chen had failed to
realize it when he was elected Taipei mayor five years ago. He
described Chen's proposal as an overdrawn check.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Chen criticized his two major rivals for their
dishonesty.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Lien had fabricated public opinion to cheat the
voters and that Soong did not honestly submit a financial report to
the relevant government agencies.</P>
      <P>According to public opinion surveys, Lien, Soong and Chen enjoy
almost the same level of popularity and similar support rates, thus
making the election campaign a period of hand-to-hand combat.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FERRARI DRIVING SON OF BUSINESSMAN DEVOTED TO HELPING ELDERLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>He is probably the first man in Taiwan who
drives a Ferrari to work as a social worker taking care of the
elderly in a job that pays a monthly wage which is not enough to
change a bumper on his car.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-ming, the 40 year old bachelor son of a rich businessman
who owns a Ferrari, a Lotus and a Mitsubishi sports car, has been
working as a social worker taking care of sick and helpless elderly
citizens for two years and has no intention of stopping.</P>
      <P>Hsu recently bought himself a "smaller car" -- a Fiat Punto --
just for the convenience of driving elders to the hospital and for
parking.</P>
      <P>Recalling the first time he saw him two years ago when Hsu walked
into the foundation for a job interview, Lee Hsiung, executive
director of the Elder Foundation said he looked at the young man with
long hair and earrings and thought to himself, "Oh my God!"</P>
      <P>Despite Hsu's appearance, Lee hired Hsu because the foundation,
which was facing great financial strain, was in dire need of helping
hands.</P>
      <P>Nobody, including Hsu himself, believed that he would be able to
keep the job for any length of time. Friends even laid odds that he
would quit the job within the first month.</P>
      <P>To everyone's surprise, Hsu held the job and soon began enjoying
it. By his presence, he has breathed life into the dull, sad, and
often times thankless job of helping and caring for elderly people
who are either poor and homeless or are sick and have no next of kin.</P>
      <P>Overwhelmed by Hsu's passion, energy and devotion to the
laborious job, Lee promoted Hsu to section chief, exclusively in
charge of rescue operations one year later.</P>
      <P>The first and still about the only foundation in Taiwan
established for the elderly, the Elder Foundation has four stated
missions it attempts to carry out on a daily basis -- to take care of
poor and helpless elderly citizens, to provide a safe haven for
abused elderly individuals, to help find lost elders, and to rescue
elderly citizens who are in danger, said Lee Hsiung.</P>
      <P>As operations chief, Hsu is always on stand by, with his sports
cars on alert for any emergencies.</P>
      <P>He has already been involved in some daring rescues. One time, he
climbed the iron racks of a five-story residential building, smashed
a window and climbed into an apartment where a old man had reportedly
fainted.</P>
      <P>He once received a phone call from the foundation, while he was
seated at New Year's Eve dinner with his family, telling him that an
elderly man, who also lived alone, had fallen to the floor and could
not move. Hsu did not hesitate to speed away from the important
family gathering to help the man in distress.</P>
      <P>Later Hsu was told that Mr. Wang, the elder who had fallen down,
had no one to take care of him and all his grown children lived in
the United States. The foundation called the family of the in-laws of
one of Wang's children in Taipei who told them they were too busy to
take care of Wang, especially during the New Year period.</P>
      <P>Hsu carried Wang, whose pelvis was smashed in the fall, to a
clinic bed. He stayed with Wang at the hospital for two days.</P>
      <P>One day Hsu was told that a blind man, living alone in a run-down
shelter, was believed to be dying because he had not been seen around
for days. Entering the dark den, Hsu almost choked from the putrid
smell inside. He then saw the old man lying on a filthy quilt with
rats running about. His two feet were dark and badly swollen.</P>
      <P>When Hsu talked to the old man and tried to lift him out of the
bed, the old man swung his cane and hit Hsu, shouting "I'm not going
anywhere, nobody is taking me to the graveyard."</P>
      <P>After trying to reason with the elderly man for more than 10
hours, Hsu and his colleagues finally persuaded the old man to let
them carry him to the hospital. Hsu was told that the old man died in
the hospital the next day.</P>
      <P>Hsu's mother said she is probably the happiest mother in the
world now as her son, who used to be the headache of the family, has
found a brand new life full of meaning and compassion. "I have a new
son," she said.</P>

of the first month of the Year of the Dragon according to the lunar
calendar. Following is a list of important events that have occurred
on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An
Assay on the Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues
that populations tend to increase faster than food supplies unless
the increase is checked by moral restraints or by war, famine or
disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who
commanded three major voyages of "discovery," charting and "naming"
many islands in the Pacific Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in
Hawaii.

1797: British naval forces under Admiral John Jervis and Captain
Horatio Nelson defeat the Spanish fleet off Portugal's Cape St.
Vincent.

1819: Christopher Scholes, the United States' inventor of the
typewriter, is born.

1859: Oregon becomes the 33rd state of the United States.

1893: Hawaii is annexed to the United States by treaty.

1912: Arizona becomes the 48th state of the United States.

1924: Thomas John Watson, the US industrialist who worked for the

made president of a company that later becomes International Business
Machines Corporation (IBM).

killed in what became known as the "Saint Valentine's Day Massacre."

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese
puppet regime known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of
their hegemony, the Japanese invaders of northern China installed the
Manchukuo regime in 1932. This "land of the Manchu" proved to be no
more than another stepping stone for the extension of Japanese
aggression.

1939: The German battleship Bismarck is launched.

1943: Soviet troops recapture Rostov from German invaders.

1944: Carl Bernstein, the US journalist who along with Bob
Woodward exposed the Watergate scandal which brought down President
Richard Nixon, is born.

"Sino-Soviet Friendly Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty" in
Moscow.

1956: Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev denounces the policies
of Joseph Stalin at the 20th congress of the Soviet Communist Party.

Kai-shek, dies in Taipei at the age of 68.

1963: Harold Wilson is elected leader of the British Labour
Party.

1972: Mexico establishes diplomatic relations with mainland
China.

1972: The Soviet Union launches its Luna 20 spacecraft to the
moon.

1972: Washington relaxes trade restrictions against Beijing,
putting it on same basis as Moscow.

1973: Lic. Walter Benche Medina, newly-appointed ambassador of El
Salvador, arrives in Taipei to assume his office.

1973: An Israeli fighter shoots down a Libyan passenger plane
over the Sinai Desert, killing 74 people.

president of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, arrives in Taipei for a
weeklong visit.

1974: Commissioner W. Stanley Cottrill, international secretary
of the Salvation Army International Headquarters, leaves Taipei after
a three-day visit.

1975: The Marinas Islands in the Pacific become a territory of
the United States.

1977: Shih Wei-liang, a noted ROC musician, dies in Taipei at the
age of 54.

1979: The US Ambassador to Afghanistan, Adolphe Dubs, is
kidnapped in Kabul and is killed when security forces try to free him
from the captors.

1989: Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious leader, issues a
"fatwa," or death sentence, against British writer Salman Rushdie for
what he deemed to be blasphemy in the author's book "The Satanic
Verses," sending him into years of hiding.

1999: Former Nixon White House aide John Ehrlichman dies at the
age of 73. He served 18 months in prison for his role in the
Watergate cover-up.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Earnestness without judgment
becomes pedantry; caution without judgment becomes timidity; courage
without judgment leads to crime; uprightness without judgment makes
men tyrannical."</TEXT>

other branch when their car collided with a motorcycle on a road near
Hsichih, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The two motorcyclists, both armed with guns, jumped up and aimed
their guns at Lin and Wang and hijacked the car. Before they realized
it, one of the gunmen was driving the bank sedan while the other kept
the pair of clerks under control.</P>
      <P>After driving about 300 meters, the two gunmen seized the cash
and hijacked another car. During the car switch, Lin tried to wrestle
back the money and was shot in the neck twice. The gunmen then sped
away in the second stolen car with the money.</P>

accident staged, suffered no serious injuries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Monday conferred
a medal on Cor Boonstra, president of Royal Philips Electronics, in

      <P>In accepting the honor, Boonstra said Philips came to Taiwan in
1966, and that following its efforts over the past three decades, the
company is pleased to see that investment in Taiwan is worthwhile and
that Philips Taiwan has become one of the multinational corporation's
major footholds in overseas markets.</P>
      <P>Though Philips has moved some of its labor-intensive production
to other regions, Boonstra said Philips will continue to develop its
high-value-added products here in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJIB HEAD ADMITS INFILTRATION BY PRC SPIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Ministry of Justice's
Investigation Bureau (MOJIB) on Monday admitted that mainland Chinese
spies have infiltrated Taiwan and conducted intelligence work here.</P>
      <P>Most of the undercover activities, however, were intercepted or
put under close surveillance, said MOJIB Director Wang Kuang-yu.</P>
      <P>Confirming reports that the nation's intelligence authorities,
including the National Security Bureau, the Military Intelligence
Bureau and MOJIB, have recently stepped up security checks on
mainland visitors here, Wang acknowledged that relevant work has been
intensified in recent weeks, just for strengthening national security
in the lead-up to the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang, however, denied that the recent work is related to the
so-called "Puo Yun (Stroking the Cloud) Operation" as has been
rumored.</P>
      <P>Wang disclosed that a total of 376 mainlanders were expelled over
the past three years after being found to have carried out undercover
intelligence work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most of them came to Taiwan legally by joining mainland Chinese
groups for cultural activities or by visiting relatives living in
Taiwan, Wang disclosed.</P>
      <P>Usually the mainlanders who worked as "cells," or infiltrators,
departed from the group which legally brought them to Taiwan on the
day after arrival and hid among Taiwanese society while they began
their information-collecting or intelligence work, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang declined to give a detailed answer when asked how many
undercover mainlanders he believes are still in Taiwan, stating only
that "there are a few of them, and all of them are under
surveillance."</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's presidential
candidates drew lots to determine the order in which their names will

    <HEADLINE>MEDIA GROUP FROM HONG KONG, MACAU ARRIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group comprising media executives from
Hong Kong and Macau arrived in Taiwan on Monday to observe
preparations for the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Heading the group, Edgar K.W. Yuen, deputy editor in chief of
Ming Pao Newspaper, said that although they have read the news about
Taiwan's presidential election while in Hong Kong, they hope to gain
a deeper understanding of the election through personal observation.</P>
      <P>Yuen said the group hopes to have more contact with local people
during the six-day visit in order to learn more about their feelings
regarding the election.</P>
      <P>He said that it has been hard to tell who will emerge as the
winner of the election by observing from Hong Kong, but he noted that
the support rate of opposition Democratic Progressive Party candidate
Chen Shui-bian rose thanks to the sparring between KMT candidate Lien
Chan and independent candidate James Soong.</P>
      <P>Willie Lam, editor in chief of the South China Morning Post, who
has been a consistent observer of Taiwan elections since in 1986,
said that in the past Taiwan's candidates resorted to sentimentalism
and personal connections.</P>
      <P>However, he said, recently, especially in the lead-up to this
year's presidential election, voters seem to be becoming more
rational, the more so in the urban centers of Taichung and Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lam said he will come again to observe and report on Taiwan's
presidential election after this trip.</P>
      <P>Ho Yuk Wa, news editor of the China desk at Sing Tao Newspaper,
said that although the group is here too early to observe the March
18 presidential election, the trip will nevertheless help them in
reporting the news as the election draws nearer.</P>
      <P>The group, which is here at the invitation of the Central News
Agency, will also visit Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park and
travel to central Taiwan to observe the post-quake situation after
the devastating Sept. 21 temblor.</P>

      <P>One practitioner told the information center that some of them
were detained by police because they took part in public protests
in Beijing against government crackdown on the Falun Gong sect, or
because they practiced Falun Gong outdoors. Others were detained
simply because they said they continued to practice Falun Gong after

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices plunged 1.6 percent,
falling below the 10,000-point mark on Monday amid cautious sentiment
due to declines in stock markets worldwide in the last trading
session.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index plunged
157.22 points to finish at 9,971.45, on a turnover of NT$204.08
billion (US$6.66 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened slightly lower, with the index fluctuating in a
200-point range. The financial sector suffered serious losses, ending
up with a 3.5-percent fall, the largest among the eight major stock
categories.</P>
      <P>The electronics sector failed to continue its strong rising trend
as it had after the index climbed to over 9,300 points, yet those
shares with speculative aspects turned out to be the leading force in
pushing the index up, which, according to dealers, was not a good
phenomenon for the bourse.</P>
      <P>The amount of loans that investors have borrowed to buy stocks
has almost reached a alarmingly high level, which was also a major
factor in the session's large fall, dealers said. Short-term selling
pressure and consolidation are expected to emerge following the
breach of the important 10,000-point level, dealers noted.</P>
      <P>Electronics shares, plastics and chemical stocks, and foodstuff
issues all suffered losses among the eight major stock categories.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market performed better than the stock
market, edging down just 1.96 points to close at 277.83 points on a
turnover of NT$42.87 billion.</P>
      <P>Decliners led advancers 316 to 248, with 32 issues remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) also experienced poor performance as the stock market did,
closing with negative results. September and December futures
recorded no transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for February plunged 187 points to finish at
9,980, with 1,107 contract transactions. Those for March shed 185
points to close at 10,064, with 1,199 contract transactions, while
those for June declined 110 points to finish at 10,260, with 29
contract transactions.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Monday were: 10,167
points for February, 10,249 points for March, 10,370 points for June,
10,231 points for September, and 10,528 points for December.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, both reported falls.</P>
      <P>February TE futures shed 7.2 points to close at 504, with 552
contract transactions, March TE futures moved down 6.4 points to
close at 511.6, with 254 contract transactions, and June TE futures
moved down 4.3 points to close at 521, with four contract
transaction.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for September or
December.</P>
      <P>February TF futures lost 67.2 points to close at 1,180, with 434
contract transactions, and March TF futures moved down 60 points to
close at 1,220, with 295 contract transactions. No transactions were

Soong reiterated on Monday that the two sides of Taiwan Strait must
lower their confrontation and reopen dialogue channels and sign a
peaceful non-invasion treaty.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with Japan's NHK TV station, Soong also
stressed that he will do whatever he can to further promote relations
between Taiwan and Japan if he wins the March 18 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on President Lee Teng-hui's contributions to
Taiwan during his 12 years in office, Soong said that in the early
part of his tenure, Lee implemented democratization and localization
programs and direct presidential elections, and also reformed the
aging parliament, all of which conformed with mainstream public
opinion.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, Lee carried out the second stage of the
constitutional reform which has caused a constitutional crisis,
especially in letting the National Assembly extend the tenure of its
members.</P>
      <P>He has also no regard for the democratic constitutional
regulations, evident in his public support as president of the
country for the ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate, and his use
of government agencies to support the ruling party candidate,
according to Soong, who claimed that the electorate has reserved its
opinion of Lee's attitude.</P>
      <P>Speaking on his mainland China policy, Soong repeated the
importance of "dialogue" and "interchanges," and added his hope that
political dialog will lower the confrontation across the Taiwan
Strait. He also said the two sides of Taiwan Strait should avoid
"pocket book" diplomatic contests.</P>
      <P>However, he also said Taiwan should build up its national defense
capability as Beijing has not ruled out taking Taiwan by force.</P>
      <P>Asked about Lee's special "state-to-state relationship"
statement, Soong said that mainstream Taiwan public opinion is
opposed to "immediate reunification" or "immediate independence," and
noted that his future mainland China policy will be made based on
these factors. He stressed that he will not easily push the Taiwan
people into a war.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taiwan-Japan relations, Soong said Taiwan can play a
"buffer" role in China-Japan relations. He also noted that he has
traveled around more than 30 Japanese prefectures, and admires very
much the Japanese spirit of teamwork.</P>
      <P>Soong said that he will not go back to the KMT if he is elected,
and criticized Vice President Lien Chan for what he termed his
inability to carry out KMT reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA FACING AGING POPULATION PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is facing a serious aging
population problem due to its one-child policy as the number of
elderly people is set to more than triple over the next five years,
according to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
(ABC) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ABC noted that the Chinese government's one-child policy has
worked well, halting the overall growth in the country's population.
Yet, at the same time, the ratio of old people to young people within
the population has also increased as a result of the policy.</P>
      <P>The absolute number of elderly is also increasingly dramatically
said the report. There are presently 130 million elderly people
across mainland China and the number is expected to surge to 400
million in the next five years. Most of that total will be
pensioners.</P>
      <P>At present, one young person in mainland China supports four
elderly people on average, and that ratio is expected to grow in the
coming years, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SUSPENDS GIVING PREFERENCE TO REFUGEE CLAIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Department of Immigration has
ordered a suspension in the processing of priority cases from
overseas claims of refugee status because of a growing influx of
illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on Monday told the Australian
that the move was a natural consequence of the wave of illegal
immigrants.</P>
      <P>More than 3000 illegal immigrants from the Middle East, mainland
China, Pakistan and Afghanistan had been detained between July 1999
and January of this year for trying to sneak into Australia, and some
of them were deported.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said his department last year received four times as many
applications for refugee status as the previous year, with a total of
about 6000 from people illegally in Australia.</P>
      <P>"Ultimately onshore arrivals granted refugree status impact
directly on offshore refugee claims. It's the reason I am very angry
about unlawful arrivals. The only prudent course was to suspend
processing," Ruddock told the daily.</P>
      <P>Australia has an entry quota of 12,000 for refugees on
humanitarian basis per year. It allowed in some 68,000 immigrants in
fiscal 1997-98 and the number is expected to remain unchanged for
1998-99 and 1999-2000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four mountain climbers from Montreal will
soon attempt to become the first Canadians to conquer Mount Everest
without the help of bottled oxygen.</P>
      <P>The four, who met with Montreal Mayor Pierre Bourque on Monday,
will also embark on the trek without a Sherpa guide, and will attempt
to scale the perilous Tibetan slope of the world's highest mountain.</P>
      <P>Only about 10 percent of the successful Everest expeditions used
this northern side. "It's more complicated than the standard route on
the Nepalese side," said Francois Loubert, the lone physician in the
group.</P>
      <P>He added that about 800 people have reached Everest's peak since
1953 and 100 have done it without bottled oxygen.</P>
      <P>More than a dozen Canadians have successfully tackled Everest,
but about six climbers die every year while attempting to reach or
descend from the 8,848-meter summit.</P>
      <P>Loubert will leave for Kathmandu in Nepal on Feb. 23 with
Bernard Mailhot, who is an engineer, filmmaker Claude-Andre Nadon,
and Andre Laperriere, a film technician.</P>
      <P>After spending two months getting accustomed to the high Tibetan
altitude, the group hopes to reach Everest's summit by mid-May.

beginning of the millennium by helping improve the living conditions
of people in developing countries.</P>
      <P>The minister announced the Canadian International Development
Agency's (CIDA) participation in "Our Millennium" -- a nation-wide
initiative of the Community Foundations of Canada. The national
campaign invites Canadians to give make meaningful and lasting
contributions to their communities at home and around the world.</P>
      <P>The CIDA has sponsored the creation of the "Global Citizenship"

    <HEADLINE>MND REITERATES ADMINISTRATIVE NEUTRALITY DURING ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Tuesday reiterated its firm stance of maintaining administrative
neutrality in the lead-up to and during the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Under the instructions of Chief of the General Staff Tang
Yao-ming, all military branches and units have been notified to
remain neutral and strictly refrain from intervening or participating
in any activities related to the election, said MND spokesman Kung
Fan-ting.</P>
      <P>Refuting allegations that the armed forces have been told to
suspend leaves on election day so as to prevent the men and women in
uniform from "voting for a certain candidate," Kung said all
arrangements and deployments will be conducted in a normal fashion on
March 18. Those members of the armed forces who are on duty on
election day will carry out their functions according to the relevant
regulations and those who are not will be able to take their leaves.</P>
      <P>Kung also rebuked rumors that all officers with the rank of major
or higher had recently received NT$2,000 from the government and that
many military personnel had received silver coins in an effort to
influence their votes.</P>
      <P>Kung said the granting of NT$2,000 cash awards and silver coins
was authorized by President Lee Teng-hui simply to express gratitude
to the armed forces for their laborious and unselfish efforts in
helping the victims of the catastrophic earthquake of Sept. 21, and
had absolutely nothing to do with the election.</P>
      <P>He also said that visits to military bases around the island and
to offshore outposts during the New Year holiday by Tang Yao-ming,
who was accompanied by officers from the war affairs section, were
simply for discussions on preparedness policies and for expressing
the MND's appreciation to the armed forces for their efforts toward
national defense over the past year. He stressed that the visits were
not related in any way to the upcoming presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND METAPHYSICIAN'S BOOK BANNED IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The latest book by mainland Chinese
metaphysician Li Jianjun has been officially banned in Taiwan as it
was found to be in violation of relevant laws in the Republic of
China, according to sources from the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>All copies of "My Taiwan Road and Lien Chan's Presidential Luck,"
written by Li, a Taoist and philosopher-turned author from Xian, were
taken off the shelves of book stores in Taiwan after the Taipei
District Court on Tuesday upheld an injunction seeking to have the
book banned.</P>
      <P>The injunction, filed recently by Gloria Chu, chair of the
Central Broadcasting System and a close friend of Lien Chan, accused
Li of making untrue statements in his book about Lien's family and
seriously tarnishing the reputation of members of his family and of
those with connections to him.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-ti, presiding administrative judge of the Taipei
District Court, said both the publication and the sale of copies of
"My Taiwan Road and Lien Chan's Presidential Luck" have been
detrimental to the reputations of people mentioned in the book,
prompting the court to rule in favor of a forced implementation of
the injunction.</P>
      <P>The publishers and owners of Way to World Publishing Group were
notified on Tuesday that they are prohibited from printing, selling,
or lending the book and from granting rights of sales of the book
effective immediately.</P>
      <P>Those copies already sold on the market were not included in the
injunction, according to the ruling.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Gloria Chu will have to provide a deposit of NT$2.68
million for the implementation of the injunction.</P>
      <P>Li, in his 40s, comes from a family of scholars with strong
religious and metaphysics backgrounds. He became renowned across the
Taiwan Strait in the early 90s for his expertise in the Chi kung fu
and Fengshui philosophies.</P>
      <P>Married to former Taiwanese television hostess Du Wen, Li was
officially designated a persona non grata by the ROC government a few
years ago and therefore prohibited from entering the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT ECONOMIC ZONE SAID TO BE PREPARATION FOR DIRECT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   15   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed establishment of a
cross-Taiwan Strait special economic zone can be viewed as a
preparatory move toward the opening of the three direct links between
Taiwan and mainland China, said Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Vice Chairman Schive Chi on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As setting up such a zone would also require an adequate
government policy to deal with the new economic situation across the
strait after the two sides join the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Schive said he agrees with the view that the proposed economic zone
is really an interim move toward the opening of the direct trade,
post and transport links between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>"More precisely, you can consider it a preparatory move prior to
the establishment of the three direct links," Schive said at a public
hearing sponsored by New Party lawmaker Lai Shi-pao on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, the CEPD vice chairman also explained that distinct
areas of the special economic zone would be set up individually on a
gradual basis. "It is out of the question that various sections would
be opened simultaneously," he stated.</P>
      <P>The proposed cross-strait special economic zone was recently put
forth by Vice President Lien Chan, the ruling Kuomintang's candidate
in Taiwan's March 18 presidential race, with an aim to deal with
changes between Taiwan and mainland China after the two sides join
the WTO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still forbids direct links with the mainland at present,
but may be required to lift the ban following its accession to the
global trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the idea of establishing such an economic zone is
just wishful thinking by Taiwan to deal with bilateral economic
exchanges that are set to undergo fundamental changes following the
two sides' WTO entry, Lai argued that it will be better for Taiwan to
fully open direct transport ties with the mainland rather than just
point-to-point links under the proposed special economic zone.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang presidential
candidate Lien Chan's mainland policy would protect the Republic of
China's sovereignty and dignity, said Lien's campaign manager on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Jason Hu, who left his post as ROC foreign minister recently to
accept his current position, made the remark while meeting with a
visiting delegation of journalists from Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>He said that Lien will formally announce his policy toward
mainland China this month, and pointed out that the policy will
stress the protection of the ROC's sovereignty and dignity.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that President Lee Teng-hui's description of
cross-Taiwan Strait ties as a "special state-to-state" relationship
last July was just a statement of fact, and should not be interpreted
as pushing for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>When asked about the relationship between Lee and Lien, which has
been the subject of much speculation, Hu noted that Lee strongly
supports Lien and is willing to do anything that is helpful to Lien's
election campaign.</P>
      <P>He said that if Lien wins the March 18 election, the future
operations of the Kuomintang will take on a new shape.</P>
      <P>Hu described the party's Lien-Siew ticket as the best pair to
lead Taiwan due to their administrative experiences and policies. He
predicts they will garner 45 percent to 50 percent of the vote.</P>

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan is the best among
the three main presidential candidates in terms of handling
diplomatic affairs and has most clearly stated his foreign policy,
said Foreign Affairs Minister Chen Chien-jen on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when asked to compare the foreign policies
of the three top candidates -- Lien of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
independent candidate James Soong -- by a visiting media group from
Hong Kong and Macau, who arrived here Monday on a six-day visit to
observe the atmosphere before Taiwan's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen said that most people in Taiwan have knowledge of Lien's
diplomatic background and his statements regarding foreign policy, as
they are aware that he has served as ambassador to El Salvador
(1975-76) and foreign affairs minister (1988-90).</P>
      <P>He also said that neither candidate Chen nor Soong have fully
disclosed their positions on foreign policy.</P>
      <P>The foreign affairs minister said that people have only a vague
understanding of Chen's stance on diplomatic issues, adding that the
charter of the DPP states clearly that it wants to establish a
Republic of Taiwan, although the party has made adjustments in its
campaign strategy to woo more voters.</P>
      <P>Chen has been a lawyer and legislator and later served as Taipei
mayor, but his experience, knowledge, and views on diplomatic policy
are no comparison to those of Lien, the foreign minister said.</P>
      <P>The head of the Foreign Ministry said that Soong has served in
various posts in the KMT and the Presidential Office and has not even
dabbled in diplomatic work. Though his knowledge of foreign affairs
may be better than that of Chen, he too is still a far cry from Lien.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new president will affect Taiwan's bid to join
the United Nations, which has suffered its seventh consecutive blow
since 1993, Chen said that if Lien is elected, there is no question
that there will be no change in this aspect.</P>
      <P>In fact, said Chen, no matter who is elected, the campaign for
Taiwan to join the UN will continue.</P>
      <P>He also said his understanding is that candidate Chen has
advocated that Taiwan step up its efforts to join the UN, while Soong
believes that the bid is worthwhile, but should not be pushed too
aggressively.</P>
      <P>The visiting media group will also call on Premier Vincent Siew,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Su Chi and the headquarters of the
three leading candidates; visit Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park; and travel to central Taiwan to gain a deeper understanding of
the post-quake reconstruction in the wake of the devastating Sept. 21
temblor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER LI AO REPORTEDLY NOMINATED FOR NOBEL PRIZE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Party presidential candidate Li Ao was
reportedly nominated for the 2000 Nobel Prize in literature based on
his role as a devout idealist and prolific author, sources from the
New Party said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The New Party on Tuesday hosted a party to celebrate both Li's
nomination for the prestigious award and the debut of the English
version of his book "The Martyrs' Shrine."</P>
      <P>At the event, Li, a true maverick who served more than seven
years in prison for political dissent, said he had been ignored and
even "squeezed out" of Taiwan's literary circles for a long time and
was almost forgotten before he joined the presidential race.</P>
      <P>Now, Li said, he is encouraged and overwhelmed by being nominated
for the Nobel Prize, which is a confirmation of his contributions to
writing and idealism, two aspects he feels are essential for such
recognition. Li believes he is now at a point of moving beyond the
island and into the global literary community.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the festivities, Sisy Chen, formerly the chief
information officer of the Democratic Progressive Party and a close
friend of Li, lauded him as a prominent historian, an author and an
idealist, which she said qualify him to be nominated for the
prestigious award.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-hua, a New Party heavyweight, said the party has been
honored that Li is willing to run for the presidency representing the
New Party -- an uphill battle for the small group which has received
only low levels of approval and support ratings so far in all public
opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Li, 65, has written more than 130 books and was imprisoned for
seven years and 4 months, including 14 months of house arrest,
between 1970 and 1978.</P>
      <P>His latest book, "The Martyrs' Shrine," which is a novel, was
recently translated into English by Oxford Publishing Co.'s Hong Kong
branch. The English version is to presented as the representative of
all his works to the Nobel Prize authorities in Sweden for
consideration for the award.</P>

      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum
Corporation's Tuesday announcement that it will increase gasoline
prices by 2.72 percent will not bring about inflationary pressure,
said the Directorate-General for Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS).</P>
      <P>An official with the Cabinet-level DGBAS projected that as a
direct result of the increase in gasoline prices, this year's overall
retail and wholesale prices for all goods will rise by only
0.11 percent and 0.13 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he noted, this year's rise in overall retail prices
will amount to 2 percent or 2.1 percent over those of last year. In
1999, retail prices rose only 0.18 percent from the previous year's
level.</P>
      <P>However, the official predicted, consumers' purchasing power will
not be affected by the 2 percent retail price hike this year because
pay raises for public and private employees are expected to surpass

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY'S LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE FINALLY RISES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The labor participation rate of Taipei City
citizens was registered at 56.25 percent for 1999, reflecting an
increase of 0.1 percent over the previous year, according to
municipal government figures.</P>
      <P>The labor participation rate (LPR) refers to the percentage of
people over 15 who are willing to join the labor market.</P>
      <P>Figures released by the Department of Budget, Accounting &amp;
Statistics (DBAS) under the Taipei municipal government indicate that
after years of decline, the city's LPR is now showing the first signs
of increase, which the department says is a result of women's
increased willingness to join the labor force.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, said DBAS officials, though the labor market
in Taipei still suffers from a lack of "the right employees in the
right places," job placement through the city government's Employment
Service Center (ESC) has made what they called a break-through with a
success rate of over 10 percent for its services. That figure
represents the ESC's achievements, added the officials.</P>
      <P>Taipei's LPR continuously declined to 56.15 percent in 1998 from
57.95 percent in 1995.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the city's LPR for men continued its downward tendency,
dropping to 65.83 percent from the previous year's 66.04 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the LPR for women in Taipei jumped to 47.45 percent last
year from 47.04 percent in 1998, leading the general rebound by the
city's overall LPR.</P>
      <P>DBAS officials said that the LPR represents the citizens'
willingness, in general, to join the labor market, which in turn
reflects prospects for the job market.</P>

      <P>Despite widespread speculation, it will not
be easy for the Vatican and Beijing to reach a compromise on the
establishment of diplomatic ties, said Foreign Affairs Minister Chen
Chien-jen on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although the Holy See and Beijing have been seeking to reach
agreement on the issue for the past 20 years, Chen said it will be
difficult for the two sides to achieve their goals in the short term
due to their different basic stances.</P>
      <P>The Vatican currently maintains formal diplomatic ties with
Taipei, and the Republic of China government is very concerned about
the development of bilateral links between the Vatican and Beijing,
Chen told a group of visiting journalists from Hong Kong and Macau,
who expressed grave concern over extensive media reports that the
Vatican and Beijing may soon establish official relations.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, it will take some time to observe the
situation because the Holy See and communist China still remain
widely divided over the future of the Catholic Church in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>As for the speculation that Beijing will set up formal diplomatic
ties with the Vatican modeled on the so-called "Vietnam pattern,"
Chen said that arrangement is neither a fixed nor complete practice

      <P>The Washington Post published a letter
on Tuesday from an official of the Japanese Embassy in Washington,
D.C., admitting the historical fact of the "Nanking Massacre" by
Japanese Imperial forces in Nanking, China, during World War II.</P>
      <P>The letter, which was signed by Kazuo Kodama, public affairs
minister at the embassy, also denied reports that Japan has
eliminated this historical fact from its textbooks.</P>
      <P>Kodama further said that the organizers of a Jan. 24 conference
in Osaka, which was called to denounce the "lie" of the massacre, do
not represent the position of the Japanese government, adding that
the organizers' stance also does not conform with the opinions of the
majority of the Japanese people.</P>
      <P>The letter states that the massive slaughter and pillage carried
out by Japanese Imperial forces in Nanking during World War II is "an
undeniable fact." Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and other
Japanese officials have expressed the same stance.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government uses textbooks to educate the younger
generation about the "damage and suffering" caused by Japan's
invasion of its neighboring countries, Kodama said.</P>

announced on Tuesday that a group of 74 air force officers, including
Air Force Commander in Chief Gen. Chen Chao-min, have been punished as
a result of security breaches.</P>

Six of the alleged thieves were captured on Feb. 6.</P>
      <P>Chen received a demerit for neglecting his supervisory
responsibilities, while seven other high-ranking air force officers
each received two minor demerits, including Deputy Commander-in-Chief
Lt. Gen. Liu Kuei-li, Director of the Political Warfare Department of

      <P>Lien, who is also the presidential candidate of the ruling
Kuomintang, made the remarks at a New Year dinner party hosted by the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) for representatives of Taiwan
investors on the mainland.</P>
      <P>He added that even the government's existing "no haste, be
patient" mainland investment policy could be adjusted flexibly under
the principles of sincerity, goodwill, and reciprocity so as to
create a win-win situation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long rejected mainland China's call to allow direct
cross-strait trade, postal and shipping links out of national
security considerations. Moreover, it also limits each individual
mainland investment to no more than US$50 million.</P>
      <P>Lien said that both sides' entry into the world trade regulatory
body will represent a turning point for improved cross-strait
relations, and that both Taiwan and the mainland should address the
situation.</P>
      <P>He described mainland China's promulgation of regulations for the

he added that it has not gone far enough, and that only a
Taiwan-mainland agreement can provide the best protection for Taiwan
businesses operating on the mainland.</P>

peaceful cross-strait climate and turn a new page in cross-strait

      <P>The SEF chairman and Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland,

Government Information Office (GIO) official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>GIO Director-General Chao Yi noted that a record 1,825 booths
from 45 countries will have a presence at the book extravaganza, with
India, Estonia and Egypt as first-time participants.</P>
      <P>The fair is the largest in Asia, and the fourth-largest in the
world, next only to the Frankfurt and Bologna fairs and the Book Expo
of America.</P>
      <P>The theme this year will be Britain, with a special "British
Pavilion" which will introduce British books, films and literary
figures.</P>
      <P>Adrian Soar, chairman of the British Publisher's Association,
said that there are similarities between Britain and Taiwan, as both
are island nations who have had to learn to face their much bigger
neighbors.</P>
      <P>Some 21 publishers from Britain will display more than 1,000
volumes, Soar said, adding that although the nation faces ever
steeper competition from the United States, it is the birthplace of
such masters as William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens, with 100,000
new books published last year alone.</P>
      <P>The GIO will also launch a pictorial book to introduce Taiwan on
opening day of the exhibition which will run through Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>The pictorial tells the story of Taiwan in 33 short stories
written by experts and scholars in their own fields, punctuated with
nearly 1,000 magnificent photos presenting Taiwan's "real face" and
its distinctive features.</P>
      <P>In addition, the manga exhibition which was so popular last year
has been expanded this year, and many heavyweight manga artists have
been invited from Japan to meet local readers.</P>
      <P>Established local writers will be another focus this year, and a
series of films and seminars will be held, some of which will be
attended by the writers themselves.</P>
      <P>In another innovative departure from previous shows, visitors
bored with browsing or stricken with culture overload will be able
to visit a specially constructed "insect zone" featuring an exhibit
of 2,000 fireflies and hundreds of butterflies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US LAWMAKER: US WOULD ACT IN CASE OF ATTACK ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington would not stand with its hands
folded if Taiwan is intimidated by Beijing's military before the
island's second popular presidential election, former US Congressman
Stephen Solarz claimed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Beijing lobbed missiles into waters near Taiwan in 1996 when the
island was bracing for its last presidential election, in an attempt
to influence the outcome of the polling.</P>
      <P>As a result, Washington dispatched two aircraft carrier battle
groups to the Taiwan Strait as a precautionary measure.</P>
      <P>Solarz, who arrived in Taiwan last week for a conference of the
non-government organization, the International Crisis Group (ICG),
warned Beijing at a press conference that any military threat against
Taiwan similar to the one in 1996 will invoke a reaction from
Washington.</P>
      <P>He said Washington's solidarity with Taiwan lies in their common
advocacy of democracy, and added that a free presidential election is
a vital part of democracy.</P>
      <P>Solarz attributed Taiwan's democratic development to local
democracy activists, especially those who gave up their lives and
assets for the democratic cause. He also attributed the development
to the willingness of the island's rulers to relax their grip on
power and permit the existence of opposition parties, as well as on
the island's numerous international allies who have supported the
island's push for democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>In response to a reporter's question on election ethics, Solarz,
who was awarded the Brilliant Star Medal with Grand Cordon by
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on Monday to honor his
long-standing support for the island, said he does not think there is
any wrong in Lee endorsing his KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan,
because it is common for an outgoing head of state to stump for his
favorite candidate.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the ICG, an international organization set up five
years ago to defuse regional crisis, concluded its two-day conference
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Its president, Gareth Evans, the former Australian foreign
minister, told a press conference organized after the meeting that
they held the conference in Taipei simply because the Taipei
authorities offered to finance and host the event, and had nothing to
do with the island's ongoing presidential elections or its relations
with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The focus of the conference was on the tense standoff between
military and civil groups and the fierce religious strife in
Indonesia, added Evans.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian research has shown that smoking
and drinking indeed go hand in hand, because nicotine spurs the
desire for alcohol.</P>
      <P>A team of scientists at the University of Toronto's Center for
Addiction and Mental Health said studies in laboratory rats show that
nicotine, in the form of tobacco, increases cravings for alcoholic
beverages.</P>
      <P>It's no medical revelation that alcohol and cigarettes are often
consumed at the same time. But many more alcoholics smoke than those
in the general public, said Dzung Anh Le, a senior scientist on the
team.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIBERIAN PRESIDENT TO VISIT ROC FEB. 21-26</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Liberian President Charles Ghankay Taylor
is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan on Feb. 21 for a six-day state
visit, sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taylor, on his third official visit to the Republic of China,
will be accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Monie R. Captan and
Public Construction Minister Emmett Taylor.</P>
      <P>The Liberian head of state is expected to meet with President Lee
Teng-hui and to sign a joint communique for closer bilateral ties
between the two countries, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>Taylor first visited Taiwan in February 1997 in his capacity as a
"member of the Collective Presidency of Liberia."</P>
      <P>He again came to Taiwan in November of the same year as the
president of Liberia. During that visit, he reached a consensus with
the ROC government that the two countries would hold annual mixed
commission meetings alternately in Monrovia and Taipei in an effort
to further bolster bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>The first mixed commission meeting was held in Monrovia in April
1998 while the second opened in Taipei on June 15, 1999.</P>
      <P>Taylor originally planned to visit Taipei in October 1999, mainly
to attend the ROC's Double Ten National Day celebrations. But the
visit was suspended after Taipei canceled most of the celebration
activities after Taiwan was hit on Sept. 21 by its deadliest
earthquake of the century.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FMD SPREADS FROM CATTLE TO GOATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Changhua,   central   Taiwan,   Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By  Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of
Agriculture (COA) on Wednesday decided to slaughter all 228 head of
goats on a ranch in Changhua's Fangyuan Township after 22 newborns
had died in succession since Feb. 7.</P>
      <P>COA quarantine officials confirmed on Wednesday that the O-strain
virus collected from the deceased kids was 99.4 percent similar to
that found in cattle in the southern county of Chiayi where the most
recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was reported among
cattle in January.</P>
      <P>The confirmation marked the first FMD outbreak among Taiwan's
goat population in decades, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>The COA and the Changhua County government announced an
across-the-board quarantine and sterilization of all cloven-hoofed
animal ranches around Changhua, the second largest region in Taiwan
where goat ranches are located.</P>
      <P>The officials also called for ranch operators in the region,
where about 40,000 head of goats are raised, to see to it that all
their farm animals are properly vaccinated in order to prevent the
spread of the deadly FMD.</P>
      <P>According to the owner, surnamed Hung, of the Fangyuan ranch
where 22 kids died over the past week, none of the kids nor nanny
goats on the ranch had received vaccinations.</P>
      <P>According to COA officials, more than 90 percent of Taiwan's
cattle and hog population has been vaccinated, but only some 40
percent of deer and 60 percent of goats around the island have
received vaccinations.</P>
      <P>The O-strain virus caused an outbreak of FMD last June among
cattle on Kinmen island, where the smuggling of agricultural and
livestock products from mainland China is widespread.</P>
      <P>The FMD epidemic among Taiwan's pigs in March 1997 led to the
slaughter of tens of thousands of the animals and dealt a devastating
blow to the country's pork exports, prompting the COA to order an
across-the-board vaccination at all hog farms.</P>
      <P>In July 1999, the COA adopted its containment policy after FMD
cases among cattle were reported.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, about 26,000 head of cattle, or some 20 percent of
the country's total of 130,000, have been affected or slaughtered
after being confirmed of having been infected with FMD.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Liberal International (LI) Congress and
the general meeting of the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats
(CALD) are scheduled to be held simultaneously in Taipei Feb. 18-20,
sources from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>More than 70 representatives from 20-odd countries and areas are
expected to take part in the three-day LI Congress -- the first of
its kind ever to be held in Asia, according to Hsiao Mei-chin,
director of the DPP's Department of International Affairs.</P>
      <P>In addition to the congress and meeting, a roundtable forum on
party politics and democratic development will also be held during
the session, Hsiao noted.</P>
      <P>Both DPP presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian and his running
mate Annette Lu are expected to deliver speeches to the forum, Hsiao
added.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung is expected to give a keynote speech
on the morning of Feb. 18 to kick off the LI Congress and CALD
meeting.</P>
      <P>During their stay in Taiwan, LI and CALD representatives from
around the world will meet with ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Chen
Chien-jen and observe the campaign activities of the DPP, said Hsiao.</P>
      <P>The Liberal International, one of the three major international
political party groups in the world, currently has 55 member
countries and 26 other countries and areas with observer status.
Taiwan's DPP joined the LI in 1994 as an observer.</P>
      <P>The DPP, meanwhile, is one of the founding members of the CALD,
which currently has eight members from around Asia.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, LI representatives have passed resolutions at
many of their congresses and general meetings calling for Beijing to
renounce the use of force against Taiwan and supporting the right of
the people of Taiwan to decide their own future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ANALYSIS CONCLUDES CHINA MAY BE WILLING TO USE FORCE AGAINST US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The disturbing conclusion to an
analysis by a renowned American think tank is that Communist China,
despite an awareness of its relative weakness, might nevertheless be
willing to use force against the United States or in a way that runs
a major risk of US involvement, seeking primarily to achieve a
political effect.</P>
      <P>In a 106-page study on "Patterns in China's Use of Force:
Evidence from History and Doctrinal Writings" for the US Air Force,
Rand Corporation analysts Mark Burles and Abram N. Shulsky wrote that
one can easily imagine circumstances in which the Communist Chinese
might believe such a political effect could be obtained.</P>
      <P>The most obvious cases would deal with Taiwan and would seek to
exploit the ambiguities in the US commitment to defend the island,
especially under circumstances in which a Taiwanese action could be
viewed as having precipitated the crisis. "In such a case, Chinese
use of force could be directed toward affecting US policy and driving
a wedge between Taiwan and the United States," said the authors.</P>
      <P>Force could also be used to influence the political situation in
Taiwan. By raising fears of a major military action, mainland China
might hope to exacerbate tensions on the island between those willing
to run major risks for eventual independence and those who do not
wish to change the status quo, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Other possibilities for mainland Chinese use of force are more
remote, said the analysis. "One could imagine Chinese military
actions in the South China Sea in support of its territorial claims.
While this could easily involve minor incidents, it is more difficult
to imagine how a major clash between the United States and China
might result."</P>
      <P>The authors are convinced that in any conflict or potential
conflict with the United States, China, understanding that it is
generally the weaker party, would have to look for asymmetric
strategies that would provide leverage against the US and exploit its
vulnerabilities, while preventing it from bringing its superior force
to bear.</P>
      <P>Beijing would seek to create a "fait accompli," they said,
thereby forcing Washington, if it wished to reinstate the status quo,
to escalate the level of tension and violence. China would then count
on the pressure of "world public opinion," the general disinclination
to see profitable economic relationships disrupted, and US public
opinion to constrain the US in this situation.</P>
      <P>In support of this goal, the authors added, mainland China would
seek to suppress the US ability to project substantial military
resources into the theater of conflict for a limited time, either by
information warfare attacks or by missile attacks, or the threat of
them, on ports, airfields, transit points, bases, or other key
facilities in the Western Pacific.</P>
      <P>Beijing could also seek to cause US casualties to influence US
public opinion. The analysis said US forces did withdraw after
suffering unexpected casualties in such places as Somalia and
Lebanon.</P>
      <P>Finally, Beijing could seek to exploit the fact that the United
States was dealing with a crisis elsewhere in the world. For example,
the authors said China could act against Taiwan at a time when the
United States had made major deployments to the Persian Gulf.</P>
      <P>But the authors noted that China usually took risks in the past
when it could count on some support from one superpower against
another. Even in 1969, before the Sino-US rapprochement, Beijing
gained some benefit from the superpower rivalry. The Soviet Union had
to fear that the US might exploit any opportunity created by a major
war between the USSR and China.</P>
      <P>The analysis pointed out that "the US status as a sole superpower
reduces China's maneuvering room, which helps explain the Chinese
preference for multi-polarity."</P>

    <HEADLINE>IOC TO INTRODUCE BLOOD TESTING WITH NO NOTICE TO ATHLETES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Olympic Committee will
introduce blood testing to detect the presence of
performance-enhancing drugs with no notice given to the more than
10,000 athletes participating in the games as soon as the test is
approved by proper authorities.</P>
      <P>Dick Pound, the IOC's vice president and chairman of the World
Anti-Doping Agency, told reporters on Tuesday that erythropoietin and
human growth hormone were already on the banned list and he would not
give cheating athletes any indication when the tests might be
implemented.</P>
      <P>"We are not proposing to tell anyone. If there is suddenly a
whole spate of people testing positive that is when they will find
out -- athletes know they shouldn't be taking it and they have been
warned many times," he said.</P>
      <P>"I don't feel the slightest compunction to tell them what dates
we will start testing, I am quite happy to have that uncertainty
exist. If it is approved before the Games, halfway through the Games
or whenever, then that is when we will act," he added.</P>
      <P>Athletes have agreed to urine and blood testing by signing forms
that state the conditions of their participation in the Olympic Games
in Sydney in mid-September this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKES RATTLE TAIWAN AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two perceptible earthquakes rocked parts of
southern Taiwan on Wednesday morning, reawakening among residents in
the region the fear of a devastating earthquake.</P>
      <P>According to the Seismology Center of the Central Weather Bureau,
the first temblor measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale occurred at 5:33
a.m., with its epicenter about 21.1 km south of Mount Ali at a depth
of 9.2 km.</P>
      <P>At 8:06 a.m. a second tremor, this one with a magnitude of 4.5,
was detected with its epicenter 20.5 km south of Mount Ali at a depth
of 13.4 km.</P>
      <P>The first quake had an intensity of 5 in nearby Taoyuan Township
of Kaohsiung County. Other places, including Minchien of Nantou
County, Kukeng of Yunlin County, Mount Ali of Chiayi County, Chiayi
City and Nanhsi of Tainan County all recorded an intensity of 4.</P>
      <P>The quake was felt as far away as Taitung and Hualien cities in
eastern Taiwan, Taichung City in central Taiwan and Makung City on
offshore Penghu Island, according to seismologists.</P>
      <P>Lu Pei-ling, deputy director of the Seismology Center, said she
believes the two quakes were aftershocks from the catastrophic
7.3-magnitude earthquake of Sept. 21, which killed at least 2,300
people, injured about 8,800 and left some 100,000 others temporarily
homeless in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, she described the quakes as "benign" movement of the
earth's crust which helped release pent-up pressure accumulated under
the tectonic plates beneath Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She also warned that further aftershocks, measuring as high as 6
on the Richter scale, could very likely occur over the next few days,
given the fact that 24 aftershocks were detected immediately after
the two major jolts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US WILL ASSIST TAIWAN IN CASE OF CRISIS: FORMER US LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will not sit idly by if
Taiwan is intimidated by mainland China in the runup to the island's
March 18 presidential election, former US Congressman Stephen Solarz
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan plays a critical role in the security of the Asian
region, Solarz said he believes that the United States will take
adequate measures to protect the security of the Taiwan Strait should
Taiwan be threatened.</P>
      <P>Solarz also expressed confidence that whoever is elected Taiwan's
next president will deal with cross-strait affairs rationally. He
added that after the election, both Taiwan and mainland China should
rekindle efforts to build mutual trust and find a peaceful resolution
to the current disputes.</P>
      <P>Solarz, who currently serves as vice president of the
International Crisis Group (ICG), made the remarks in response to
reporters' questions following an hour-long meeting with Chen
Shui-bian, presidential candidate of the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan has been transformed into a democracy, the
international community should respect its needs, the former US
congressman said, adding that the ICG has also called on Beijing to
forswear the use of military force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Praising Taiwan's "economic miracle" and the forthcoming
"political miracle" that will come about with the current

      <P>Former Singapore Prime Minister Lee

of the Taiwan Strait will not occur.</P>
      <P>At a forum sponsored by a local university, he said the United

erupts over the Taiwan independent announcement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan knows that its independence movement will not achieve

the same position as the current Clinton Administration toward the

added that their characters will have an important impact on future

      <P>Lee also claimed that mainland China's military development will

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei and Ottawa should strengthen two-way
economic and cultural exchanges, visiting Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
said here on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As the mayor of Taipei, Taiwan's largest city, Ma said he has the
responsibility to promote Taipei's exchanges with foreign cities to
help upgrade the living standards of Taipei's citizens.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while addressing a party held in his honor.
The event, sponsored by Fang Chin-yen, Republic of China
representative to Canada, was attended by around 70 figures from the
local media, political sectors, and the Chinese community.</P>
      <P>Offering thanks for the warm reception accorded to him, Ma said
he had met with his Ottawa counterpart and had invited Ottawa to send
representatives to take part in a world information technology
seminar slated to take place in Taipei in June.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, he also met with trade officials from the Ottawa
municipal government for discussions on bilateral cooperation on
software technology.</P>
      <P>Taipei should have the ambition to become a "southern silicon
valley," as Ottawa, home to more than 800 hi-tech companies, boasts
of being the "northern silicon valley," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The mayor, who flew into Ottawa from Toronto earlier on Tuesday
and was scheduled to proceed to Vancouver on Wednesday, said he will
suggest that the three Canadian cities conduct a "resident artists"
program which would consist of exchanges between Canadian artists and
high school students and their Taipei counterparts.</P>
      <P>Under the sponsorship of the program, writers, photographers,
painters, and students in the three Canadian cities and Taipei would
be able to live in either country for a certain period of time in
order to gain a deeper understanding of different cultures and widen
their horizons, Ma added.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival at the Ottawa airport, he told CNA that he has
been promoting the "resident artists" program with several
world-class cities, and that his Toronto counterpart has shown an
interest in the project.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, a group of Toronto councilors are scheduled to
visit Taipei in March to further boost bilateral technical, economic
and cultural activities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang on Wednesday formally
filed a lawsuit against independent presidential candidate and former
KMT Secretary-General James Soong, accusing him of embezzling party
funds.</P>
      <P>KMT lawyer Chang Nai-liang said that Soong embezzled NT$360.8
million (US$12 million) from party funds when he was party
secretary-general, transferring the money into a family account.</P>
      <P>Soong's sister-in-law, Chen Pi-yun, and an aide, Yang Yun-dai,
were also accused of faking documents which allegedly were used to
effect the transaction, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Soong has denied the accusation.</P>
      <P>Before filing the lawsuit, KMT spokesman Huang Hui-chen described
the decision to sue Soong as "bitter," but said that the party is
just trying to seek justice and claimed it is "not trying to taint
Soong's presidential bid."</P>
      <P>Once the money is returned, according to Huang, the KMT will
spend it on public welfare.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT's lawyer, Soong stands accused of faking a
seal and documents in violation of criminal law, and could be
sentenced to up five years in prison.</P>
      <P>Another KMT lawyer, Chung Po-lin, said that after the case is
settled, the KMT will withdraw NT$240 million of the money which
Soong tried to return and deposited at the Taipei District Court
following KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui's refusal to accept it.</P>
      <P>The party also lodged a civil suit to demand NT$120 million
"compensation" from Soong.</P>
      <P>Soong was expelled by the KMT last November for deciding to run

    <HEADLINE>MOEA REASSERTS TAIPEI'S BOTTOM LINE FOR WTO ACCESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's bottom line in its bid to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is that Taipei and Beijing must enter
the body at the same time, a senior official of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOEA Vice Minister Lin Yi-fu made the remarks in answer to
reporters' questions during a meeting sponsored by the Taipei
Import-Export Association in which he gave an address on the impact
of WTO membership on Taiwan industry.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that both sides expect to enter the world trade
regulatory body between June and July this year. However, he went on,
should Beijing's entry not be as smooth as expected, both sides'
accession will have to be postponed until the latter half of 2000.</P>
      <P>Lin added that if Taipei cannot be allowed to access the WTO
ahead of Beijing, the two sides should at least gain membership at
the same time.</P>
      <P>Since most of Taiwan's industrial products have already been
liberalized, WTO admission will not have much ill effect on the
island's industrial sector, said Lin, who pointed out that as Taiwan
is a trade-oriented country, WTO membership will in fact benefit the
island's industries.</P>
      <P>In the agricultural sector, the island's entry to the
Geneva-based world trade regulatory body will inevitably have some
effect on agricultural products in the initial stages of membership,
Lin continued, but he stressed that the government will do its best
to open its agricultural market as slowly as possible.</P>
      <P>As for the service sector, he went on, an opening of the service
market will benefit Taiwan's goal of becoming a business operations
hub in the Asian-Pacific area.</P>

      <P>The Nantou County

of Kuanghua Isle for the small island in Sun Moon Lake, and will
officially announce the change Feb. 19, the day of the Lantern

      <P>The name Lalu Isle was originally used by an aboriginal tribe

name Lalu Isle after a temple on the island was destroyed by the

      <P>Taiwan's booming economy is expected to
last into 2001, said an economics official on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development under the Executive Yuan, told a symposium organized by
the Chinese National Federation of Industries that thanks to rapidly
expanding Internet-related and hi-tech industries, the economy is
anticipated to post a 6.5 percent expansion rate in 2000, well beyond
the government's official 6.1 percent target.</P>
      <P>This expected upswing is also backed by growing export orders and
the booming local real-estate market, said the government's chief of

      <P>He told the labor leaders attending the symposium that the
government is pushing to create a more open, free, and prosperous

      <P>The Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MOTC) has decided to postpone the inauguration of
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport's second terminal until
mid-March.</P>
      <P>Chang Chia-chu, the vice MOTC minister, said that the decision
was made on Wednesday afternoon after a fifth rehearsal was held,
which led to the realization that several faults still require
correction.</P>
      <P>The terminal was originally scheduled to begin operations on Feb.
26.</P>
      <P>Because several faults were found, and due to the "political
sensibility" of the presidential election in March, the ministry has
decided to postpone the inauguration until the middle of that month
in order to carry out the necessary corrections, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the construction of the second terminal is 97.8
percent complete. As the presidential election will be held on March
18, the MOTC wants to correct all the faults so that the facility can
be opened in perfect condition.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the ministry proposed the one-month period until March
16 to re-examine the terminal and make the required changes. Once it
passes the re-examination, the MOTC will select a date for the formal
inauguration, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The MOTC originally hoped that the facility would be opened to
passengers on Feb. 26 so as to allow Eva Airways to use the terminal
to operate its new Taipei-Tokyo daily flight.</P>
      <P>The second terminal includes: departure and arrival halls, 10
gates, car parks, duty free shops, internet services, banks, cellular
phone services, insurance sales, car rental, a beauty salon, hotel

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate James
Soong on Wednesday challenged President Lee Teng-hui to undergo a lie
detector test to get at the truth regarding what he called the
trusteeship between them.</P>
      <P>In a response to the ruling Kuomintang's criminal suit against
Soong, which charges that he embezzled party funds by forging
documents, Soong spokesman Liao Wen-chang dared Lee, who is also the
KMT's party chairman, to affirm that whoever of the two fails a
lie-detector test on the matter should withdraw from politics.</P>
      <P>Charging Lee of "lying through his teeth" in accusing Soong of
wrongdoing, Liao asked Lee to appear at a court hearing to contradict
Soong and let the truth be told.</P>
      <P>Although he acknowledged that he has not yet seen an official
copy of the KMT's written complaint, another Soong spokesman, Chen
Liang-chu, said he would like to emphasize Soong's innocence,
claiming that all the funds stored in Soong's secret bank accounts
were legally transferred to Soong by Lee to use for the party's
political missions when Soong served as KMT secretary-general from
1989 to 1993.</P>
      <P>Soong has kept a clear record of the funds, including where they
came from and where they went, and has offered to return the balance
of NT$240 million to the KMT, but it was rejected by the party,
according to Chen. That fact, argued Chen, shows that, far from being
an embezzler, Soong is a dutiful trustee.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chen said, the legal definition of embezzlement is
the conversion to one's own use of another's money or property, of
which the wrongdoer acquired possession lawfully by reason of some
office of employment or position of trust, so therefore, the KMT's
complaint vindicates Soong's claims that there is a trusteeship
between Lee and himself.</P>
      <P>Soong opened bank accounts in the names of the KMT Central
Committee and the KMT-owned Hua Hsia Investment Corporation when he
served as the KMT secretary-general and concurrently as chairman of
Hua Hsia. It was within the scope of his authority to do this, said
Chen, stating that there was no forgery at all.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON ARGUES FOR PASSAGE OF NTR STATUS FOR CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton said
Wednesday he is convinced that Communist China is far more likely to
be a constructive member of the international community if it gets
into the World Trade Organization and makes changes according to its
WTO accession agreement with the United States than if it is denied
entry.</P>
      <P>President Clinton told a White House press conference that he
wants to get the earliest possible congressional vote on the
permanent NTR legislation, saying that "I think if we didn't do this,
we would be regretting it for 20 years."</P>
      <P>When asked if would he rule out a one-year automatic renewal of
China's normal trading status unless Congress disagrees, the
president said he would not support that because in order to get
China into the WTO and for the US to benefit from the terms of the
trade agreement, Beijing has to get permanent normal trading status.</P>
      <P>"This is not a political issue, for me. This is a huge national
security issue, for three reasons," stressed Clinton. First, the
trade agreement offers no increased access to the American markets by
China, but gives Americans dramatically increased access to the
mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Secondly, having China within a rule-based system increases the
likelihood that Beijing will not only follow the rules of the road in
terms of international economy, but that it will cooperate more in
other forums like the United Nations, trying to help reduce rather
than increase the proliferation of dangerous weapons or technology.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, Clinton noted, this WTO agreement will change China from
within more rapidly than all the other economic openings of the past
20 years combined because of the dramatic increase in access to
communications and contact with the outside world that this agreement
portends.</P>
      <P>Clinton added that it is quite interesting that many of the
religious groups that actually have missions operating in mainland
China agree that "what we're doing is the right thing," since one of
the big issues on which Washington has differences with Beijing is in
the repression of political and religious expression. "I think the
substantial majority of opinion in Taiwan agrees that this is the
right thing to do," he said.</P>
      <P>But Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stressed in a House Ways and Means
Committee hearing that on the basis of trade issues alone, Congress
should not surrender its authority to review China's trade status,
saying "Congress should insist that China take steps to implement the
bilateral agreement before permanent normal trade relations is
adopted."</P>
      <P>The congresswoman pointed out that at the same time as Beijing is
negotiating bilateral trade agreements, it is also escalating its
crackdown on peaceful activities in the areas of religion and
internet use, and on any organization perceived to be a threat to
Communist rule.</P>
      <P>She added that China also continues to make the world a more
dangerous place by its cooperation with Pakistan's missile program,
cooperation with Iran and threats against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee,
representatives of human rights groups and trade unions also voiced
their strong opposition to granting China permanent NTR status based
on Beijing's horrible human rights record and disrespect for workers'
basic rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CANDIDATE UNVEILS CAMPAIGN PLATFORM FOR CROSS-STRAIT TIES (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate
Lien Chan unveiled his campaign platform for relations across the
Taiwan Strait on Thursday, promising to catapult cross-strait ties
into a "medium range" stage if he manages to win presidency.</P>
      <P>Lien, also a KMT vice chairman, expounded his cross-strait
ties-related campaign platform at a meeting of the party's mainland
China affairs guidance task force which Lien himself heads.</P>
      <P>Lien, who doubles as the country's incumbent vice president,
said if he wins the March 18 presidential election and mainland
President Jiang Zemin takes concrete action to show goodwill toward
Taiwan, he will endeavor to usher in a new era of cross-strait
cooperation in line with the government's National Unification
Guidelines.</P>
      <P>According to the unification guidelines, the "medium range"
stage of the development of cross-strait relations will be
characterized by cross-strait cooperation based on mutual trust and
the establishment of a peaceful competitive relationship.</P>
      <P>Lien especially mentioned that President Lee Teng-hui's
definition of cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state
relationship" last July is a pragmatic move to define the Republic
of China's status.</P>
      <P>"The definition affirms political realities on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait and also exactly complies with legal facts that the two
sides have been separately ruled and not subject to each other's
jurisdiction since 1949," Lien noted, adding that Beijing should not
interpret it as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>He recalled that the late President Chiang Ching-kuo took the
initiative to allow Taiwan people to visit relatives on the
mainland back in 1987, marking the beginning of civilian
cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>And in 1991, Lien said, President Lee announced the termination
of the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of Communist
Rebellion, a move that opened the door for cross-strait negotiations
and further interaction.</P>
      <P>However, Lien said, Beijing has unilaterally suspended regular
cross-strait dialogue a few years ago. In the face of the dawn of a
new millennium and a new environment, Lien said he sees an urgent
need to take new initiative to break the current cross-strait
impasse.</P>
      <P>"While safeguarding the well-being of our people, we should also
take action to help boost common interests and benefits of both
sides of the Taiwan Strait," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two sides should not continue trapping
themselves in a plight of mutual confrontation or animosity, Lien
said Taiwan and mainland China should work together based on the
principles of "three noes" and "three wants."</P>
      <P>Lien explained that the "three noes" refer to "no unification,
no independence and no confrontation" while the "three wants" refer
to seeking "peace, exchanges and win-win strategy."</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that Taiwan's successful democratization has
nurture Taiwan people's self-confidence and a strong sense of
"being their own master."</P>
      <P>"As the mainstream common sense among local people is to sustain
national survival and development, our mainland policy will be
meaningful only when it can help realize the goal of upgrading
Taiwan's interests and boosting cross-strait rapprochement,"
Lien said, adding he hopes in the new century, there will be no war
in the Taiwan Strait and that Chinese will help Chinese.</P>
      <P>Lien then outlines 10 concrete measures that he, if elected,
will adopt to forge closer cross-strait exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>First of all, Lien said he will push for top mainland envoy Wang
Daohan to visit Taiwan. "We'll also use Wang's visit as a start to
pave the way for a meeting between the top leaders of both sides of
the Taiwan Strait which we hope will eventually lead to the
establishment of a framework for regular cross-strait summit," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Other measures cited by Lien included:</P>
      <P>-- the establishment of parallel official dialogue channels to
facilitate cross-strait cooperation and settlement of bilateral
issues;</P>
      <P>-- easing restrictions on cross-strait investment and trade in
line with the regulations of the World Trade Organization and
negotiating issues related to the opening of direct postal, trade
and transportation links;

(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A fundraising campaign was launched in
Halifax this week for a project spearheaded by a Nova Scotia jazz
musician aimed at helping young Cuban musicians by sending 2,000
instruments to students on the island nation by the year 2002.</P>
      <P>Jeff Goodspeed said he got the idea for the project a few years
ago when he met a music teacher from Cuba who told him about the
plight of young musicians there.</P>
      <P>"Although they have a wonderful education system, probably the
best in the world, they are desperately short of equipment. So it's
not uncommon to see five students sharing one clarinet," the teacher
told him.</P>
      <P>Since then, Goodspeed has delivered about 50 instruments to Cuba
on his own. As he became better acquainted with the Cuban music
community, he came to know a group of 12 teenaged musicians called
Los Primos who toured Nova Scotia two summers ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA COULD POSE FUTURE THREAT TO AUSTRALIA: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The military threat that mainland China
poses to Taiwan today could become a military threat to Australia in
the future as Beijing seeks to boost its military capabilities,
according to a leading American analyst on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an article published by the Australian Financial Review,
Richard D. Fisher Jr., senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation in
Washington, warned that China is building new missiles aimed at
deterring US or Australian intervention on Taiwan's behalf in
preparation for future military action against the island.</P>
      <P>"New variants of the DF-21 medium-range missiles will employ
terminally guided warheads to ensure a successful attack on US forces
in Okinawa. And the new DF-31 ICBMs displayed for the first time last
October can reach Australia or the west coast of the United States,"
said Fisher.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the relationship between Australia and
America has grown through shared sacrifices in war, ranging from
World War Two, the Korean War, and through to the Gulf War. "It would
be tragic for the allies to part company over the growing threat to
Asian stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said.</P>
      <P>Fisher said he was worried after Australia's Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) told Washington to proceed with the
"greatest caution" in deploying missile defenses in Taiwan because it
could further anger Beijing.</P>
      <P>He reminded Australia that "while not recognized by all, the
People's Liberation Army is preparing for war against Taiwan as part
of a broader strategy to force its free people to submit to
unification under Beijing's terms."</P>
      <P>He concluded that "both Australia and the US have stood together
against tyranny for most of the last century. There should be no
illusion that the same tyranny threatening Taiwan today could be
turned against Australia in the future."</P>

and international security, made the remarks during a news briefing
at the New York Foreign News Center on US progress in arms control
and prevention of nuclear proliferation.</P>
      <P>Responding to an inquiry from the Central News Agency concerning
Taiwan's interest in joining the TMD system, Holum first explained
that TMD is basically an installation against missile attacks and is
not a nuclear weapon.</P>
      <P>Holum added that although TMD is still in the research and
development stage, Taiwan has expressed interest in this
sophisticated anti-missile system.</P>
      <P>Noting that TMD may not be ready for deployment until 2007, Holum
said there are still many issues to be considered regarding Taiwan's
participation in the project, such as mainland China's missile
deployment against Taiwan, military buildup and other actions.</P>
      <P>Holum did, however, state that the United States has not ruled
out the possibility of including Taiwan in the TMD system which
focuses on intercepting high-altitude missiles. "We have not ruled
that out," he said.</P>
      <P>Holum, who has been nominated for the position of undersecretary
of state for arms control and international security, also noted that
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is heading a high-profile
delegation to visit mainland China this week.</P>
      <P>According to Holum, the US delegation is composed of senior
officials from the Department of Defense, National Security Council
and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The US delegates are expected to discuss
issues related to arms control and prevention of nuclear
proliferation with mainland officials during their visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'OFFSHORE PEACE ZONES' AN ECONOMIC CONCEPT: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposal initiated by Vice President
Lien Chan to set up "peace zones" on frontline Kinmen and Matsu
Islands is an economic concept aimed at paving the way for a
comprehensive peace zone in the Taiwan Strait, said Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su's remarks came on the heels of the announcement by Lien, the
ruling Kuomintang's candidate in Taiwan's March 18 presidential
election, regarding his policies toward mainland China if elected the
next president.</P>
      <P>In the 10-point statement, Lien proposed enhancing Kaohsiung's
cross-strait offshore transshipment center, establishing special
cross-strait economic zones, opening trade and marine transport links
between mainland China's coastal regions and both Kinmen and Matsu,
and setting up "peace zones" on frontline islands.</P>
      <P>George S.Y. Chen, vice minister of the Transportation and
Communications Ministry (MOTC), voiced the ministry's full support
for Lien's statement by saying that Taiwan will first open direct
sea-traffic ties with mainland China if the government lifts the
decade-old ban on direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport links.</P>
      <P>As long as the government decides to do so, the MOTC will do its
best to help implement the policy, Chen claimed, pointing out that
the precondition put forth in Lien's policies is that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait should first build mutual trust before entering
the mid-term phase of the Guidelines for National Unification -- the
establishment of direct cross-strait trade, transport and post links.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of setting up a special cross-strait free
trade zone inside the complex at Taiwan's southern Kaohsiung Port,
Chen explained that an export processing section of the zone will be
first opened before requiring mainland authorities to open Guangzhou,
Dalian, Shanghai, Qingdao and Tianjin in reciprocity with their
Taiwan counterparts.</P>
      <P>As for the proposed establishment of peace and economic zones on
frontline islands such as Kinmen and Matsu, Chen said the government
has a plan to open Shuitou Port on Kinmen Island to conduct direct
transport with Xiamen Port in Fujian province.</P>
      <P>As Fujian is just opposite from Kinmen across the Taiwan Strait,
Chen said demand for sea traffic will be greater than that for air
traffic between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chang Jong-kung, head of the KMT's Mainland Research Department,
commented that the extent of Lien's proposal to set up peace zones on
frontline Kinmen and Matsu Islands goes beyond that of mainland
China's suggestion to begin with "three mini-links" with those
places, and his plan will serve as an interim move toward the
formation of a larger peace zone in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>If the younger generation on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can
coexist peacefully, it would be a good beginning for promoting the
establishment of such a peace zone in the Strait in future, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA SEEN AS VAST TOURIST MARKET FOR AUSTRALIA; TAIWAN LOOKS BRIGHTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is expected to be a
leading market for the Australian tourism industry, while the number
of tourist arrivals from Taiwan is expected to increase this year
following a decline over the past three, according to the Australian
Tourist Commission (ATC).</P>
      <P>ATC Managing Director John Morse said 98,000 Chinese tourists
visited Australia in 1999, up about 25 percent from the previous
year.</P>
      <P>He attributed the surge of Chinese tourist arrivals to the impact
of Beijing signing an agreement with Canberra last year through which
Australia was designated as one of the few countries Chinese
nationals could visit for "pleasure trips."</P>
      <P>Chinese nationals could only travel to Australia on business or
official trips before the agreement was signed.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese visitors to Australia fell 1.5 percent to
137,438 in the first 11 months of 1999, and the figure for December
represented a drop of 1.8 percent compared to the corresponding
period in 1998, according to the ATC.</P>
      <P>But an ATC spokeswoman told the Central News Agency that more
Taiwanese tourists should visit Australia this year. "We expect a
gradual increase in the number of Taiwanese tourist arrivals this
year," she said.</P>
      <P>She believed the number of Taiwanese tourists going to Australia
will increase by about 7 percent this year to 164,000 from last
year's level. The figure is expected to rise to 251,000 by 2008.</P>
      <P>But the Chinese market is expanding at a quicker pace than that
of Taiwan, according to the ATC forecast.</P>
      <P>Morse predicted the number of Chinese tourists will rise to
520,000 by the year 2008.</P>
      <P>"Ninety-eight thousand visitors is now a bigger market than
Indonesia, bigger than the Philippines, bigger than Thailand," he
said.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Task Force of Australia (TTFA) said it had great hope
for the growth of the Chinese market. "It's a highly regulated
market, so things can go wrong, but if China can hold its nerve, we
can expect 1 million Chinese tourists annually in 10 years," TTFA
managing director Chris Brown said.

    <HEADLINE>KMT DEMANDS 2-WAY DEBATE ON CROSS-STRAIT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for the Kuomintang (KMT)
presidential campaign headquarters once again on Thursday urged the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate to agree to
a two-party debate on cross-Taiwan Strait policy.</P>
      <P>The KMT campaign headquarters formally declared on Wednesday that
KMT candidate Lien Chan prefers a one-on-one debate with DPP
candidate Chen Shui-bian. Lien declined to take part in a forum
debate with participation by all five presidential hopefuls, which
would be sponsored by a coalition of TV stations and newspapers.</P>
      <P>Tsai Cheng-yuan, the spokesman for the Lien campaign
headquarters, for the second time called on DPP's Chen to take on the
two-party tussle, right after Lien announced his cross-strait
platform.</P>
      <P>Tsai commented that Chen's "China policy," which was released
recently, is not pragmatic and its contents are "all in a mess."</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that the purpose of a one-on-one debate is to allow
the candidates of Taiwan's two main political parties have an
in-depth debate over their mainland China policies. If the podium is
to be shared by all five candidates, it would be much like fighting a
skirmish, he said.</P>
      <P>Other factors affecting the KMT's preference for a two-way
debate, Tsai added, are the facts that some of the presidential
hopefuls have not yet made mainland-policy announcements, and in some
cases, the candidate's mainland policy conflicts with the party's
cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>To elevate the quality of the island's presidential election, it
is necessary to hold a one-on-one debate, said Tsai, adding that it
would be a needless bother to hold a public debate if all five
candidates are to participate, as a news conference would be
sufficient to do the job.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HEIGHTENS VIGILANCE AS PRESIDENTIAL RACE ENTERS FINAL COUNTDOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the presidential race entering its
final stages, military, intelligence and law enforcement authorities
have tightened security measures to ensure national security and
social stability in the run-up to the March 18 election.</P>
      <P>Military sources said the armed forces have established an "early
warning" mechanism to monitor any mainland Chinese military
deployment and action and collect local and overseas press reports
concerning combat preparedness on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The mechanism is expected to allow us to offer timely
clarification of any misleading reports or speculation, in order to
prevent our voters from being scared or swayed in the run-up to the
critical election," said an official with the Ministry of National
Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>According to the official, an emergency task force formed by the
government in July 1999 will continue its operations until after the
inauguration of the new president on May 20.</P>
      <P>The panel, named the Yung-An (permanent peace) task force, was
originally installed to handle the escalation of tension in the
Taiwan Strait after President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties
as "a special state-to-state relationship" last July. His statement
angered Beijing and prompted a display of saber-rattling against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MND sources said the Yung-An panel now meets every morning to
review the latest mainland Chinese military deployments and
movements, domestic public opinion and the situation in general.
Every evening, the chief of the general staff personally chairs a
meeting of the Yung-An panel to discuss relevant developments of the
day and work plans for the following day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MND sources said, all military units have heightened
combat preparedness and are ready to react rapidly to any unexpected
situation. Nevertheless, to curb any inappropriate political
speculation, the military will adopt a low-profile approach toward
all routine training programs during the presidential campaign
period.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the National Police
Administration (NPA), more than 1,400 illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants remain unaccounted for on the island, posing a threat to
Taiwan's national security and public order. Police authorities have
stepped up efforts to search for illegal mainland immigrants since
last July.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Immigration has also tightened screening of
mainland residents applying for visits to Taiwan. Intelligence
sources said the number of mainland applicants for entry permits and
the number of mainland visitors who were found to have engaged in
activities not included in their application forms have both
increased.</P>
      <P>The Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice (MJIB)
said it has tightened its monitoring of the activities of 500-plus
mainland visitors who have been found to have conducted activities
incompatible or inconsistent with the purposes stated in their
original entry application forms.</P>
      <P>The NPA and the MJIB have also formed a joint task force to
monitor the activities of "certain individuals" to prevent mainland
Chinese capital and political clout from influencing the election
results.</P>
      <P>In addition, the National Security Bureau has also stepped up its
monitoring of "special political groups," religious activists,
criminal rings and international terrorist groups to prevent them
from sabotaging the election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Coast Guard Administration and police authorities
have intensified a crackdown on smuggling and other maritime criminal
activities.</P>

      <P>Unprotected homosexual intercourse was the

contracted the virus in 1999, the Cabinet-level Department of Health
(DOH) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to a DOH analysis, 40 percent of Taiwan teens who

unprotected intercourse with homosexual partners, ahead of the 27
percent and 12 percent who said they were infected through unsafe sex
in their heterosexual and bisexual relationships, respectively.</P>

cases in Taiwan increased over the 1995-1999 period, with the average
number rising from 20 to 51 per year over that time.</P>

      <P>Lord Douro, chairman of the British Fondation d'Entreprise
Montblanc de la Culture, awarded the foundation's 2000 award to Chen
Ching-huang, who is also chairman of the Hsinkang Foundation of

      <P>This is the first time since its inauguration in 1992 that the

    <HEADLINE>ALL CLOVEN-HOOFED LIVESTOCK IN TAIWAN TO BE VACCINATED WITHIN 10 DAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   17   (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nonplused by another flare-up of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) among Taiwan's livestock, the Council of
Agriculture (COA) has ordered the vaccination of all cloven-hoofed
beasts on the island within ten days.</P>
      <P>In an effort to stamp out the disease once and for all, the COA
has demanded that farmers have all of their cattle, pigs, sheep, deer
and goats inoculated against FMD immediately.</P>
      <P>The sweeping decision was made after the disease hit a farm in
Changhua County, central Taiwan, killing 22 goats. The remaining 200
animals in the herd were destroyed on Wednesday as a precautionary
measure.</P>
      <P>Although this is the first time FMD has been found among the
island's goat population, it has erupted repeatedly among the
island's pigs and cattle since 1997, and agricultural officials are
at the end of their wits as to where the disease originated, and how
to wipe out it.</P>
      <P>Since the rhinoviruses which cause FMD can remain latent for
three years in the systems of water buffalo and oxen, two common work
animals in Taiwan, and in goats for eight to nine months without any
symptoms, the officials said new FMD cases could occur again unless
the mass vaccination is carried out.</P>
      <P>Admitting that they are at loss as to the origin of the virus,
the officials said it could have originated in Taiwan and exist in
the environment, rather than having been transmitted from overseas
through smuggled livestock. They said an all-out vaccination is a
last resort, and a sure method of eliminating the FMD.</P>
      <P>In addition to sterilizing the farm where the FMD was detected on
Wednesday, officials threw a cordon around the affected farm on
Thursday to prohibit movement of any stock.</P>
      <P>A large-scale campaign to raise farmers' awareness of the disease
has also been implemented, and livestock farmers are required to sign
a pledge to have their cloven-hoofed animals inoculated within ten
days. The goat market in Changhua has also been closed for ten days.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew will
deliver an oral administrative report to the Legislative Yuan on
Friday.</P>
      <P>This will be Siew's last administrative report to the legislature
before the March 18 presidential election, because he is the running
mate of the ruling Kuomintang's presidential candidate Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>In his report, Siew will present eight strategies to push forward
the island's "third wave" of reform.</P>
      <P>The eight strategies are: eliminating "black money politics"
through institutionalized power; developing new partnership ties
between the central and local governments; developing Taiwan into an
island of humanity and science-technology; creating new agricultural
life; developing a profound and magnificent culture; developing a
Taiwan Strait peace zone; expanding foreign relations with new
concepts; and pursuing everlasting development for the nation.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-strait relations, Siew will stress
that national security and dignity are the basis for formulating the
nation's mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>He will urge Beijing to replace confrontation with dialogue and
to replace hostility with exchanges, and will note that the "go slow,
be patient" policy regarding Taiwan investment in mainland China is
only a transitional policy, not an unchangeable principle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRUNKEN BRAWL ON PLANE INVOLVING POP STAR LEADS TO FORCED LANDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An EVA Airways flight departing Los Angeles
en route to Taipei had to make a forced landing in Anchorage, Alaska
Thursday after a drunken brawl started by Hong Kong pop singer Ronald
Cheng broke out on board.</P>
      <P>The captain of the EVA Flight BR005, John Irving, landed the
plane, with 365 passengers on board, after deciding that a drunken
brawl in the first-class cabin had gotten out of control, EVA Airways
sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>After Cheng was temporary restrained, with his head bleeding,
Irving discharged 6,000 pounds of fuel in the air and made a detour
to Anchorage for an emergency landing.</P>
      <P>The drunken Cheng, 28, was arrested by Anchorage police and FBI
agents immediately upon the landing. He is being detained for
questioning and is receiving medical treatment, EVA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to crew members on Flight BR005 who arrived in Taipei
at around 9:20 a.m. on Friday, Cheng began to drink heavily soon
after settling into his seat in first-class.</P>
      <P>After several drinks, including a glass of Champaign, several
glasses of Scotch Whiskey, and at least five glasses of Cognac, Cheng
began singing loudly and grasped the arm of Robert Pimentel, an
American who was seated next to Cheng, and shouted to him.</P>
      <P>Pimentel left his seat to tell the crew members that Cheng was
smoking and causing a commotion in the cabin and asked the crew not
to serve Cheng any more alcoholic drinks.</P>
      <P>A stewardess went to speak to Cheng, who then grabbed her by her
hair.</P>
      <P>Sensing the disturbance in the cabin, co-pilot Cheng Meng-lung
approached Cheng to try to restrain him and in turn had his neck
grabbed by Cheng.</P>
      <P>The captain soon entered the fray and was able to put Cheng under
control by striking him in the head with a flash-light, causing
excessive bleeding to the singer's head.</P>
      <P>Cheng was put under police custody at the 6th Avenue Pretrial
Facility in Anchorage. According to FBI sources, as a US citizen,
Cheng could face a prison term of up to 20 years or a maximum fine of
US$250,000 for violently assaulting crew members during flight,
considered a felony under US law.</P>
      <P>The Anchorage court said Cheng, charged with the felony, will not
be released on bail.</P>
      <P>Cheng, a famous pop star in Hong Kong, joined Universal Music and
began to tap the Taiwanese pop music market four years ago. The
rakish singer, who was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan, is as well known for
his hell raising lifestyle as for his music.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI WELCOMES TUVALU'S UN MEMBERSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Friday welcomed the United Nations (UN) Security Council's resolution
Thursday formally admitting the South Pacific nation of Tuvalu as a
full member of the UN.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said the UN admission of Tuvalu, which
maintains formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, is
beneficial to the ROC's bid to join the UN and other international
organizations. Tuvalu was the 27th country out of the 29 nations in
the world which presently have formal diplomatic ties with the ROC to
establish those ties.</P>
      <P>The South Pacific nation of Tuvalu, with a population of 10,000,
won support from the Security Council for its bid to become the 189th
member of the UN Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under the abstention of China, which is one of the five permanent
members of the UN Security Council, the council, by a vote of 14-0,
recommended to the General Assembly that Tuvalu be admitted as a
member.</P>
      <P>Tuvalu, a tiny Pacific nation with a total land area of
approximate 26 square kilometers, including nine coral atolls, and
located 1,000 kilometers north of Fiji, has been an ROC ally since
1979.</P>
      <P>Chen welcomed the development, saying that Tuvalu's admission
means one more voice in the United Nations supporting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tuvalu is expected to formally begin its activities in the UN's
General Assembly in September when it begins convening, noted Chen.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) on
Friday promulgated the names of the five presidential candidates and
announced the official campaign schedule for the March 18 election.</P>
      <P>The CEC announced the five tickets in their drawing orders:
independent presidential candidates James Soong and his running mate
Chang Chao-hsiung, Lien Chan and Vincent Siew of the ruling
Kuomintang, Li Ao and Elmer Fung of the New Party, independent
candidates Hsu Hsin-liang and Chu Huei-liang, and Chen Shui-bian and
Annette Lu of the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Acting CEC Chairman Huang Shih-cheng announced that the 28-day
official campaign period will be from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily between
Feb. 19 and March 17.</P>
      <P>Voters will be able to go to the polls between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.
on March 18, and the CEC estimates that results of the election will
be known by 9 p.m. on the same day.</P>
      <P>Huang said that in order to enhance the general public's
understanding of the platforms of the five presidential tickets, four
TV campaign forums will be held, with the first scheduled for Feb.
20.</P>
      <P>There will be three TV forums for the presidential candidates and
one for the vice presidential candidates. During the forums, the
candidates will each deliver a 30 minute speech outlining their
platforms, but will not field questions from the media.</P>
      <P>The CEC is presently calculating the total number of eligible
voters and will announce the exact number on March 15.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior has calculated the total population
of Taiwan to be 22,106,240 as of the end of January, 2000.</P>
      <P>The CEC estimated that the number of registered voters for the
presidential election will hit 15 million, noting that during the
last nation-wide elections for the Legislative Yuan in 1998, the
number of registered voters totaled 14,961,930 out of a population of
21.1 million.</P>
      <P>The CEC said that if 80 percent of the voters show up at the
polls, then the presidential candidates will be fighting over
approximately 12 million votes, sources said.</P>
      <P>The sources said that judging from the three-way race between
Lien, Soong and Chen, these candidates will try to consolidate the
some 3 million votes of their diehard supporters and win over the 3
million or so voters who have not yet made public which candidate
they will support.</P>
      <P>The sources predicted that it will be a very close race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EARLY ENACTMENT OF TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT URGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned scholar-turned legislator of
Taiwan's main opposition party Thursday urged the earliest possible
enactment of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, stressing that "if
the United States helps Taiwan strengthen its defense capabilities,
Taiwan will be able to support US strategic interests in the
Asia-Pacific region."</P>
      <P>Parris Chang, of the Democratic Progressive Party and convener
for the 1999 session of the ROC Legislative Yuan's Foreign Relations
Committee, wrote in The Washington Times that the Clinton
administration's arguments against the bill, which was overwhelmingly
passed by the House of Representatives recently, are not persuasive
at all.</P>
      <P>The TSEA is needed "precisely because provisions of the Taiwan
Relations Act (of 1979) have not been fully and faithfully
implemented, and because the US government has from time to time
violated outright the spirit and letter of the TRA," said the former
Pennsylvania State University professor.</P>
      <P>He added that "the US government, afraid of offending Beijing,
has delayed and denied numerous weapons procurement requests from
Taiwan, saying that Taiwan does not need the weapons."</P>
      <P>For example, in 1992 the United States finally agreed to sell
F-16s to Taiwan after delaying for 15 years, but these fighter planes
were not equipped with state-of-the-art equipment. The US has also
refused to provide Taiwan with submarines, despite 20 years of
persistent requests from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Pentagon's report, "The Security
Situation in the Taiwan Straits," submitted to Congress last
February, shows that the military balance between mainland China and
Taiwan tips in China's favor. China has spent an enormous amount of
resources modernizing its armed forces over the past decade, and has
deployed M-class missiles targeted at the island that constitute a
clear and immediate threat.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also adopted a quick-strike strategy, featuring
ballistic and cruise missiles to influence Taiwan's people and
leaders, and to gain military superiority.</P>
      <P>"Such a strategy is designed to achieve China's control over
Taiwan before the US can effectively intervene. The United States
must take this into account, which means that Taiwan will need more
and better defensive weapons, including the Theater Missile Defense
(TMD) system," said Chang.</P>
      <P>He added that the US must also review its own capabilities in the
region, and the speed with which its forces are able to respond to
any future PRC provocations. This is because Communist China's
deployment of new missiles is not merely aimed at Taiwan, but is also
directed at American forces in Japan and US warships in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The United States needs to take into account Beijing's grave
strategic challenge, since its new ICBMs, equipped with new small and
multiple nuclear warheads developed with stolen US technology can
reach most places in the United States. "Such a weapon system is
intended to deter US support for Taiwan and project PRC power in
Asia," noted the DPP legislator.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he continued, China is conducting a vigorous campaign
to block US-Japan cooperation on the TMD and the US sale of a missile
defense system to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is imperative that Washington clearly distinguish between
friends and enemies. Taiwan is a democratic state -- its people and
leaders share American values of democracy, freedom and human rights,
and are both willing and able to contribute to the expansion and
consolidation of a growing community of democracies anchoring
international peace, stability and prosperity," said Chang.</P>
      <P>He concluded that "Taiwan is a valuable and constructive member
of the international community worthy of American support. As a real
friend, Taiwan can be a significant strategic asset to the United
States, as both have vital common strategic interests in East Asia."</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign beer brewers from Australia, New
Zealand and other countries have continued losing money heavily in
mainland China, thanks to a notoriously fractured and difficult
market, according to the Australian.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily's correspondent Lynne
O'Donnell reported that Foster's, a leading Australian brewer,
incurred loses of A$6.6 (US$4.4) million last year, after losing
A$8.5 (nearly US$5.7) million in 1998.</P>
      <P>Foster's continued to loss money despite selling two of its three
breweries in mainland China, one in Tianjin and the other in
Guangzhou, in an attempt to reduce its loss-making operations. It now
only has one brewery located in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The actual per capita consumption of beer by mainland Chinese
actually hovers at just under 14 liters a year, or about half of the
world average, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WILL NOT AMEND LAWS RELEVANT TO TIES WITH PRC: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China is
not presently considering amending any laws relevant to ties and
exchanges between Taiwan and mainland China, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin reiterated that the government has no plans to revise the
Constitution, nor to include President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" in the
Constitution, and certainly has no intention of making any effort to
address the "state-to-state special relations" concept advocated by
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>A DPP proposal to create a unique law to be used to deal with all
issues arising from exchanges between people from the two sides, is
believed to be a scheme aimed at eventually making the
"state-to-state special relations" idea a reality, Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>The proposal, submitted by 39 DPP legislators headed by Shen
Fu-hsiung, suggests that all laws -- including those carried in the
Civil Law, the Criminal Law and the Nationality Law -- concerning
relations and exchanges between people on either side of the Taiwan
Strait, will be amended and revised into a unique version which would
be the basis for all laws governing cross-strait relations, according
to Lin.</P>
      <P>However, the proposal did not even make the Steering Committee of
the Legislative Yuan in its last session which opened on Oct. 1, and
neither is it expected to be included in the Steering Committee
agenda of this session, which opened on Tuesday, according to
observers at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lin further said that the Cabinet-level MAC will continue to
collaborate with KMT lawmakers to ensure the DPP proposal is aborted,
as it could be a factor contributing to impairing the stability in
the Taiwan Strait if passed by the Legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA ON ALERT OVER MAINLAND CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTER'S AFRICAN VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Friday it is keeping close watch on mainland Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan's current overseas visit which will take him to
two African and two Middle East countries.</P>
      <P>Liu Chen-kun, deputy director of MOFA's African Affairs
Department, said Tang's Feb. 15-23 overseas trip follows a five-leg
African visit he made in January this year.</P>
      <P>Tang visited Nigeria, Namibia, Mozambique, the Seychelles and
Zimbabwe from Jan. 10-19. This time he will travel to Mauritania,
Tunisia, Kuwait and Iran. This is his fourth trip to the African
continent since he assumed his current post in March 1998.</P>
      <P>Liu said Tang's current trip again proves that mainland China has
made courting African countries one of its priority foreign affairs
tasks for the moment.</P>
      <P>In addition to meeting with top leaders of the host countries,
Tang is also expected to invite those countries to take part in a
high-profile multilateral meeting to be held in Beijing this October,
Liu said.</P>
      <P>The event, organized by the mainland authorities and dubbed
"China-Africa Cooperation Forum -- Beijing 2000 Ministerial Meeting,"
is aimed at enhancing Beijing's clout in African countries, according
to Liu. "Increased African support is expected to facilitate mainland
China's bid to become a spokeman for the Third World in the new world
order," he noted.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that MOFA has ordered the Republic of China
embassies in African countries to check whether any of the ROC's
diplomatic allies has received invitations from Beijing to attend the
October meeting.</P>
      <P>"So far, none of our African allies have received any invitations
from mainland China," Liu said, adding that MOFA will continue
keeping close watch on all relevant developments.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China has never ceased its efforts to
isolate Taiwan in the international community, Liu said Beijing has
often taken advantage of self-hosted international conferences to
contact the ROC's diplomatic allies with an ultimate goal of tempting
them into switching their diplomatic allegiance.</P>
      <P>Liu said the ROC's stance on the issue is to advise its allies
not to send delegates, particularly high-ranking officials, to attend
such meetings. "For instance, all of our allies took our advice and
did not send any representatives to a recent Beijing-sponsored
international postal conference," he recalled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER REITERATES ESTABLISHMENT OF PEACE ZONE IN TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday reiterated
his call for the establishment of a "Taiwan Strait peace zone" so as
to promote the normalization of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks in an administrative report to the
Legislative Yuan, his last as premier, since he will pitch in to the
official 28-day presidential election campaign activities on Saturday
as the running mate of Vice Present Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Siew said that while the government's "no haste, be patient"
stance on cross-strait trade relations is the current policy, it is
by no means unchangeable.</P>
      <P>He added that if cross-strait relations are markedly improved,
and the rights of Taiwan businessmen duly protected, the policy could
be adjusted.</P>
      <P>He also said that he will led the Cabinet in an en masse
resignation before the inauguration of the new president on May 20.</P>
      <P>In retrospect, Siew noted that his Cabinet has dedicated itself
to the national modernization program, that the nation has emerged
unscathed from the regional financial storm, and that it has
weathered the massive Sept. 21 earthquake of last year.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan, despite its small size, managed to create a
trade volume of US$230 billion to become the 18th-largest economy in
the world, and the 15th-largest trading nation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves rank third in the world, while
its per capita income now totals US$13,000, a huge leap from the
US$100 of half-a-century ago.</P>
      <P>Looking toward the future, he said that the government will push
for a new wave of reforms and try to root out "black gold" politics,
adding that substantive measures in this regard include the
promulgation of the law regarding disclosure of the assets of civil
servants, and the government procurement law.</P>
      <P>The government will also work on the lobby bill, the political
parties bill, and the management of political donations bill.</P>
      <P>Siew also vowed to change the relationship between local
governments and the central government to a partnership relationship,
and to promote voluntary work by members of the public.</P>
      <P>The government will also work to step up information development
to turn Taiwan into a high-tech island, said Siew.</P>

    <DATELINE>Rome, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Tony Fang &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A six-member mission from Taiwan lobbying for
World Health Organization (WHO) membership visited the Italian
parliament on Thursday to lobby their support for Taiwan's WHO bid.</P>
      <P>The mission, accompanied by Joe Hong, ROC representative in
Italy, called on Francesco Carella, vice chairman of the Senate
Sanitary Commission, to exchange views on medical care and sanitation
cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Carella said that medical care and sanitation are non-boundary
basic human rights and that Beijing cannot represent Taiwan. He noted
that Beijing has no right to oppose observer status for Taiwan in the
WHO.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan, with its population of 22 million,
should not be excluded from the world health network and that Italy
will therefore support Taiwan's WHO bid.</P>
      <P>Hong told the Italian parliamentarians that Taiwan has already
implemented a national health insurance program, and noted that
Taiwan is willing to share its medical and health care experience
with all nations. This, he said, makes it unfair that Taiwan is
barred from the WHO.</P>
      <P>In addition to Carella, nine other Italian parliamentarians
joined Carella to extend their welcome to the Taiwan mission.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, members of the mission called on Aldo Pagni,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) and the
US technology-heavy NASDAQ stock exchange may sign a cross-listing
agreement after the Republic of China joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a senior official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Tzong-yeong, chairman of the Securities and Futures
Commission, said the US NASDAQ is considering setting up a
cross-listing system with the Taiex after Taiwan becomes a WTO
member later this year.</P>
      <P>"If the plan is realized, our stock market will be further
internationalized," Lin said, adding that the Taiex will be able to
attract more foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Under a cross-listing arrangement, local investors can
conveniently purchase blue-chip stocks listed on the NASDAQ. It will
also make it easier for Taiex-listed companies to raise funds from
the US stock market, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>The planned cross-listing agreement with the NASDAQ is also
expected to facilitate Taiex's bid to become the second largest
bourse in Asia after Japan, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In terms of total stock market value, Taiwan currently ranks
third in Asia after Japan and Hong Kong. Based on trading volume,
the Taiex is now the world's third largest after New York and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Lin said the SFC is endeavoring to increase the number of
companies traded in the Taiex in order to attract more foreign
investors, particularly major international financial institutions.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, more than 150 local firms currently listed on
the over-the-counter market will shift to the Taiex by the end of
this year. Meanwhile, Lin said the SFC hopes to boost the number
of Taiex-listed firms to 700 by 2001 from 464 at present.</P>
      <P>Lin further reported that foreign capital has continued flowing
into Taiwan for stock investment. As of early February, more than
US$25 billion has been remitted to Taiwan for stock investment. In
the first half of February alone, net capital inflow for stock
investment reached US$5 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHARE PRICES DOWN 1 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices moved down 1 percent on
Friday as the index was dragged down by selling pressure resulting
from profit-taking after the index soared in the previous trading
session.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index shed
105.82 points to finish at 10,096.38, failing to breach the all-time
high of 10,256 points, on a turnover of NT$259.18 billion (US$8.44
billion), with 6.38 billion shares changing hands.</P>
      <P>The index opened higher and immediately surpassed 10.256 points,
at one point soaring to 10.400 points. But selling pressure caused by
profit-taking soon emerged as turnover rocketed to US$120 billion one
hour after the bourse opened.</P>
      <P>The bourse ended up with heavy selling, with 1 million more
shares sold than bought, discouraging the bullish sentiment of
previous trading sessions.</P>
      <P>The decline was primarily led by large-cap traditional
businesses, especially those with investment in telecommunication
services. Stocks of companies in the Koo's Group suffered after
rising in recent sessions, on the announcement that one of its
Internet companies, CigaMedia Ltd., was due to make a debut on the
technology-heavy US Nasdaq index on Friday.</P>
      <P>According to dealers, the situation of tense consolidation is
normal whenever the index rises to a high level, but they stressed
that investors need not lose heart, as the medium- to long-term
future of the stock market is promising.</P>
      <P>Six out of the eight major stock categories reported losses, with
paper-making issues suffering the heaviest losses, ending with a
5.5-percent fall. Cement issues and foodstuff shares enjoyed
2.2-percent gains and 3.2-percent gains, respectively.</P>
      <P>Decliners led advancers 371 to 206, with 26 issues remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) also experienced poor performance, closing with mixed
results. December futures recorded no transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for March lose 133 points to finish at
10,160, with 2,899 contract transactions. Those for April shed 152
points to close at 10,188, with 69 contract transactions, while those
for June dipped 101 points to finish at 10,300, with 17 contract
transactions. September futures rose 53 points to close at 10,360,
with one contract transaction.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Friday were 10,293 points
for March, 10,340 points for April, 10,401 points for June, 10,307
points for September, and 10,604 points for December.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, both reported mixed results.</P>
      <P>March TE futures shed five points to close at 512, with 674
contract transactions, April TE futures moved up 1.4 points to close
at 516, with eight contract transactions, and June TE futures moved
down 1.15 points to close at 529, with five contract transactions.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for September or
December.</P>
      <P>March TF futures shed 29 points to close at 1,195, with 593
contract transactions, April TF futures moved up 1.8 points to close

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several scholars from local universities
commented on Friday on the five presidential candidates' mainland
China policies, each scholar offering his own interpretation, but
concentrating mainly on Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan's policy.</P>
      <P>Ge Yung-guang, a political science professor at National Taiwan
University, praised Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan's ten proposals
for cross-strait relations as a positive initiative which shows
Taipei's goodwill in seeking negotiation, and putting emphasis on the
integration of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chang Lin-cheng, a political science professor at National Taiwan
University, remarked that although there are differences in the
wording and content of the policies of Lien, independent presidential
candidate James Soong and Progressive Democratic Party's (DPP) Chen
Shui-bian, they all resemble President Lee Teng-hui's mainland
policy.</P>
      <P>In comparison, she went on, the policies of independent candidate
Hsu Hsin-liang and New Party candidate Li Ao sound "more feasible"
than those of Lien, Soong or Chen.</P>
      <P>However, Chao Chun-shan, a political science professor at
National Chengchi University, disagreed, noting that Lien's policy is
very considerate of the feelings of both Taiwan's voters and the
people of mainland China, as well as the feelings of the
international community. It is therefore the most satisfactory and
acceptable of the three main presidential hopefuls' proposals, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chao said in particular that Lien's use of the word "brotherhood"
in referring to the cross-strait relationship is noteworthy.</P>
      <P>Professor Chiang Hsin-li of National Sun Yat-sen University said
Lien's proposals show a sense of rationality, stability and goodwill,
which should be beneficial in pulling relations between Taipei and
Beijing back on track.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Rampant smuggling of live animals across
the Taiwan Strait has become a loophole in Taiwan's anti-epidemic
system, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official warned on Friday.</P>
      <P>Soong Hua-tsung, deputy director of the COA's flora and fauna
inspection and quarantine bureau, said the amount of confiscated
contraband live animals and livestock products has increased rapidly
in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to COA tallies, a total of 890 tons of livestock
products were seized in 1999, marking a 1.25-fold increase from the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Soong said, a large number of various live animals
were seized last year, including a horse, eight head of cattle, 17
ostriches, 98 dogs and 220 birds of different kinds.</P>
      <P>Soong said most of the seized contraband animals were from
mainland China which is stricken by many contagious diseases. Some
of confiscated animals were smuggled from Southeast Asia, also an
area plagued by various epidemics.</P>
      <P>"Smuggling of live animals could bring virulent viruses into
Taiwan and pose a serious threat to our anti-epidemic system
and the development of local livestock industry," Soong said.</P>
      <P>He further said the COA needs the assistance of the general
public to intercept or uncover smuggled live animals or livestock
products.</P>
      <P>With information provided by members of the public, Soong said
the COA's quarantine bureau has managed to uncover more than 20,000
kilograms of smuggled animal products since the bureau was
inaugurated two years ago.</P>
      <P>Soong urged local people to cooperate even closer with the COA
to curb smuggling of live animals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US NEVER SAW CHINA AS 'ADVERSARY,' SAYS 7TH FLEET COMMANDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Feb. 18 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States had never viewed China
as an "adversary" and did not see Russia's recent delivery of some
warships to China as a threat to US interests in the region, the
visiting commander of the 7th Fleet said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"A few warships will not affect the balance of power and the
Chinese navy has every right to modernize itself, just like any other
nation," said Vice Admiral Walter Doran.</P>
      <P>Doran also said the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system was
still being debated in the United States, but that nothing concrete
had been drawn up.</P>
      <P>He was speaking to about 80 participants at a forum organized by
the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies.</P>
      <P>However, when asked how he viewed the strengthening of ties
between the Russian and Chinese militaries, as demonstrated by a
recent bilateral naval exercise, he hinted that this was something of
great concern in the "neighborhood" of East Asia.</P>
      <P>The United States is confident that its defense ties with China
will soon be back on a friendly track, as Washington has never viewed
Beijing as an adversary nor a threat, despite US concerns over the
Taiwan issue, he said.</P>
      <P>"There is nothing on the table now, but we hope things will soon
work out," he said.</P>
      <P>"There have been positive developments, such as the visit of the
carrier battle group USS Stennis to Hong Kong last week, the first by
a US warship for quite some time."</P>
      <P>When fielding questions later, he stressed his own personal and
professional interests in China.</P>
      <P>He said that, following the visit of Xiong Guangkai, a
high-ranking Chinese military official, to Washington last month and
USS Stennis' visit to Hong Kong, Sino-US defense ties were on the
mend.</P>
      <P>Ties were disrupted in May of last year after NATO forces bombed
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.</P>
      <P>"The TMD is essentially for protecting the US Navy where it
happens to be," he said, ruling out the end of forward deployment of
US troops in the Pacific with the advent of the system.</P>
      <P>China has condemned the TMD as a threat to its security, calling
it a provocation for a new arms race, especially if it is installed
in Taiwan.

    <HEADLINE>NSB CHIEF BRIEFS DPP CANDIDATE ON NATIONAL SECURITY SITUATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian became the first
presidential hopeful to hear official briefing on the country's
general security situation on Friday.</P>
      <P>Ting Yu-chou, director of the National Security Bureau (NSB),
personally briefed Chen and his running mate Annetta Lu on the
Republic of China's latest security situation at the NSB
headquarters on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ting said the NSB has followed the US practice in offering
national security briefings for various presidential tickets and
that the DPP team was the first to receive the presentation.</P>
      <P>According to Ting, the US government adopted the "national
security briefing" system in the early 1950s on the advice of
then-President Harry S. Truman (1884-1972).</P>
      <P>Truman, who served as US president from 1945 through 1953,
recalled that he found difficulties formulating national
security policy during the presidential campaign period because of
his limited knowledge about the US security situation at that time.
Therefore he suggested before his departure from the office that the
US government offered pre-election briefings on the national security
situation to presidential candidates of both Republican and
Democratic parties.</P>
      <P>Ting said Republican candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first
US presidential hopeful to hear "security briefing." Eisenhower
later won the election and served as the 34th US president from 1953
to 1961.</P>
      <P>The "security briefing" system has since been implemented in the
United States. Ting said its success lies in three conditions -- all
US presidential hopefuls abide by the principle of "secrecy"; none
of them have tried to "politicize" the event; and none of them have
tried to implicate security or intelligence agencies in presidential
campaign.</P>
      <P>Ting said the NSB has taken the initiative to offer "security
briefings" to the five presidential teams contested in the upcoming
election. "The move is mainly aimed at helping presidential hopefuls
gain a better understanding of the country's current security
situation so that they can formulate sound security-related campaign
platform," he explained.</P>
      <P>Ting stressed that the NSB will offer similar briefings to the
four other presidential tickets in the run-up to the March 18
election. "We'll abide by the principles of 'administrative
neutrality,' secrecy, no political involvement and fairness in
security presentation," he added.</P>
      <P>DPP presidential candidate Chen said he felt honored to become
the first ROC presidential hopeful to receive the national security
briefing. "I believe it marks a good omen for my presidential bid,"
he added confidently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS MOGUL HAILS VP'S MAINLAND POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) Chairman Y.C.
Wang on Friday hailed the mainland China policy released recently by
Vice President Lien Chan, predicting that cross-Taiwan Strait ties
will advance after Taiwan's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Praising Lien's mainland China policy as positive and conducive,
Wang, one of Taiwan's most influential business leaders, expressed
his view that Taiwan's policy toward mainland China will be more open
following the coming presidential election, helping improving
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lien, the ruling Kuomintang's candidate in the presidential race,
made public a 10-point mainland China policy on Thursday, favoring
the establishment of special economic zones on frontline islands,
such as Kinmen and Matsu, and the opening of direct trade, post and
transport links across the Strait, provided that Taiwan is not
intimidated by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Turning to the question of whether FPG will proceed with its plan
to set up a power plant in Zhangzhou in mainland China's Fujian
province, Wang ruled out the possibility by saying that his group
will not rekindle efforts to do so -- even if the government gives
its approval -- because FPG has sold its shares at the plant to other
foreign counterparts.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan still bans local businesses from investing in mainland
Chinese infrastructure projects, FPG was forced two years ago to
withdraw from a joint venture with a US-based company to build the
Zhangzhou plant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANILA PROPOSES SUBREGIONAL ECONOMIC BLOC WITH CHINA, JAPAN, S. KOREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada formally proposed on Friday the formation of a subregional
economic cooperation bloc in central East Asia composed of the
Philippines, mainland China, Japan and South Korea, with Northern
Luzon serving as the main gateway to this area.</P>
      <P>Estrada presented the proposal at the launch in Malacanang of the
Central East Asia Growth Circle program.</P>
      <P>He said the success of his proposed central East Asia economic
bloc will rely on the optimal use of the "economics of proximity and
complementarity" among the member-countries in the grouping.</P>
      <P>"With this thrust in mind, the Philippines now formally proposes
the formation of a subregional economic cooperation bloc composed of
economies in central East Asia, through the activation of the Central
East Asia Circle program," Estrada said in his speech at the
program's launch ceremony.</P>
      <P>The program covers the Ilocos and Pangsinan provinces, Cagayan
Valley, central Luzon and the Cordillera Administrative Region as the
Philippine-focus area of the Central East Asia Growth Circle, due to
its geographic proximity and economic compatibility with mainland
China, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Estrada said he views the new growth area as an important
component of his firm commitment to improve the living conditions of
the masses and provide a leadership truly responsive to the needs of
Filipinos.</P>
      <P>"My administration upholds this vision to implement projects and
programs that will secure economic progress for our nation, and
achieve genuine social equity for our people," he said.</P>
      <P>This new initiative would likewise explore new areas of
cooperation -- not only the north Philippines, but areas toward the
South China Sea: the southern provinces of mainland China, the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Estrada noted that a major concern in the activation of the
Central East Asia Growth Circle program is the development of
micro-linkages with and among focus areas in the growth region.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ANTICIPATES POSTING WORLD'S NO.2 ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Predicting a period of high economic growth
and low inflation, government officials on Friday revised upward
their forecast for economic growth in 2000 from 5.67 percent to 6.54
percent -- the second best worldwide, next only to that of mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Noting the signs of a booming economy and tame inflation, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS)
under the Executive Yuan announced that Taiwan's gross national
product is expected to reach US$325.4 billion -- and push past the
US$300 billion mark for the first time -- to account for US$14,634
per capita this year.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Director-General Wei Duan also said consumer prices will
see inflation of a moderate 2.2 percent, within the normal range of
up to 3 percent, although higher than the 0.18 percent of last year.
Wholesale prices are expected to rise by 0.55 percent.</P>
      <P>He based his rosy predictions on the booming international
economy, increasing exports and expanding private-sector investment.</P>
      <P>Wei speculated that exports will expand by 10.39 percent,
compared to the 10 percent for 1999, while imports will increase by
12.8 percent, with a trade surplus of US$9.4 billion, against last
year's US$10.94 billion.</P>
      <P>Taking inflation into account, and excluding the amount of
service trade, however, the figures will translate into a real-term
growth of 7.4 percent in exports.</P>
      <P>Although domestic oil prices have already been raised twice thus
far this year, and a hike in pulp prices is in the works, Wei said
not all import prices have increased, and prices of gold and precious
metals are at a historic low. As a result, Wei said, their impacts on
domestic commodity prices will be mixed.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the interest rate will remain at the current
level in light of the fact that the Central Bank of China is pleased
with the current retail price level.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the DGBAS, Taiwan recorded a
growth rate of 5.67 percent in 1999, ranking it sixth globally, and
scored a GNP of US$290.8 billion, or US$13,248 per capita, bringing
it to 17th place worldwide, up two spots from the previous year.</P>
      <P>A surge in exports and the strong domestic demand stimulated by
the disastrous Sept. 21 earthquake were credited with the
better-than-expected expansion of 1999, said Wei.</P>

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan received an
honorary doctorate of juristic science from Trinity College of
Hartford, Connecticut, in Taipei on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony held at the auditorium of the Presidential Office,
Evan S. Dobelle, head of Trinity College, awarded Lien the degree in
honor of his excellent achievements in academia and in public office.</P>
      <P>Calling it a great honor for his school to confer the law degree
on Lien, Dobelle presented the vice president with a doctorate
diploma and turned the tassel on Lien's mortarboard.</P>
      <P>In a brief speech for the occasion, Lien said he considered the
honor not only a personal glory but also an acknowledgment of the
Republic of China's developments in various fields.</P>
      <P>Lauding Taiwan's achievement as an epitome of the dreams harbored
by Chinese people for hundreds of years, the vice president vowed to
live up to the people's mandate and pass on a more free, peaceful and
prosperous country to their offspring.</P>
      <P>The Trinity College chorus sang four songs -- in English,
Mandarin and Taiwanese -- at the ceremony. After that, Lien and his
wife hosted a dinner party for Dobelle and his students.</P>
      <P>The college named Lien as a recipient of the honorary degree last
May, but he was not able to travel to the United States to receive it
due to his busy political schedule at home. Therefore, Dobelle came
to Taiwan this month to present the honor.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan people support the
signing of a peace agreement across the Taiwan Strait as proposed by
ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate Lien Chan, according to the
results of a new public opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,084 randomly selected adult residents
was conducted by Gallup Taiwan Co. from Feb. 17-18. The poll was
commissioned by Sanlih Entertainment Television with an aim of
probing various presidential hopefuls' latest support ratings and
voters' views on Lien's newly unveiled mainland policy-related
campaign platform.</P>
      <P>Poll results show that 70.19 percent of those interviewed said
they agree with Lien's proposal to sign a peace agreement with
mainland China to end cross-strait hostility, and less than 10
percent said they disagree with such a proposal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 70.09 percent gave a thumbs up to Lien's overture
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait set up an official dialogue
channel based on the principle of parity.</P>
      <P>Other major findings of the poll included: 63.1 percent welcome
top mainland Chinese negotiator with Taiwan Wang Daohan to visit the
island at anytime of his convenience; 55.7 percent support the
opening of a "hotline" for communication between the top leaders of
both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>While 44.1 percent of the respondents support cross-strait
negotiation for the establishment of a mechanism for
exchanges of visits by military personnel and information concerning
routine military exercises, 27.2 percent said they oppose such an
idea.</P>
      <P>As for Lien's proposal that the two sides negotiate for the
opening of direct trade and transportation links between Taiwan-held
Kinmen and Matsu islands and mainland China's southeastern coastal
province of Fujian to pave the way for the formation of a
special peace zone in the region, 47.5 percent threw support
behind the proposal, compared to 20.02 percent who gave a negative
reply.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 46.7 percent said they think that
various campaign promises offered by presidential hopefuls are
tantamount to an "act of vote-buying," but 36.2 percent said they
don't think so.</P>
      <P>Some 56 percent said they fret that implementing campaign
promises offered by presidential candidates could further worsen the
government's finance, while 26.7 percent think otherwise.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the latest support ratings for the
three key presidential contenders were 23.2 percent for independent
candidate James Soong; 22.7 percent for opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) nominee Chen Shui-bian; and 15 percent for
KMT's Lien. More than 30 percent remain undecided on their choice.</P>
      <P>Poll results further show that although Lien lags in personal
popularity, he leads the pack in terms of chance of success perceived
by voters. About 33 percent said they believe that Lien would win
the March 18 election, while only 18.3 percent would bet on Soong's
victory and 14.9 percent put bets on Chen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 23.6 percent said they think that Chen would be most
likely to honor his campaign promises if elected, compared to
Soong's 21.5 percent and Lien's 17.3 percent.</P>
      <P>According to a new regulation by the Central Election
Commission, no presidential race-related poll results can be
published in the last 10 days of the campaign.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's efforts in
animal rights protection in recent years, particularly its
improvement in treatment of stray dogs, have won international
recognition and praise, an ROC official said here on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Shiang-nung, the ROC's top agriculture official, made the
statement upon his arrival in Los Angeles after attending the
annual meeting of the Human Society of the United States held in Las
Vegas earlier this week.</P>
      <P>During its annual congress, Lin said, the US animal rights
promotion group publicly lauded Taiwan for its endeavors in the past
two years to improve the living conditions of animals.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the ROC government, Lin received an award from the
Human Society at its 2000 annual conference, also known as Animal
Care Expo, for Taiwan's progress in animal rights protection in
recent years.</P>
      <P>In a relatively short period of two years, Lin said, the ROC
has completed legislation of a new animal rights protection law
to ensure humanitarian treatment of all animals.</P>
      <P>"In accordance with the law, we have completed registration of
420,000 dogs which account for about 20 percent of some 2 million
total dogs kept by Taiwan residents," Lin said, adding that the
Human Society described it as a "remarkable" achievement.</P>
      <P>Lin, chairman of the ROC's Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture,
went on to say that although many stray dogs-related problems still
exist, Taiwan has made great progress in treating stray animals.
 Relevant government agencies would raise any captured stray dog
for one week, Lin said, adding: "During that period, we would
encourage members of the general public to 'adopt' the animal. We no
longer use cruel measures to kill stray dogs."</P>

Taiwan if political instability on Taiwan leads one side to invite
Beijing's intervention, or if Taipei deliberately precipitates a
crisis in the Taiwan Straits to gain US support for independence.</P>
      <P>Other than military preparedness, Lasater stressed, the most
important contribution Taiwan can make to its own security is
political astuteness. "There is no reason to be unduly pessimistic
about Taiwan's future, unless the Taiwanese people and their elected
officials contribute to their society's demise by alienating both
their enemies and their friends, while at the same time weakening the
island's social cohesion."</P>
      <P>With the world's attention once again focused on Taiwan because
of the upcoming March 18 presidential election, there has been
increased concern over the island's security.</P>
      <P>In his 80-page detailed study on the probability of Communist
China's use of force against Taiwan and the likely US response,
Lasater has drawn the following conclusions:</P>
      <P>-- China is willing to go to war over Taiwan, and Beijing is most
likely to use force against the island if the latter seeks to become
an independent nation-state separate from mainland China.</P>
      <P>-- The United States probably will defend Taiwan. Beijing's
increased power strengthens China's deterrence against American
intervention, but US interests in preventing Chinese hegemony are
more important than the risks to American forces.</P>
      <P>-- US arms sales to Taiwan are critical and likely will continue.
But as the People's Liberation Army modernizes and China exercises
its growing national power, US arms sales in itself will be no
guarantee of Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>-- The security of Taiwan is of international strategic concern,
since Taiwan's geostrategic importance has increased, not decreased,
as a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the
Cold War.</P>
      <P>-- PRC missiles pose the greatest threat to Taiwan, since they
may suffice to break the will of the Taiwanese people, thus making
the development of an effective local missile defense system one of
the priorities for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan will benefit from Theater Missile Defense, but its
overall security will become more dependent on external factors in
the early 21st century.</P>
      <P>Lasater, former professor at Pennsylvania State University,
the US Naval War College and National Chengchi University in
Taipei, said the ability of Communist China to produce large numbers
of guided missiles and to acquire state-of-the-art conventional
offensive weaponry from Russia and other sources means that Taiwan's
narrow technological advantage over the PRC will likely be
overwhelmed in five to ten years. At that time, in the absence of US
intervention, Taiwan would likely be defeated by a determined PLA
attack.</P>
      <P>The national and military strategies of the Republic of China are
evolving, but they have not yet solved the problem of long-term
survival, Lasater noted.</P>
      <P>"Due to the nature of the modern PRC threat to Taiwan --
unrelenting political confrontation and preparation for attack, the
ROC must continually review and adjust its national strategy and its
military strategy. Unfortunately, the restrictions under which Taiwan
must operate make an effective defensive strategy difficult to
conceptualize and implement," he wrote.</P>
      <P>In his view, there is no peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue in
sight and the political situation is fluid, but the election of a new
president in the ROC in March 2000 may usher in a period of possible
political movement on the Taiwan issue in both Beijing and Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE LEADERS FIND IT DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE RELIGION WITH MARXISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese leaders are finding it
difficult to reconcile religion with Marxist ideology because the
widespread popularity of well-organized religious sects such as Falun
Gong could undermine the survival of the Communist regime, according
to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the revival of religion in China is a
spin-off of the economic reforms that have swept the country through
the 1980s and 1990s up to the present. Almost 10 percent of the
country's 1.3 billion people now reportedly adhere to a religious
faith.</P>
      <P>Chinese Communist Party leaders are apparently perplexed by the
well-organized religious sects, particularly Falun Gong, and are
clearly concerned by the phenomenon as they find it difficult to
reconcile religion with the atheist Marxist ideology.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Jonathan Unger, a China specialist at the
Australian National University in Canberra, as saying that "one thing
a genuine religious group has in common with Falun Gong is that they
are both organizations with a mass following seeking a spiritual
solace that the Chinese government cannot offer."</P>
      <P>The daily quoted an unnamed foreign diplomat as saying that
curbing the spread of the many faiths in the mainland is consuming an
inordinate amount of the government's time and resources.</P>
      <P>The continuous crackdown on Falun Gong and other religious sects
has resulted in uncertainty and no one really knows what the exact
extent of official religious tolerance now is in China.</P>
      <P>To date, as many as 35,000 members of Falun Gong have been
detained at some time and group leaders have received jail sentences
of up to 18 years. For Western diplomats, the Falun Gong crackdown is
primarily an issue of the deprivation of Chinese citizens' rights of
freedom of belief and expression, the daily reported.</P>

      <P>Air New Zealand has agreed to buy the
remaining 50 percent of Ansett Australia from media magnate Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation at a price of A$580 (nearly US$390)
million and obtain full control of the second largest airline in
Australia.</P>

thumbs down in the shares market with the airline's stock dropping
considerably on the Australian bourse Friday.</P>
      <P>Singapore Airlines has tried to buy the News Corporation's 50
percent stake in Ansett but a deal failed to materialize. Financial
experts said they doubt Air New Zealand would be capable of
competing with Qantas and Britain's Virgin Airline on Australia's
domestic routes unless SIA was part of the new acquisition.</P>
      <P>Standard and Poors has also downgraded Air New Zealand's rating
following the report of its takeover of Ansett.</P>
      <P>After the takeover, the Kiwi airline is expected to lay
off hundreds of staff at Ansett in order to strengthen its
competitive edge against its major rivals in the domestic market,

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Feb.   19  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City Cross-Strait
Development Association, aimed at improving friendship and exchanges
between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland to create a win-win situation
for the two sides, was officially established on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The inauguration meeting of the association was presided over by
Chang Tseng-hsi, chairman of the preparation committee for the
association. Chang Jung-kung, director of the Mainland Operation
Department (MOD) under the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), also attended the
meeting, together with more than a hundred representatives from all
walks of life.</P>
      <P>The chairman pointed out that the association is designed to
conduct exchanges with the mainland in a pragmatic manner and with
initiative.</P>
      <P>Chang, who is an honorary chairman of the newly
established association's board, noted that Beijing's policy toward
Taiwan basically sets "One China" as its starting point, uses the
"double-handed peace and war" method of negotiating, and sets the
"one country, two systems" formula as its goal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei's mainland policy sets "divided parities" as
its starting point, employs the concept of a "peaceful race" in the
negotiation process with the mainland, and sets "democratic
unification" as its goal, Chang added.</P>
      <P>These differences between the two sides are actually the core
issues of cross-strait relations, Chang indicated.</P>
      <P>Since the two sides are currently in a divided situation, it is
natural that both Taipei and Beijing have their own opinions about
the terms of final unification, Chang continued.</P>
      <P>The key to resolving these differences lies in further exchanges,
dialogue, and consultations, and not in demanding that Taipei
relinquish its call for parity between the two sides in cross-strait
discussions as Beijing has always done, Chang stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO HELP ROC ERADICATE COMMERCIAL PIRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said
on Saturday that the United States is welcome to furnish the ROC
government with detailed information concerning Taiwan firms
allegedly involved in commercial piracy.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in response to reports that the Republic
of China was the largest source of pirated goods confiscated by US
customs authorities in the first half of last year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC has spared no efforts to crack down on
counterfeiting in recent years, Wang said he earnestly hopes that
US authorities could provide Taiwan with a list of Taiwan firms
found to be involved in such illegal trade practice.</P>
      <P>"We believe such a name list would help make our
anti-counterfeiting operations far more effective," Wang
said.</P>
      <P>According to US customs tallies released on Friday, US$35.1
million worth of pirated products from Taiwan were seized in the
first half of 1999, making the island America's number one source of
counterfeit goods.</P>
      <P>The same statistics also show that audio-visual products,
including VCDs, CDs and DVDs, formed the bulk of seized pirated goods
from Taiwan, accounting for 83 percent of the total. Other major
sources of counterfeit products uncovered by US customs agents during
the same six-month period included mainland China, Singapore, South
Korea and France.</P>
      <P>Economics Ministry officials said Taiwan has long set up a
special monitoring system to thwart exports of pirated information
software products.</P>
      <P>"The system has been effective in curbing outbound shipment of
pirated audio-visual products," said a ministry official.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that as triangular trade and transshipment
business among the three Chinese communities -- Taiwan, Hong Kong
and mainland China -- are very brisk, the actual production place of
counterfeit goods seized in the United States may not necessarily be
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the official said, the ROC hopes to obtain the list
of Taiwan firms found to have shipped counterfeit products to the
United States in order to enhance the efficiency of its anti-piracy
operations.</P>
      <P>The official recalled that Marc M. Wall, economic division chief
of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
once said in January that he was impressed by Taiwan's efforts
to crack down on commercial piracy and protect intellectual
property rights.</P>
      <P>Wall made the remarks while attending a ceremony honoring
selected local law-enforcement officers for their contribution to
busting counterfeit products in the past year.</P>
      <P>AIT represents US interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of
US$16.1 billion with the United States in 1999, the highest level in
12 years, according to the latest statistics released by the US
Department of Commerce on Friday.</P>
      <P>The total value of Taiwan's exports to the United States grew by
6.3 percent over that of 1998 to US$35.2 billion last year, while US
exports to Taiwan rose by 5.3 percent to US$19.1 billion, leaving the
island with a trade surplus of US$16.1 billion, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>The 1999 trade gap between the two countries represented an
increase of 7.5 percent, or US$1.12 billion, over the 1998 level.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was America's seventh-largest trading partner in 1999
after Canada, Mexico, Japan, mainland China, Germany and Britain,
according to the statistics. Taiwan was also the United States'
seventh-largest source of imports and its eighth-largest export
market.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the statistics showed that Taiwan was the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WARNED AGAINST POSSIBLE `INFORMATION WAR' BY CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China needs to guard
against the possible use of "information warfare" by mainland China,
researchers at a think tank warned during a seminar on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) convened the one-day seminar on
the topic of mainland China's information warfare research and
development and its effect on Taiwan at the Taipei International
Convention Center. The seminar was presided over by Lin Bih-jaw,
deputy secretary general to President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>TRI researchers noted that Beijing has been dedicated to the
research and development of its information warfare capabilities in
recent years, adding that its progress in this field has greatly
upgraded mainland China's combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>The researchers said information warfare, which causes minimum
personal casualties, is less costly, and can be utilized rapidly for
a quick strike, is ideal to Beijing's notion of "unification (with
Taiwan) first and rule (the island) later."</P>
      <P>They said that Beijing, which has been able to obtain high-tech
nuclear weapons, intercontinental missiles, and artificial
satellites, could also acquire information technology and therefore
pose a more serious threat to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>They said that Beijing, based on the principle of taking Taiwan
in a single strike, could employ its advanced information technology
edge to intercept Taiwan's strategic information and interfere with
its weaponry and warfare systems.</P>
      <P>Beijing could also bring Taipei to its knees by sabotaging
non-military systems, such as its telecommunications networks, and
its financial, electrical and traffic systems.</P>
      <P>Beijing could also launch a disinformation campaign to create
social disturbances and demoralize the local population in order to
create a pretext for invading Taiwan, the researchers warned.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sidelines of the seminar, a ranking official in
charge of Taiwan's mainland policy said that Beijing's development of
mid-range and long-range missiles will pose a serious threat to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, revealed that Beijing has already deployed
short-range missiles with a range of 600 kilometers and has developed
its mid-range "Hongniao 2" cruise missiles.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the eventual deployment of the mid-range missiles
will mean that Beijing is in a position to invade Taiwan by force.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing is now developing a long-range "Hongniao 3"
cruise missile, with a range of 2,500 kilometers, similar to the
United States' tomahawk cruise missile.</P>
      <P>If Beijing gains the know-how for launching its long-range
missiles from its submarines, then this will mean that its capability
of invading Taiwan has matured, he added.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Vice Secretary General Lin urged Beijing
not to interfere in Taiwan's presidential election scheduled for
March 18 less it incur the aversion and antagonism of the local
population.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Beijing would not launch large-scale military
exercises this time like it did during the last presidential election
in 1996.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he hopes Beijing has "learned a lesson" from its
missile exercises in waters near Taiwan in 1996, when it aimed to
influence the outcome of the presidential election but instead
contributed to the overwhelming victory of President Lee Teng-hui of
the ruling Kuomintang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Tang Fei
on Saturday expressed his hope that Beijing will make a favorable
response to Taipei's decision to suspend large-scale military
exercises before the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>He made the remark in an interview with the Taipei-based
Broadcasting Corporation of China.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid causing trouble, Tang said that the ROC Defense
Ministry has announced it will not conduct large-scale war games
during the election period, adding that "we hope Beijing will make a
friendly response."</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on Hong Kong media reports that Beijing is
planning to carry out a large-scale anti-air attack military maneuver
in Fujian Province, Tang said that "up to this moment, there is no
sign that Beijing is going to conduct a large-scale military
exercise."</P>
      <P>However, he said, the public should not ignore the fact that
mainland China "is always making preparations," and added that "when
necessary, they might take actions."</P>
      <P>Tang reminded the public that Beijing has recently used the
phrase "chieh-fang" (liberalization) again, and it indicated that
Beijing has never renounced the option of using force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the establishment of a cross-Taiwan Strait mutual trust
mechanism, Tang said that it must be built on a "parity" basis, and
therefore, the time is still not ripe to consider that concept
because mainland China won't concede "parity" in negotiations to
Taiwan.</P>

(By Timothy Sun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Manila office of Taiwan's China
Airlines (CAL) said on Saturday it will suspend its flight services
between Manila and the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung from
Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>CAL executives in Manila said the carrier was forced to make the
decision because of different views with Philippine civil aviation
authorities concerning the total number of passengers that Taiwan
carriers are allowed to carry between the countries per week.</P>
      <P>CAL executives said the suspension may be temporary. "We could
resume Kaohsiung-Manila flights the following day should the two
sides reach an agreement on the number on Monday," a CAL executive
said.</P>
      <P>According to a bilateral agreement sealed on Jan. 28 for
resumption of flight services between the two countries after a
hiatus of four months, Taiwan agreed to halve its maximum weekly
passenger traffic to 4,800 on the Taipei-Manila route.</P>
      <P>In CAL's view, the 4,800-seat ceiling does not cover the
passenger volume on the Kaohsiung-Manila route. Philippine civil
aviation authorities, however, think otherwise.</P>
      <P>The Philippine civil aviation commission on Friday asked CAL to
suspend its Kaohsiung-Manila flight services after a
temporary arrangement for Taiwan carriers to fly the route
expires on Feb. 20.</P>
      <P>The Philippine commission said it will decide whether to
allow Taiwan carriers to continue Kaohsiung-Manila services out
of the 4,800-seat weekly quota after consulting with the
Manila Economic and Cultural Office, which signed the Jan. 28
pact with Chan Hsien-ching, Taiwan's representative to Manila.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 4,800-seat quota for the Taipei-Manila route,
the Jan. 28 accord allows Taiwan's carriers to transport an
additional 1,000 passengers per week between Kaohsiung and Manila on
a temporary basis. The Kaohsiung-Manila arrangement will expire on
Feb. 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI REP. TO BANGKOK SHYS AWAY FROM PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN RALLY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei's representative to Thailand balked
at a dinner party hosted by the local Taiwanese community on Saturday
until posters supporting a Taiwan presidential candidate were removed
from the site.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsien-yung, head of the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in
Bangkok, the de-facto embassy of the Republic of China (ROC), arrived
at the event hall of the Taiwanese Association of Thailand for a
dinner party hosted by local Taiwanese to mark the Chinese Lantern
Festival.</P>
      <P>He was greeted warmly by the association's Chairman Chen
Shui-lung, but the former commander in chief of the ROC Air Force
balked at the door when he found there were many campaign posters for
Chen Shui-bian, the presidential candidate of Taiwan's Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Fearing his presence at the dinner party would be perceived as
tacit support for the opposition presidential candidate, and a breach
of the political detachment government officials are supposed to
maintain in the presidential election, Huang insisted that his host
remove the campaign posters and said he would wait in the association
chairman's office while the dining hall was cleared of the signs.</P>
      <P>Huang's demand angered Chen Shui-bian's staunch supporters among
the 500-odd party-goers, mainly Taiwanese business leaders working in
Thailand. They refused to remove the posters, saying the
representative is in no position to dictate the association's
preferences.</P>
      <P>However, in a gesture of compromise, they offered to hang up
campaign posters promoting presidential candidate Lien Chan of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT), of which Huang is a member, as a
counterbalance, but Huang stuck to his guns and would not budge.</P>
      <P>After an embarrassing standoff lasting one and a half hours, two
impatient Thai staff members of the association removed the posters
that offended the guest, after which time, Huang and his wife were
ushered into the dining hall amid loud applause by the party-goers.</P>
      <P>In his subsequent speech at the event, Huang urged his
compatriots not to turn against each other because of their different
preferences for candidates in the highly politically-charged
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Huang bid farewell to his host shortly after the dinner began.</P>
      <P>During an interview later with the Central News Agency, Huang
said that although he himself is a KMT member and a supporter of its
candidate Lien Chan, he would not interfere with the after-hours
political activities of his staff.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain the administration's political impartiality,
however, neither he nor his staff should campaign for their favorite
candidate in their official capacity, said Huang.</P>
      <P>He said he would not have taken part in Saturday's dinner had he
known it was a campaign rally supporting Chen's presidential bid, and
asked his host's forgiveness for his insistence on keeping his office
out of the political brawl related to the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Taiwan residents will go to the polls on March 18 to chose a new
president. The fierce competition among candidates of various
political parties in Taiwan has strained relations between their
respective supporters in overseas Chinese communities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>75% IN TAIWAN IN FAVOR OF '3 DIRECT LINKS' AFTER TWO SIDES JOIN WTO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 75 percent of Taiwanese are in favor
of direct links with mainland China after both sides of the Taiwan
Strait enter the World Trade Organization, a survey showed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Trendgo Survey Research Center as
commissioned by the Institute of China Studies. The center telephoned
Taiwanese people over the age of 20 at random on Feb. 17 and Feb. 18,
collecting 1,065 effective samples with a margin of error of 3
percent.</P>
      <P>Those polled were asked about three main topics: their
identification with the nation's policy toward mainland China, their
overall opinion about the presidential candidates, and their views on
Taiwan's future direction regarding its relations with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Regarding identification with Taiwan's mainland policy, the
survey found that 75 percent of those polled are in favor of "three
direct links" -- postal, trade and transportation -- with the
mainland after both sides of the Taiwan Strait join the World Trade
Organization, and only 16 percent are against the idea.</P>
      <P>Some 65 percent of those polled said they are in favor of opening
links between the offshore islands, such as Kinmen and Matsu, and the
coastal mainland for trade and shipping exchanges.</P>
      <P>Some 79 percent of respondents are in favor of the signing of a
peace agreement between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait so as to
officially end the cross-strait hostility and establish a "peace
zone" in the Taiwan Strait. Only 15 percent of those polled are
against the proposal.</P>
      <P>Some 83 percent of those surveyed said they think both sides of
the Taiwan Strait should sign an investment guarantee agreement,
while those opposed to the idea account for a meager 9 percent.</P>
      <P>One-fourth of respondents said that Taiwan should not try to join
the United Nations in order to avoid offending Beijing, but 64
percent disagreed.</P>
      <P>Asked their general opinions about the three main presidential
contenders, 36 percent of those surveyed said that if ruling
Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan, who is the current Vice President, is
elected president, there will be more stable cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The other two candidates -- independent James Soong and Chen
Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party -- trailed
behind with 21 percent and 11 percent, respectively, believing they
would bring greater stability.</P>
      <P>Some 40 percent of those polled said that if Chen is elected
president, war is more likely to flare up in the Taiwan Strait, while
8 percent said so regarding Soong and 3 percent answered similarly
about Lien.</P>
      <P>On future relations with the mainland, 22 percent of respondents
are in favor of speedy unification with the mainland or moving toward
that direction in the future, and 10 percent are in favor of
independence soon or sometime in the future, while 39 percent favor
the status quo or deciding the island's direction later. Some 17
percent said that Taiwan should retain its status quo permanently.</P>
      <P>Professor Chao Chun-shan of National Chengchi University, in
interpreting the survey, said that the results show that the people's
attitude toward the mainland is ahead of that of the government,
which has promoted the "go slow, be patient" policy regarding trade
and investment in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the ruling Kuomintang's Department
of Mainland Affairs Research, said on the same occasion that Lien's
mainland policy is more firm, steady and mature and more
middle-of-the-road as well as reliable, compared to those of the
other candidates, saying that Lien's policy better lives up to the
expectations of the public.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the poll showed that 65 percent and 79 percent
support the Kinmen and Matsu and Fujian peace zones, and the peace
zone in the Taiwan Strait, respectively, which were recently proposed
by Lien.</P>
      <P>Chang said that this shows that Taiwan people have high
expectations for peace in the Taiwan Strait, which should not be
achieved at the expense of national interests, as shown by the fact
that 64 percent of those polled said that Taiwan should seek to join
the UN despite the vehement opposition from Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The president of California Institute
of Technology told the school's Falun Gong Club that he is supportive
of their right to religious freedom, despite a request by the Chinese
Consulate that the group cancel a scheduled educational event.</P>
      <P>David Baltimore, who is also a Nobel laureate in the field of
biology, told the group: "I certainly support your right to practice
your faith."</P>
      <P>On Feb. 19, a Caltech Public Events Office manager received a
call from Liu Wansheng, who introduced himself as a consul of the
Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles, saying: "I am representing Chinese
government." Liu asked the manager to cancel a Feb. 20 seminar
sponsored by the Caltech Falun Gong Club to be held at the Pasadena,
California, campus. Liu said, "Falun Gong is illegal in China."</P>
      <P>Many people have read media reports about Chinese police
violating human rights and beating Falun Gong practitioners who
believe that characteristics of the universe are "truthfulness,
compassion and forbearance." What most people do not know is that the
Beijing regime has been working hard to influence policy and beliefs
in the United States.</P>
      <P>For example, the mayors of both Seattle San Francisco have had to
choose whether or not to follow instructions from the Beijing
government to withdraw awards they have issued to Falun Gong for its
support of business.</P>
      <P>Caltech had already rejected a request from Beijing to remove its
Falun Gong Club's website from the Internet. Beijing subsequently
blocked mainland Chinese access to the university's entire website
for several months, which caused great inconvenience to potential
students in China.</P>
      <P>"I really wanted to tell them this is an American university,"
said the manager of the Caltech Public Events Office, Ramanuj Basu,
who took the call on Feb. 19. But he refrained, and told the caller
that the issue should be handled by the student affairs office.</P>
      <P>Vice President for Student Affairs Chris Brennen was surprised to
hear the request from the Beijing government. He had seen event
flyers on campus and was invited to the seminar. Brennen said he
could not understand why the Beijing government wants to interfere
with a seminar of the Falun Gong Club, which simply promotes a
cultivation of morality and meditation practice.</P>
      <P>In a letter to John Li, the president of the Caltech Falun Gong
Club, Brennen said: "Let me assure you and the Caltech community that
Caltech has no intention of taking any action to interfere with the
lawful activities of the Caltech Falun Gong Club. Moreover we remain
committed to the free exchange of information throughout the world."</P>
      <P>Caltech President David Baltimore told Li: "I certainly support
your right to practice your faith."</P>
      <P>To prevent any interference with the seminar, Caltech's Security
Chief Gregg Henderson said he has already taken some precautionary
measures and hopes the event will be successful.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 210 illegal immigrants from mainland
China were repatriated from the offshore island of Matsu on Sunday,
as six wanted Taiwanese criminals who had sneaked into the mainland
were repatriated to Matsu.</P>
      <P>Officials with the detention center in Matsu said repatriation
operations had been suspended for six months, and that the detention
center had become too crowded over the period.</P>
      <P>After repeated requests, Beijing finally agreed to increase the
number of illegal immigrants to be repatriated to 210 -- 193 men and
17 women -- with the repatriation operation beginning at 9:30 a.m.
Sunday.</P>
      <P>As some of the illegal mainland immigrants have become homesick
after staying in Taiwan for more than six months, they returned in a
cheerful mood when they boarded the ship sent by the mainland.</P>
      <P>Beijing seemed to deal with the repatriation operation more
cautiously this time, sending officials to Fujian province to monitor
the operation process. In the past, it has left its semi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and Red Cross to
handle the matter.</P>
      <P>Some 263 illegal mainland Chinese immigrants in Matsu are still
waiting to be sent back to the mainland after the latest repatriation
operation.</P>
      <P>The repatriated Taiwan criminals will temporarily stay in Matsu,

      <P>Kuomintang presidential candidate Lien Chan
on Sunday pledged to build a safer Taiwan which respects the value of
human beings with sustained economic development.</P>
      <P>In the first of three nationally televised presentations
organized by the Central Election Commission, in which the candidates

ahead if elected. They are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- upgrading national defense, sticking to "aggressive defense,
effective deterrence," and avoiding war or the threat of war in the
Taiwan Strait;</P>
      <P>-- improving Taiwan's ties with mainland China and transforming
them from the "short-term phrase" into the "mid-term phase" as
stipulated in the Guidelines for National Unification, which center
on trust-building and cooperation between the two sides;</P>
      <P>-- encouraging the public's participation in the state's
diplomacy, ending the government's monopoly in this field, increasing
transparency in the national foreign aid mechanism, and boosting the
Republic of China's presence in the international community;</P>
      <P>-- creating a clean political environment, prohibiting
string-pulling by business tycoons and gangsters to influence
government decisions, and plugging holes in the law which make the
practice possible;</P>
      <P>-- boosting per capita annual income to US$30,000 by 2011, while
pressing ahead with the liberalization of the economy and the project
of making the island a business hub in the Asia-Pacific region;</P>
      <P>-- encouraging mergers of financial institutes, creating a fair
tax system, lessening the tax burden on wage earners, and harnessing
technology to improve agricultural development;</P>
      <P>-- giving all pre-school children the chance to go kindergarten,
extending the period of compulsory education from nine years to 12
years, getting rid of the current university entrance examinations,
making lifetime learning a priority, and adding a ministry of culture
to the Executive Yuan;</P>
      <P>-- creating a safe, stable and harmonized society, improving
women's rights to employment, education and participation in

bearing interest no more than 3.5 percent;</P>
      <P>-- continuing to build Taiwan into an island focused on science

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China could send its top
negotiator with Taiwan to the island after the March 18 presidential
election, a government official in charge of mainland policy said on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, made the remarks during a televised panel discussion which
included participation by Chang Lin-chen of National Taiwan
University, among others.</P>
      <P>Wu said that, based on various sources, he has learned that the
mainland could send Wang Daohan, chairman of the semi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, to Taiwan after
the presidential election, adding that Beijing is still mulling over
the timing of his visit.</P>
      <P>But Wu said that the mainland government is also carefully
assessing who will emerge as the winner in the election and what
negotiation strategy to take with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that there is no better way than negotiation to solve the
differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and that many
cross-strait issues could be solved through communication, dialogue
and consultation.</P>
      <P>He said that if Wang visits Taiwan, then the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait could return to institutionalized consultation, which
was disrupted after President Lee Teng-hui redefined cross-strait
ties as a "special state-to-state" relationship in July 1999.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if either the ruling Kuomintang candidate Lien
Chan or independent presidential candidate James Soong is elected,
the chance of Wang visiting Taiwan is more likely, but if Chen
Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party is elected,
because of his party's tilt toward Taiwan independence, then Beijing
could have more misgivings about sending Wang.</P>
      <P>Chang said that when Wang would visit Taiwan hinges on the
outcome of the election, saying that if Lien or Soong is elected,
because of their past advocacy of unification with the mainalnd, then
the chance of Wang's visit is greater.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Lien's 10-point proposal for Taiwan's policy toward
the mainland, which includes the establishment of a "peace zone in
the Taiwan Strait," is a visionary one, while Chang said that
policies of the five presidential candidates do not show much
variation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE CAN EASE CROSS-STRAIT TENSION: HSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential candidate Hsu
Hsin-liang on Sunday proposed that both Taiwan and mainland China
shelve their sovereignty dispute and promote economic and trade
cooperation to ease tension between them.</P>
      <P>In the first televised public speaking program arranged by the
Central Election Commission, Hsu also said that the best "political
defense" for Taiwan is for it to openly accept the "one China"
principle that has long been called for by mainland China, and for
both sides to sign a 50-year peace accord, allowing them to solve the
sovereignty issue 50 years in the future.</P>
      <P>He said that developments in world politics and mainland China's
military buildup have increasingly put Taiwan in an unfavorable
situation.</P>
      <P>For example, he noted, Washington-Beijing relations have improved
greatly as compared to four years ago, and US officials and
influential US think tanks have repeatedly warned Taiwan that the US
commitment to the security of Taiwan doesn't mean it will give Taiwan
"blank checks."</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hsu said that the best defense for Taiwan
is for both sides to ink an "interim agreement" as proposed by the
United States, in which Taiwan accepts the "one China" principle in
exchange for maintaining Taiwan's status quo for 50 years.</P>
      <P>Hsu, formerly chairman of the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, also lashed out at the government's ban on the
three direct cross-strait links as impractical, and called for its
immediate abolition and that of the conservative "go slow, be
patient" mainland investment policy as well.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, New Party presidential hopeful Li Ao said that the
campaign platforms of the four other candidates are all "unfeasible."
Li, however, came up short in delivering his own.</P>
      <P>Remarking on both his rivals and himself, the famous writer and
political observer said that the Kuomintang's Lien Chan is "not
aggressive," DPP's Chen Shui-bian is "dangerous" (for his support for
Taiwan independence), Hsu is "too idealistic," independent James
Soong is "relatively steady," and he himself is "great."</P>

Soong on Sunday found fault with the ruling Kuomintang nominee Lien
Chan for making one promise after another, saying that Taiwan will be
drowned in astronomical debts.</P>
      <P>Soong also blasted President Lee Teng-hui for creating tensions
in the Taiwan Strait, during the first of three television forums for
presidential candidates, which was aired live islandwide.</P>
      <P>Soong greeted the audience in Mandarin and various dialects,
before saying that he felt "disappointment and a twinge of
helplessness" about the picture of the nation envisioned by Lien, who
was the first to talk about his platform in the TV presentation, even
though he had stumped for the Lee-Lien ticket four years ago.</P>
      <P>Soong questioned whether the government has "upgraded" or
"retrograded," saying that in his campaign from north to south, he
has observed that the unemployment rate has hit a new high.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the government's efficiency in the post-quake
relief and rescue operations after the massive Sept. 21 temblor,
saying with irony that it was not pursued as thoroughly and
relentlessly as the investigation by the Control Yuan, the highest
watchdog body of the nation, into his financial dealings with the
Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corp.</P>
      <P>He also criticized Lien for not being able to popularize the use
of tap water on the island during his term as governor of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong said that when he first headed the Taiwan provincial
government, the coastal areas in Taoyuan had a popular
tap-water-usage rate of less than 30 percent, and that Checheng and
Linluo, two townships in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County, had no
tap water at all.</P>
      <P>But Soong said that the coastal areas have now have a use rate
for tap water of up to 90 percent, while the above-named two
townships have up to 95 percent usage rates.</P>
      <P>He also questioned what will become of the democratic development
of the nation, saying that the KMT has become more corrupt while the
DPP has become more tilted toward the KMT. The collaboration of the
two parties in the constitutional reforms has resulted in the
extension of the terms for the unpopular assembly members.</P>
      <P>On Lien's statement that he has turned the nation's finances from
red to black while heading the central government, Soong said that
the current debt incurred by the central government has exceeded
NT$2.4 trillion, which along with the yet-to-be-disclosed debt
amounts to nearly NT$6 trillion, adding that the local governments do
not have enough budget to cover their national health insurance fees.</P>
      <P>He blasted Lien for making one promise after another, and said
the accumulated debt will "drown Taiwan eventually."</P>
      <P>Soong also blasted President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of
cross-strait ties, saying that it has plunged cross-strait relations
into tension.</P>
      <P>He said that solving cross-strait differences will depend on the
easing of hostility and all-direction dialogue, saying that peace in
the Taiwan Strait is the aspiration of all.</P>
      <P>Soong said that if he is elected, he would seek the signing of a
non-aggression agreement with the mainland under the witness of the
United States and Japan and bring 50 years of peace to the island.</P>
      <P>On national defense, he said that he will ensure that Taiwan can
resist first- and second-wave attacks launched by the mainalnd, and
that he does not agree with Lien's idea of developing long-range
missiles which could reach Xinjiang and Mongolia.</P>
      <P>On diplomacy, he said that even if Taiwan can not join the United
Nations, which is more of a political issue, he will seek for the
nation to join economically oriented global associations, such as the
World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the government for announcing US$300 million
in assistance to Kosovo and its establishment of diplomatic
relations with Papua New Guinea, which he said had become a joke.</P>
      <P>Soong stressed that other candidates owe much to supporters in
their respective parties, but he owes much to the 22 million people
on the island, and that if he is elected, he will aim to make Taiwan
No. 1 in the world.</P>
      <P>Questioned after the TV presentation why he only criticized Lien
and spared Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, Soong
said that he had not heard Chen, who was third to make his
presentation, and that he will comment on Chen after listening more
in future TV forums.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC EYEING MARKETS ABROAD AS ITS MONOPOLY ENDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With oil products from Formosa Plastics
Group just around the corner, the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC),
Taiwan's sole distributor of oil products, is planning to begin
exporting to overseas markets, CPC sources said on Monday.</P>
      <P>CPC, which will no longer be the only oil producer and
distributor in Taiwan starting next month, is eyeing markets in
mainland China, Vietnam and Indonesia in order to deal with
competition at home for the first time.</P>
      <P>Formosa Group is scheduled to initially put its diesel oil on the
market in March, to a tune of around 1 million cubic liters, formally
ending CPC's monopoly in oil sales and distribution in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the government's policy of market liberalization, CPC will
meet fierce competition from Formosa, prompting the state-run company
to seek other markets aboard, said CPC President Pan Wen-yen.</P>
      <P>Pan admitted that CPC has targeted mainland China as a major
market for its products. Currently, although still in the
experimental stage, CPC delivers "a ship" of oil products to mainland
China every two months via Hong Kong, he noted.</P>
      <P>Although Indonesia itself is an oil-producing nation, Pan said,
the country needs to import diesel oil to meet domestic demand.
Vietnam, which only produces a limited amount of crude oil, also
needs to import oil products, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANDIDATES INVITED TO SPEAK ON WOMEN AFFAIRS-RELATED PLATFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 40 women's rights promotion groups
around the island formed an alliance on Monday to co-sponsor a
televised campaign forum for all five presidential candidates to
present their platform on women affairs.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that women's groups from a broad
spectrum of political and social interests have joined forces to push
all presidential hopefuls to expound their women affairs-related
campaign platform before the March 18 vote.</P>
      <P>Shih Chi-ching, head of the Warm Life Association for Women,
said the alliance has contacted all five presidential contenders
about the planned forum, tentatively scheduled for March 1.</P>
      <P>"Initial response from candidates is encouraging, with all of
them promising to seriously consider the invitation," Shih said,
adding that she hopes none of them would reject the invitation on
any excuse.</P>
      <P>Shih said she believes that nothing else is more important for
presidential candidates than "giving beef (presenting their views and
policies on major public issues)."</P>
      <P>Lamenting that Taiwan's legal protection for women's rights and
physical safety remains limited and primitive, Shih said she hopes
the country's future president will "promise a future for all local
women."</P>
      <P>Shih said the planned forum would be canceled if any single
candidate rejects the invitation. "I hope none of the presidential
aspirants would shun the challenge," she added.</P>
      <P>Su Chien-ling, chairman of the Awakening Foundation, said women
account for half of total eligible voters and that many of them have
not yet expressed their voting preferences.</P>
      <P>"We believe that there is still a great room for presidential
candidates to expand their support base in female population," Su
said, adding that the planned televised forum is an opportunity "too
good to miss" for presidential hopefuls to court "swing" women
voters.</P>
      <P>Su said each candidate must attend the forum in person, adding
that Public Television Service has agreed to televise the whole
event, slated for 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. on March 1.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that the forum will be held in line with four
basic principles: non-partisan, free of ethnic bias, no war of words
and focusing on women affairs policies.</P>
      <P>She further explained that the televised forum will adopt a
"middle-of-the-road" policy. "Five women representatives will pose
questions for all the five presidential candidates to reply in
turns," Su said, adding that all candidates can only explain their
own views or policy proposals and are banned from taking shots at
each other or posing questions to any other contender.</P>
      <P>A total of 37 women's rights groups, including the Warm Life
Association for Women, the Awakening Foundation, the Association for
the Promotion of Women's Rights and the Modern Women's
Foundation, have joined the "forum-promotion alliance," Su said,
adding: "Many other social groups are expected to join the alliance
in the coming days."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMOSA DIESEL EXPECTED TO TAP TAIWAN'S OIL MARKET IN MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Petrochemical is scheduled to put
its first oil product -- diesel fuel -- on the market in March,
formally ending the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.'s (CPC)
decades-old monopoly on Taiwan's oil market.</P>
      <P>Formosa Petrochemical, an offshoot of Formosa Plastics Group,
which was founded by Taiwanese plastics magnate Wang Yung-ching, will
be a "fierce" and "respectable" rival for CPC, according to local
market observers.</P>
      <P>After years of planning, construction and development, Formosa
Petrochemical's naphtha cracking plant is expected to begin its
commercial production at the end of this year, with the first diesel
oil coming on the market in March.</P>
      <P>The introduction of Formosa's diesel fuel, although only
representing a small fraction of the oil market, is actually a big
step in Taiwan's oil history. It represents the end of an era during
which petroleum oil, viewed as a vital aspect of national security
since World War II, has been under the government's total control
through its monopoly. It marks the beginning of open competition
between the state-run supplier and a private firm.</P>
      <P>Following the introduction of its diesel fuel on the market,
Formosa Petrochemical is scheduled to make petroleum of all kinds
available islandwide at its own gas stations beginning June, said a
company spokesman.</P>
      <P>Compared with CPC's giant workforce of 18,000 people, Formosa
Petrochemical has fewer than 3,000 employees. Stressing the
advantages of good management and a lean-and-mean workforce, Wang
Wen-chao, vice president of Formosa Petrochemical and the
British-educated nephew of Wang Yung-Ching, said that "in the future,
we'll compete with CPC not in price, but in services."</P>
      <P>Formosa Petrochemical's gas stations, with signs featuring boldly
colored swirls, circles, stars and tulip bulbs in the style of Henri
Matisse, are expected to open islandwide beginning in March.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTIGATION INTO SOONG'S CASE NOT TO AFFECT ELECTION: PROSECUTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The investigation into the legal case filed
against independent presidential candidate James Soong by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) will be based on the principle of not affecting the
upcoming presidential election on March 18, said a local prosecutor
on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hung Tai-wen, the prosecutor at the Taipei District Prosecutors'
Office who is in charge of taking action on the case, made the remark
in regard to reports that the prosecutors' office would delay hearing
the case after the official starting date of the presidential
election campaign, which fell on Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>Before the official campaign kick-off, handling of the so-called
"Chung Hsing Bills Finance Case" attracted much public attention,
including an additional tax bill sent by the Finance Ministry to
Soong, an investigation report made public by a Control Yuan special
task force, and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta's accusation that
the government watchdog body has become a KMT machine against Soong.</P>
      <P>However, in the wake of the official start of the campaign,
public interest in Soong's financial affairs has gradually declined.</P>
      <P>Hung said the prosecutors' office has come to no biased position
in advance concerning Soong's case, adding that it would take time to
make clear all the dealings and flows of the funds.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, recent reports indicated that the local
prosecutors' office would not act on the case until after the
election. Therefore, key figures in the case, including the former
deputy secretary of the Taiwan provincial government, Ma Chieh-ming,
and Soong's former secretary, Yang Yun-tai, were reportedly not to be
summoned before the election.</P>
      <P>Hung declined to confirm those reports.</P>
      <P>The KMT took Soong to court last Wednesday. The legal action
against the independent candidate involves charges of embezzling
NT$360 million and forgery, allegedly committed when he was
secretary-general of the KMT. Soong has denied both charges.</P>
      <P>Soong argued that the funds were entrusted to him by President
Lee Teng-hui in his capacity as KMT chairman. As for the charge of
forging documents in the name of the KMT, Soong said through his
legal team that all actions were within his powers as party
secretary-general.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND DENIES DISCLOSURE OF INTELLIGENCE CHANNELS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
denied on Monday that it has ever disclosed any of its intelligence
sources in its intelligence reports.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a US newspaper report that a
statement issued by Taiwan's defense ministry four years ago had led
to the execution of three mainland Chinese people who were part of a
crucial Taiwan spy network in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"The report is not true," an MND official said, stressing that
the ministry has consistently avoided implicating any intelligence
channels in its reports.</P>
      <P>The Washington Post reported on Sunday that mainland Chinese Maj.
Gen. Liu Liankun, his unnamed mistress, and Senior Col. Shao
Zhengzhong were executed in mainland China last September on charges
of spying for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, Liu was charged with tipping off Taiwan
that missiles fired by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) near the
island on March 8, 1996 as part of its live-fire war games carried
only dummy warheads.</P>
      <P>The PLA military exercises, held two weeks before Taiwan's
first-ever direct presidential election, were largely seen as an
attempt to warn Taiwan voters against voting for pro-independence
politicians.</P>
      <P>Eager to calm jittery Taiwan residents, the Washington Post said,
the MND issued a press release saying the mainland missiles were
unarmed.</P>
      <P>The Washington Post said the MND statement alerted Beijing to a
possible leak in its defense establishment and prompted an
investigation that culminated in the arrest and execution of Liu and
his espionage team.</P>
      <P>The prestigious US paper said the liquidation of the network was
a particularly heavy blow to Taiwan because Liu was "well-placed to
provide Taiwan with intelligence about China's military
capabilities."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Washington Post report, the MND said it issued
a total of 31 press releases concerning mainland China's military
activities during the PLA military exercise period in the run-up to
Taiwan's 1996 election.</P>
      <P>The MND said it had issued all those reports with an aim of
curbing ill-motivated rumors or misleading reports, as well as
allaying local people's misgivings.</P>
      <P>In releasing the reports, MND officials said, the ministry had
taken great care to avoid violating any military intelligence
regulations or revealing any of its intelligence channels.</P>
      <P>The officials further noted that all the MND press releases
issued during that period proved to be helpful in upholding morale
and confidence among local people and in maintaining domestic
stability. "The majority of local people also gave a thumbs-up to our
move," recalled an MND official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG-MANILA CAL FLIGHTS MAY NOT RESUME SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) may be unable
to resume flight services between Manila and the southern Taiwan port
city of Kaohsiung within the next few days, sources close to the
Republic of China's representative office here said on Monday.</P>
      <P>CAL resumed its Kaohsiung-Manila flights only on Feb. 16 after a
four-month hiatus because of a dispute over an ROC-Philippines
aviation agreement.</P>
      <P>However, the Philippine civil aviation commission informed CAL's
Manila office on Friday that the carrier should temporarily suspend
its Kaohsiung-Manila flights from Feb. 21 because the passenger load
allowed for Taiwan carriers has yet to be clarified.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office in Manila spent Monday negotiating
the issue with Philippine civil aviation authorities, but its efforts
were to no avail.</P>
      <P>Sources said the latest suspension of CAL services was the result
of the insistence by Philippine Airlines (PAL) Chairman Lucio Tan
that Taiwan carriers' total passenger load on Taipei-Manila and
Kaohsiung-Manila routes be limited to 4,800 seats per week.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Philippine civil aviation officials had
suggested that the ROC representative office in Manila "consult" with
Tan over the issue. "So long as Tan agrees, all problems (concerning
Taiwan-Philippines flight services) are settled," a Philippine civil
aviation administrator was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The sources further said Tan intends to force Taiwan to reopen
aviation rights talks with the Philippines by demanding that CAL
suspend its Kaohsiung-Manila flights.</P>
      <P>By so doing, the sources said, Tan wants to force Taiwan to
accept his demand that Taiwan carriers pay "royalties" to PAL when
the number of transit passengers they transport exceeds a specified
ceiling.</P>
      <P>If Tan succeeds in forcing Taiwan accept his demand, according to
the sources, he will then ask South Korean and Singaporean carriers
to follow suit.</P>
      <P>The sources also said Tan originally promised to pay a visit to
ROC Representative to Manila Chan Hsien-ching on Monday. However, Tan
did not honor his promise, and Chan was unable to get in touch with
him throughout the day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Eva Estrada-Kalaw, chairwoman of the Manila Economic
and Cultural Office, headed a five-member delegation on a visit to
Taipei. The office was founded by Philippine authorities to handle
relations with the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The delegation is expected to exchange views with relevant ROC
officials on aviation issues.</P>
      <P>Because of the suspension of its Kaohsiung-Manila flights, CAL
was forced to fly scores of passengers who had booked reservations to
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in northern Taiwan early on
Monday morning to connect with a CAL flight from Taipei to Manila.</P>
      <P>CAL and another major Taiwan carrier -- EVA Airways -- resumed
scheduled flights on the Taipei-Manila route earlier this month after
the two countries reached an agreement on Jan. 28 on the resumption
of direct airlinks.</P>
      <P>PAL, meanwhile, resumed regular Taipei-Manila flights on Monday.
But only CAL had resumed scheduled Kaohsiung-Manila flight services.
CAL offered 158 seats on its Kaohsiung-Manila flight. Between Feb. 16
and Feb. 20, the daily passenger load on each of CAL's
Kaohsiung-Manila flights was 50 percent to 60 percent of capacity.</P>
      <P>According to the Jan. 28 accord, the two sides agreed to continue
recognizing the 1966 aviation agreement, and allows Taiwan carriers
to sell a total of 4,800 seats per week on the Taipei-Manila route
and another 4,800 seats per week on the Kaohsiung-Manila route or
flights between Taiwan and Philippine cities other than Manila.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the pact, Taiwan dropped its demand for the
"fifth freedom," or the right to fly on to a third destination, and
Manila agreed not to prohibit Taiwan carriers from transporting
passengers to a third destination, provided that travelers transit in
Taiwan by switching airlines, changing planes or stopping over while
the plane's flight number is changed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEPT. 21 PEOPLE'S WEEKLY AIMS TO BE VOICE OF QUAKE VICTIMS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new newspaper, called the September 21
People's Weekly, which aims to become the voice of the victims of the
devastating earthquake that struck Taiwan on that date, was launched
on Monday.</P>
      <P>The new newspaper, based in a prefabricated housing unit in the
village of Tuniou in Shihkang Township, Taichung County, has only a
handful of staff members, with only five or six editors working at
any given time. Because of their small number, they have to serve
concurrently as staff writers and photographers, and most of them are
volunteers working without pay.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-chih, editor in chief of the newspaper, noted that
despite being published in a little-known village, it is hoped the
paper can offer consolation to the quake's harder-hit victims in
their efforts to reconstruct their homes.</P>
      <P>Lee said that 20,000 copies of the first edition of the
eight-page newspaper were printed, with three-quarters of those being
delivered to quake-affected victims by various volunteer workers and
the remaining one-fourth going to related government agencies.</P>
      <P>Discussion is now underway between Lee and the 7-11 chain of
convenience stores in an effort to expand the distribution network of
the newspaper.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the paper is being published in the weekly format
"due to limited staff and budget."</P>
      <P>The 43-year-old Lee runs a studio specializing in documentary
films. He is also a former member of the now-defunct Renchien (Hunan
World) magazine, an investigative reporting monthly.</P>
      <P>Lee said that after pitching in with quake-relief work for more
than three months, he has witnessed many small newspapers springing
up in the affected areas, adding that he felt that the papers needed
to work together to exert greater influence over public opinion on
how to help the stricken areas.</P>
      <P>So, after holding discussions with the heads of five or six of
those publications, Lee decided to publish a national newspaper for
the earthquake victims, aimed at helping "pool resources for the
quake-affected areas" as well as "monitoring the progress of the
government's post-quake reconstruction efforts."</P>
      <P>The members of the newspaper's editorial staff, most of whom also
hold jobs at other organizations, consider it their mission to
continue helping the victims after taking part in earlier
quake-relief efforts, even if others think they are crazy for doing
so.</P>
      <P>"We want to publish a national newspaper that is accessible to
quake-affected and non-affected people alike that will move them
after reading it," Lee said firmly.</P>
      <P>In order to embrace the quake-affected victims, the newspaper
hasn't set up its office like most major news media organizations,
even though "considering printing and distribution, it would be more
ideal to move the base to Taichung," said Lee.</P>
      <P>He has instead chosen the "poorly insulated, sweltering hot
prefabricated housing unit with no air-conditioner" as the paper's
base.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he expects the paper's NT$270,000 budget, which he
collected from a national quake-relief fund, will be able to cover
personnel expenditures for one season. Printing costs are being
temporarily supported by similar newspapers in the area.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lee said that journalistic writing seminars are being held
occasionally to help reporters sharpen their writing skills, and the
newspaper will also accept stories from individuals in the
quake-stricken regions, even though they may have limited reporting
skills, as "every day, there are numerous touching stories from the
area."</P>
      <P>Lee said his paper aims to set itself apart from more
conventional newspapers by trying to explore all sorts of issues in
the stricken areas to establish a public consensus in order to push
reconstruction projects to their conclusion.</P>
      <P>The theme of the newspaper's first edition is the issue of where
the vast amount of money donated to quake-relief efforts has been
allocated.</P>
      <P>Lee aspires for the newspaper to also serve in the role of
educating the people in the quake-stricken areas, observing that more
and more of them have become too dependent on outside resources.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that most of the stories and pictures in the
newspaper try to convey a sense that "one must save oneself before
seeking the assistance from others."</P>
      <P>For example, the first edition's front page photos show residents
paving roads and digging wells to improve their living conditions.</P>
      <P>Many publications in the quake-stricken areas have been faced
with the dire plight of no money and no personnel, but Lee is
preparing to stick it out till the end, saying that if he does not
insist on following this road, then the voice of the people in
quake-stricken areas would "gradually fade away."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAKES NO  INSTANT OFFICIAL RESPONSE TO BEIJING WHITE PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An aide to Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Su Chi said on Monday that the MAC will not make an instant
comment on the "one China principle and the Taiwan issue" white paper
just issued by Beijing.</P>
      <P>The sternly worded white paper warns Taiwan not to seek
independence or to indefinitely delay negotiations for a peaceful
unification, at risk of military invasion.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said that the white paper is an obvious attempt
by Beijing to influence Taiwan's March 18 presidential election, and
added that the MAC will not respond until a careful study of the
11,000-word document has been carried out.</P>
      <P>Government sources said that Beijing might take more action to
put pressure on Taiwan before election day, including a possible
statement by mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Taipei government has worked out a set
of strategies to meet any political, economic or military emergencies
so as to ensure a smooth election.</P>
      <P>The Beijing white paper threatens the use of force if Taiwan
declares independence or if it is "invaded by foreigners."</P>
      <P>It also states that "if the Taiwan authorities indefinitely
refuse to peacefully settle the reunification issue through dialogue,
the Chinese government will be forced to adopt all possible drastic
measures, including military force."</P>
      <P>However, Chang Jung-kung, director of the ruling Kuomintang's
Mainland Affairs Department, said in Bangkok that the white paper
contains no new substance, and is apparently designed to try to
influence the cross-Taiwan Strait policies of the five presidential
candidates, as well as spell out its firm stand on the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was visiting Bangkok to explain the mainland policy of
the KMT's presidential election ticket of Lien Chan-Vincent Siew to
the local Chinese community, said that Taiwan and the mainland have
not unified yet, and therefore have different views on the "one
China" principle.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that Beijing will return to the 1993
consensus which allowed differing interpretations of the "one China"
principle by each side of the strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Wu-yueh, director of the Institute for Mainland
China Affairs at Tamkang University, said that the new paper contains
nothing new, and has a paradox in its "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>He said that the main purpose for Beijing issuing the paper at
the present time is an attempt to caution against Taiwan independence
during the election campaign and to pave the way for peace talks
after the election.</P>
      <P>The paper notes that "anything can be taken up for discussion
under the one China principle," while reiterating that "Taiwan is
part of China, and the PRC is the sole legitimate government," which
Chang described as a paradox.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan's indefinite refusal to engage in peace
talks is listed in the white paper as a condition under which Beijing
will use force, and added that he believes Beijing will place more
focus on this point in the future.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiators for Taiwan's three leading
presidential candidates reached an agreement in principle on Monday
on televised public debates, but said details still had to be worked
out at a meeting scheduled for the following day.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate Lien Chan, Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian and independent
presidential candidate James Soong agreed through their deputies to
debate with each other in front of TV cameras on a one-to-one basis.</P>
      <P>Where and when the debates will be staged, and how they will be
conducted, was to be determined through further negotiations on
Tuesday, said the Formosa Journalist Association, which brokered the
agreement.</P>
      <P>Noting that public debate is designed to meet the public's right
to know under democracy, Legislator Ting Shou-chung, who represented
Lien in Monday's negotiations, said Lien and Chen should be the first
two rivals to meet in a public debate.</P>
      <P>Lien, who trails Soong and Chen in most public opinion polls, has
refused to confront in public any of his rivals other than Chen,
arguing that the presidential race should be a competition between
political parties rather than individuals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wen Chung-tao, a negotiator for Soong at Monday's
meeting, said his side welcomes any public debate, as long as they
are fairly organized and conducted.</P>
      <P>Ke Cheng-heng, Chen's deputy at Monday's negotiations, said the
debating pairs should be determined by drawing lots rather than by
the whims of Lien, and he urged Lien to approach the debate with an
open mind.</P>
      <P>Chen is said to be refusing to debate with the two long-shots in
the race -- independent candidate Hsu Hsin-liang and New Party
candidate Li Ao -- because of the fierce criticism of his policies
they have leveled in their campaign rallies.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Journalist Association apologized on Monday to Hsu
and Li for not including them in the public debate plan, but was
unable to assuage Hsu's anger. He protested at what he called the
association's servility toward the political establishment, and
blasted the association for betraying the cause of impartiality in
journalism for which it was founded.</P>
      <P>The former DPP chairman accused the association of trying to skew
the ballot in favor of Lien and Chen because the debate, expected to
be staged around March 10, will undoubtedly give the candidates of
the two major parties some free publicity very close to the polling
date of March 18.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TECH GROUP EMBRACING CHALLENGES OF NEW CENTURY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prestigious name in the fields of
electrical appliances and machinery since the 1960s, Tech Electric
and Machinery Co. is embracing the challenges of the new century with
an ambitious globalization drive and diversification projects, said
Tech Chairman Theodor Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang, speaking with full confidence about the industrial group's
prospects in the 21st century, said the company is ready to harvest
and return profits to all of its shareholders. He took over the
chairmanship in 1992 and has endeavored to transform the company by
diversifying its investments in that time.</P>
      <P>The Tech group began as a machine factory in Sanchung, suburban
Taipei in 1956 under the name Tung Yuan Electric &amp; Machinery Co. Ltd.
Tung Yuan became a famous brand name for motors and electrical
machinery in the 1970s. In the 1980s, the company entered into the
hi-tech sector and rapidly expanded its business overseas.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Tech's diversification into hi-tech industries,
as well as food-processing and infrastructure development, have
proved successful. He added that the company will not follow the path
of some more conventional manufacturing industrial groups which have
made their machinery divisions into holding companies.</P>
      <P>One of the company's new investment policies is to adjust its
long-term securities management. Huang elaborated that Tech learned
the importance of managing long-term securities last year when it's
share price dropped to a historic low of NT$20 at one point last
year. Huang added that recent investments in long-term securities
have become one of Tech Group's most profitable endeavors.</P>
      <P>In addition to investments in machinery and electrical
appliances, Tech Group has shown a lot of interest in key components
manufacturing, internet software and bio-technology.</P>
      <P>Tech's partners in some of its diversified investments include
Rebar Eastern Enterprise, KGT-Online Telecom Group, Seednet, Mosel
Vitelic, Taiwan Fixed Network, Mobitai Communications, Lien chang
Electronic Co., and Softchina Corp.</P>
      <P>The potential profit of the group's diversified investments were
estimated by Huang to be at NT$41,668 million, with a potential
investment return rate high as high as 570.87 percent.</P>
      <P>As the internet and internet-related sectors have become ever
more popular in Taiwan, Tech is keen on developing its E-commerce.
Information Technology Total Services, a Tech affiliate, and
Softchina Corp. are considered prospective blue chip companies in
Taiwan's internet software sector.</P>
      <P>Huang said the recovery of Southeast Asia from the financial
crisis has also helped Tech's business expansion overseas. Tech's
overseas investments cover the United States, England, Australia,
Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Playing an important role in Taiwan's high-speed railway project,
Tech also prides itself on being a leading enterprise in carrying out
various domestic infrastructure projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC GENERAL SAYS PEOPLE OF TAIWAN SHOULD CHOOSE THEIR LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While Communist China issued a stern
warning that it could resort to drastic measures if Taipei continues
to refuse to negotiate on reunification with the mainland, the PRC
air force commander said Monday that the people of Taiwan should
decide whom they want to elect as their president.</P>
      <P>Voice of America, the radio station that expresses US government
policy, reported Monday that Gen. Liu Shunyao commented at a
regional aviation show in Singapore that while Beijing aims to boost
its offensive capabilities, it would never threaten or invade another
sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that China is aiming to streamline its armed forces
and to enable its military to compete more successfully on a
high-tech battlefield.</P>
      <P>In his remarks, VOA pointed out, Gen. Liu did not mention Taiwan,
which Beijing regards as a province of China. However, he did speak
of the need for territorial integrity and "the unity of the Chinese
motherland."</P>
      <P>After his speech, reporters asked the general if Beijing planned
to try to intimidate Taiwan during next month's presidential
elections on the island. VOA quoted Liu as replying that the people
of Taiwan should decide whom they want to elect.</P>
      <P>But the radio station reminded its listeners that during Taiwan's
1996 presidential race, China held war games in the waters off
Taiwan, sending cross-strait relations to a low point.</P>
      <P>VOA added that Gen. Liu's statement came on the same day as
Beijing issued a stern warning to Taiwan, saying it could resort to
drastic measures if Taiwan continues to refuse to negotiate its
reunification with mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN TV REPORTS BEIJING'S MILITARY THREAT AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It isn't Taiwan's democratic election that
is attracting the Canadian media's attention, but instead Beijing's
military threat against the island, according to a Canadian
Television Network report Monday.</P>
      <P>"Today, the Communist government in Beijing issued a dramatic
ultimatum to the island to begin talking about reunification or
face military invasion," reported the CTV.</P>
      <P>The ultimatum came in the form of a news bulletin on state-run
television. China says it will be forced to used "drastic measures"
including military force if Taiwan delays negotiations aimed at
reunification, according to the CTV.</P>
      <P>The new demand significantly raises the stakes in the
half-century-old standoff, the CTV noted. Beijing in the past has
threatened Taiwan with force if the latter declared independence.
Now, the delaying of unification talks apparently is reason enough
for China to invade Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This new threat of force comes as the people of Taiwan prepare
for a presidential election and is meant to put pressure on the
candidates as well as on the voters, the CTV said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's entry into the World
Trade Organization may hit a snag due to Beijing's desperate attempt
to gain control over internet use and e-commerce, according to a
report by the Australian.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted WTO head Mike Moore as commenting during a
stopover in Singapore last week prior to his first visit to Beijing
that "countries that decide to erect barriers are countries that are
committing economic suicide, they are hurting themselves."</P>
      <P>But the Ministry of Information Industry in China responded by
warning that e-commerce growth would be held back until 2002.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the value of e-commerce trade in mainland
China was worth only US$30 million last year and is expected to surge
to US$120 million this year.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Western analysts as saying that by imposing
draconian controls over the internet, mainland Chinese authorities

    <HEADLINE>LIEN PROMISES TO DONATE SUBSIDY TO SOCIAL GROUPS IF ELECTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan, the presidential
candidate of the ruling Kuomintang, said on Tuesday that if elected,
he would donate the entire amount of any subsidy he receives from the
Central Election Commission (CEC), in order to assist needy social
groups.</P>
      <P>The CEC has stipulated that any presidential candidate who
garners more than one-third of the number of votes received by the
winning candidate, will be eligible for a subsidy of NT$30 (US$0.97)
from the CEC for every vote received.</P>
      <P>Lien made the announcement while receiving Sung Chin-chung and
Chang Yung-kun, the two youths who had suggested that he donate the
money to needy social groups.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that their idea was both compassionate and creative,
and said he would be happy to comply with their wishes. He said he
will donate the subsidy to help women, the disabled, low-income
families, and the elderly, if he is elected.</P>
      <P>After Lee Teng-hui won the 1996 presidential election, he and
Lien used the subsidy received at that time to establish an
educational foundation to nurture Taiwan's youth.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it is understood that some of the money involved in
independent presidential candidate James Soong's financial dealings
with the Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corp., which are presently under
investigation, is part of the subsidy he collected after running for
the office of Taiwan provincial governor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHARE PRICES PLUNGE DUE TO NEW THREAT FROM M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hit by the news of fresh military
intimidation from mainland China, Taiwan share prices tumbled 1.8
percent on Tuesday, with all eight major stock categories closing
with serious losses.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index shed
180.74 points to finish at 9,860.12, a further dip after the index
fell under 10,000 points in the previous trading session. The
turnover totaled NT$197.5 billion (US$6.4 billion), with 5.21 billion
shares changing hands.</P>
      <P>The index opened lower amid news of mainland China's issuance of
a new white paper warning Taiwan that it wants unification talk or
war, and at one point the index even plunged to 9,596.68 points, with
investors liquidating their share holdings of speculative low-priced
traditional manufacturing industries to take profits.</P>
      <P>Beijing's latest warning was made in a policy paper issued
Monday. Apart from its long-standing policy of reserving the right of
military attack if foreign forces meddle or if Taiwan formally
declares independence, Beijing authorities this time added a new
precondition for an attack: Taiwan's foot-dragging on unification.</P>
      <P>Investors did later shift some capital back to electronics issues
with solid economic fundamentals to bargain-hunt for relatively low-
priced issues after the index fell under 9,600 points, a move which
helped ease the sharp losses.</P>
      <P>According to dealers, the stock market so far has not experienced
any large-scale consolidation after enjoying bullish sentiment and
solid gains for over 10 weeks, amid the government's favorable
policies aimed to lift up the index before the upcoming presidential
election on March 18. Tuesday's consolidation, therefore, is good for
the future development of the stock market, dealers said.</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories reported losses, with cement
issues suffering the most, ending with a 5.5-percent fall.
Construction issues, foodstuff shares and financial issues also
posted losses at 4.7 percent, 3.8 percent and 3.8 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Decliners led advancers 489 to 89, with 22 issues remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) also experienced poor performance, all closing with losses.
September and December futures reported no transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for March lost 145 points to finish at 9,875,
with 4,247 contract transactions. Those for April shed 167 points to
close at 9,913, with 150 contract transactions, while those for June
dipped 224 points to finish at 10,026, with 27 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Tuesday were 10,020
points for March, 10,080 points for April, 10,250 points for June,
10,220 points for September, and 10,331 points for December.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, reported gains and losses, respectively.</P>
      <P>March TE futures rose 2.5 points to close at 489, with 1,061
contract transactions; April TE futures moved up 3.5 points to close
at 495, with 12 contract transactions; and June TE futures moved up 7
points to close at 512, with five contract transactions.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for September or
December.</P>
      <P>March TF futures shed 25 points to close at 1,165, with 637
contract transactions; April TF futures moved down 48 points to close
at 1,191, with four contract transactions; and June TF futures shed
42 points to close at 1,192, with one contract transaction. No
transactions were recorded for TF futures for other months.</P>

      <P>The president of the American Chamber of
Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei said on Tuesday that Taiwan will continue
to maintain its good investment environment no matter who wins the
March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Paul Cassingham told the Central News Agency that Taiwan will not
be affected by Monday's announcement of the "One China principle and
the Taiwan issue" white paper by Beijing, because there was no change
in Beijing's basic position on that issue.</P>
      <P>AmCham held a regular luncheon meeting on Tuesday, and invited
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou to speak on the development of the city.</P>
      <P>When asked by CNA to comment on Beijing's "one China" white
paper, Cassingham noted that he does not think it would deal a
serious blow to the cross-Taiwan Strait relationship, as Beijing has
long insisted on that policy.</P>
      <P>In the white paper, Beijing reiterated that Taiwan is part of the
People's Republic of China, and that it might use force if Taiwan
seeks independence or is invaded by a foreign power.</P>
      <P>It also warned that if Taiwan authorities indefinitely delay
dialogue for reunification, mainland China might take drastic action,
including the use of military force.</P>
      <P>Regarding Taiwan's presidential election, the AmCham chief said
that he is not in a position to indicate his view on who is the best
choice.</P>
      <P>But he did say that he believes Taiwan's investment environment
will continue to be sound no matter who becomes the new president, as
Taiwan's economy will continue to grow.</P>

recipients of ROC economic assistance, also wish to court greater
Taiwan investment.</P>

      <P>The New Taiwan dollar moved down NT$0.084
against the greenback on the Taipei Foreign Exchange market on
Tuesday to close at NT$30.791 to the US dollar, the lowest level in a
month.</P>
      <P>A total of US$419 million changed hands. The greenback opened at

      <P>According to Taipei exchange dealers, the NT dollar suffered
heavy devaluation pressure in the day's session, as it was affected
by renewed cross-strait tension. The devaluation trend was softened
after the Central Bank of China (CBC) stood up to express its
determination in stabilizing the NT dollar.</P>
      <P>With long-term solid economic fundamentals and the continual
inflow of foreign capital, the NT dollar is expected to rise despite
Tuesday's accidental fall due to the non-economic factor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR INTERPRETS BEIJING'S WHITE PAPER ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The purpose of the "White Paper on Taiwan"
issued by Beijing on Monday is mainly to sound its key note of "one
China," said Chou Shi-hsiung, a professor at National Sun Yat-sen
University.</P>
      <P>Chou deemed that Beijing's new policy statement would not have
much impact on the result of the island's presidential election,
which will be held on March 18.</P>
      <P>He suggested that a rational, stable and middle-of-the-road
election campaign strategy would be welcomed by the voters.</P>
      <P>Though Beijing has in the past repeatedly said it would use force
if Taiwan is invaded by a foreign force, proclaims independence or is
troubled by internal chaos, this marks the first time mainland China
has stated so clearly that if Taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse
to peacefully settle the reunification issue, Beijing would be forced
to adopt all possible "drastic measures," including military force.</P>
      <P>However, Chou pointed out that no matter how strong and tough the
Beijing authorities' wording may be, the paper is basically a warning
rather than a substantial threat. This is due to the fact that
Beijing has never mentioned under what conditions it would renounce
the use of force against Taiwan regarding the reunification issue, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the timing of the white paper is aimed primarily
at expressing Beijing's wish that Taiwan's new president not walk out
on the "one China" framework, thereby defining Taiwan's March 18
presidential election as a local election. The white paper has warned
that the reunification issue must be dealt with as a top priority by
Taiwan's new leader, he continued.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan should not be panicked by Beijing's new
policy statement, Chou stressed, adding that, rather, now is a good
time for Taipei to demonstrate to the international community its
willingness to work for peaceful resolution of cross-Taiwan Strait
issues.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  22   (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Veteran US Senator Jesse Helms on
Tuesday blasted Beijing over its white paper on the Taiwan issue and
criticized the White House for its lukewarm attitude toward Taiwan's
defense.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued Tuesday, the Republican senator from North
Carolina said he is "deeply concerned by today's revelations that Red
China has escalated its threat of armed aggression against democratic
Taiwan, lowering the threshold by which Beijing would justify an
invasion of the island."</P>
      <P>Helms was talking about Beijing's sternly worded white paper on
the Taiwan issue, which warns Taiwan not to push for independence or
indefinitely delay negotiations for peaceful unification at the risk
of military invasion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Helms said he is "extremely disturbed" that "in light
of these new and disturbing threats from Beijing, the Clinton
administration has refused to testify before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Wednesday on Taiwan's annual defense request."</P>
      <P>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee originally scheduled a
closed-door hearing on Taiwan's defense request for Wednesday and
according to Helms, had filed a request with the State Department in
writing on Jan. 21 that the Department cooperate by sending a
"competent, well-informed witness" to testify at the hearing.</P>
      <P>The proposed hearing, which has been unilaterally supported by
the committee's members from both the Republican and Democratic
parties, was described as an "upgrading" of consultations on Taiwan's
cause between the legislature and the administration.</P>
      <P>The hearing, however, was postponed indefinitely after the
legislature and the administration failed to reach a consensus on
participation.</P>
      <P>In his statement, the apparently disappointed Helms said "I
wonder what the problem is; Does the State Department have no one who
is competent or well-informed? I am willing to conduct the hearing in
closed session, but this committee needs and is entitled to know what
the administration plans regarding Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"I resent being brushed off at the last minute and I will bear in
mind this experience the next time the State Department asks
something of me," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON WOULD VIEW SERIOUSLY ANY ATTACK ON TAIWAN SAYS BACON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Defense Department would view
the use of force against Taiwan with grave concern and would consult
with Congress over the appropriate response, Pentagon spokesman
Kenneth Bacon said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's just-released white paper on the Taiwan issue, Bacon
said during a regular Pentagon briefing that the Defense Department
feels the same way the White House does and the Pentagon would view
very seriously any attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing the United States' clear one-China policy, which
insists that disputes between China and Taiwan should be settled
peacefully, Bacon said any disputes about the timing of unification
between China and Taiwan should be resolved peacefully. "So we reject
threats about the use of force," he added.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese have issued a white paper that contains some
rhetorical threats, but we don't think those threats are helpful,"
Bacon said, adding that as the threats are merely rhetoric at this
stage, the Pentagon plans no change in force dispositions and no
change in naval dispositions in the area.</P>
      <P>"Obviously, we'll watch this situation very closely," Bacon
noted.</P>
      <P>When asked if China were to ever make good on its threat and
attack Taiwan because of Taiwan's failure to set any sort of firm
deadline on unification, would the US come to the aid of Taiwan,
Bacon said there are a number of hypothetical questions there, but
"let me stick to the facts, and the facts are the Taiwan Relations
Act."</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan Relations Act says that we would view the use of
force with grave concern, any use of force with grave concern, and we
would consult with Congress over the appropriate response," Bacon
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bacon noted that the Pentagon assessment that it would
be extremely difficult for China to carry out an invasion against
Taiwan has not changed.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question about whether there has been any
detected increase in the sea-lift capability of the Chinese military
that would increase its ability to take Taiwan, Bacon repeated that
there has not been any significant change in mainland China's
amphibious capability.</P>
      <P>Bacon pointed out, however, that the fact that China is improving
its military should come as no surprise. "It was one of Deng
Xiaoping's `four modernizations.' It happened to be the last
modernization they got to. Now they are devoting more attention to it
than they were 10 or 15 years ago," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US REJECTS BEIJING'S THREAT OF FORCE AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States government stressed
Tuesday that it rejects any use of force or any threat of force in
resolving the Taiwan issue, saying Communist China's latest threat is
"counterproductive and unhelpful," but added that there is no
consideration being given to a change in the US policy on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We believe that peaceful dialogue and bilateral engagement
between the two sides is the best way to move forward. Any suggestion
that this situation can be resolved through the use of force...is
something that our policy opposes," said White House Press Secretary
Joe Lockhart during a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, State Department spokesman James Rubin said that "we
do note with concern China's statement in this document that an
indefinite delay in cross-strait negotiations would be a reason to
use force. The threat is contrary to the commitments contained in the
(three) communiques that form the bedrock of our policy."</P>
      <P>He added that "in our very clear view, issues between the two
sides should be resolved peacefully. So we reject the use of force or
the threat of the use of force as a way of resolving the Taiwan
question."</P>
      <P>As a result of the Beijing white paper, Rubin pointed out, the
Clinton administration has communicated to China its view and the
importance it attaches to urging both Beijing and Taipei to refrain
from actions or statements that increase tensions, and instead take
steps to foster dialogue, reduce tensions and promote mutual
understanding.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that "it is up to China and Taiwan to determine
what the basis for dialogue is, but we certainly have an abiding
interest in a peaceful resolution."</P>
      <P>Rubin refused to speculate on whether Beijing's white paper is a
reaction to President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state
relations" comments last fall or a warning to Taiwan voters ahead of
next month's presidential elections, saying "that is obviously
something that only the Chinese themselves can know."</P>
      <P>Asked what would happen as a result of any military movements or
actions by China, Rubin replied that "we have a long-standing policy
in this regard and that is, based on the Taiwan Relations Act. We
would consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other
than peaceful means a threat to the peace and stability of the
Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States."</P>
      <P>Under the Taiwan Relations Act, he explained, "the president and
Congress will determine any appropriate action by the United States
under the circumstances."</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the US government is prepared to
review its policy toward China and Taiwan, especially with regard to
arms sales to Taiwan, in light of the latest Chinese threats, Rubin
said "we have been second to none in our support for Taiwan and the
Taiwan Relations Act codifies a level of support unique in the world.
We believe this has made a difference, as recently as 1996, and so
nobody should doubt our willingness to act in our own national
interest."</P>
      <P>Rubin stressed, however, that US decisions on arms sales to
Taiwan are "a complex calculus," that they are made based on a
strategic judgments about what is appropriate for the defense of
Taiwan, and that "isn't necessarily affected by any one statement in
a white paper."</P>
      <P>He added that "I am sure there are some in this government and in
Congress and in other governments who may have opinions that differ
on particular points, but there is no consideration given to a change
in our Taiwan policy. We remain fervently against and in opposition
to the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which we believe will harm
our national interests by jeopardizing an arrangement that has served
us extremely well."</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan is on a collision course with both
Australia and New Zealand after rejecting Canberra's demand for the
creation of a whale sanctuary in the South Pacific and then hitting
back at Wellington's accusations that Tokyo was trying to shore up
the whaling vote through its "cheque book diplomacy."</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald in Tokyo, Japan's
delegate to the International Whaling Commission, Minoru Morimoto,
was quoted as rejecting flatly an Australian demand for the whale
sanctuary, saying there is no scientific or practical rationale for
the proposal.</P>
      <P>He said Australia and other countries were influenced by a
handful of environmental protection groups using inaccurate analysis
and emotional propaganda.</P>
      <P>Morimoto's remarks signify a significant rejection of the appeal
for Japan not to use its clout to prevent the IWC from approving the
sanctuary at the forthcoming conference in Adelaide, South Australia
this coming June, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The IWC has imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling since
1982, but Japan has used a clause within the IWC's charter permitting
scientific whaling in order to kill about 440 mink whales a year,
most of which end up on Japanese supermarket shelves or in
restaurants, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN  REGISTERS  RECORD  HIGH JANUARY EXPORT ORDERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's January, 2000 export orders
totaled US$10.87 billion, a record high level for that month,
according to statistics released on Wednesday by the Statistics
Department under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Seemingly unaffected by seasonal factors, Taiwan's January export
orders registered a growth of US$1.07 billion (10.86 percent) from
that of the same period last year, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>MOEA sources attributed the sound performance to an improvement
of the global economy and expanded demand for electronics and
information products.</P>
      <P>Electronics products dominated the export orders, increasing by
US$530 million, or 33.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Export orders from the United States in January totaled US$3.56
billion, an increase of US$80 million, or 2.36 percent, over the
year-earlier level. Of this figure, electronics product orders
recorded the highest growth of US$200 million, followed by plastics
and rubber product orders, at US$60 million.</P>
      <P>Export orders from Hong Kong reached US$1.96 billion, an increase
of US$320 million, or 19.49 percent. Of them, information and
communication product orders registered the highest growth of US$90
million, followed by plastics and rubber product orders, at US$80
million.</P>
      <P>Export orders from Japan stood at US$1.09 billion, an increase of
US$120 million, or 12.11 percent. Of them, electronics product orders
recorded the highest growth of US$80 million, followed by information
and communication product orders, at US$60 million.</P>
      <P>Export orders from Europe amounted to US$2 billion, an increase
of US$260 million, or 15.17 percent. Of them, electronics product
orders enjoyed the highest growth of US$150 million, followed by
transport tools and equipment, at US$30 million.</P>
      <P>Chang said that domestic semiconductor manufacturers have raised
their product prices and expanded their capacities. The prevailing
trend of strategic alliances and mergers among electronics and
information industries will add to the competitiveness of domestic
electronics and information industries, and will be beneficial to the
growth of the nation's export orders in the first quarter, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAILS US STANCE ON PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO TAIWAN STRAIT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China welcomes the US
reiteration of its stance on peaceful solution to the Taiwan Strait
issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a statement from the White House
that the United States views any threat to Taiwan with "grave
concern" and rejects any use of force or any threat of force over the
Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart made the statement
during a routine news briefing on Tuesday while commenting on
mainland China's newly unveiled white paper on the so-called "one
China principle and the Taiwan issue."</P>
      <P>Lockhart said the US government believes that peaceful dialogue
and bilateral engagement between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
is the "best way to move forward."</P>
      <P>Asked about Lockhart's remarks, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said
the US stance is consistent with the ROC's basic policy toward
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We have repeated that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
forge goodwill and cooperation through exchanges and dialogue, and
should resolve any bilateral disputes or differences by peaceful
means," Chen said, adding that the ROC welcomes the latest US
reaffirmation of its insistence on peaceful settlement of any
cross-strait issue.</P>
      <P>In its 11,000-word "white paper" released on Monday, Beijing
threatened to use "drastic measures, including military force" if
Taiwan delays "indefinitely" on unification talks.</P>
      <P>The policy paper was apparently designed to pressure candidates
and voters ahead of the ROC's March 18 presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Chen said Beijing's move will only hinder progress in
cross-strait relations, adding that Beijing's denial of the ROC's
existence can only bring "more trouble to cross-strait ties and
deepen tension."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S LABOR PARTICIPATION RATE DROPS TO RECORD LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While Taiwan's unemployment rate declined
in January, its labor participation rate dropped to a record low,
government sources said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>On average, Taiwan's labor participation rate was 57.92 percent
in the first month of 2000, the lowest level in Taiwan's history,
said officials from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting &amp;
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The labor participation rate is the ratio of the working
population to the population aged 15 and over.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the record-low labor participation
rate mainly to the decreased number of women working as many females
quit their jobs after marrying or giving birth.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate stood at 2.74 percent in January,
marking a slight decline of 1.11 percentage points from December's
rate and 0.02 percentage points from the previous January's figure,
according to the latest DGBAS tallies.</P>
      <P>January's 2.74 percent jobless rate marked the first decline in
this regard since June 1997 when the Asian economic crisis began to
batter the Asia-Pacific region, indicating that the adverse impact of
the regional economic turmoil on Taiwan's job market has cleared
away, the DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS tallies, the number of jobless people in
Taiwan decreased by 12,000 from December to 267,000 in January.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the lower unemployment rate in January
to economic recovery on the island due to exports picking up steam.</P>
      <P>The statistics also showed that Taiwan's workforce totaled 9.49
million people at the end of January, down 4,000 over the figure
recorded on Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS meanwhile readjusted the country's overall economic
growth upward to 6.54 percent for the year 2000 on the grounds that
all economic activities continue to grow. Based on this, they also
estimated that the annual unemployment rate may also decline further,
to a level lower than the originally-estimated 2.8 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN  CAPITAL TO FEED  BULLISH  TAIWAN STOCK MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign capital will be the prime mover
behind the momentum to shore up the Taiwan stock market, foreign
brokerage sources said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sources made the observation after news that foreign
institutional investors have overbought Taiwan stocks by more than
US$2.6 billion since the beginning of the year, a phenomenon which
they said has been rarely seen since the government eased a ban on
foreign investment in the local bourse.</P>
      <P>They noted that the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI),
which specializes in stock market analysis and advising investors,
announced in November that it would gradually raise its weighting of
Taiwan stocks on its influential indices -- Emerging Markets Free and
All Country Free, which includes All Country Far East Free Ex-Japan
-- to around 65 percent in May from the present 50 percent and
eventually to 100 percent next year.</P>
      <P>Following the MSCI cue, foreign institutional investors have
begun pumping up the Taiwan bourse, analysts said, causing marked
appreciation of the new Taiwan dollar since the beginning of the
year.</P>
      <P>They predicted that with the continued inflow of foreign capital,
the local currency will break the NT$30 barrier threshold, and may go
as far as NT$29.5 to the greenback.</P>
      <P>Why are foreign institutional investors displaying such a keen
interest? Peter Kurz, president of Merrill Lynch Taiwan, notes that
Taiwan has emerged largely unscathed from the regional financial
crisis which began in mid-1997.</P>
      <P>Kurz said that while Southeast Asian countries, along with Japan
and South Korea, were battered during the financial storm, Taiwan
managed to avoid the economic disaster, showing that Taiwan is a
strength to be reckoned with.</P>
      <P>Kurz stressed that MSCI's announcement that it will raise the
weight of Taiwan stocks in its influential indices, has been the
catalyst for foreign investors to jump into the Taiwan bourse.</P>
      <P>He noted that MSCI is an authoritative investment consultancy,
and its words mean a lot to fund operators around the world.</P>
      <P>With MSCI's announcement, and the continued robustness of
Taiwan's fundamentals, foreign institutional investors have continued
to pump in their money, analysts said, noting that foreign
institutional investors overbought Taiwan stocks to the tune of US$10
billion 1999, and that the figure to increase to US$15 billion this
year.</P>
      <P>ABN AMRO Asia Investment Consultancy (Taiwan), Ltd. estimates
that foreign institutional investors held US$42 billion-worth of
Taiwan stocks at the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>It predicts that the market value of Taiwan stocks held by
foreign institutional investors could reach US$65 billion. Among
them, new overbuying accounts for US$13 billion, while stock trading
profits account for US$10 billion, illustrating the high earn-return
rate for foreign investors.</P>
      <P>So which shares in the Taiwan stock market are the favorites
among foreign investors? Foreign brokerages say that blue-chip issues
are on the top pick list.</P>
      <P>Nathan D. Emerson, ABN AMRO country chief executive director,
stresses that there is only one Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corp. (TSMC), and only one United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) in the
world, but that combined they produce more than 70 percent of the
world's semiconductors.</P>
      <P>Kurz concurs that foreign institutional investors often begin
their investment in the Taiwan bourse by buying TMSC and UMC, and
says that the two companies are well-known and the market value of
the two stocks accounts for a large part of the Taiwan bourse.</P>
      <P>Analysts also note that TMSC stocks are listed on the New York
Stock Exchange in the form of American Deposit Receipts (ADRs), which
were selling at US$56.50 on the NYSE on Tuesday, and say this is also
a major indicator.</P>
      <P>Foreign brokerages say that Taiwan has set strict regulations for
foreign capital entering the stock market, and that because it is
hard for them to apply to become a qualified foreign investment
institution (QFII), foreign investors have no alternative but to
buy the much more expensive ADRs.</P>
      <P>The brokerages say that most of the QFIIs in Taiwan are largely
emerging market stock funds, or regional funds, and they expect that
future QFIIs which land in Taiwan will be global equity funds and
global high-tech funds, adding that after the heavyweights come to
Taiwan, the buying power of foreign capital will be stronger.</P>
      <P>ABN AMRO said that 70 percent of current foreign investment
focuses on electronics shares, and it forecasts that after
global equity funds and global high-tech funds land in Taiwan, they
will also set their eyes on electronics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING WILL FACE `INCALCULABLE CONSEQUENCES:' US OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Undersecretary of Defense Walter
Slocombe on Tuesday warned Beijing that it faces "incalculable
consequences" if it follows through on its threat of force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Slocombe, who, along with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, has just ended two days of high-level security talks in
Beijing, was quoted by the Washington Post as saying of the mainland
Chinese policy statement carried in Beijing's "white paper" on the
Taiwan issue: "If it says what it appears to say, is a new and
troubling formula."</P>
      <P>Beijing released the sternly worded document just six hours after
Talbott and Slocombe left. It warns Taiwan not to push for
independence or indefinitely delay negotiations for peaceful
unification at the risk of "drastic measures," including military
invasion.</P>
      <P>The issuance of the white paper took both the US administration
and legislature by surprise.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman James Rubin said that during their
"intense" security talks in Beijing, Talbott and Slocombe did discuss
the issue of Taiwan with high-level Chinese officials, including Vice
Premier Qian Qichen and Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Rubin said, Beijing did not say a word about
its intention to issue the white paper soon. However, he refused to
characterize the visit to Beijing by the Talbott delegation as a
failure.</P>
      <P>Ironically, Talbott and Slocombe attempted during the talks to
persuade Beijing to exercise self-restraint in the run-up to Taiwan's
March 18 presidential election, according to the Washington Post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEAVY RAIN TO CONTINUE OVER WEEKEND: CWB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) continued
to issue a heavy rain warning on Wednesday for Taiwan's central,
northern and northeastern parts, saying that heavy rains will
continue to drench the island over the next three days.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, the current cold front hanging over Taiwan
will not leave until Saturday, and the temperature will continue to
fall, probably to 12 degrees Celsius, in the days ahead.</P>
      <P>The heavy rain which has fallen unabated since the weekend has
already caused serious damage to several mountainous areas, and the
CWB called on residents of central Taiwan to remain on high alert
over the possibility of landslides triggered by the rain.</P>
      <P>Many mountainous villages and freeway sections islandwide have
been damaged by the rain, particularly in central Nantou County and
southern Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>On Monday, a traveler was killed by a falling rock in Nantou
County's Jenai village, while a nine-month-old baby girl was also
killed by a falling rock on Tuesday in the county's Chungliao
village.</P>
      <P>At the same time, hundreds of residents of villages across Nantou
and Chiayi counties have been trapped by mudslides over the past
three days, and some of them have had to flee to safer ground after
losing electricity and water supplies.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew, concerned about the damage caused by the
rain, has instructed Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan to take effective
measures to prevent further damage and inundation.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, relevant government authorities convened an
emergency meeting on Wednesday morning, at which it was decided to
send task force personnel and equipment to help with disaster relief
operations in central Taiwan areas such as Nantou and Taichung
counties, which were hard hit by the Sept. 21 earthquake last year,
and in eastern Hualien and Taitung counties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LATEST  MAINLAND  CHINA  THREATS  TO TAIWAN IRK US CONGRESS MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several members of the US Congress on
Tuesday criticized Beijing for once again threatening to use military
force against Taiwan, and called on the Clinton administration to
react more strongly to such intimidation.</P>
      <P>Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, said he was "deeply concerned about China's latest effort
to intimidate Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"The administration's policy of accommodation toward Beijing is
proving to be ineffective and is destabilizing the region," he said
in a statement. "A firmer stance toward Beijing is required."</P>
      <P>Gilman's counterpart in the Senate, Jesse Helms, expressed
similar concerns.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that
by issuing a white paper on the "one China" principle, Beijing "has
escalated its threat of armed aggression against democratic Taiwan,
lowering the threshold by which Beijing would justify an invasion of
the island."</P>
      <P>At a hearing before the Senate Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee,
a senior administration official came under fire for failing to react
more strongly to the white paper.</P>
      <P>John Kerry (D-MA) said that the threats contained in the white
paper are "unacceptable."</P>
      <P>He said that he was "disappointed" at the comments made at the
hearing by Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth, and added that
the United States "has to be very clear" with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Roth said the threat of the use of force runs "contrary to the
commitments contained in the communiques" between the United States
and mainland China and the long-standing US position that differences
between Taiwan and the mainland should be resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>Kerry, ranking minority member on the subcommittee, also said
that the white paper is "a most inadvisable and unfortunate statement
with potential serious implications to America's own policies over
the course of the next months."</P>
      <P>He was referring to the administration's effort to seek
Congressional approval for granting permanent normal trade relations
with the United States to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Senate minority leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) said that he was "very
concerned" about the implications for relations between Washington
and Beijing as a result of the white paper, adding that he believes
it is still in the United States' best interest to grant normal trade
status to the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Wednesday blasted an advertisement which links the nation's
establishment of diplomatic ties with Papua New Guinea last year to
Vice Presdient Lien Chan's election campaign.</P>
      <P>Lamenting that MOFA has been dragged into Taiwan's coming

the accusation carried in the advertisement which slings mud at Lien,
the ruling Kuomintang's candidate in the March 18 presidential race.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, time has proved that MOFA did not spent so
much as a penny on setting up the short-lived diplomatic relations
with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside the figure of US$2.3 billion which the
announcement accused MOFA of spending to "buy" formal ties from the
Papua New Guinea government, Chen said it would have been impossible

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Finance
(MOF) said on Wednesday that Taiwan's exports in February are
expected to grow 14 percent over the same period of 1999, with
imports increasing by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Preliminary statistics indicate that exports between Feb. 1-19
amounted to US$6.06 billion, up 22.3 percent over the year-earlier
level, with imports going up 39.3 percent to US$5.91 billion.</P>
      <P>Based on the figures, the MOF predicted a 14 percent increase in
exports for the whole of February, while saying that imports will
increase more than 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Because of the continued growth of the global economy and the
island's competitiveness in information industry products, the MOF
said that Taiwan's foreign trade will continue to grow this year.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics predicts that Taiwan's exports this year will increase by
10.4 percent and imports will go up by 12.8 percent, resulting in a

      <P>The new Taiwan dollar moved up NT$0.06
against the greenback on the Taipei Foreign Exchange (TAIEX) market
on Wednesday to close at NT$30.785 to the US dollar.</P>
      <P>A total of US$547.5 million changed hands. The greenback opened

      <P>The NT dollar appreciated under the influence of the strong yen
in the morning trading session, but devaluation pressure later
emerged as foreign capital slowed its flow into the exchange market
in the late trading session. The local currency ended the day on a
slight rise due to Central Bank of China's interference near the
close of trading.</P>
      <P>Exchange market dealers said the NT dollar has a good chance of

      <P>State-run China Steel Corp. on Wednesday
said it will continue to promote merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) and
forge strategic alliances with other firms in a bid to survive harsh
international competition.</P>
      <P>In light of the competition that will result from Taiwan's World

anti-dumping due to the struggle to survive. It added that M&amp;A and
strategic ties have become the best way for the industry to make a
living.</P>
      <P>China Steel expects Southeast Asia to be the fastest-growing

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN JANUARY SLIGHTLY TOO HOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a "yellow-red"
light in January on a government-designed monitoring system,
according to government statistics scheduled to be released next
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The figures, which will be issued by the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan
show that the island's economic prospects are slightly overheated,
and should have the government's attention, said CEPD Vice Chairman
Schive Chi.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD-designed five-color composite economic
measurement system, a yellow-red light means a warning of incipient
overheating.</P>
      <P>January's yellow-red signal is the first since February 1995, and
is a result of a surging stock price index of 47.5 percent on a
month-to-month basis, according to the CEPD report.</P>
      <P>The slight overheating just 12 months after the island entered
its 10th wave of economic cycle seems abnormal, said the official,
adding that it may be signaling a trend toward a bubble economy.</P>
      <P>An overview of the nine indicators used by the CEPD to gauge
domestic economic health shows that all the figures are either
soaring or at least remaining static.</P>
      <P>These nine indicators are: industrial production; new orders
received by local manufacturers; export value; non farming sector
employment rate; manufacturing inventory; M1B money supply; bank
lending to private enterprises; stock prices; and the check default
rate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE MEETS EUROPEAN BANK CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Wednesday
that political democratization is cornerstone of the Republic of
China's vibrant economic development.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with European Bank of
Reconstruction Development (EBRD) Chairman Horst Kohler, who is
in Taipei to explore possible cooperative projects between the ROC
and the bank.</P>
      <P>Lee told his guest that Taiwan now ranks among the world's top
20 economic powers and commands great clout in the global economic
system.</P>
      <P>The president further said Taiwan's economic success lies in
four major factors -- well-developed high-technology industry,
robust small- and medium-sized enterprises, close connection among
Silicon Valley network, Asian network and Chinese network, and
abundant capital.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC has completed political reforms and scored
brilliant achievements in economic liberalization over the past
decade, Lee said ROC nationals now can enjoy the satisfaction of
self-realization.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee said increased per capita income has helped
upgrade local people's living standards and qualities. Quoting
official statistics, Lee said Taiwan's per capita income rose from
US$3,130 in 1985 to US$13,112 in 1998, and its annual trade volume
also surged from US$50.8 billion to US$215.2 billion during the same
period.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also boasts the world's third largest foreign exchange
reserves, standing at US$1,027 billion at the end of last October,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kohler said he has been impressed by Taiwan
people's vitality during his brief stay. "I think this may be one of
Taiwan's special features," he noted.</P>
      <P>The London-based European Bank, founded in 1991, took the
initiative to present a Kosovo reconstruction action plan to the ROC
after President Lee announced a US$300 million aid package for the
war-torn Yugoslav province.</P>
      <P>Kohler's current visit is aimed at exchanging views with ROC
officials on the development of bilateral cooperative relations. He
also hopes to sign a letter of intent with the ROC government on the
EBRD-proposed Kosovo reconstruction plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYCOON'S MAINLAND VISIT BEARS NO POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said on Wednesday that Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) Chairman Wang
Yung-ching's current visit to mainland China does not bear any
political significance.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu said Wang's mainland
visit is mainly for looking into the development of herbal
medicine there.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Wang is visiting the mainland to explore the
possibility of cultivating medicinal plants there. "Investment in
this field is subject to initial screening of the Council of
Agriculture (COA)," Lin said, adding that if the FPG really wants to
invest in herbs plantation in mainland China, the MOEA will join
forces with the COA in evaluating the project.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong press reports said the FPG, one of Taiwan's largest
private business groups, is planning massive investment projects on
the mainland and that FPG Chairman Wang already arrived in Beijing
quietly on Feb. 20 to meet with many senior mainland officials.</P>
      <P>The reports said Wang will visit Beijing, Shanghai and the
southeastern mainland province of Fujian during his current trip.
Wang reportedly will inspect FPG's various investment projects in
those areas.</P>
      <P>An FPG spokesman said as Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, an FPG
affiliate, has devoted much energy and resources to the development
of herbal medicine, Wang hopes to learn more about mainland China's
experience in this field as well as the market situation there.
Mainland China is one of the world's most important herbal medicine
strongholds.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, P. K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said the government basically
supports the FPG's plan to introduce herbal medicine technology and
expertise for cultivation of medicinal plants.</P>
      <P>"We have included biotechnology and herbal medicine technology
into a list of industries to be given intensified development,"
Chiang said, adding that the ROC welcomes introduction of technology
and expertise in these fields from any places.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Chiang said, the FPG has no plan to build an
industrial park in the southwestern mainland city of Chungqing to
accommodate high-tech industrial materials production facilities as
reported by news media.</P>
      <P>Quoting one of Wang's close aides, Chiang said Wang has long
hoped to use scientific methods to study traditional Chinese medicine
and cures with a view to developing and commercializing Taiwan's own
technology in relevant fields.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics was forced to abort a multi-billion dollar plan
for a petrochemical complex in Fujian after the Republic of China
government in 1996 launched a "go slow" policy urging local
enterprises to refrain from making extensive investments in the
mainland to avoid being held economically hostage by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Current ROC government regulations ban local enterprises from
investing US$50 million or more in a single project in mainland
China and require case-by-case approval for investment in high-tech
industries.</P>
      <P>Some 40,000 Taiwanese enterprises have poured an estimated
US$30 billion US dollars into the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOSPITAL DENIES PRESIDENT LEE HAS TUMOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital denied
on Wednesday that President Lee Teng-hui has suffered from a
pancreatic tumor as claimed by a new book.</P>
      <P>The book, jointly authored by presidential candidate Li Ao of the
New Party and Taipei City Councilman Lee Ching-yuan, claims that
President Lee checked into the hospital several times in January 1999
suffering from a fever caused by a pancreatic tumor.</P>
      <P>Lien Wen-ping, who heads the president's medical-care team, said
that there is absolutely no truth to the story.</P>
      <P>The hospital said that all tests have shown that the president's
liver, kidney and pancreas are functioning well, and that there is
absolutely no pancreatic tumor.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Presidential Office also refuted the claim
that President Lee decided to hand over the helm of the nation to
Chen Shui-bian, presidential candidate of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, due to illness.</P>
      <P>Ting Yuan-chao, deputy director of Public Affairs Department of
the Presidential Office, said that the claim that the president had a
pancreatic tumor is "absolute nonsense."</P>
      <P>Ting reaffirmed that the president has had a regular physical
examination every year and has reported the results to the public,
and said that there is no truth to the claims of the book.</P>
      <P>The book, tentatively named "The True Face of Chen Shui-bian,"
alleges that President Lee, because of a pancreatic tumor, has
decided to hand over the helm of the country to Chen since both share
the same belief of promoting Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Councilman Lee speculated that the president wants to
hand over his post to Chen for three major reasons: the president
needs a longer rest because of the pancreatic tumor; the president's
redefinition of cross-strait ties has resulted in pressure from the
United States; and Taiwan's middle-generation leaders have prodded
him to step down.</P>
      <P>The councilman cited sources from the president's medical-care
team as saying in October that because of the president's potentially
fatal pancreatic tumor, the team had invited specialists from Germany
to come to Taiwan for consultation that month. They said the
specialists advised the president to have surgery and that he rest
for six months before the surgery.</P>
      <P>Councilman Lee said that the president checked into National
Taiwan University Hospital twice with a high fever, which conforms
with the symptoms of a pancreatic tumor, and not with a serious cold
as claimed by the Presidential Office.</P>

      <P>Far East Air Transport Corp. (FAT) intends
to buy Boeing 757-300 jetliners to cope with demand from its
expansion of regional and cross-strait flight routes in the future, a
FAT official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>US-based Boeing Co. held a demonstration flight at Sungshan
Airport in Taipei on Wednesday morning to introduce its Boeing
757-300 aircraft and tap the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Taipei is one of the 16 cities worldwide that Boeing plans to
visit to promote the sale of its 757-300.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yi-chung, deputy director of FAT's planning department, said
that FAT now owns five Boeing 757-200 planes. Due to the common
denominator between the 757-200 and 757-300, FAT plans to procure
757-300 aircraft in a bid to meet the expanded demand for regional
and cross-strait flight routes in the future, he said.</P>
      <P>The maximum seat capacity of Boeing's 757-300 is 289, or 50 more
than that of the 757-200, and its maximum flight range is 6,420 km,
while the 757-200 can fly 800 km farther.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new type of computer software which can
perform two-way conversions on the different versions of Chinese
characters made its debut in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a demonstration of the new product, Jimmy Lin, chief executive
officer of the Taiwan-based Win Pre Ton Corporation, said the
software, designed to convert the simplified Chinese characters which
prevail in mainland China into the standard Chinese characters used
in Taiwan and Hong Kong, or vice versa, will help users of the two
different versions communicate with each other via the Internet.</P>
      <P>Using computers equipped with this software, web surfers can
choose to read home pages of Chinese-language websites in either
simplified or standard characters.</P>
      <P>Noting that many Taiwanese who do business in mainland China
often have difficulty reading documents written by their mainland
employees in simplified Chinese characters, Lin said that the
software can help them by automatically converting the documents to
standard Chinese characters once the originals have been entered on
computers.</P>
      <P>This software can also help website operators establish alternate
versions of their home pages, posting both kinds of characters to
reach out to users of both simplified and standard characters, said
Lin.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the software will enjoy a US$3 million market
over the next three years.</P>

      <P>Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China will
continue to be large markets for Australian seafood in the years
ahead because of their economic recovery, according to the Australian
Bureau of Agricultural and Resources Economics (ABARE).</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA on Wednesday, Anthony Cox, a senior
ABARE economist, said both Taiwan and Hong Kong are established
markets for Australian seafood.</P>
      <P>"Both Taiwan and Hong Kong have strong purchasing power and the
markets are quite steady for Australian seafood exporters," he said,
although he noted that competition in the Taiwan and Hong Kong
markets from Thailand and North America is very keen.</P>
      <P>Australia exported 6,858 metric tons of seafood products to
Taiwan in fiscal 1998-99, down from 7,088 metric tons in 1997-98 and
8,460 metric tons in 1996-97, while its exports to Hong Kong were
8,249 metric tons in 1998-99, up from 7,938 metric tons in 1997-98

up from 2,815 metric tons in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>He said the total value of Australian fisheries production
increased by 8.5 percent to A$2 billion (US$1.33) billion in 1998-99.</P>
      <P>"The economic downturn in the Asian economies did not affect the

      <P>Independent presidential hopeful James Soong

      <P>The Republic of China signed a letter of
intent on Wednesday with the visiting head of the European Bank of
Reconstruction Development (EBRD) to document Taiwan's willingness to
join three reconstruction projects in war-ravaged Kosovo.</P>
      <P>In the letter, signed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Chen
Chien-jen and visiting EBRD President Horst Kohler, the ROC promised
to chip in on financing for three projects undertaken by the EBRD in
the Balkans: an action program for Macedonian cities and the
environment, the Macedonia Reconstruction Stock Fund, and a Kosovo
bank program to make small-business loans.</P>
      <P>The EBRD contacted Taipei after ROC President Lee Teng-hui
pledged in 1999 to grant US$300 million in aid to Kosovo for its
post-war reconstruction after NATO forces took control of the
Albanian enclave in Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>Kohler was invited to visit Taiwan to wrap up details of the
three projects with Taipei authorities and exchange views with ROC
leaders on the Balkan situation.</P>
      <P>He met with President Lee earlier on Wednesday and is slated to
call on acting Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Minister of Finance Paul
Chiu, and the Central Bank of China's Governor Fai-nan Perng.</P>
      <P>The London-based development bank was set up in 1991 by the
European Community. Although not a member of the bank, Taipei has
been a regular guest at the EBRD annual conference ever since its
establishment, and once organized a symposium on small- and
medium-sized businesses at the conference.</P>
      <P>Taipei and EBRD jointly set up a fund in 1991 to assist with both
the transition to a market economy and the rejuvenation of private

      <P>Heavy rains over the past several days have
resulted in two deaths and disruption of traffic in central Taiwan's
mountainous regions, and have wreaked havoc with its agricultural
industry, the Ministry of the Interior said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A 61-year-old man and a nine-month-old baby were killed by
falling rocks triggered by the heavy rains in Nantou County, central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The flow of traffic in the Hoping Township section of the
East-West Cross-island Highway was halted due to the continued
landslides. More than 100 residents in the mountainous region of
Taichung County are trapped due to the interruption, but they face no
immediate danger, and the government is ready to offer assistance
once the disrupted traffic resumes.</P>
      <P>Heavy damages were also reported in Nantou County, with Puli,
Kuohsing and Jenai townships in the mountainous region reporting mud
and rock slides and outbound traffic disruption.</P>
      <P>In view of the heavy losses, the Executive Yuan has instructed
all related agencies to immediately send officials to the disaster

mudslides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Council of Agriculture (COA) reported that 19
hectares of agricultural fields in Nantou County were submerged by
flooding, incurring a loss of NT$152 million (US$4.94 million).</P>
      <P>Affected crop areas totaled 22 hectares, with damaged areas
accounting for 82 percent of the total, registering losses of around
NT$3 million (US$97,400), mainly of betel nuts and strawberries.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that since the advent of the cold, wet weather
on Saturday, the supply of fresh produce has gradually decreased, and
damage sustained in the island's vegetable-growing centers of
Changhua and Yunlin counties will result in price increases averaging
50 percent.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau issued a heavy-rain warning and said

Richard said that although he is not the foreign minister, he
believes his French colleague would also be able to state this policy
in one sentence, namely that "we definitely want the China-Taiwan
relationship remain a certain legitimacy of seeking unification, but
fundamentally a political relationship that could only be maintained
through political means."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cohen, commenting on Beijing's strongly worded white
paper which threatens "drastic measures," including the military
invasion of Taiwan if the island indefinitely delays negotiations for
unification, said the US continues to expect that the Taiwan issue
will be resolved peacefully rather than with either side resorting to
threats or force.</P>
      <P>Cohen reiterated that the Pentagon supports the one-China policy
and the Taiwan Relations Act, adding that he hopes the Chinese and
Taiwanese will seek unification through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Cohen, however, stated that the United States is not yet
considering dispatching sea-lift troops to areas near the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASHINGTON REITERATES LONG-STANDING POLICY ON TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration on Wednesday
once again stressed the long-standing US policy that rejects any use
of force or threat of force to resolve the Taiwan issue, saying that
providing for Taiwan's legitimate defense needs is maintaining a
balance across the Taiwan Straits that has served America's national
interests extremely well.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Communist Chinese embassy in Washington said
in a Wednesday press conference that "unification with the motherland
is the only way out for Taiwan," and that "it's better for the US to
stop interfering in China's internal affairs because the Taiwan issue
is a question left over from a civil war."</P>
      <P>He also added that "the Chinese people have the right to decide
how to settle the Taiwan issue."</P>
      <P>White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart responded later in a
routine press briefing that "I think the US interest in this matter
is well known and is governed by the Taiwan Relations Act. And our
position is long-standing and well-known: that we reject the use of
force, or the threat of the use of force, to resolve the Taiwan
question."</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman James Rubin, meanwhile, told reporters
that Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott delivered a very strong
message to Chinese ambassador Li Zhaoxing Tuesday, stressing US
concerns over the statement in the PRC white paper that indefinite
delay in unification negotiations would be a reason for the PRC to
use force.</P>
      <P>Talbott also made very clear the US view that the resolution of
cross-strait differences should be peaceful and the threat that
Beijing has made in this regard is, therefore, counterproductive.</P>
      <P>As to the Communist Chinese embassy claim that the white paper is
not aimed at Taiwan's forthcoming presidential elections or the
people of Taiwan, Rubin said "I am not sure they hit the nail on the
head" if the United States, especially those who are supporting the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, is their audience.</P>
      <P>But Rubin noted that the latest Chinese threat has not changed
the Clinton administration's opposition to the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act, adding that "we engage in quite substantial support
for Taiwan, pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act."</P>
      <P>Stressing that "we're second to none in the world in supporting
Taiwan's defense, and this is a system that has worked well," the
spokesman said "if it's not broken, we don't think it ought to be
fixed with a law that will complicate the defense of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"I just hope that those ..... who have suggested that we haven't
done enough for Taiwan will take into account that, one hand, the
Chinese think we're doing far too much, and we are walking a balance
here that has served our national interests extremely well, providing
Taiwan what it needs for its legitimate defense, despite the fact
that China opposes that activity," added Rubin.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A female immigrant from mainland China is
being charged with manslaughter for leaving her 19-month-old son
unattended in a locked car while gambling at a hotel in Melbourne,
according to Australian news reports.</P>
      <P>The 39-year-old Jie Hua Yu's toddler sustained massive brain and
organ damage after being locked in the unventilated car for two hours
on a hot day. He was sent to hospital, but died later.</P>
      <P>Yu, accompanied by her sister and husband, appeared in the

to reappear in the same court in May.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard on Wednesday said he was appalled at
the "social and human havoc" caused by gambling and took the
opportunity to renew his push to curb gambling. Yu came to Australia

    <HEADLINE>ICE STORM OF 1998 RATED TOP CANADIAN WEATHER EVENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadians chose the severe ice storm that
struck in Jan. 1998 as the most significant weather event in Canada
during the 20th century, announced Environment Canada on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Dustbowl of the 1930s came in second and the sinking of the
Titanic after striking an iceberg in 1912 ranked third on the list.</P>
      <P>"The events chosen by Canadians underscores how weather
influences our daily lives," said Environment Minister David
Anderson. "These top three weather events remind us of the importance
of continued national weather and climate research monitoring to
ensure the quality of life and health for all Canadians."</P>
      <P>Canadians were asked to vote for their top three weather stories
of the century. Some three thousand Canadians logged on to
Environment Canada's Green lane to cast their votes. Selections were
compared with those of Canada's best known television weather
personalities.</P>
      <P>The "Ice Storm of the Century" took place between Jan. 4 and 9 in
1998. One of the most destructive and disruptive storms in Canadian
history hit Eastern Canada, causing hardship for 4 million people and
over C$3 billion in damages. The government had to mobilize the armed
forces to help with relief work.</P>
      <P>The Dustbowl Era of the 1930s refers to the period between 1933
and 1937 when the Prairies experienced only 60% of normal rainfall.
Thousands of head of livestock died, crops withered, and some 250,000
people across the region abandoned their land to seek better lives
elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The World's Worst Iceberg Accident occurred on April 15, 1912
when Titanic collided with an iceberg 700 km southeast of
Newfoundland, causing the death of 1,500 people and making headlines
around the world.</P>

      <P>The US Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) on Wednesday declined to either confirm or deny a press report
that it has conducted an evaluation of the possible outcome of
Taiwan's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The report quoted Chen Shui-bian, the presidential candidate of
Taiwan's main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), as
having said at a recent campaign rally that a new CIA evaluation
shows that Chen would win Taiwan's upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former Taipei mayor, said he received the information
from one of his friends in the legal profession in the United States,

      <P>Asked about the report, a CIA official said that the CIA's
consistent and unswerving policy has been to not get involved in

    <HEADLINE>SAILING OF USS KITTY HAWK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BEIJING'S WHITE PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sailing of the American aircraft
carrier USS Kitty Hawk out of its home port of Yokosuka is to carry
out a scheduled military drill and has nothing to do with Taiwan's
presidential election or Beijing's white paper on the Taiwan issue,
the US Defense Department said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The US Defense Department made the remarks in response to
Japanese and Taiwanese news media reports that the USS Kitty Hawk
left Yokosuka on Wednesday for a two-week experimental voyage and may
be dispatched to the waters close to the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>A press official with the US Defense Department told CNA that the
USS Kitty Hawk will stage routine military exercises in the waters
off the Philippines and return to Yokosuka before Taiwan's March 18
presidential election. He said the aircraft carrier would not pass
through the Taiwan Strait on its way to the waters near the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>The Defense Department official also denied the report that the
aircraft carrier USS Nimitz will reach the waters near the Taiwan
Strait by the end of this month, saying that the aircraft carrier is
now undergoing a 33-month period of servicing at the port of Newport
News in Virginia.</P>
      <P>A US Navy official told CNA that the United States has not made
any changes to its naval deployments in East Asia following Beijing's
announcement on Tuesday of its white paper on the "one China policy
and the Taiwan issue" in which it warns Taiwan not to push for
independence or indefinitely delay negotiations for peaceful
unification at the risk of military invasion.</P>
      <P>The official also denied the report that the United States had
dispatched additional warships to the waters close to the Taiwan
Strait earlier in the month on a mission to help defend Taiwan in the
run-up to its presidential election.</P>
      <P>Another US official said that at present, the United States has a
military force of 100,000 personnel deployed in the Far East as a
rule to cope with unexpected situations and to closely watch any
signs of action in the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRENCH DEFENSE MINISTER WARNS CHINA TO BACK OFF FROM TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  24 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>French Defense Minister Alain Richard
warned China to refrain from threatening Taiwan, when he spoke to
reporters here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference following a meeting with his US
counterpart, the visiting defense chief from France said: "We do warn
China that it's against their interests to make any kind of threat or
any kind of -- play military pressure over Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Richard noted that he is simply the defense minister, but that he
supposes his country's foreign minister would be able to state
France's China policy in one sentence: "We definitely want the China,
continental China-Taiwan relationship to remain a political one with
some legitimacy in looking for unification, but basically, uniquely
by political means."</P>
      <P>US Defense Secretary William Cohen then reiterated that
Washington supports both the "one China" policy and the Taiwan
Relations Act and expects that the Chinese will seek reunification by
peaceful means and not through either threats of force or an actual
attempt to carry out any military activity, adding that that is the
policy the United States intends to maintain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said at a briefing at
the Foreign Press Center that the Taiwan Relations Act makes it very
clear that "we would consider any use of force against Taiwan as a
threat to security in the South China Sea area and in Asia generally,
a threat to stability in that area, and we, the administration, would
consult with Congress over the appropriate response."</P>
      <P>As for Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe's use of the
word "incalculable" in a comment on possible consequences of Chinese
military action against Taiwan, Bacon explained that Slocombe said
nothing new about US policy: "He just said any use of force, which we
oppose, would ... certainly be cause for grave concern here and would
lead to unpredictable consequences from China's standpoint."</P>
      <P>"And it certainly would have a very damaging impact on our
relationship with China," Bacon added.

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER RUSHES TO AREAS AFFECTED BY MUDSLIDES IN CENTRAL TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Suspending campaign activities, Premier
Vincent Siew, the Kuomintang's vice presidential candidate, on
Thursday rushed to inspect villages affected by mudslides in Nantou
County in central Taiwan, one of the areas hardest hit by the Sept.
21 earthquake last year.</P>
      <P>Heavy rains over the past several days have resulted in two
deaths and excessive disruptions of traffic in central Taiwan's
mountainous areas. They have also wreaked havoc on the region's
agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday morning, more than 100 locations in mountainous
areas in the counties of Nantou, Taichung, Miaoli and Chiayi have
reported rock and mud slides, resulting in incalculable damage to
roads, houses and farms.</P>
      <P>In the three aboriginal villages in Nantou County's Chungliao
Township alone, some 1,000 villagers were trapped due to the
interruption.</P>
      <P>An unknown number of people in other villages have also
reportedly been deprived of running water as a result of the
landslides and floods. Fortunately, the residents are facing no
immediate danger, according to officials from the Cabinet-level
Aboriginal Affairs Commission.</P>
      <P>Fourteen primary schools announced the cancellation of classes on
Thursday in order to prevent children from getting hurt on their way
to school.</P>
      <P>Siew told local people that the central government is monitoring
the situation closely and has instructed all relevant government
agencies to take all possible measures to minimize further damage.</P>
      <P>He said, if necessary, people will be evacuated from villages
affected by the floods and mudslides.</P>
      <P>Siew said the government has been doing its utmost in rural
reconstruction to help the earthquake-stricken counties and townships
in Central Taiwan to pull their own weight again.</P>
      <P>Siew responded to criticism of the government's handling of the
situation by other candidates by calling them insensitive and saying
they know nothing about such matters, calling them people who "drink
the water but refuse to carry it from the well."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Shui-bian, the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP) candidate, visited Puli in Nantou County and offered
his sympathy to villagers who are suffering from the second major
natural disaster to hit the area since Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Chen criticized the ruling Kuomintang for only taking care of
KMT-ruled cities and townships in central Taiwan. He said that those
townships in Nantou which have a DDP magistrate, for example, are
virtually tantamount to places for orphans.</P>
      <P>Former Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao, meanwhile, offered his
condolences to villagers in Nantou County's Chungliao Township on
behalf of independent presidential candidate James Soong. A truck
full of bottled water, food and other emergency materials for victims
in the area accompanied Liao.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAVYWEIGHT QUITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chung Jung-chi, a minister without
portfolio and a key member of the Kuomintang's election machine, on
Thursday announced his resignation from public office and from the
party as well, in a "consciousness-raising" move.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Chung, who was deputy secretary-general of
the KMT Central Committee until just three months ago, said that
after a long period of soul-searching, he has decided to quit the
"well-paid positions of high social status" as the minimum
requirement for "fulfilling the expectations of my fellow citizens."</P>
      <P>Chung, 57, a journalist-turned-official of the ruling party who
was also a legislator for six years, declined, however, to confirm
media speculations that he is quitting the KMT in order to join the
bandwagon of party defectors leaving to support independent
presidential candidate James Soong.</P>
      <P>Chung said he needs time to sort out his future plans.</P>
      <P>He cited his complete disappointment with the KMT, which he
described as full of rich men and gangland figures, as the remote
reason for his departure from the party. He noted that a sudden raid
on former Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-pan's residence by
judges and policemen recently prompted him to actually take the
action. Liu, a KMT heavyweight, joined Soong's camp a few months ago.</P>
      <P>The resignation is widely believed to deal a heavy blow to the
KMT, which is fighting an uphill battle for the presidential election
slated for March 18, just 23 days away. The impact is speculated to
be the most serious in Chung's hometown of Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan, which his nephew Chung Shao-ho represents in the Legislative
Yuan. Chung Shao-ho recently announced his support for James Soong.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew, who was in central Taiwan inspecting
flood-ravaged mountainous townships, was taken by surprise upon
hearing the news of Chung's resignation. He said he would have tried
his best to retain Chung if he had only known of his intent to
resign.</P>

      <P>Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
on Wednesday attended the inaugural ceremony for Taiwan-based Acer
Group's new production facility in Juarez, a Mexican city bordering
the United States.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Zedillo lauded Acer Group, Taiwan's
largest personal computer manufacturer, for its achievements in
computer technology.</P>
      <P>"I believe that Acer's new plant in Juarez will create many job

      <P>Feng Wei-chang, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
in Houston, which represents Republic of China interests,
was also a guest of honor at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Feng said Zedillo's presence at the ceremony was not only an
honor to Acer but also a "historic record" in the history of
Taiwanese investment in Mexico.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC is now the world's 15th largest trading
nation, Feng said the opening of the new Acer plant marks a
beginning of trade and economic cooperation between Taiwan and
Mexico.</P>
      <P>"We believe that our two countries will be able to strike even
more cooperative projects in the future," Feng said, adding he hopes
that President Zedillo can head a trade delegation to visit the ROC
to explore trade or joint-venture opportunities.</P>
      <P>To signify the importance the Mexican government has attached to
the new Acer plant, Zedillo led a high-profile official delegation,
including commerce minister and education minister, to attend the
ribbon-cutting ceremony.</P>
      <P>Zedillo and his entourage also heard a briefing on the Acer
plant's operations and its market prospects, and toured plant
facilities after the inaugural ceremony.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan stock market dipped for the

      <P>Apart from the electronics sector, the other seven major stock
categories reported losses, with construction issues suffering the
most, ending with a 5.3-percent fall. Paper-making issues, textile

      <P>However, Vice Finance Minister Wang Jung-chou, who is in charge

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has established a mode,
with a positive manner and rapid pace, for dealing with disputes
across the Taiwan Strait, said an official of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi-jen, executive manager of DPP presidential candidate Chen
Shui-bian's campaign headquarters, was referring to Washington's
reaction to mainland China's white paper on Taiwan issued Monday.</P>
      <P>In the white paper, Beijing said for the first time that if
Taipei dragged its feet indefinitely on reunification, it could lead
to war.</P>
      <P>The White House quickly warned Beijing against any aggression
toward Taipei, urging both sides to engage in dialogue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs noted that the white paper was "obviously a
source of concern to us," and called for both Beijing and Taipei to
refrain from actions or statements that could deteriorate the
situation.</P>
      <P>Chiu said in an interview that Beijing's white paper was aimed at
upping the ante for negotiations. Beijing should act properly,
because Taiwan will not succumb to such kind of intimidation, he
added.</P>
      <P>The best way for the island to respond to Beijing's new policy
statement is "having got the message," Chiu stressed.</P>
      <P>Should a war break out between China and the United States, Chiu
said he believes the United States would be the winner. However, from
the US viewpoint, the most desirable resolution for disputes between
Taiwan and mainland China is not fighting a war, but rather defusing
the cause of any conflict in advance, Chiu concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of academics on Thursday urged the
government to make it clear to Beijing that Taiwan will not hold
talks on unification with mainland China on the grounds that most of
the people of Taiwan will not accept communist rule.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, K.M. Koo, a
member of the Taiwanese Association of Professors and a stalwart of
Taiwan's independence movement, called on the government to tell
Washington and Beijing that under the current situation, Taiwan will
not conduct any negotiation on unification with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under Beijing's "one China" policy framework, Koo noted, the "one
country, two systems" formula is the mainland's bottom line in its
pursuit of China's unification.</P>
      <P>However, Koo stressed that as more than 90 percent of the people
of Taiwan are unwilling to live under mainland Chinese rule, the
candidates in Taiwan's March 18 presidential election should focus on
this point in their respective mainland China policies.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the China policies raised by the three major
presidential contenders, Koo expressed his opinion that the policies
put forth by independent hopeful James Soong and ruling Kuomintang
candidate Lien Chan are "too soft," while those aired by Chen
Shui-bian, candidate of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party, are "too optimistic."</P>
      <P>"The most unreasonable thing is that the United States has
repeatedly asked Taiwan to hold talks with mainland China, and that
is why the mainland China policies unveiled by the three leading
contenders are so placatory," he concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By M.C. Chou and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>French daily newspaper La Croix on Wednesday
carried a statement by ROC President Lee Teng-hui which urged
democratization for mainland China in order to clear the way for
China's eventual unification.</P>
      <P>The statement came in response to a call by Pope John Paul II
early this year for democratization in mainland China, and was made
in the wake of a white paper issued on Monday by Beijing which said
that Taipei will face invasion if it indefinitely puts off
negotiations on unification with the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to La Croix, France's largest religious daily,
Beijing's latest saber-rattling is apparently aimed at Chen
Shui-bian, candidate of Taiwan's leading opposition party, the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, in the March 18
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The paper said that although Beijing is once again seeking to
influence Taiwan's presidential election by issuing military threats,
it will not cow Taiwan's voters, far less cause social unrest on the
island.</P>
      <P>Responding to Beijing's threats, Taiwan authorities made public a
declaration on Tuesday, emphasizing that "the Republic of China has
been a sovereign independent state since 1912, and the nation is
entitled to maintain diplomatic relations with other countries and
take part in international affairs."</P>
      <P>Taipei's stressing of the fact that Taiwan and mainland China
have been under separate rule since 1949 is an undeniable reality,
and the declaration has prevented Taiwan from falling into the
Chinese communist trap, La Croix commented.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANOTHER SUSPECTED `UA' CASE REPORTED INVOLVING VOLVO CAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central  Taiwan,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Volvo 960 car rammed
into a watch, clock and eyeglass store in the central Taiwan city of
Taichung on Wednesday, allegedly because of a case of "unexpected
acceleration (UA)."</P>
      <P>The owner of the car, surnamed Kuo, said: "The car accelerated
without warning when I started the engine and engaged reverse gear.</P>
      <P>"The car then careened backward in a violent, uncontrollable
manner," Kuo said, adding: "It first glanced off a utility pole, then
smashed into a sedan parked in front of the shop, broke a decorative
wooden pillar in the shop's arcade, and didn't stop until its rear
end hit and shattered a glass display cabinet installed near the
shop's front aisle."</P>
      <P>Both Kuo and his wife said they were badly frightened when the
car took off on its own, and added that they gradually calmed down
only after discovering that neither themselves nor anyone nearby had
sustained serious injuries.</P>
      <P>Only the son of the shop owner was slightly injured by shards of
glass from the broken display cabinet.</P>
      <P>Kuo said his Volvo, which was only four years old and had just
40,000 kilometers on the clock, had undergone regular inspection and
maintenance checks.</P>
      <P>"I have heard of many Volvo-related UA cases, but I never thought
that I would one day experience such a terrifying episode in person,"
Kuo said, adding that he would ask the auto supplier to look into the
cause of the incident.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the latest suspected UA case, a spokesman for
Volvo's local agent, Cannon Taiwan Ltd., said it would be premature
to attribute the incident to so-called UA.</P>
      <P>"It will require further investigation to determine the cause of
the incident involving Kuo's car," said the Cannon spokesman, adding
that the company is more than willing to help Kuo investigate the
cause of the incident. "However, Kuo has so far yet to contact us,"
he said.</P>
      <P>A string of alleged UA cases involving Volvo 960 cars were
reported in 1997, and one Taipei citizen surnamed Tsai even filed a
lawsuit against Cannon on July 21 that year after a Volvo 960 in
which he was a passenger accelerated unexpectedly.</P>
      <P>In August 1999, the Taipei District Court ruled that Cannon had
to pay NT$1.07 million in restitution to Tsai for the head injury he
received as a result of that incident.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the district court ruling, the Cannon spokesman
said an extensive inspection by Taiwan's authoritative Vehicle
Research and Test Center in Hsinchu proved the soundness of the Volvo
car.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we have filed an appeal with the Taiwan High Court
which is still examining the case," he explained.</P>
      <P>Quoting exhaustive research reports published in the United
States and Japan, the spokesman claimed that human error is the
culprit in nearly all UA cases.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Chen

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING WHITE PAPER AIMED MORE AT WASHINGTON THAN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's white paper on its policy toward
Taiwan is a gambit aimed more at Washington than at Taipei,
independent presidential candidate Hsu Hsin-ling said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The former chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party said that Beijing, believing that the way to Taipei is through
Washington, is obviously trying to pressure Washington into
convincing Taipei to open political dialogue with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has refused to negotiate with Beijing on the ultimate
reunification of the two sides before the communist regime gives up
force as an option in dealing with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Describing the United States a country well-honed in politics,
Hsu predicted it will follow what he called a "precautionary
defense," by warning Beijing against military adventurism and by
"sort of coercing" Taiwan into talking with Beijing to eliminate any
possibility of conflict.</P>
      <P>The White House reiterated its long-standing appeal for peaceful
resolution of the Taipei-Beijing dispute after Beijing threatened in
its white paper on Monday to use force against Taiwan if the island
delays indefinitely talks on reunification.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Beijing's policy has forced Taiwan's next president,
whoever he may be, to make political talks with Beijing, rather than
the much-discussed direct trade, postal and transportation links, or
the ease of limitations on commerce with Beijing, his top priority.</P>
      <P>He dismissed some analysts' views that the white paper is an
attempt to influence Taiwan's presidential election, pointing out
that there is virtually no substantial difference between the three
leading contenders' mainland Chinese policies.</P>
      <P>He said the message Beijing is trying to get across via the white
paper is that it will not grant Washington's demand for a peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue -- one of the three pillars of
Washington's China policy aired by President Bill Clinton in 1999 --
unless Washington can convince Taipei to accept the other two
pillars: that there is only one China, and that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should iron out their differences through dialogue.</P>
      <P>Although the white paper might prompt a backlash in Washington,
and will probably cause the US Congress to block Beijing's permanent
normal trade relationship status with the United States, or give
Taiwan a sympathetic consideration when weighing arms sales, Hsu
predicted that the United States will eventually turn around and
support Beijing's bid for dialogue after the Taiwan election.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will paint itself into a corner by resisting to sitting
down at the negotiating table, and thereby risk war with Beijing, he
warned.</P>
      <P>He espoused the idea of bypassing the thorny issue of sovereignty
and entering a 50-year modus vivendi, or interim agreement, with
Beijing in return for peace.</P>
      <P>Although criticized for advocating the shelving of the issue of
the island's sovereignty, Hsu argued it is worthwhile to put on hold
an issue without much substance, in return for peace of 50 years. At
the end of the day, he went on, Taiwan will have nothing to lose.</P>
      <P>"Whoever wins the presidential election will have no option but
to follow the route charted by me," Hsu claimed confidently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADB TO OPEN MAINLAND CHINA RESIDENT MISSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on
Thursday announced that it will establish a resident mission in
Beijing which will be one of the ADB's largest resident missions.</P>
      <P>It will have an initial staff of 17 officers, including 11
mainland China nationals, and up to 20 administrative staff, said ADB
President Tadao Chino.</P>
      <P>The mission, which is expected to open by mid-2000, will include
an information office and library which is open to the public, he
added.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is one of the ADB's largest clients, borrowing
more than US$1 billion annually.</P>
      <P>"The mission will strengthen our partnerships with developing
stakeholders, including the government, other donor agencies, the
private sector and civil society. It will also enable us to provide a
better service to one of our most important clients, Chino said.</P>
      <P>The ADB has been particularly active in supporting the Beijing
regime's efforts to clean up the environment, improve water supplies
and waste water treatment in urban areas, and develop the transport
sector.</P>
      <P>"To help reduce poverty, the ADB has channeled more than
two-thirds of our assistance to the poorer, inland provinces," said
Bruce Murray, ADB's programs manager for mainland China.</P>
      <P>Murray noted that the Beijing office will also improve the ADB's
ability to promote regional coordination, particularly for the
Greater Mekong Subregion, the Central Asian Republics and the
Caucasus.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's southwestern Yunan Province is an active
participant in the ADB's initiative to promote closer economic ties
among the six countries bordering the Mekong River -- Cambodia,
mainland China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ADB is promoting cooperation between Xinjing
province in northwestern mainland China and its neighboring Central
Asian Republics.</P>
      <P>The ADB's operations in mainland China have grown in size and
complexity since the country joined the ADB in 1986. The ADB has
approved loans totaling US$9.6 billion, and technical assistance
grants amounting to US$166 million. In addition, the ADB has
mobilized US$2.8 billion in cofinancing from other sources for
mainland China.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Thursday entertained his Liberian counterpart Charles Ghankay Taylor

      <P>Before the banquet, Lee met with Taylor to exchange views on the
international situation in general and bilateral relations between
the ROC and Liberia in particular.</P>
      <P>Addressing the banquet, Lee extended a warm welcome to the
Liberian head of state on his third visit to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Lee spoke highly of the far-sighted grasp of international
affairs shown by Taylor, and added that despite the great changes in
the world situation over the past two years, friendly and cooperative
relations between Taiwan and Liberia are becoming more consolidated.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the ROC has offered technical assistance
to help Liberia expand its rice production and its medical care
network. The ROC has also helped Liberia construct an international
airport and build a sea port. These, he noted, are only a few
examples of the successful cooperation projects between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed thanks to Taylor for his country's
support for Taiwan at the United Nations General Assembly, and in
particular his proposal last year to give the ROC a UN seat.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Taiwan treasures the traditional friendship between
the two countries, and pointed out that although the devastating
Sept. 21 earthquake brought heavy losses of life and property to
Taiwan, the country nevertheless kept its word to render assistance
to Liberia.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the world has become a universal village,
evident in the way the Balkan conflict was not only a regional issue
but also affected the international community. In order to uphold
international justice and promote international humanitarian
assistance, large-scale international cooperation is vital, he said.</P>
      <P>He also praised Taylor's contributions to promoting peace and

      <P>In return, Taylor expressed thanks to Lee for the economic and

      <P>The A-Lien ranch, owned by a farmer surnamed Chen, raised a
total of 295 dairy and meat goats. It was the latest goat-related FMD
case since a similar outbreak was reported last week in a ranch in
Changhua county's Fangyuan township in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said all of his goats had received vaccination since the
COA issued an order on Feb. 17 that all cloven-hoofed livestock on
the island must be inoculated within 10 days. "I simply couldn't
understand why my goats still succumbed to the deadly FMD virus,"
a frustrated Chen complained.</P>
      <P>In addition to demanding an across-the-board slaughter of Chen's
animals, the COA has also banned movement of cloven-hoofed livestock
raised in the nearby region and launched sterilizing measures to
prevent further spread of the disease. The COA also renewed its call
on ranch operators around the island to have their cloven-hoofed
animals inoculated.</P>
      <P>There are currently 20-plus goat ranches in A-Lien township,
raising a total of 5,000 dairy and meat goats.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials said since the O-Kinmen strain virus caused
an outbreak of FMD among cattle in the frontline island of Kinmen
and in several southern Taiwan ranches last summer, all
cloven-hoofed livestock, including pigs, goats, deer and cattle,
have been exposed to the threat of the deadly disease.</P>
      <P>Alarmed by the string of cattle- and goat-related FMD cases
reported in Yunlin, Chiayi, Changhua and Kaohsiung counties since
January this year, the National Security Council has twice called
meetings of officials from all relevant government agencies to
discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>According to the COA, the virus that infected cattle and goats in
Taiwan recently was a new type probably transmitted by live animals
smuggled from mainland China. Officials said although the newly
found virus belonged to O-strain, it was more virulent than the
type that caused an FMD outbreak among local cattle population last
year.</P>
      <P>Soong Hua-tsung, deputy director of the COA's flora and fauna
quarantine and inspection bureau, said rampant smuggling of live
animals and livestock products from mainland China has posed a
serious threat to Taiwan's anti-epidemic system and livestock
industry.</P>
      <P>Soong said three strains of FMD viruses -- O, A and A-1 -- have
been found in mainland China. So far, only O-strain has been
detected in Taiwan. "If A- and A-1 strains are transmitted into
Taiwan, the consequences will be grave," he warned.</P>
      <P>Soong said the COA has collected extensive information
concerning live animal smuggling from the mainland. "We'll cooperate
with law enforcement authorities closely to crack down on such
illegal operations," he added.</P>
      <P>The FMD epidemic among Taiwan's pigs in March 1997 led to the
slaughter of tens of thousands of the animals and dealt a devastating
blow to the country's pork exports, prompting the COA to order an
across-the-board vaccination at all hog farms.</P>
      <P>In July 1999, the COA adopted its containment policy after FMD
cases among cattle were reported.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, about 26,000 head of cattle, or some 20 percent of
the country's total of 130,000, have been affected or slaughtered
after being confirmed of having been infected with FMD.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD SHOULD OPPOSE BEIJING'S THREATS TO TAIPEI: CANADIAN DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's latest threats against Taiwan are
unacceptable and must be rejected by any country that supports the
peaceful resolution of disputes, a Canadian newspaper said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an editorial, The Ottawa Citizen said an unambiguous
international response is also important because Taiwan -- unlike
mainland China -- has embraced democracy. "Western countries must not
allow Taiwan's rejection of authoritarian rule to be punished by the
still-undemocratic mainland," the article pointed out.</P>
      <P>The daily lamented Canada's meek response to Beijing's white
paper released on Monday which threatens war against Taiwan. Canada's
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy, responding to a question in
the House of Commons, would only say that Canada favors a negotiated
settlement between Beijing and Taipei, and will "bring this point of
view once again to the attention of the Chinese authorities."</P>
      <P>Beyond that banality, the minister offered no condemnation of
mainland China's warmongering, and no indication that Canada would go
beyond pusillanimous statements, said the article, titled "China's
thuggish threats."</P>
      <P>That, the editorial continued, is not good enough, adding that
Axworthy should make it clear that a Canadian trade mission to
mainland China planned for later this year will be canceled unless
Beijing withdraws it threat of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At a time when Canada has limited its official contacts with
Austria because the far-right Freedom Party is in its governing
coalition, it would be hypocritical for Prime Minister Jean Chretien
to lead a trade delegation to a country openly threatening war, it
went on.</P>
      <P>The Citizen said Canada should also work with like-minded
countries to oppose mainland China's admission to the World Trade
Organization unless Beijing commits itself to peaceful settlement of
its dispute with Taipei. Further, Canada should oppose Japan's plans
to invite mainland China to this year's G-7 summit in Japan, it
added.</P>
      <P>A concerted international response could help ease tensions
across the Taiwan Strait, it concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US INSISTS ON PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton stressed
Thursday that America will continue to reject the use of force as a
means of resolving the Taiwan issue and will also continue to make
absolutely clear to Beijing that the issue must be resolved
peacefully and with the consent of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While urging the American business community to press for
congressional support of his administration's agreement to bring
Communist China into the World Trade Organization, Clinton said "it
is clear that the more we can promote peace and stability in Asia by
helping the right kind of China to develop, the more America's
interests and values will be served."</P>
      <P>The president told the US Business Council that the WTO agreement
with China helps to advance all these goals in unprecedented ways.
"It's the kind of opportunity that comes along once in a
generation... If we don't seize it, we'll be regretting it for a
generation," he said.</P>
      <P>Although conceding that critics' worries about China's growing
threat to Taiwan and its other neighbors, its human rights abuses,
and its dangerous military proliferation are all legitimate concerns,
Clinton pointed out that "this agreement is vital to our national
security and that every single concern we have will grow greater and
the problems will be worse if we do not bring China into the WTO."</P>
      <P>He also admitted that bringing China into the WTO "doesn't
guarantee of course that it will choose the path of political reform.
But by accelerating the process of economic change, it will force
China to confront the choice sooner in ways that are most powerful,
making the imperative, I believe, the right decision."</P>
      <P>Of course, Clinton added, bringing China into the WTO is not by
itself a human-rights policy for the US. The reality is that Beijing
continues to suppress the voices of those who challenge Communist
Party rule. It will change only by a combination of internal pressure
and external validation of the human-rights struggle. "So we must
maintain our leadership in the latter, while the WTO agreement
contributes to the former."</P>
      <P>That's why the United States sanctioned China as a country of
particular concern under the International Religious Freedom Act last
year, and also why Washington is once again sponsoring a resolution
this year at the UN Human Rights Commission condemning human rights
abuses in mainland China, explained Clinton.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue to press China to respect global norms on
nonproliferation. And we'll continue to reject the use of force as a
means of resolving the Taiwan issue. We'll also continue to make
absolutely clear that the issues between Beijing and Taiwan must be
resolved peacefully and with the assent of the people of Taiwan,"
said the president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE US STATES WANT TO BUY CHEAPER MEDICINES FROM QUEBEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The governors of Vermont, New Hampshire and
Maine have sent a letter to Premier Lucien Bouchard of the province
of Quebec urging him to grant the New England states access to its
cheaper prescription drugs.</P>
      <P>Under the proposal, wholesalers in the border states would be
allowed to import drugs from Quebec for sale to New England
pharmacies. Individuals would also have the right to purchase pills
by mail from Quebec pharmacies.</P>
      <P>The governors have asked the attorney-generals in their states to
determine whether such an arrangement would be permitted under the
North American Free Trade Agreement.</P>
      <P>Prescription drugs can often cost twice as much in the United
States as in Canada, sometimes even more. US citizens living close to
Canada have been seen coming over in buses to buy cheaper drugs.</P>
      <P>Unlike Canada, the US does not have comprehensive public health
insurance, including coverage for drugs, so that US pharmaceutical
firms can choose to sell drugs at much higher prices.</P>
      <P>For example, a month's supply of Tamoxifen, the popular
breast-cancer pill, can cost about US$156. In Quebec, it costs only
US$11.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is being drawn into a row
between the United States and its European allies over French claims
that America's Cold War-era electronic spying network is now being
used for commercial espionage against European governments and
companies.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Friday reported the French
government claims that the network, which includes a ground station
in Australia, is being used by the US and Britain, with the help of
Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, to eavesdrop on the Europeans,
picking up commercially sensitive information.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted an Australian Defence Department spokesman as
saying that the department was aware of the row but that it would not
comment on matters of national security and intelligence.</P>
      <P>European intelligence sources backed the French claim, saying the
Defence Signals Directorate Monitoring Station at Geraldton in
western Australia was a vital part of the network and "sucked up"
vast amounts of commercially valuable electronic communications, the

    <HEADLINE>FMD SUSPENDS TAIWAN'S GOAT MEAT AUCTION MARKETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's goat meat auction markets were
forced to close Friday in the wake of a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
outbreak among the island's goat population that began in mid
February.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
said that although the outbreak of FMD among the goat population has
already been put under control, Taiwan's two goat meat auction
markets, one in the central county of Yunlin and the other in the
southern city of Kaohsiung, will be suspended for one week in order
to prevent the infection from spreading further.</P>
      <P>COA officials, meanwhile, stressed that frozen lamb, mutton and
goat meat currently on supermarket shelves is safe to consume as most
of it was imported and all of it has passed sterilization checks.
They added that locally-produced goat milk presently on sale at
retail markets is also safe to drink.</P>
      <P>Since the first FMD case among the island's goat population was
reported on Feb. 15, quarantine agencies have stepped up vaccination
work on the goat population islandwide.</P>
      <P>So far, 90 percent of the goat population, totaling about 400,000
head of dairy and meat goat, have been inoculated, compared with only
60 percent around mid February, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>The COA and the Changhua County government announced on Feb. 16
an across-the-board quarantine and sterilization of all cloven-hoofed
animal ranches in the Central Taiwan county after 228 goats on a
ranch in Fangyuan Township were slaughtered because they were
infected with the Kinmen O-strain FMD virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, all 295 goats being raised on a ranch in Ah-Lien,
Kaohsiung, were slaughtered on Thursday after 42 kids were confirmed
to have died from the same O-strain virus. The case marked the second
and most recent report of an FMD outbreak among Taiwan's goat
population.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Goat Ranch Association reported on Friday that as a
result of the reported cases of FMD, the average wholesale price of
goat meat has so far dropped by NT$10 per kilogram, while the total
turnover of the commodity has shrunk by about 4-5 percent.</P>
      <P>Goats raised for their meat or for dairy products, totaling about
400,000 islandwide, represent one of the most important livestock
sectors in Taiwan, the association said. They collectively generate a
turnover of some NT$2.5 billion annually,</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials said that since the Kinmen O-strain virus
caused an outbreak of FMD among cattle on ranches on the frontline
Kinmen Island and in southern Taiwan last summer, all cloven-hoofed
livestock, including pigs, cattle, goats and deer, face the threat of
contracting the deadly disease.</P>
      <P>They attributed the outbreak on Kinmen Island to the rampant
smuggling of live animals and livestock products from mainland China,
where three strains of FMD virus -- 0, A and A-1 -- have been found.</P>
      <P>The FMD outbreak among Taiwan's hogs in March 1997 led to the
slaughter of tens of thousands of the animals and dealt a devastating
blow to the country's pork exports, prompting the COA to order an
across-the-board vaccination at all hog farms.</P>
      <P>In July 1999, the COA adopted its containment policy after FMD
cases were reported among cattle.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, about 26,000 head of cattle, or some 20 percent of
the country's total of 130,000, were slaughtered after being infected
with FMD.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RESUMES FISHERY PACT WITH PAPUA NEW GUINEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After a two-year hiatus, Taiwan recently
renewed a fishery agreement with Papua New Guinea (PNG), leading to a
resumption of Taiwanese commercial fishing of tuna, skip jack and
other fish in the Pacific nation's fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>PNG Fishery and Resources Minister Ron Ganarafo and Wu Chuan-hu,
a board member of the Taiwan Deep Sea Tuna Boat Owners and Exporters
Association, jointly inked the agreement in Seoul on Feb. 21 to renew
the bilateral fishery pact, which was suspended in late 1997.</P>
      <P>Under the renewed pact, PNG allows Taiwanese fishing boats access
to its fishing grounds with no operation-day restrictions or quota
limits at a cost of about US$121,000 per vessel per year.</P>
      <P>Prior to the hiatus, the waters near PNG had been one of the most
important fishing grounds for Taiwan's ocean-going fishing vessels,
particularly those conducting purse seiner operations, according to
Wu.</P>
      <P>Wu lauded the new agreement as a win-win solution for both the
Taiwan deep sea fishery industry and for PNG, saying that from the
100,000 metric tons of fish that Taiwanese fishing boats will gather
on average per year, the PNG government will receive US$4.2 million
in fishing charges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TYCOON'S VISIT TO MAINLAND HAS NO POLITICAL BEARING: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan business tycoon Wang Yung-ching's
current trip to mainland China is to promote the exchange of Chinese
herbal medicine between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Lin
Chong-pin, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council said Friday.</P>
      <P>The ranking official in charge of Taiwan's mainland policy said
that Wang, chairman of the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), is in
mainland China mainly to visit Chinese medicine research facilities
there and not for investment.</P>
      <P>Wang hopes to introduce mainland Chinese herbal medicine and its
bio-technology to Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, an FPG affiliate, and
promote the cross-strait exchange of Chinese medicine research and
expertise, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Wang said that FPG executives briefed the Ministry of Economic
Affairs and the Council for Economic Planning and Development that
Wang's visit to the mainland in the final stage leading up to
Taiwan's presidential election is sheer coincidence and does not bear
any political significance.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong press reports said that FPG, one of Taiwan's largest
private business groups, is planning massive investment projects on
the mainland and that FPG Chairman Wang had already gone to Beijing
quietly on Feb. 20 to meet with many senior mainland officials.</P>
      <P>The reports said Wang will visit Beijing, Shanghai and the
southeastern province of Fujian during his current trip. Wang
reportedly will inspect FPG's various investment projects in those
areas.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that if FPG wants to invest in the planting of
Chinese herbs or the production of plastics and industrial products
on the mainland, it will have to conform to current government
policies and regulations.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that when President Lee Teng-hui proposed a "go
slow" policy toward mainland China in Sept. 1996, urging local
businessmen to refrain from making major investments there to avoid
Taiwan being taken hostage economically by Beijing, the president
did not say the policy was set in stone.</P>
      <P>Lin said that as long as Beijing displays good will, then the
policy can be readjusted.</P>
      <P>On the planned visit of Kao Chin-yen, chairman of the Chinese
National Federation of Industries (CNFI), to the mainland after the
March 18 election, Lin said that the CNFI and the government have
been in close contact and he is confident that the federation will
carefully consider its visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said he believes the CNFI, which has played a crucial rule in
government policy-making and in communicating with business, will
take the timing of the visit, as well as national interests and
dignity, into consideration.</P>
      <P>Previously, FPG was forced to abort a multi-billion dollar plan
for a petrochemical complex in Fujian after the government launched
the "go slow" policy.</P>
      <P>Current ROC government regulations ban local enterprises from
investing US$50 million or more in a single project in mainland China
and require case-by-case approval for investment in high-tech
industries.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 40,000 Taiwanese businesses have poured
around US$30 billion into the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`I'M PEACEMAKER, NOT TROUBLEMAKER,' CLAIMS DPP CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian reiterated on Friday that
if he wins the March 18 presidential election, he will be "a
peacemaker, not a troublemaker."</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement to refute allegations that if he is
elected as the Republic of China's next president, he will promote
Taiwan independence and thus escalate tension in the Taiwan Strait,
which would in turn cause the Taiwan stock market to shed two-thirds
of its current value.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician said that if elected, he will handle
cross-strait relations with prudence, pragmatism, patience and
flexibility.</P>
      <P>"If elected, I will be a leader worthy of the trust of Beijing,
Washington and Tokyo," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's recently unveiled white paper on the
so-called "one-China principle and the Taiwan issue," Chen said the
people of Taiwan reject the use or threat of force in resolving
cross-strait problems.</P>
      <P>Beijing warned in an 11,000-word policy report that Taiwan will
face military attack if it continues to stall indefinitely
negotiations on reunifying with mainland China.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said Taiwan will not be intimidated. "We won't
start cross-strait talks under military threat and will never accept
terms for surrender," he said, adding: "If elected, my administration
will do its utmost to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait.
Nevertheless, we won't go to the negotiating table amid (mainland
China's) saber-rattling."</P>
      <P>Chen, a former Taipei mayor, further said that if elected, he
will make every possible effort to defend Taiwan's national dignity
and sovereignty. "I'll deal with all cross-strait issues based on the
principle that `Taiwan interests come first.'"</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed gratitude for the US government's quick
response to Beijing's latest threats to Taiwan. The US White House,
the Pentagon and Congress quickly condemned mainland China after it
released its intimidating white paper.</P>
      <P>Saying that democracy is a universal value, Chen said Taiwan and
the United States share the same ideals of upholding freedom,
democracy and human rights. "We appreciate the US concern about
Beijing's threat to Taiwan," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN  EFFORTS  TO  STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS PAYING OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian appeals to mainland China,
Indonesia and other countries to help Canberra stop the entry of
illegal immigrants are paying off and the influx is dropping,
according to the Immigration Department.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA on Friday, a spokesman for Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock said mainland China, Indonesia, Turkey and
countries of the Middle East are "very cooperative in helping
Australia stem the tide of illegal boat people."</P>
      <P>Indonesian police have recently detained more than 60 boat
people, mainly from Iraq and Iran, who were heading toward Australia,
in the first clear sign of cooperation with Australian authorities
since the flood of illegal immigrants began late last year, he said.</P>
      <P>Previously, Indonesia had done little to prevent the growing tide
of people using Indonesia as a stop-over on their way to Australia
because would-be migrants pay large sums of money to Indonesian
brokers who supply them with unreliable boats for the journey.</P>
      <P>The latest action indicates that Indonesian police are getting
serious about improving relations with Australia. Bilateral relations
between Canberra and Jakarta have been strained since Australia took
a leading role in the UN peacekeeping force in East Timor.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the number of boat people from mainland China
and other countries is also showing signs of falling in February
because of cooperation from these governments in cracking down on
trafficking of humans.</P>
      <P>Australia spends about US$20 million a year in feeding and
accommodating illegal immigrants at detention centers, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Between June 1999 and early this year, more than 3,000 boat
people had entered Australia illegally, he said.</P>
      <P>Australia, with a land size almost as big as that of the United
States, has 37,000 kilometers of coastline, much longer than
America's 20,000 km.</P>
      <P>The influx of illegal immigrants has also disrupted the
Australian government's yearly intake of refugees. Australia accepts
12,000 refugees each year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHARE PRICES FALL BELOW 9,500 POINTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Waning investor confidence further dragged
down the Taiwan stock market for the forth consecutive day on Friday,
after the index fell 3.2 percent over the previous three sessions.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index
nose-dived 166.68 points, or 1.7 percent, to finish at 9,432.49. The
turnover narrowed to total NT$149.64 billion (US$4.86 billion).</P>
      <P>Affected by the sharp fall of traditional manufacturing issues,
share prices across the board dropped as fear over Beijing's threat
toward Taiwan, and the upcoming elections, continued to hover over
the market.</P>
      <P>According to dealers, the electronics sector was relatively
loss-proof compared to other shares, with high-priced shares starting
to recover from earlier losses as they were boosted by the
record-creating US technology-heavy NASDAQ index and a promising
future for the industry. However, raw material-related shares were
expected to suffer either consolidation or loss in the short term due
to lack of investor confidence.</P>
      <P>The market in general weakened following the index plunge to
below 9,500 points, and the dealers said the index is likely to fall
further to 9,300 points. They suggested that investors should not be
too hasty in selling shares to avoid immediate losses.</P>
      <P>Decliners led advancers 520 to 53, with 23 issues remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) also reported negative results, with the exception of
September and December futures, which reported no transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for March shed 138 points to finish at 9,602,
with 2,380 contract transactions. Those for April dipped 169 points
to close at 9,661, with 134 contract transactions, while those for
June fell 120 points to finish at 9,800, with 30 contract
transactions.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Friday were 9,740 points
for March, 9,830 points for April, 9,920 points for June, 9,940
points for September and 10,051 points for December.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, reported mixed results and falls,
respectively.</P>
      <P>March TE futures rose 0.75 points to close at 489, with 541
contract transactions, April TE futures moved up 3.6 points to close
at 493.6, with 27 contract transactions, and June TE futures moved
down 12.95 points to close at 496.05, with one contract transaction.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for September or

    <HEADLINE>MAC TO RESPOND TO BEIJING'S WHITE PAPER ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Su Chi, chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), was scheduled to make an official
response on Friday to Beijing's white paper on Taiwan, issued on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The white paper shows that mainland China has hardened its policy
on reunification with Taiwan, warning for the first time that if the
island drags its feet indefinitely on the reunification issue,
Beijing will adopt "drastic measures," including the possible use of
force.</P>
      <P>The 11,000-word policy statement released ahead of Taiwan's March
18 presidential election is seen by local political observers as
obviously designed to affect Taiwan's election.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General to the President Ding Mou-shih, Deputy
Secretary-General to the President Lin Bih-Jaw, MAC Chairman Su Chi,
MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin, Foreign Minister Chen Chien-jen, and
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Lee Ta-wei had since Tuesday been
analyzing the white paper, together with foreign countries' reactions
to it.</P>
      <P>A meeting was convened on Wednesday by Ding to discuss the
matter, and Chen, Su, Lin were all present. In addition, Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, also attended the
meeting, after which a briefing was prepared for President Lee
Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Taipei's policy makers deem that the timing of the white paper
takes the mainland's domestic situation into consideration.</P>
      <P>One of the factors governing the timing of its release, they
said, may be increasing pressure from the mainland's military
leaders, adding that the paper is probably aimed at pacifying the
army's keen impatience over the pace of the reunification issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they added, it might also be designed to convey
Beijing's intentions to the United States and the international
community.</P>
      <P>According to informed sources, Lee deems cross-Taiwan Strait
security as the government's top priority in ensuring that the
upcoming presidential election is conducted smoothly.</P>
      <P>Against that backdrop, Lin on Tuesday adopted a rational and
low-key reaction, stating that each side should be allowed to
interpret the definition of "one China" as a precursor to
reunification negotiations, and this position was not expected to
change significantly in Su's Friday statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING WHITE PAPER CHALLENGES US `CHINA POLICY': OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China official said on
Friday that mainland China's recently unveiled "Taiwan issue" white
paper poses a challenge to the two basic values upheld in the US
"China policy" -- peace and democracy.</P>
      <P>Liu Chih-kung, director of the North American Affairs Department
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the remarks at a routine
press conference.</P>
      <P>Liu said the US government has reacted quickly and unequivocally
toward Beijing's new policy paper, which warns Taiwan it will face
military attack if it continues to indefinitely drag its feet over
negotiations on China's reunification.</P>
      <P>Since Beijing released the white paper on Monday, senior US
officials, from President Bill Clinton on down, have wasted no time
in sternly criticizing Beijing's threats to Taiwan and reiterating
the basic US stance that cross-Taiwan Strait issues must be settled
peacefully.</P>
      <P>The US Congress and news media have also condemned Beijing for
its saber-rattling against Taiwan in the run-up to Taiwan's March 18
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the strong US response to Beijing's new
11,000-word policy paper to three factors. First and foremost, Liu
said, the United States think that Beijing's military threats against
Taiwan challenge Washington's peace- and democracy-centered China
policy.</P>
      <P>"The United States has staunchly insisted that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait resolve their disputes or differences through
peaceful dialogue," Liu said, adding that the United States has also
demanded that cross-strait dialogue be conducted on terms acceptable
to both sides, and that the final arrangements for Taiwan's future
should acquire the consent of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that the three definitive Washington-Beijing
communiques -- the 1972 Shanghai communique, the 1979 communique on
establishment of formal US-mainland China ties, and the 1982 August
17 communique -- and many other relevant US official documents, have
clearly explained these two major ingredients of the US China policy.</P>
      <P>Another reason behind the Clinton administration's strong
reaction lies in US frustration over Beijing's failure to respond to
its call that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait refrain from taking
any provocative action in the leadup to the Taiwan election, Liu
noted.</P>
      <P>The third reason is that Beijing's saber-rattling will only stir
up anti-communist China sentiment in the United States, thus
hindering improvement of Washington-Beijing relations, a development
that the Clinton administration does not want to see in a US election
year, Liu said. The United States will elect a new president later
this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Formosan Association for Public
Affairs (FAPA), a US-based organization that supports independence
for Taiwan, issued a statement on Thursday to laud President Bill
Clinton for his remarks on the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Clinton stressed on Thursday that the United States will continue
to reject the use of force as a means of resolving the Taiwan issue
and will also continue to make absolutely clear to Beijing that the
issue must be resolved peacefully and with the consent of the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>FAPA President Chen Wen-yen said in the statement that the FAPA
thinks the United States should adopt a more positive and democratic
approach to supporting Taiwan's efforts to decide its own future and
should strengthen the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) by passing the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA).</P>
      <P>He said that the FAPA resolutely supports the US government's
existing stance on the Taiwan issue, which is to oppose the use of
military force against Taiwan and to oppose any attempt to force the
people of Taiwan to accept any arrangement concerning Taiwan's future
that the people of Taiwan do not think is best.</P>
      <P>The FAPA consists of Taiwanese residing in the United States. Its
headquarters is located near Capitol Hill, and the association has
many branch offices in various US cities.</P>
      <P>The goals of the FAPA are to strive for support from the US
executive and legislative branches for the welfare and security of
the people of Taiwan as well as to help Taiwan become an independent
and democratic country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS ON VOTERS TO CAREFULLY SELECT NEXT PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Friday called on voters to carefully select the country's next
president.</P>
      <P>Lee made the call while receiving leaders of the Multiple
District 300, Lions Club International, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>"If you liken the selection of a president to the selection of an
apple, we (the voters) must absolutely not select a bitter-tasting or
overripe apple, so as voters, we should therefore open our eyes and
elect a person with rich experience in national administration," Lee
said.</P>
      <P>He then gave an overview of the ROC's achievements over the past
two years since the Asian financial crisis which began in mid-1997.
He pointed out that many Asian countries suffered heavily, but added
that although Taiwan was also affected by the crisis, it quickly
recovered because of its healthy banking system, and adopted a series
of appropriate measures to counter the situation.</P>
      <P>He also referred to the Sept. 21 earthquake which caused massive
loss of live and property in central Taiwan, and how the people stood
united to help the government and the earthquake victims arise from
the rubble. Because of these efforts, he went on, Taiwan not only
arose, but also won the respect of the international community, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Lee further pointed out that the earthquake also had an impact on
the economies of Japan and the United States, noting that during the
period, the prices of electronic parts registered a 40 percent
increase in the Japanese market, while Taiwan also affected US Nasdaq
prices, showing the island's importance in the world's economic
development.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned his government's politicial reform and the
democratization of Taiwan, and said that under his leadership, the
government has successfully carried out political reform and the
democratization over the past 12 years.</P>
      <P>He told visitors that he will step down from office on May 20 and
that maintaining the government's record of achievements will be the
responsibility of the new president.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the voters not to vote for a person without trust and
sincerity. "We cannot smash our `political miracle' by wrongly
selecting the next president and making Taiwan a joke the
international community," Lee added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EUROPE TO BE IMPORTANT PARTNER FOR TAIWAN: PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Friday he
hopes that a "European network," which encompasses technology and
culture, will evolve between Taiwan and Europe in the near future.</P>
      <P>Addressing the participants to a luncheon sponsored by the
European Trade Representatives Organization, Lee said the formation
of such a network will allow Taiwan and Europe to "join hands to
build a brighter new era for the world."</P>
      <P>Lee further said he believes that Europe, which has abundant
cultural assets and advanced science and technology will surely be
an important partner for Taiwan on its path to greater humanitarian
development and economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his hope that European countries
will continue to give the Republic of China their greatest support
and "join us in striving to further enhance the relations between
Europe and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lee said the ROC's March 18 presidential election
will have great significance for Taiwan's economic and political
development.</P>
      <P>"It will also determine the direction of our future development,
and therefore has received worldwide attention," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee outlined major factors behind Taiwan's rapid
economic development in the past few decades.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Taiwan's economic development is closely
related to its democratization process. "The real economic take-off
occurred when we concurrently engaged in political democratization
and economic liberalization," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the realization of democratic ideals helped
Taiwan's freely competitive market economy to gradually develop,
thereby rapidly expanding Taiwan's exports and injecting a new
vitality to Taiwan's robust economy.</P>
      <P>"This has allowed Taiwan, in a little over a decade, to raise
per capita income from US$3,130 in 1985 to US$14,103 in 1999, and to
increase total trade from US$50.8 billion in 1985 to US$232.3
billion in 1999. Furthermore, our foreign exchange reserves have
multiplied from US$22.7 billion in 1985 to US$106.2 billion as of
the end of January 2000," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also cited four other reasons for Taiwan's economic success
-- vigorous and dynamic small- and medium-sized enterprises; the
availability of capital; a solid foundation of technology
industries; and Taiwan's close interrelationship with three large
"networks" (connections with Silicon Valley, Asia and Taiwanese
business associations around the world, which have greatly expanded
its space for economic development.)</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that as Taiwan and Europe share common ideals
of political democracy and economic liberalization, the relations
between the two sides have grown closer day after day.</P>
      <P>"Europe is currently our third largest trading partner. In 1999,
our trade with Europe totaled US$37.91 billion," Lee said.</P>
      <P>With respect to cultural and educational exchanges, Lee said,
more and more of Taiwan students are studying in Europe. Academic
cooperation projects, cultural interchanges and reciprocal tours by
artistic groups have increased in frequency.</P>
      <P>"Not only have these exchanges enhanced our mutual
understanding, but they also strengthen our friendly relations and
lay a solid foundation for greater cooperation in the future," Lee
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso
will make a state visit to the Republic of China after the ROC's
March 18 presidential election, Panamanian government sources said
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the two sides have yet to work out a
definite schedule for Moscoso's first state visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Panama is one of the ROC's important diplomatic allies in
Central America.</P>
      <P>On behalf of President Lee Teng-hui, ROC Premier Vincent Siew
invited Moscoso to visit Taiwan when he attended Moscoso's inaugural
ceremony as Lee's special envoy in September 1999. At that time, the
Panamanian president had accepted the invitation.</P>
      <P>Sources said Moscoso was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan in
February this year. As Taiwan is now busy with presidential
campaign activities, Moscoso decided to postpone her visit
until after the ROC's hotly contested presidential election. By
then, Moscoso will be able to meet with the ROC's president-elect to
discuss measures to further boost bilateral cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MANUFACTURERS REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Results of a survey by the Taiwan Institute
for Economic Research indicate that half of local manufacturers are
optimistic about the island's economic performance in the coming six
months.</P>
      <P>An institute researcher said that although the general index on
January's economic performance continued to slip for the third
consecutive month, more manufacturers foresee a better performance
during the February-July period.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that 49.2 percent of the respondents believe the
performance will take a turn for the better, up from January's 30.8
percent. But at the same time, 16.3 percent said the economic
performance will worsen, up from January's 9.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The institute asserted that Taiwan's economy will continue to
grow this year amid favorable factors at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>It noted that the world economy is expected to grow by 2.8
percent this year, and added that the growth rate will be 3.7 percent
for the United States, 3.1 percent for Europe, 1.2 percent for Japan,
and 6.5 percent for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the island's various economic fundamentals remain sound, the
institute said, the Taiwan stock market will continue to enjoy hectic
trading for some time, unless interrupted by non-economic factors.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that it is still safe for foreign capital to enter
the Taiwan stock market before the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the exchange rate of the Taiwan currency, the institute
said the new Taiwan dollar's value against the greenback may continue
to inch up in the future, following the expected influx of more
foreign capital into the stock market and an increase in the island's
trade surplus and foreign currency reserves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC COUNTERS BEIJING'S CLAIMS BY AGAIN CALLING TIES STATE-TO-STATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei reiterated its advocacy of special
state-to-state ties with Beijing to counter mainland China's claim
that Taiwan is part of its territory.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a cautious reply to
Beijing's white paper on Taiwan policy that special state-to-state
ties should be the basis for current bilateral negotiations and
exchanges, given the fact that "China" is a split nation governed
separately by the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People's
Republic of China in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China will never accept Beijing's "one China
policy" as defined in its white paper issued on Monday, said the MAC.</P>
      <P>Five days after Beijing claimed in the white paper that "the ROC
has ceased to exist in history", that "the People's Republic of China
has inherited sovereignty over Taiwan," and that "Taiwan has always
been a local authority of China," the MAC said in its first official
response that the mainland interpretations are absolutely
unacceptable to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Dismissing Beijing's claims as departing from reality, the MAC
said in a written statement that this white paper will only give rise
to resentment among the people of Taiwan against Beijing and hurt the
feelings of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In the white paper, Beijing for the first time threatened to use
force against Taiwan if the island indefinitely postponed
negotiations with Beijing on national reunification.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level agency in charge of mapping out Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China said the ROC will not bow to military
intimidation, a move that would raise further problems while solving
none of them.</P>
      <P>It accused Beijing of using the white paper to try to influence
the outcome of Taiwan's presidential election and to mislead the
international community into considering Taiwan to be part of
mainland China by timing the release of the white paper to coincide
with the run-up to the election on March 18.</P>
      <P>However, the white paper only betrays Beijing's antagonism toward
and fear of democracy, exposing its bellicose and hegemonist
character, said the MAC.</P>
      <P>Touting the ROC for having always based its policy toward
mainland China on public opinion, the MAC said Taiwan will never
compromise its determination to defend democracy, to shield its
elections from overseas interference and to pursue peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Blaming the different political structures of Taiwan and mainland
China for their rivalry, the MAC said Taiwan is looking forward to
changes in the mainland Chinese political system and social
structure, two improvements that are vital both to stability on the
mainland and to the eventual reunification of China.</P>
      <P>Although both agree that there is only "one China," Taipei and
Beijing are far from agreeing which regime enjoys sole legitimacy.</P>
      <P>In its statement, the MAC urged Beijing to return to the
consensus reached by both sides in 1994 which allowed Taipei and
Beijing to each write their own versions of the "one China policy."</P>
      <P>Only by agreeing to disagree on the meaning of "one China" can
the two sides resume dialogue and exchanges, and build a constructive
relationship, said the MAC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL, EVA, BOEING SIGN ACCORD ON AIRCRAFT REMODELING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines, Eva Airways Corp., Japan
Asia Airways, Aero Industry Development Corp. (AIDC) and the US
Boeing Co. entered into an agreement on aircraft remodeling on
Friday, witnessed by officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA).</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, the participants will jointly tap the air
cargo market in the Asia-Pacific region. It was estimated that
business in remodeling passenger aircraft for cargo use will top the
NT$10 billion mark annually.</P>
      <P>A signing ceremony was held at the MOEA. Joseph M. Gullion,
president of Boeing's airplane services division; Chen Ho-hsien,
board chairman of Eva Green Aerospace Hi-Tech Corp.; and Hu Chin,
general manager of AIDC, inked the accord on behalf of their
respective parties. Vice Economics Minister Ying Chi-ming witnessed
the ceremony.</P>
      <P>CAL, Eva Airways, AIDC and Japan Asia Airways will each chip in
NT$100 million to establish the International Consortium on Airplane
Service (ICAS) to implement the aircraft remodification business.</P>
      <P>It was understood that Singapore also sought a cooperation
agreement with Boeing to conduct airplane remodeling. After
considering the positions of CAL and EVA Airways as two of the
world's leading air cargo carriers -- and their potential maintenance
requirements -- Boeing selected Taiwan's airlines for the business
cooperation partnership instead of Singapore's.</P>
      <P>A MOEA official pointed out that CAL and Eva Airways' air cargo
business operations stand for 40 percent of the world market, and
coupled with the aircraft repair and maintenance potential of Japan
Asia Airways and AIDC, the newly established consortium will have a
brilliant future.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that airplane refurbishment is a new business with
an estimated worldwide annual worth of around NT$100 billion. The
Asian market alone will see an annual NT$10 billion worth of
business.</P>
      <P>The cooperation among these companies will help them to obtain
supplemental-type certification (STC) from the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to remodel passenger aircraft into air cargo
planes.</P>
      <P>Because airplane modification will involve technical difficulties
and potential problems originating from the airplanes' original
designs, the process of modification should be completely supervised
by the FAA and other agencies; otherwise the consortium would be
unable to obtain the FAA's STC approval.</P>
      <P>That is one reason why the four local airlines sought cooperation
with Boeing. Another is that the refurbishment will cut the cost and
waiting time involved for the local companies to take delivery of
cargo planes.</P>
      <P>There are a total of 1,500 air cargo planes around the world, of
which 70 percent were remodeled from passenger planes. The number of
aircraft worldwide will double by 2020.</P>
      <P>It was estimated, therefore, that the world will need 2,775 air
cargo planes in the coming 20 years.</P>

      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait two-way trade totaled a
record high of US$25,758 billion in 1999, an annual increase of 14.5
percent from the previous year, according to statistics released
Friday by the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The figure represents 11.1 percent of the country's overall
foreign trade for that year, said the BOFT.</P>
      <P>Exports from Taiwan to mainland China increased by 15.5 percent
to US$21,236 billion last year, representing 17.5 percent of the
island's overall exports, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's imports from mainland China grew by 10
percent, to total US$4,522 billion in 1999, registering 4.1 percent
of the country's overall imports.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of US$16,714 billion
with mainland China last year, a record high.</P>
      <P>Except for September, when the island was affected by a
devastating earthquake, Taiwan's monthly exports to the mainland grew
by double-digit percentages in the second half of last year,
indicated the BOFT, adding that the expanded exports also indirectly
stimulated Taiwan's demand for raw materials from mainland China.</P>

repaired in a successful operation recently at Taipei Veterans
General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Wei Mo-lin, 93, is Taiwan's oldest patient to successfully
undergo the surgery, said his surgeon, Lai Hsiao-ting.</P>
      <P>Wei was diagnosed with an enlarged heart because two of his
heart's four valves could not close properly. As a result, blood was
leaking back into the chambers it came from, leading to bloated limbs
and shortness of breath.</P>
      <P>Before the surgery was performed, Wei's condition had
deteriorated to the extent that he was largely confined to bed and
had rest several times just going the short distance from his bed to
the bathroom, because of his weak heart.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 25 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Denouncing mainland Chinese attempts to
destabilize Taiwan's forthcoming presidential elections with its
threats, US Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) on Friday urged Congress to
deny mainland China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status.</P>
      <P>The Ohio Democrat said as Congress prepares to vote on permanent
NTR to mainland China: "We cannot afford to turn a blind eye to
China's intimidation tactics. China's threat of military action
against their democratic neighbor should send a message to every
member of Congress. We cannot afford to dole out increased trade
privileges to a country that has no respect for the rule of law."</P>
      <P>"China is obviously desperate to undermine the growth of
democracy just off its shores. Four years ago, the Chinese government
tried to upset Taiwan's first historic democratic presidential
election by shooting missiles across the straits of Taiwan, but their
plan backfired. Last week, they were at it again. This time, they
threatened military action only three weeks before Taiwan's second
democratic election," noted the congressman.</P>
      <P>Brown added: "The people of Taiwan deserve to elect their
president without the threat of violence."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON DOWNPLAYS BEIJING'S THREATS AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton on Friday
downplayed the latest mainland Chinese threat against Taiwan</P>
      <P>Clinton said: "You have to see it in the context of the electoral
politics playing out in Taiwan and not necessarily assume that some
destructive actions will follow, just as I saw the Taiwanese
provocative comments in the context of the Taiwanese elections."</P>
      <P>While urging American business leaders to press Congress to
support the Washington-Beijing agreement to bring mainland China into
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Clinton stressed that the United
States will continue to reject the use of force as a means to resolve
the Taiwan issue and will continue to make absolutely clear that
cross-strait issues must be resolved peacefully and with the assent
of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the president told reporters that "the United States has had
now for two decades a `one China' policy. It says: We believe in one
China. But we believe the differences between Taiwan and Beijing have
to be resolved in a diplomatic manner. And we support a cross-strait
dialogue."</P>
      <P>Clinton pointed out that President Lee Teng-hui announced last
July that he thought there should be state-to-state relations between
Taiwan and mainland China, and later the mainland Chinese conducted
some military maneuvers, which raised questions. "But it would be a
mistake for either side to abandon the policy that has served both
well for the last 20 years," he said.</P>
      <P>Although conceding that the latest mainland Chinese statement on
Taiwan has made it harder for his administration to win congressional
support for the WTO pact, Clinton said: "In the absence of some
destructive action, it would be a terrible mistake for the United
States, and for those who basically find this an uncomfortable vote
(on the US-PRC WTO agreement), to use this as an excuse to isolate
China and almost guarantee the very things they say they are worried
about."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's deicison to allow North Korea
to open its first consulate in Hong Kong has sparked fears that
Pyongyang will use the territory as a base for drug smuggling, money
laundering and other criminal activity.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, a correspondent for The Australian
newspaper quoted an unnamed Western diplomat as saying: "North Korean
diplomatic missions have largely distinguished themselves as bases
for racketeering, money laundering, smuggling and bribery. Opening in
Hong Kong is a great opportunity for Pyongyang to increase its
earnings overseas."</P>
      <P>North Korea opened its first consulate in Hong Kong early this
month, a diplomatic coup for what Washington calls a "rogue state."</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Hong Kong police are especially concerned
about the presence in the consulate of one official believed to have
links to drug smuggling gangs in Afghanistan and Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Defectors from North Korea have claimed that Hong Kong has been
used in the past as a trans-shipment point for equipment used in
North Korea's ballistic missile program, the daily reported, adding
that North Korea's consulate in nearby Macau is a base for terrorist

    <TEXT>
      <P>The French Foreign Office reiterated on
Friday that France respects Beijing's "one China" principle and
encourages both sides of the Taiwan Strait to hold direct dialogue to
ensure prosperity and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>A foreign office spokeswoman made the remarks when commenting on
Beijing's strongly worded white paper on "the one China principle and
the Taiwan issue" which threatens "drastic measures," including the
military invasion of Taiwan, if the island delays negotiations on
unification.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman stressed that the French government's stance on
respecting Beijing's "one China" principle as the basis for
negotiations on unification and on cross-strait relations has not
changed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, French news media continued to comment on Beijing's
white paper, with the Paris-based Le Figaro newspaper indicating on
Friday that Taiwan's sovereignty is a matter for the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It said that Beijing's threat of the use of force against Taiwan
cannot bear fruit, and added that Taiwan's democratic politics have
been well-developed and it is up to the people of Taiwan to solve the
dispute over Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The article concluded that from the campaigning activities of the
candidates in the run-up to the country's March 18 presidential
election, it is evident that Taiwan is unlikely to engage in
negotiations on unification with Beijing as long as Beijing continues
its saber-rattling.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate
Lien Chan enjoys the highest popularity among chief executive
officers (CEOs) of local small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
according to the results of an opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 1,040 CEOs was conducted on Feb. 20 by
the Republic of China Enterprise Development Research Association
with an aim of probing SME managers' voting preferences and their
opinions about certain economic issues.</P>
      <P>The poll results show that if the presidential vote were to take
place the following day, 38.6 percent of the respondents would vote
for Lien, while 26.7 percent would support the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party's standard-bearer, Chen Shui-bian, and
21.8 percent would choose independent hopeful James Soong.</P>
      <P>Only 3 percent said they would cast their ballots to eccentric
New Party candidate Li Ao, and 3.9 percent said they would opt for
independent contender Hsu Hsin-liang.</P>
      <P>Asked about the five candidates' odds of winning the March 18
election, 51.3 percent put their bets on a Lien victory; 27 percent
said they think that Soong will win; 15.7 percent expressed their

Lien is most capable of promoting Taiwan's economic growth, while
16.1 percent chose Soong, and 11 percent opted for Chen.</P>

economic climate is either "very good" or "good," while 51.5 percent
of the respondents said they think otherwise.</P>
      <P>However, 57.9 percent of those interviewed said the general
business situation in their own industry is either "very good" or
"good," compared to 40.1 percent who said the climate in their own
line of business is either "bad" or "very bad."</P>
      <P>Turning to the government's Asia-Pacific business hub development
project, 53.4 percent said they think that the ambitious plan is
"very helpful" or "helpful" to Taiwan, while 19.6 percent gave the
project a negative evaluation.</P>
      <P>Asked about the government's ability to implement its economic
policies, 57.5 percent said they are confident in the government's
ability, and only 26.5 percent gave a "no confidence" answer.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 63 percent of the CEOs gave a thumbs-up

      <P>Although some human rights problems
still exit Taiwan, an annual report by the US Department of State
hails the Taiwan authorities as "a government which widely respects
the public's human rights."</P>
      <P>With the holding of the first direct presidential election in
1996, Taiwan has been fully transformed into an open and democratic
society, in which police and security forces are effectively
controlled by a civilian government, the report says. On the economic
front, Taiwan enjoys a vigorous export-oriented market economy.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the problem of politically motivated
murders and disappearances does not exist in Taiwan, but some human
rights issues, such as gender discrimination and violence against
women, abuse of children and child prostitution, social injustice
against aboriginal minorities, and political intervention in judicial
systems, still remain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report goes on, the human rights situation in
mainland China has noticeably deteriorated over the past year, with
Beijing's continued crackdown on democracy activists and Falung Gong
followers. It notes that the extensive cases of Beijing's human
rights abuses collected in its 110 pages are all against
international norms.</P>
      <P>Although basic human rights are protected by the mainland Chinese
constitution, the report says, the Beijing authorities usually ignore
these clauses.</P>

mudslides caused by the recent torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Peng made the remarks at a press conference held in Taipei,
during which he said that although the presidential hopefuls have
made one attempt after another to woo the voters, they do not care
about the real needs of Nantou people who are still reeling from the
devastating Sept. 21 earthquake, and now face the new terror of
mudslides.</P>
      <P>Peng said that the past week of rain has battered Nantou County,
which is still trying to rebuild from the rubble of the killer
temblor. The rain has triggered serious mudslides which have to date
caused two deaths and at least two injuries.</P>
      <P>Peng said he appreciated the presidential hopefuls' visits to
Nantou to express concern, but suggested more substantial measures to
help his county.</P>
      <P>These measures, he said, should include central government help
for the local government to improve its dire financial plight and
reduce the huge debts accumulated over the years.</P>
      <P>Peng also asked the central government to subsidize Nantou County

a torrent of mud.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARATS HEAD MAY VISIT TAIWAN THIS SUMMER IF KMT WINS ELECTION: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Huang Kuei-mei and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan,
Wang Daohan, is likely to visit Taiwan this summer if the island's
ruling Kuomintang wins the March 18 presidential election, a senior
Taiwan official claimed on Friday.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council,
which charts the Republic of China's policy toward mainland China,
made the remark during an interview with Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun
daily.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China is to blame for the suspension of
regular dialogue across the Taiwan Strait, Su said he hopes that
Wang, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), will visit Taiwan this year to pave the
way for the resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the earlier the resumption of bilateral
dialogue, the better the interests of both sides of the Taiwan Strait
will be served," Su said.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top mainland policy planner further said he believes
that if Vice President Lien Chan -- also the KMT standard-bearer in
the current presidential race -- wins the presidency, cross-strait
dialogue could resume very quickly.</P>
      <P>Su also predicted that Wang's long-planned Taiwan visit could be
realized this summer if Lien wins the election, adding that the ROC
government has been very active in preparing for Wang's visit.</P>
      <P>Asked in which capacity the ROC's new president would receive
Wang, Su said he does not think that will be a problem. "I don't
think mainland China would make an issue of it," he added.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Su also said the ROC expects that Taipei's and
Beijing's accession to the World Trade Organization will bring about
positive effects on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former Shanghai mayor and a mentor to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan last
autumn. However, the Beijing authorities indefinitely postponed
Wang's visit after ROC President Lee Teng-hui said last July that
cross-strait relations should be defined as "a special state-to-state
relationship."</P>
      <P>Although the ROC government insists that the definition is just
an affirmation of a long-existing political reality, Beijing
interprets the definition as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian said on Saturday that if
elected, he will push for exemption of income and business taxes for
residents of Taiwan's offshore islands, including Penghu.</P>
      <P>Chen told a campaign rally in Penghu, an island county off
southwestern Taiwan coast, that if he wins the March 18 presidential
election, he will carry out national reforms under three premises --
maintaining stability in personnel, structure and policy.</P>
      <P>He also promised to push for "necessary" revisions of tax laws to
allow exemptions of income and business taxes for the residents of
Taiwan-held offshore islands, which generally lag behind Taiwan in
terms of economic development.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician further said that if elected, he
will lobby Chang Jung-fa, chairman of Evergreen Group, which operates
the world's largest container shipping fleet, to invest in Penghu,
Chang's home county.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen's campaign headquarters in Taipei showcased a new
television commercial calling for "party rotation" to further boost
Taiwan's party politics and democratization.</P>
      <P>The commercial features interviews with ordinary people who voice
a unanimous call: Vote down the ruling Kuomintang in the upcoming
election. One pedestrian in the commercial says he believes that the
KMT could be the most powerful and most competent opposition party
because it has "done whatever dirty thing you can name during its
50-plus years in power."</P>
      <P>Lo Wen-chia, one of Chen's campaign aides, said a system whereby

    <HEADLINE>COMPUTER EXHIBIT FEATURING RECYCLING UNDER WAY IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A computer exhibition featuring products
made from recycled scrap computers opened on Saturday at the Taipei
World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has become the world's third-largest information
products manufacturer, the recycling of scrap information products on
the island has been largely neglected.</P>
      <P>In order to address this anomaly, the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) began working to recycle scrap
information products on June 1, 1998, and Taiwan is also the first
country in the world to push for legislation governing the recycling
of information products.</P>
      <P>The concept of environmental protection is widespread among
information product consumers in Europe and the United States, and
many people refuse to buy information products from companies that do
not recycle or send old, but still serviceable products, to those in
need in less-developed countries.</P>
      <P>To date, 650,000 scrap computers have been recycled in Taiwan
under joint efforts of the information product industry, the
recycling sector and the government. The EPA urged the public to
continue to support the government's recycling policy.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the computer exhibition, which will run until Feb.
29, can see a series of products made from recycled information
products.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will move to the Taichung World Trade Center,
where it will run from March 10-15 and will also go to Kaohsiung from
April 5-9.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW HOUSING OPENED FOR THAILAND-BASED NATIONALIST VETERANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiang Rai, northern Thailand, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By F.C. Kuo and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Overseas Chinese
Affairs Commission (OCAC) Minister Chiao Jen-ho on Saturday held a
ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the completion of 49 new brick-built
houses for Nationalist veterans at a village in northern Thailand.</P>
      <P>Giving thanks to the more than 60 Rotary Club members from Taiwan
who raised the funds for the housing construction and who were
present at the ceremony, Chiao revealed that the OCAC also donated
money to build two classrooms so that the village children can learn
Chinese, and expressed the hope that the veterans who move into the
new houses will be able to enjoy a better quality of life.</P>
      <P>According to Chiao, the Cabinet member in charge of maintaining
contact with the more than 9,000 overseas Chinese communities across
the world, Chinese people around the globe have altogether helped
build more than 100 classrooms, and have donated over 4,000 desk and
chair sets for local Chinese school students in northern Thailand.</P>
      <P>The Rotary Club, after the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation and the Chinese Refugee Relief Association, has been the
third charity group from Taiwan to help the more than 40,000 veterans
and their families to build new houses in this remote mountainous
area.</P>
      <P>A Rotary Club representative stressed that this contribution is
only a beginning, and promised to continue raising funds in order to
help needy people.</P>
      <P>Thousands of the veterans settled in northern Thailand after
retreating from southwestern mainland China following the defeat of
KMT forces by the Chinese communists in 1949.</P>
      <P>Today, they remain stateless, officially unrecognized by both the
Republic of China and Thailand, and many of them are still living in
thatched houses in a dozen impoverished villages scattered throughout
this region.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, ROC Representative to Thailand Huang
Hsien-yung urged the veterans to pay greater importance to their
children's education, stressing that only a good education will help
create a brighter future for them.</P>
      <P>In addition, Huang also called on the ROC agricultural missions
dispatched to neighboring regions to teach the veterans and their
descendants to improve their farming technology as a means of
improving their standards of living.</P>
      <P>Later the same day, Chiao also made an inspection trip to the
Tatung High School -- a Chinese school located in a neighboring
village -- where he pledged to donate computers to the school.</P>
      <P>Chiao is scheduled to fly back to Taiwan on Sunday after
concluding a four-day fact-finding visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE HITS CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR KMT TICKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Saturday
he will end his presidency in May to uphold the country's democratic
constitutional system.</P>
      <P>"My decision to step down has nothing to do with my health," Lee
said at a campaign forum, in an apparent attempt to refute a claim in
a recently published book that Lee is suffering from a pancreatic
tumor.</P>
      <P>Lee arrived in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung on
Friday evening to campaign for the ruling Kuomintang's
standard-bearer in the March 18 presidential election, Vice President
Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Lee, who managed to garner more than half of the vote in
Kaohsiung in the 1996 presidential election, attended three campaign
forums on Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>He said that although he is 79 years old, he still enjoys good
health.</P>
      <P>"It's meaningless to speculate on my health simply for
presidential campaign purposes," Lee said, adding that politically
motivated speculation, like stock market speculation, will prove to
be futile in the long run.</P>
      <P>Lee urged local voters to be wise and prudent in choosing the
country's future leader. "A wrong choice will spell disaster or bad
fortune for both the people and the country," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>Praising both Lien and his running mate, Premier Vincent Siew, as
honest, sincere, diligent, experienced and responsible men, Lee said
he believes that the KMT ticket is the best choice in the upcoming
vote.</P>
      <P>Touching on mainland China's recently released white paper on the
so-called Taiwan issue, Lee said Taiwan will never bow to Beijing's
military threats. "We hope Beijing's leaders will understand that
only peaceful dialogue can lead to better relations across the Taiwan
Strait," he noted.</P>
      <P>Addressing a packed audience at an activity center for
blue-collar workers in Kaohsiung, Lee also said he will ask relevant
government agencies to study the feasibility of refunding national
health insurance premiums to those who have never seen a doctor
during a specific year, a proposal suggested by some labor union
leaders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERSEAS CHINESE CAUGHT UP IN FRENZY OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With only 20 days to go before Taiwan's
presidential election, overseas Chinese and local people alike have
been caught up in the frenzy of the election campaign.</P>
      <P>Eastern Multimedia Co., a local cable television company,
sponsored the second of its three forums in the run-up to Taiwan's
March 18 presidential election, with a program featuring a studio
audience in San Francisco linked via satellite to supporters of the
three main presidential contenders in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The program was broadcast live by satellite at 8 p.m. Saturday,
San Francisco time, and simultaneously at noon on Sunday, Taipei
time.</P>
      <P>Supporters of the three leading candidates -- Lien Chan of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), and independent James Soong -- took part in the TV forum
centered on Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition
of Taipei-Beijing ties as "special state-to-state" relations in 1999,
which infuriated Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsi-kun, secretary-general of Lien's Friends Association,
said that Taiwan, with its own army and currency, is not Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>But he said that Beijing has nevertheless consistently viewed
Taiwan as a province, and that is the reason behind President Lee's
redefinition of cross-strait ties -- to ensure the peace, safety and
dignity of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Mei-chen, director of the DPP's Department of International
Affairs, noted that Taiwan and mainland China are two independent
sovereign states, and that only an independent sovereign state can
have a presidential election, adding that the future of Taiwan should
be decided by its people.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-fang, a spokesman for Soong, said that the relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait involve two facts: that
the two sides are sovereign states independent of each other and that
cross-strait relations are both complex and sensitive.</P>
      <P>He said that President Lee's redefinition only addresses the
first fact and ignores the second one.</P>
      <P>Speaking in support of Lien, the association secretary-general
criticized the DPP's mainland policy as being too outrageous, which
would make the people Taiwan nervous, and Soong's policy as having
denigrated Taiwan, saying that only Lien's policy is moderate and
middle-of-the-road.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Hsiao noted that Chen has expressed that he will not
let the cross-strait redefinition be included in the constitution,
and that he will not change the name of the Republic of China if
elected.</P>
      <P>Chen said that unless mainland China tries to invade Taiwan by
force, he will try to maintain the status quo, according to Hsiao.</P>
      <P>Lin, speaking for Soong, noted the blind spots of both the KMT
and the DPP, saying that "state-to-state" relations are between two
countries that are foreign to one another, but in reality, Taiwan and
mainland China are not two foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Eastern Multimedia Co., will host its last US forum in New York
on March 5. The first one was held in Los Angles.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui called on voters
Sunday to back the ruling Kuomintang presidential candidate, Vice
President Lien Chan, and his running mate Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Lee made the call when he was invited to attend a rally for a
Buddhist fellowship association organized by Chungtai Temple in
Taichung.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the association said that more than 150,000
Buddhist supporters attended the rally, which was presided over by
Master Wei Chueh at Linkou Stadium in a suburb of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lien, President of the Legislative Yuan Wang Ching-ping,
Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou were
among those invited to attend.</P>
      <P>Addressing the rally, Lee at first praised the Buddhists'
contributions to helping the government maintain the peace and
security, as well as education, of the society.</P>
      <P>The chief of state recommended Lien to the participants and
described him as a person of honesty, good character and rich
experience.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the rally, Lien said that Taiwan has experienced two
successful reforms during the past five decades; namely transforming
from an agricultural-based economy to a high-tech-oriented economy,
and from a society lagging behind in democracy to one of political
democratization.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lee also attended a mass rally organized by the
Tai Ji Men Association with the purpose of welcoming the year of the
new millennium, held at Taoyuan County Stadium.</P>
      <P>Lee hailed the association for its contributions to promoting a
harmonious society over the past 35 years.</P>
      <P>Your motto, "to show loyalty, to show devotion, to love the
country and to love society," is a good example for people to follow,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee also took the opportunity to recommend Lien to the
participants.</P>
      <P>Lee called on the participants to vote for Lien, saying that only
he can lead the nation to face the challenges of the year of the new

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first of 30 exemplary farms to be
sponsored by Taiwan businesses in Panama was officially inaugurated
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Panamanian First Vice President Arturo Vallarino, Republic of
China Consular Ingrid Hsing and a Panamanian agricultural official
jointly presided over the inauguration ceremony at the farm in the
mountainous region of Herrera, a province in northeastern Panama.</P>
      <P>Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso attaches great importance to
the project sponsored by ROC businesses, but could not attend the
inauguration ceremony because she is now hospitalized, Vallarino
said.</P>
      <P>The first vice president is hoping that the project will help
farmers improve production skills, increase agricultural production
and upgrade the nutrition level of the children.</P>
      <P>Hsing, who arrived at the farm after more than five hours of a
bumpy ride in the mountainous area, lauded Moscoso's government for
making efforts in eradicating poverty through improving the living
standard of the Panamanian people.</P>
      <P>Hsing stressed that the ROC government is willing to increase
cooperation with Panama and promote its development in all aspects.</P>
      <P>ROC agricultural mission expert Lee San-yuan said that he would
come to the exemplary farm every week to help farmers upgrade their
production skills and increase production.</P>
      <P>The exemplary farm, with a size of three hectares, will be tended
by 144 people from 24 families. The ROC businesses have donated
US$10,000 for its basic facilities, and will provide technical
assistance.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has pledged to set up 30 such farms in Panama.</P>

      <P>Holders of Hong Kong and Macau Special
Administrative Region passports may soon be granted visa-free access
to European Union countries, the Hong Kong Standard reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, this follows a decision by the European

      <P>A two-thirds majority of EU member countries would be required
for the plan to be passed.</P>
      <P>Monfort said a working group of delegates from member countries

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PROMISES TO CREATE 100,000 JOBS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party candidate
(DPP) Chen Shui-bian promised on Sunday to create 100,000 jobs if he
is elected president on March 18.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at his Taichung campaign office in
central Taiwan, Chen said the 100,000 jobs will benefit 100,000
families and 1 million people.</P>
      <P>He unveiled numerous suggestions for creating jobs, roughly
grouped into four basic approaches.</P>
      <P>Chen promised to introduce industries that are new to Taiwan --
by lifting the ban on privately run distilleries, eliminating the
government's monopoly on the distribution of tobacco and liquor, and
setting up rice liquor distilleries in the area ravaged by the
earthquake last year.</P>
      <P>As part of that approach, he proposed establishing a Southeast
Asian trade center to promote trade with states in that area and
promote local culture and tourism to that market.</P>
      <P>He said more jobs could be created in "new industries" by
inviting developed countries to open colleges and universities in
Taiwan to upgrade the island's "culture-related industries," and by
encouraging professionalism in sports to allow athletes make a living
through playing sports.</P>
      <P>The DPP candidate promised to provide jobs to underprivileged
workers -- by opening day-care centers for seniors and children,
creating after-school centers for students, organizing vigilance
groups to patrol neighborhoods, and helping elderly unemployed
workers start their own businesses.</P>
      <P>The former Taipei mayor promised to safeguard workers' rights --
by giving aboriginals and residents of earthquake-ravaged areas
preferential treatment in applying for work on major projects funded
by the central government.</P>
      <P>To help ensure workers' rights to a decent wage, he proposed
guaranteeing that farmers' incomes equal the minimum wage set by the
government, and encouraging fishermen to process and sell their own
hauls to boost their income.</P>
      <P>Chen also promised to improve vocational training and
occupational safety -- by introducing an apprenticeship system like
the one used in Germany, and by encouraging enterprises to set up
"hope universities" which would integrate education, research,
development and employment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAMES SOONG FIERCELY CRITICIZES PRES. LEE TENG-HUI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential hopeful James
Soong on Sunday launched fierce criticism at President Lee Teng-hui,
Vice President Lien Chan and opposition Democratic Progressive Party
Presidential Candidate Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The former Taiwan governor also challenged Premier Vincent Siew,
who is the vice presidential candidate for the ruling Kuomintang, to
a public debate.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks at his northern Taiwan election campaign
headquarters inaugurated in Taoyuan City on Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Soong cited the case of the Linkou-Taoyuan railway, which is used
for coal transport, and the blockage of the Luchu Hsiang ,
saying that Lien had held the posts of premier and Taiwan governor
but did not handle the issue with care, and the situation is as yet
unresolved. He called on voters to support someone who works hard for
the people, like himself.</P>
      <P>He noted that Lee, Lien and Siew once proposed to abolish the
Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen under the
Cabinet and are now offering to raise the pension allowance to
NT$15,840 in order to grab votes. Soong joked that the number 15,840
is a homophone for "dead" in Chinese, while his offer of NT$16,888
sounds like "to develop along the way."</P>
      <P>Soong said that the KMT is implementing the so-called "domino
effect policy" in the election campaign by trying to oppress him with
all it can. He said top KMT leaders criticized DPP presidential
candidate Chen in a manner of "having air without power," while
supporting Lien in a manner of "abandoning without power."</P>
      <P>Soong then turned his spear to Siew and invited him to an open
debate because Siew said recently that the central government's debts
originate from the Taiwan provincial government's debt. Soong
previously served as Taiwan provincial governor. Soong described
Siew's statement by saying that "mad people have mad sayings."</P>
      <P>Soong also criticized Chen, who on Saturday made a campaign
promise to exempt people residing on the Penghu Islands from income
taxes. Soong described Chen's policy as discriminatory.</P>
      <P>Soong also criticized Lien and Chen's cross-strait policies.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three leading tickets in the
presidential election got various scores in terms of financial and
economic policy, according to a survey released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by a self-styled presidential election
observation group, consisting mainly of scholars and experts, found
that Lien Chan and Vincent Siew, representing the ruling Kuomintang,
got the highest approval rating on five of the 15 criteria used in
the survey, while an independent ticket was on top in four areas, and
the main opposition party ranked highest in six categories.</P>
      <P>The fields in which the Lien-Siew ticket is most-favored are:
"pushing for the leading edge in science and technology in the
Asia-Pacific area", "promoting the development of small- and
medium-sized businesses," "stimulating overall economic growth,"
"deregulating and globalizing the financial sector" and "upgrading
industries."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, independent candidate James Soong and his running mate
Chang Chao-hsiung lead the pack in "narrowing the gap between urban
and rural areas," "protecting investors," "pushing for traffic
infrastructure" and "fairly allocating government revenues between
the central and local governments."</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian and his
running mate Annette Lu were given the highest scores in "raising
government revenue," "privatizing state-run enterprises,"
"strengthening the local capital market," "managing government debt,"
"reforming the tax system" and "establishing an environmentally
friendly economy."</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-yeh, a professor at National Taiwan University, said at
a press briefing called to release the results the survey that it is
natural that Lien and Siew, candidates from the ruling party, were
considered the best choices in policy concerning industrial
development, while the opposition candidates Chen and Lu were deemed
the best for changing the status quo.</P>
      <P>Although financial policy is but one of many factors which
influence voters' choices, Legislator Lai Shyh-bao, who is the head
of the group that organized the poll, said at the press briefing that
he hoped the survey will lead the public to make their choices
according to candidates' campaign promises and their ability to
deliver on them, rather than by voters' personal feelings.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted recently among 502 adults in Taiwan with
a margin of error of 5 percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SANKEI SHINBUN PRAISES PRES. LEE'S CRISIS-HANDLING CAPABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's Sankei Shinbun published an article
on Sunday hailing Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
capability in handling the crisis caused by the killer earthquake
which jolted central Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999, resulting in huge
losses of life and property.</P>
      <P>The article, written by columnist Sotaro Ishigawa, also said that
Japan could learn a lot from Lee's handling of the crisis.</P>
      <P>Ishigawa hailed Lee's crisis-management capability after
comparing activities recorded in Lee's disaster-relief diary
following the Sept. 21 earthquake, with rescue activities by the
Japanese government after an earthquake jolted the Kobe area in 1995.</P>
      <P>Ishigawa visited Fengyuan in central Taiwan this January and
found that the area had already recovered from the disaster. He also
found that the Taiwanese and Japanese governments adopted different
measures in handling crises arising from natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Lee rushed to Taiwan's disaster area the following day and
ordered the military to help with rescue and reconstruction work as
well as to listen to complaints and requests from victims, while the
Japanese then-Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama made a field visit two
days after the Kobe quake, Ishigawa said.</P>
      <P>There was also a big difference between the ROC military's
arrival in the affected areas the day after the Sept. 21 quake, and
Japan's Self-defense Force arriving at the disaster area several days
after the Kobe quake occurred, Ishigawa pointed out.</P>
      <P>This indicates that Japanese government leaders lacked experience
in crisis-management, Ishigawa said, calling on them to learn from
Lee's experience in handling the aftermath of the Sept. 21 earthquake
in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, Feb. 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Chen Shui-bian, James Soong and Lien
Chan officially hit Taiwan's campaign trail last week, Time asked the
three leading presidential candidates to share their views on key
questions such as relations with China, security, corruption and the
country's future.</P>
      <P>On the issue of relations between China and Taiwan being "special
state-to-state" ties:</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian: "I believe Taiwan is already a sovereign and
independent country. But as president I would give three guarantees:
not to put 'state- to-state' relations in the constitution; not
proposing to change the name of the Republic of China; any change in
the status quo would have to be agreed by the 22 million people of
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lien Chan: "It has been the policy of our country for years.
Taiwan should not go independent. We cannot afford it. Nor can we be
united with the mainland -- we need flexibility, no set timetables."</P>
      <P>James Soong: "Taiwan and China should de-escalate tension,
establish direct dialogue and sign a non-aggression accord with
international witnesses -- the U.S. and Japan."</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's security issue:</P>
      <P>Chen: "Of course people feel threatened by China's missile
deployments -- Taiwan's security cannot depend just on hardware, but
also on political relations. We do not care so much whether the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act passes [in the US Congress], but we
are pleased to see the strong level of support in Congress for
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lien: "Our security must be strengthened. We need an effective
deterrence, including keeping open the possibility of joining the
Theater Missile Defense [system]."</P>
      <P>Soong: "I don't want to engage in an arms race with Beijing. But
I would warn Beijing that any military threat will only agitate the
Taiwanese and make them feel humiliated. It will not solve the
problem."</P>
      <P>The three candidates' responses on other issues can be found in
Time's March 6 issue, which reaches readers in Asia the week
beginning Feb. 28.

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS MOGUL'S VISIT TO MAINLAND HAS NO POLITICAL BEARING: SON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan business tycoon Wang Yung-ching's
current trip to mainland China has no political significance, Walter
Wang, the mogul's son, said here on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Walter Wang, who now heads J-M Manufacturing Company Inc., an
affiliate of his father's Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), said that his
father is visiting the mainland because he has not traveled there for
quite a long time and wants to meet some old friends there.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong press reports said that FPG, one of Taiwan's largest
private business groups, is planning massive investment projects on
the mainland and that FPG Chairman Wang had already quietly gone to
Beijing on Feb. 20 to meet with many senior mainland officials.</P>
      <P>The reports said Wang will visit Beijing, Shanghai and the
southeastern province of Fujian during his current trip. Wang
reportedly will inspect FPG's various investment projects in those
areas.</P>
      <P>The junior Wang said that he did not know whom his father is
meeting in the mainland, and stressed that his visit at this time in
the run-up to the presidential election is purely coincidence and has
no political significance.</P>
      <P>Walter Wang, who came to Flushing, New York, to attend a science
forum, reaffirmed that his father visited the mainland to discuss
investments in Chinese herbal medicine and the development of
biological expertise in that area on behalf of Chang Kung Memorial
Hospital, another FPG affiliate.</P>
      <P>FPG was forced to abort a multi-billion-dollar plan for a
petrochemical complex in Fujian province after the ROC government
launched the "go slow" policy toward investment in the mainland in
1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S NEW HARD LINE MERE SURVIVAL TACTIC, SAYS ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If PRC President Jiang Zemin stakes out
a new hard line against Taiwan and the West out of his ambition to
keep in power, then his opponents may go for the opposite: domestic
reform and liberalization, constructive relations with the West and
conciliation with Taiwan, said a renowned American China expert
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Arthur Waldron, director of Asian studies at the American
Enterprise Institute, wrote in The Washington Post that the signs of
Communist China declining Japan's invitation to join the G8 meeting,
letting World Trade Organization accession talks with the Europeans
break down, and releasing the menacing new document threatening
military force against Taiwan show that "Jiang Zemin is having
domestic political troubles and the new hard line against the West is
part of his survival strategy."</P>
      <P>Faltering economic growth over the past year has swelled a rising
tide of protest by farmers and industrial workers and has also driven
a steadily increasing crackdown on all forms of dissent, including
democratic activists, the harmless followers of the Falun Gong
movement, as well as Protestants and Tibetan Buddhists -- and now the
Internet and international business interests involved in it, said
the professor of international relations at the University of
Pennsylvania.</P>
      <P>Politically, however, Waldron pointed out, the big issue, and the
one that explains last week's warning about Taiwan, has to do with
power: Who will rule? One longtime PRC insider says: "Jiang wants to
be huangdi (emperor)." But emperors rule for life, and Jiang forswore
that ambition a few years ago, when all the other members of his
generation in power stepped down -- on the condition that Jiang would
step down as well when his current term expires.</P>
      <P>Now a "spontaneous" movement has reportedly begun to keep Jiang
in power and that has alarmed many mainland Chinese, including
"retired" elders, said Waldron. The problems for Communist Chinese
foreign relations arise from the stance that Jiang must now adopt
internally against this potential check to his ambition. He cannot
present himself as a reformer, so he is evidently rallying the
military, consolidating his party ties and wrapping himself in the
flag.</P>
      <P>What can the rest of the world do? Waldron wrote: "The error is
to imagine that somehow we have caused or contributed to the crisis,
an error to which the Clinton administration seems particularly
prone." For instance, in the case of Taiwan -- where Jiang dearly
hopes for more concessions -- the Clinton administration has
regularly confused effect with cause, imagining that American or
Taiwanese actions were somehow "provoking" Beijing, when in fact
Communist China was raising the stakes for its own reasons.</P>
      <P>"This has led to a counterproductive policy that has exacerbated
the military tension it was designed to reduce. When China fired
missiles near Taiwan during the island's last presidential election,
the American response -- after sending the carriers -- was to make
concessions, asserting the 'one China' policy and imposing the
current de facto moratorium on major arms sales to Taiwan," said the
China expert.</P>
      <P>Waldron added that American movement on the issues -- and the
fact that the movement came in response to Communist Chinese military
threats -- "emboldened Beijing and led it to expect that further
threats will lead to yet more movement in its direction."</P>
      <P>Beyond understanding this much, however, he said, "we can do
little more in preparation for the possible storm other than to
ensure that our own policies in Asia are hedged, even as we maintain
communications with China and keep strong alliance with states whose
values we share, whose politics are democratic and whose economies
are free."</P>
      <P>But Waldron is convinced that the prospects are not all grim. If
Jiang stakes out such a hard line as his power position, then his
opponents may go for the opposite because strong constituencies exist
in mainland China and in the Communist Party for such policies as
domestic reform and liberalization, constructive relations with the
West and conciliation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Abrupt change is characteristic of the Chinese system. Although
a storm may be brewing, it could -- eventually -- bring better
weather," concluded Waldron.

    <HEADLINE>CHEN LI-AN ANNOUNCES HIS SUPPORT FOR LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Li-an, the former president of the
Control Yuan, the highest level watchdog body in the nation, on
Monday formally made known his intention to support Vice President
Lien Chan, the presidential candidate of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the press conference that if Lien is elected, he
will bring the most "benefits" to the island in negotiations with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>He affirmed that his personal likes or dislikes were not
important in the decision, saying that the "welfare of 23 million
people living on the island" was his major concern.</P>
      <P>He said that he would have been going "against his conscience" if
he did not step forward to throw his support behind Lien at a time
when the mainland warned Taiwan not to indefinitely delay
negotiations with the mainland or face possible military attack.</P>
      <P>Beijing's State Council issued the stern warning in a "white
paper" last Monday.</P>
      <P>But Chen also admitted that the decision was a "painful" one
because the party has become corrupt and rotten over the years
despite its past glories.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he also said now is the time for the KMT, which is
"at a low ebb," to examine itself before it makes a fresh start.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that cross-strait negotiations are urgent and
inevitable, saying that the person who "will represent us at the
negotiating table must be someone who, in addition to his own
qualifications, also has the support of a political party."</P>
      <P>Chen, who lost in the last presidential election after quitting
the KMT to run as an independent candidate, said that having a KMT
president represent Taiwan in negotiations with the mainland will be
"valuable and is representative" because the KMT has had a long
history of dealing with the Communist Party.</P>
      <P>With Lien's open-mindedness, Chen said that Lien and his running
mate Vincent Siew, who is also a seasoned negotiator, will bring
Taiwan "peace and stability," which are the aspiration of the people
on Taiwan, said Chen.</P>
      <P>He said that it is no longer suitable for a "strong and
authoritative" president to be at the helm of the nation.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions by journalists, Chen reaffirmed that it is
important to conduct negotiations with Beijing, adding that if
cross-strait relations were not so tense at the present time, the
corrupt KMT would likely be replaced by another party in this
election.</P>
      <P>Chen continued that the two other major candidates in the
presidential race -- Chen Shui-bian of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and the independent James Soong -- are inferior to
the more seasoned Lien on the issue of handling cross-strait
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP presidential hopeful, who has advocated Taiwan
independence in the past, has adjusted his rhetoric to broaden his
support base among voters, he is not trustworthy in negotiating with
Beijing, Chen alleged.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that Chen's announcement on Monday will be a boost
for Lien as the presidential race kicks into high gear, especially
after the KMT recently suffered a major blow when Chung Jung-chi,
former vice secretary-general of the KMT and minister without
portfolio, walked out and offered to quit the KMT late last week.</P>
      <P>Various polls on the three major presidential hopefuls -- Lien,
Chen, Soong -- have shown that they are closing ranks, if not running
neck-and-neck, and that around 30 percent of voters have yet to make
known who they will vote for.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is currently actively promoting Buddhist teachings and
educational activities through a foundation, is well respected among
local people despite his defeat in Taiwan's first popular
presidential election in 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO ALLOW DEMOCRACY TO FLOURISH IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration may amend
particular provisions of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, but the
debate over legislative details should not overshadow a task that all
Americans should view with enthusiasm, namely welcoming the
establishment of real democracy in Taiwan and doing what must be done
to allow it to flourish, according to a US specialist on cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Greg Mastel, director of the Global Economic Policy Project at
the New American Foundation, wrote in a recently published analysis
that there is no prouder legacy for US foreign policy in the
post-Cold War world than the establishment of true democracies in
countries that the United States supported or worked to help
liberate.</P>
      <P>Because of the powerful image of the Berlin Wall being torn down,
most Americans are aware of the general success of these efforts in
Europe. Fewer, however, are aware of the Asian successes. And in a
lesser-known example, Taiwan has established a true democracy after
being ruled by an authoritarian regime that kept tight control over
the political system, noted Mastel, who has written extensively about
China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the large deployment of US troops in South
Korea provides unequivocal evidence of a continuing American
commitment to a free South Korea. The question must be asked as to
whether the United States has a similar level of commitment to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to characterize Communist China as a merciless
empire set on world domination, said the author. Nonetheless, the
current PRC regime has a questionable record of respect for human
rights and toleration of religious freedom.</P>
      <P>China's military ambitions are probably more along the lines of
establishing itself as a dominant regional power rather than of
seeking world domination, said Mastel. Without the possibility of
outside intervention, however, Beijing would likely use its military
power to blockade, invade or threaten Taiwan until it submitted to
the PRC.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Mastel wrote, the Clinton administration seems to
disagree with this view. It has continued a tilt toward the PRC over
Taiwan that began during the Nixon administration. Most troubling,
the Clinton administration has vigorously opposed the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act, which approves new arms sales to and establishes new
military ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the Clinton administration and its defenders justifiably note,
no one wants to see a war break out in the Taiwan Straits. It is just
as important to note, however, that "no one should be willing to
allow a democracy of 22 million people to be smothered in its
cradle," said Mastel.</P>
      <P>It would be unwise to sell Taiwan weapons that would spark an
arms race, but an arms race, in fact, is already underway in the
Taiwan Straits, one led by Communist China. If current trends
continue, a number of military analysts believe that mainland China
could gain a decisive advantage in 10 to 20 years.</P>
      <P>Far from being provocative, Mastel stressed, selling new
submarines, missiles and early warning equipment that Taiwan needs to
defend itself is important to maintain the balance that has kept
relative peace in the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>"The truly provocative step would be to allow the current
situation to continue and allow Beijing's leaders to imagine that a
military solution of their `Taiwan problem' was feasible -- the
outcome that risks making war thinkable," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Mastel pointed out that "in reality, it is ambiguity, not
clarity, that risks conflict. The so-called policy of ambiguity seems
much more likely to create a misunderstanding that could lead to
conflict than a clear statement of support understood by both Taiwan
and China."</P>
      <P>The United States cannot afford to ignore the changes taking
place in Taiwan any more than it could afford to ignore Beijing 30
years ago. The realities that underpinned the current "one China"
policy have all changed. The policy must evolve to reflect those
changes, he said.</P>
      <P>Rather than scurrying to the side of one of the world's most
oppressive governments, the Clinton administration should be battling
to help forge a role for democrats in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This does not mean provoking needless conflict with Communist
China. But it does mean helping Taiwan to establish its place in the
international arena through steps, such as membership in the World
Trade Organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA DEPORTS 1,447 CHINESE ILLEGALS OVER LAST FOUR YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has successfully deported 1,447
Chinese people who illegaly entered the country back to mainland
China over the past four years, thanks to joint cooperation between
Canberra and Beijing, according to the Department of Immigration on
Monday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA on Monday afternoon, Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock said "the government has achieved outstanding
results in returning boat people who have arrived illegally from
China."</P>
      <P>He said 40 Chinese boat people were deported to mainland China
last weekend, bringing the total to 1447.</P>
      <P>"In the past four years, 1452 boat people have arrived illegally
from China and 1447 of those have been returned home," Ruddock said,
adding that "these returns underscore the strong relationship and
cooperation that exists between the Australian and Chinese
governments and shows the futility of undertaking such a perilous
journey."</P>
      <P>He said that "illegal boat people who have no reason to stay in
Australia will be returned as quickly as possibly. These returns
should send a clear message that if people believe the lies peddled
by the people smugglers, they will pay the price when they are sent
home to a possible lifetime of debt."</P>
      <P>Ruddock praised the agreement signed jointly by Canberra and
Beijing three years ago under which Australia will be responsible for
the cost of sending Chinese boat people back after they are confirmed
as illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>He said that people smugglers now face up to 20 years in jail and
fines of up to A$220,000 (US$147,000). He said unauthorized arrivals
who are found to be refugees will now only be granted a three-year
temporary protection visa instead of gaining permanent residence.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Australian immigration and Customs officers now
have the power to board and detain boats in international waters
suspected of being involved in people smuggling in their bid to crack
down on human smuggling trade.</P>
      <P>"Australia does not welcome illegal arrivals. Our refugee and
humanitarian programs will not be dictated to by people smugglers,"
Ruddock said.</P>
      <P>Australia is one of the few countries in the world that accept
refugees and its annual quota is 12,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ZEALAND TO ASSERT IDEPENDENCE IN DEFENSE PLANNING: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prime Minister Helen Clark will make her
first official visit to Australia this week and is expected to notify
Prime Minister John Howard that New Zealand will no longer follow an
identical defense planning strategy with Australia, The Australian
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Political experts predicted Clark will assert New Zealand's
independence in strategic planning on the grounds that there is no
reason why it should approach regional security and national defense
in the same way as Australia.</P>
      <P>Clark on Sunday warned Australia against lecturing New Zealand on
its defense policies, saying such an approach "goes down like a lead
balloon" and is "entirely counter-productive."</P>
      <P>The Australian Monday quoted Clark as saying that" "we are
probably, in strategic terms, the most securely located country in
the world, so we do have a different perspective."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD PAY MORE HEED TO MAINLAND MARKET: JAPANESE REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should pay more attention to the
vast mainland Chinese market to sustain its economic development
into the 21st century, according to a study by Japan's Mitsubishi
Research Institute.</P>
      <P>The research report points out that Taiwan is facing a cut-throat
"three-way" competition in the global market. In the high-tech
domain, the report said, Taiwan lags behind the United States, Japan
and European countries. In the medium-level technological field,
Taiwan faces competition from South Korea, and in the low-end market,
Taiwan is losing competitive edge to mainland China and other
developing countries.</P>
      <P>The report forecasts that Taiwan's annual economic growth rate
will range between 5.5 percent and 4.8 percent from 2000 through
2020, compared to mainland China's 7 percent to 6.5 percent, South
Korea's 5.8 percent to 4.5 percent, Hong Kong's 3 percent to 1.1
percent and Singapore's 4.2 percent and 2.6 percent for the same
20-year period.</P>
      <P>The report says although the Taiwan economy is expected to
maintain moderate growth in the coming two decades, it must adjust
its development strategy in the face of general industrial structural
changes.</P>
      <P>The report further indicates that Taiwan's future economic growth
will rely on three prerequisites -- continued expansion of exports,
continued upgrading of productivity and continued increase in
investment.</P>
      <P>With regard to export expansion, the report says Taiwan should
attach greater importance to the vast mainland Chinese market.
Taiwan should diversify its export outlets, with the entire world as
its target, the report urges, adding that Taiwan should not just
focus on exploring the US, European and Japanese markets and should
instead pay more heed to mainland China's market demand.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and mainland China share common language
and cultural background, the report says Taiwan companies will enjoy
easier access to the mainland market than their foreign counterparts
so long as their products can meet the demand of mainland consumers.</P>
      <P>In view of Taiwan's limited natural and manpower resources, the
report says Taiwan should develop highly competitive export items
to enhance its operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Touching on the direction of future industrial development, the
report says although electronics and information-technology (IT) will
remain "star" industries in the coming years, the emphasis will be
given to software programs instead of hardware.</P>
      <P>In the new century, the report says IT hardware will become
common products and can no longer generate high additional value,
adding that only software programs with magic functions can
create a remarkable value-added effect.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan will no longer be able to
upgrade its productivity by using low-end production technology.
"Taiwan should develop high-end products to upgrade its
productivity in the years ahead," concludes the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN APPRECIATES CHEN LI-AN'S OPEN SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's presidential
candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, on Monday expressed appreciation
to former Control Yuan President Chen Li-an for his open support
earlier in the day, just 19 days before the March 18 election.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Lien as the most capable among the five candidates to
lead the country in negotiations with mainland China, which he said
is the urgent and inevitable task of the nation.</P>
      <P>Lien pledged that he would lead the nation to safety and
affluence if elected, and that he would live up to the aspirations
that Chen and the people have for him.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-li, an official of Lien's campaign headquarters, said
that Chen's support clearly shows that Lien is the most capable of
handling cross-strait relations, due to his personal attributes and
ample experience.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that Chen's support will have a "positive" effect on
Lien's chances in the fierce presidential race.</P>
      <P>However, the two other leading presidential contenders have
criticized Chen, who failed in his own presidential bid during the
last election in 1996, when he quit the ruling KMT to run as an
independent.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-ching, director of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's Department of Chinese Affairs, noted that Chen has criticized
President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of cross-Taiwan Strait ties as
"special state-to-state" for creating tension across the strait, yet
supports Lien's stance to return to the 1993 consensus in the first
high-level cross-strait talks of each side having its "own
interpretation of the definition of one China."</P>
      <P>Yen said that Chen's words showed that Lien's mainland policy is
in contrast to Lee's.</P>
      <P>Yen said that though negotiation with Beijing is important, the
principles of considering what is in the best interest overall and of
having both sides stand on equal footing at the negotiating table are
equally important.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan needs a leader who will follow the will of
the people and not someone who will "dance to the tune of Beijing."</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, another DPP spokesman, said that he suspected Chen,
who quit the KMT because he did not agree with the ideas espoused by
the Lee-Lien ticket four years ago, might have become too ignorant of
the political environment after having left politics for so long.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is now actively propagating Buddhist teaching and
promoting cultural and educational activities, enjoys high esteem
despite his loss in the presidential election of 1996.</P>
      <P>Chen has forgotten that President Lee's redefinition of
cross-strait ties has been the source that created tension across the
strait, the DPP official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Yi-chiao, a spokesman for independent
presidential candidate James Soong, said that Chen's words represent
only his own opinion and not the views of the middle-of-the-road
voters, who are the backbone of Soong's supporters.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that Lien will inherit the heavy burden of President
Lee's "state-to-state" redefinition, which Huang said only has the
support of 18 percent of the people, according to some public opinion
polls.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S THREAT WILL REMAIN AFTER TAIWAN'S ELECTION: US SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang and Jane Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No matter who is elected Taiwan's next
president in March, mainland China's military threat against Taiwan
will remain, commented a US China expert.</P>
      <P>William Shawcross, a member of the International Crisis Group,
said in an article in the latest edition of Newsweek magazine that
Beijing's belligerent nature will make it harder for the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait to unite.</P>
      <P>As a sense of the "new Taiwanese" is emerging on the island,
Shawcross said Beijing's "one China" policy seems more inappropriate
at this time.</P>
      <P>In other words, the external threat against Taiwan will increase
while Taiwan's internal democratic system is coming of age, and that
is the reason why the Taiwan Strait is still listed as one of the
most dangerous flash points in Asia, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Hailing Taiwan's democratic and economic achievements over the
past five decades, Shawcross said Taiwan has built a reliable system
for its people to trust, while in contrast, mainland China has failed
to do so.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, different from Hong Kong and Macau, is a sovereign state
with own constitution and military, according to the China expert,
who, citing ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Chen Chien-jen, said Taiwan
is willing to talk about unification with mainland China only when
the Beijing leaders respect rule of law, human rights, democracy and
free economy.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the problem that Taiwan is excluded from the United
Nations and recognized by only 29 nations worldwide, Shawcross said
it is "extremely absurd."</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's struggle for international recognition is not
an encouraging phenomenon, he said, the truth is that many countries,
including mainland China, maintain very close business relations with
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS CEOS MOST CONCERNED ABOUT CANDIDATES' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent opinion survey found that more
than 80 percent of the chief executive officers (CEOs) of major local
enterprises are most concerned about "beef" or policy proposals
offered by presidential candidates.</P>
      <P>Candidates' capabilities and decisiveness come second, and only
14.1 percent of the CEOs interviewed said they most care about the
candidates' party affiliation.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the CommonWealth business monthly
from Feb. 9 through Feb. 16. The magazine sent out questionnaires to
1,520 major local enterprises and received 340 valid replies or
22.37 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Asked about the most disgusting phenomenon seen in the current
presidential campaign, 76 percent said they are most dissatisfied
with candidates' rush to offer far-fetched campaign promises; 70.6
percent said they think that the ongoing election campaign has
wasted too many resources; and 63.7 percent said they are fed up with
the rampant use of mudslinging or negative campaign tactics.</P>
      <P>A quarter of the respondents said they feel that the
ongoing presidential race has become too frenzied, and 14.2 percent
said they face pressure to take side in the current race.</P>
      <P>Asked what scenarios they most don't want to see in Taiwan, 83
percent cited "the breakout of a military confrontation between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait"; 70 percent mentioned "further
worsening of 'black gold' politics; 52 percent singled out "an
economic slowdown; and 45 percent said "escalation of domestic
political struggle."</P>
      <P>As for issues the new president must tackle with urgency,
improving public order topped the list (66.9 percent); followed by
upgrading administrative efficiency (60 percent); improving relations
across the Taiwan Strait (58.7 percent); stepping up infrastructure
construction (47.5 percent); cracking down on official corruption
(46.9 percent).</P>
      <P>The figures indicate that "curbing crime, maintaining
cross-strait peace and ending 'black gold' politics" are mainstream
opinions among local CEOs. "Black gold' politics refers to the
connection between organized crime and government.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that most CEOs think that Taiwan's bid to
join the World Trade Organization is the most urgent
economics-related issue that the new president must address. Other
urgent problems in the field included improving the investment
climate, accelerating infrastructure construction and opening direct
cross-strait "three links".</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOONG URGES VETERANS TO GIVE HIM 'BASES ON BALLS' IN PRES. ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  eastern  Taiwan, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent presidential
candidate James Soong on Monday urged the Republic of China's
veterans to give him "bases on balls" in the upcoming election to let
him have another opportunity to serve the public.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remark when meeting a group of retired ROC
generals at a luncheon.</P>
      <P>Commenting on allegations that the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) would
rather support the opposition Democratic Progressive Party candidate
Chen Shui-bian in the presidential election than let Soong win, Soong
asked how the KMT could spread the message if it maintains its
fundamental party character -- recognizing the existence of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>He was referring to what he sees as Chen's reluctance to
recognize the existence of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Soong claimed that he would resolutely maintain the existence of
the Republic of China and urged the nation's former soldiers to vote
for him on March 18, giving him "bases on balls" to send him to the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Prior to the luncheon, Soong called on Master Cheng Yen of the
Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation to exchange views on the relief work
following last year's Sept. 21 earthquake, which caused severe damage
in the central part of the island.</P>
      <P>Soong extended his respect for the post-quake reconstruction
efforts made by Tzu Chi members and hoped that the association would
continue to provide quake victims with relief services. He also urged
the government to take more responsibility in the second stage of
quake-relief work.</P>
      <P>He and Cheng Yen also said they felt heavyhearted over central
Taiwan residents' suffering caused by the continued rain, which began
on Feb. 20 and still shows no sign of easing.</P>
      <P>Islandwide rain has caused a rash of mudslides in central Taiwan,
the second natural disaster to hit the area in six months.</P>
      <P>Also on Monday morning, Soong went to Hsiulin Township in Hualien
County, home to many of Taiwan's aboriginals, to attend the
inauguration of an organization supporting his campaign.</P>
      <P>Soong, who had toured all of Taiwan's aboriginal townships during
his tenure as the island's first directly elected governor, promised
to further improve aboriginals' quality of life if he is elected
president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL OIL PRICES NOT EXPECTED TO SURGE IN MARCH: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Soaring international petroleum prices are
not expected to continue their surge in March, according to an
analysis by the Energy Commission under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA), which was announced by commission officials Monday.</P>
      <P>The decision by the United States not to rule out the possibility
of releasing strategic oil reserves in case of emergency, in
conjunction with a plan to increase oil production by non-OPEC
(Organization of Petroleum Export Countries) members starting April
1, were cited by MOEA officials as factors supporting the expected
easing of oil prices.</P>
      <P>The tendency of international oil prices will hinge on whether
the consensus reached by OPEC to cut production is maintained. The
OPEC is scheduled to hold a ministerial-level meeting on March 27 in
Vienna, out of which a resolution should emerge.</P>
      <P>Wang Yun-ming, deputy executive secretary of the Energy
Commission, noted that most experts on international oil prices
believe a "soft-landing" of the surging oil prices can be achieved if
OPEC imposes a gradual reduction in the pace of oil production.</P>
      <P>Even if OPEC should decide to continue cutting production, a
tight sellers' market could be eased as a result of the US release of
strategic oil reserves, if an emergency occurs, together with the
plan -- likely to be enacted under US pressure -- by non-OPEC
countries, such as Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, to increase
their oil production from April 1, Wang remarked.</P>
      <P>As for domestic gasoline prices in Taiwan, Chinese Petroleum
Corp. is not expected to raise prices before the March 18
presidential election, according to Energy Commission officials.</P>
      <P>The soaring international oil prices have been attributed mainly
to increased demand as a result of a severe winter in the
northeastern United States and to the robust resurgence of the global
economy, said the officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISA-ISSUANCE IN MOROCCO NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED TO PROMOTE MUTUAL TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Business leaders in Morocco will be more
willing to travel to Taiwan to purchase products if Taiwan's
diplomatic authority would simplify the visa-issuance procedures in
Morocco, said the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) on
Monday.</P>
      <P>An analysis conducted by CETRA revealed that the trade volume
between Taiwan and Morocco is increasing, while Taiwan-made products
enjoy a good reputation in the north African country, despite all the
difficulties resulting from the lack of formal diplomatic ties
between the two nations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan does not send delegates to the country, which has a
population of 26 million, due to political factors, with only an
office set up by CETRA in the capital Casablanca available to help
visas application.</P>
      <P>According to the analysis, bilateral trade between Taiwan and
Morocco totaled US$72 million in 1999, with an annual growth rate of
13.3 percent; Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of US$12 million last
year.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan-made plastic goods, electronic and
telecommunications products, office equipment, daily necessities and
parts for motorcycle and cars are popular in Morocco, it seems that
Moroccan investors are not encouraged to travel to Taiwan, as their
travel documents can not be issued unless they travel to a third
country, for example in the Middle East, Asia or Europe, CETRA said.</P>
      <P>The same problem happens for Taiwan investors wishing to travel
to Morocco, as the visa application for Taiwanese must be transferred
to Hong Kong first, which delays the procedure by five to six days.</P>
      <P>CETRA said it would urge both governments to simplify the
visa-application procedures to facilitate trade exchanges between the
two countries.

    <HEADLINE>ACER'S STAN SHIH TO LECTURE AT UNIVERSITY ON MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, Feb. 28 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As more and more business
leaders lecture on their successful corporate experiences at
universities, the head of Acer Group, Stan Shih, will join the
bandwagon and begin teaching at National Chiao-Tung University, said
university officials on Monday.</P>
      <P>Starting this week, Shih will lead a lecture course on business
operations and strategies for international corporations at the
science and technology-oriented Chiao-Tung University, Shih's alma
mater, as part of the school's post-graduate EMBA degree program,
which leads to an MBA degree specially designed for high-ranking
corporate executives.</P>
      <P>Shih told the media that he is glad to be able to teach at his
alma mater and hopes to instill in students an understanding of how
Taiwan managed to win itself a place on the international stage by
making use of its tiny amount of resources to compete with
international conglomerates.</P>
      <P>Apart from sharing his observations on Taiwan's endeavors, Shih
also plans to tell students how Acer explored a new niche for itself
by latching onto the development trend of the Internet industry and
tapping the related market.</P>
      <P>To give students a better understanding of Taiwan's development
in the technology industry and strategies for internationalization,
Shih will describe Acer's 23-year development history -- from its
first steps as a small operation; through its endeavors in product
design, creating its own brand, and global marketing; to making
information software and becoming an Internet service provider.</P>
      <P>Shih also wishes to foster leadership for the next generation of
the Internet era by inspiring EMBA students with tales of Taiwan's
unique entrepreneurial spirit and by illustrating blueprints for the
Internet era at the turn of the century.</P>
      <P>Chiao-Tung University said these courses are designed to help the
country foster more professional managers with an international
vision, and university officials hope that valuable experience in
operating international corporations can be passed down through
cooperation between industry and academia.</P>
      <P>The university will further realize its dream by inviting Morris
Chang, the Chairman and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., who has been dubbed the godfather of Taiwan's semiconductor
industry, to lecture in September.</P>
      <P>Chang lectured on operational management for Chiao-Tung
University's EMBA course in 1998, and his September lectures will
focus on industries generated by the Internet era and the ability of
Taiwan's industries to compete globally, courses which are expected
to mingle theory with practice, university officials said.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A memorial service was held at the 228
Memorial Park in downtown Taipei on Monday in remembrance of the
victims of the tragic events sparked by the incident that took place
on Feb. 28, 1947, known today as the 228 Incident.</P>
      <P>The memorial service was jointly presided over by Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou and Huang Ta-chou, chairman of the 228 Incident Memorial
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Braving heavy rain, many of the families of those who died in the
unrest and aftermath of the 228 Incident attended the ceremony. They
placed bouquets of yellow roses in front of the 228 Monument to
express their grief and remembrance of their beloved.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Ma said the Taipei city government has
spared no effort to collect and preserve all 228 Incident-related
archives, documents and articles.</P>
      <P>"I earnestly hope that all the residents of the island will
remember the bitter lessons of the 228 Incident forever, so that
ethnic rifts will never occur again," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China government has made Feb. 28 a
national memorial day in an attempt to heal the wounds and close the
divisions left by the tragic episode, Ma said he hopes the different
ethnic groups can enjoy a permanent harmonious relationship and
jointly create a brighter future for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following the memorial ceremony, Ma cut a ribbon to open a
painting exhibition at the 228 Memorial Museum in the memorial park
complex as part of the remembrance programs.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen Shui-bian, the standard-bearer of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, also visited the memorial
park to pay tribute to the victims of the incident.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former Taipei mayor, said that if he wins the March 18
presidential election, he will push for the establishment of a
national-level 228 memorial museum and a special museum dedicated to
preserving documents and artifacts representing the different ethnic
groups' development, culture and lives in Taiwan in the 20th century.</P>
      <P>Similar memorial services were also held in other major cities
around the island in memory of the 228 Incident victims.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident was triggered when an elderly Taiwanese woman
selling untaxed cigarettes in Taipei was severely beaten by an
inspector of the Wine and Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. Faced by an angry
mob, the inspector shot dead a bystander and fled to a nearby police
station.</P>
      <P>Faced by mass protests and rioting and unable to control the
situation, Taiwan Governor Chen-yi appealed for help to Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek in mainland China, who sent troops to the northern
port city of Keelung, from where they spread out over the island,
killing indiscriminately.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing period known as the "White Terror," thousands of
local people, especially doctors, lawyers and scholars, were murdered
or imprisoned by the Nationalists, and many were not released until
the 1980s. Public discussion of the incident was taboo until early
1990s.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING STILL CANNOT DESTROY SINGLE ROC MISSILE COMPANY: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China still does not have enough
M-9 missiles to destroy even a single missile company of the Republic
of China armed forces, according to an evaluation by the Ministry of
National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>The MND report said mainland China currently has about 200 M-9
missiles with a range of 600 kilometers, and 16 Dongfeng-21 missiles
with a range of 1,800 km.</P>
      <P>As a single ROC Hawk missile company can withstand attack by up
to 275 M-9 missiles, the report said, mainland China does not have
enough to destroy even one.</P>
      <P>The MND prepared the evaluation report at the request of the
defense and intelligence committee of the watchdog Control Yuan with
an aim of giving an understanding of the ROC military's maximum
capacity to withstand a mainland Chinese missile attack, and the
anti-missile effect of the ROC's Patriot missile defense system.</P>
      <P>The report claimed that M-9 missiles are the most reliable and
accurate of the missiles owned by mainland China, and added that
mainland China's other missiles have an error range of about three
kilometers.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the intensity of an M-9 missile is
equivalent to that of 500 kilograms of traditional explosives, and
can cause a 137-square-meter crater.</P>
      <P>The report also said the ROC-owned "Patriot PAC-2 Plus" missiles
are the upgraded version of the Patriot missile system the United
States used in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Quoting an evaluation by
the missile manufacturer -- the US-based Raytheon Co. -- the report
said the Patriot PAC-2 Plus system has a hit rate of more than 80
percent.</P>
      <P>The report further said mainland China also has about 80 Dongfeng
No. 3 missiles with a range of 3,000 km, and 10 each of Dongfeng No.
4 missiles, with a range of 5,500 km to 7,000 km, and Dongfeng No. 5
missiles, with a range of 14,500 km.</P>
      <P>The report said mainland China is not expected to attack Taiwan
with these long-range ballistic missiles, which are far more
expensive than the M-9s.</P>

about to review Taipei's annual request for arms purchases has made
the cross-Taiwan Strait issue even more sensitive than usual.</P>
      <P>In the white paper, Beijing threatens to invade Taiwan if it
"indefinitely" postpones negotiation on unification with China.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said that the United States is planning to provide
Taiwan with more advanced weapons, including four Arleigh Burke-class
guided-missile destroyers equipped with the Aegis weapons system to
enhance its defense capability.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it would not comment on any arms sales yet to
be decided in accordance with the understanding reached between
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>It added, however, that Taiwan would welcome any measures that
help maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>But military officers, who asked not to be named, said that
Beijing's white paper has not only created cross-strait tension, it
has also made Washington worried about the situation.</P>
      <P>They said that they are optimistic that Taiwan will eventually
obtain the Aegis system, since the Beijing move will only prompt the
United States to sell more defensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANILA URGES TAIPEI TO REOPEN AVIATION TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Manila on Monday urged Taipei to return to
the negotiating table to resolve the fresh aviation dispute between
the two sides, and proposed that the talks be reopened in Manila on
March 1-2.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the Taiwan side will accept the proposal by MECO
(the Manila Economic and Cultural Office) for the resumption of air
consultation talks in Manila on March 1-2," said Philippine
presidential spokesman Fernando Barican.</P>
      <P>Air links between Taiwan and the Philippines were suspended by
Manila late last year after Taipei refused to accept its demand to
lower the weekly Taipei-Manila passenger quota for Taiwan airlines
from 9,600 to 3,500.</P>
      <P>After months of talks, both sides on Jan. 28 reached an agreement
to fix the total weekly passenger number carried by the two Taiwan
airlines -- China Airlines and Eva Airways -- from Taipei and
Kaohsiung to Manila, Cebu, Laoag, and Subic Bay in the Philippines at
9,600, allowing flights to resume earlier this month.</P>
      <P>But Philippine aviation authorities on Feb. 18 disrupted the
Kaohsiung-Manila route being served by CAL alone, alleging that the
carrier has exceeded its passenger limit and triggering a new
dispute.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taipei retaliated by reducing the weekly flights by
Philippine Airlines (PAL), Philippines' flag carrier, from seven to
four.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 60-year-old female practitioner of
Falun Gong was beaten to death in a detention center at Weifang city
in eastern Shandong province on Feb. 21, a human rights group said
here Monday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said the practitioner, Chen Zixiu, was
detained on Feb. 17 by police, who suspected that she was planning to
go to Beijing to take part in a public protest against government
persecution of the Falun Gong sect.</P>
      <P>The information center said her family found many bruises on her
corpse. Blood stains were found in her mouth and ears, and her teeth
were broken.</P>
      <P>The police prohibited her family from taking pictures of her
corpse, and put the whole family under round-the-clock surveillance.</P>
      <P>The center also said that her family wanted to sue the police for
her death, but no layer was willing to represent them in court.
Because, without the permission of the authorities concerned layers
in China are not supposed to represent Falun Gong members in law
court.</P>
      <P>At least 11 Falun Gong practitioners have died of police
brutality or hunger strikes since the sect was outlawed as an "evil
cult" in July last year, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait two-way trade totaled a
record high of US$25.758 billion in 1999, an annual increase of 14.5
percent from the previous year, according to statistics released
Monday by the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The figure represents 11.1 percent of the country's overall
foreign trade for that year, said the BOFT.</P>
      <P>Exports from Taiwan to mainland China increased by 15.5 percent
to US$21.236 billion last year, representing 17.5 percent of the
island's overall exports, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's imports from mainland China grew by 10
percent, to total US$4.522 billion in 1999, registering 4.1 percent
of the country's overall imports.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of US$16.714 billion

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S THREATS AGAINST TAIWAN INCREASE INSTABILITY: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the threat of force remains as a
fixture of Beijing's Taiwan policy, it sets the stage for instability
in East Asia, makes any form of reunification even less probable, and
adds fuel to an incipient arms race across the Taiwan Straits and the
region, said a renowned American China expert Monday.</P>
      <P>Prof. David. M. Lampton, director of The Nixon Center, wrote that
the white paper is just another step in what has been a worrisome
tendency over the years. For Mao Zedong, resolution of the Taiwan
problem was thought about in terms of a hundred years. For Deng
Xiaoping, the period was reduced to fifty years. With the present
statement out of Beijing, the time horizon has been shortened
further, albeit indefinitely.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the director of Chinese studies at the Johns
Hopkins University pointed out, public opinion in Taiwan is nowhere
near contemplating any form of reunification.</P>
      <P>This shortened time horizon therefore increases anxieties on
Taiwan, which in turn produces more calls for US weapons sales to
Taiwan, justifies firmer security guarantees from Washington, and
fosters more unpredictable political rhetoric in Beijing, Taipei and
Washington. "Cumulatively, this increases the chances that the
situation will careen out of control," said Lampton.</P>
      <P>Lampton, who opposes the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, also
noted that Beijing's line makes it more likely that Washington will
pursue policies to which the PRC is adamantly opposed, such as
inclusion of Taiwan in defensive missile systems under development by
the US and an increase in the level of America's security commitment
to Taipei.</P>
      <P>"In short, while the white paper has the earmarks of an
ambivalent compromise coming out of Beijing, it will be perceived
abroad as another ratchet up in pressure on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Most fundamentally, he said, this new statement reveals that
Beijing sees the Taiwan problem as a combination of deterring and
compelling. It wants to deter Taiwan from seeking anything that looks
like independence or divided sovereignty and at the same time compel
Taipei to move toward some form of negotiations.</P>
      <P>In the end, however, with Taiwan having a political system that
is responsive to the people, Beijing's ultimate job is to attract the
people of Taiwan to a reunified China. "Deterrence may prevent
independence, but it cannot achieve reunification, and this is where
the white paper is woefully inadequate."</P>
      <P>As for US policy, Lampton concluded, America should reiterate its
commitment to a "peaceful resolution" of cross-strait issues, wait
for the people of Taiwan to elect their new president next month, get
both the PRC and Taiwan into the WTO where they can establish new
channels of communication, and not complicate matters further for the
new administrations that are to come both in Taipei and Washington.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MUST SUPPORT TAIWAN'S DEFENSE: US POLICY ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For the very reasons Communist China
may make war on Taiwan, the United States should continue to provide
the weapons and support that will preserve the island's democracy,
and "preserving its existence is perhaps the most effective way for
the US to encourage mainlanders who desire real democratic reform,"
according to an American senior policy analyst.</P>
      <P>Richard Fisher, a senior fellow at Jamestown Foundation, wrote
Monday in The Washington Times that President Bill Clinton is leaving
a dangerous legacy in the Taiwan Straits, namely political
appeasement that has encouraged Beijing's belligerence, and the
essential disarmament of Taiwan in the face of a growing Communist
Chinese juggernaut, both of which could hasten war.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration could mollify history's potentially
harsh judgment by selling Taiwan the AEGIS naval defense system, the
AMRAAM anti-aircraft missile and starting a crash program to build
lasers capable of dealing with the missile threat to Taiwan, said the
former director of the Center for Asian Studies at the
Washington-based Heritage Foundation.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, Fisher, who has studied the PRC military and its
equipment for many years, pointed out that the next US president will
have to choose between selling Taiwan the arms it needs to deter a
PRC attack and forgetting about civil relations with Beijing for most
of his first term, or forgoing those sales and possibly presiding
over a war that could herald the real US retreat from Asia.</P>
      <P>He said the PRC could learn a great deal from Taiwan's March 18
presidential election, but Beijing has instead issued a threat in its
white paper on its Taiwan policy.</P>
      <P>Beyond this election, what angers Beijing most is Taiwan's very
existence as a democracy and its preservation of economic freedom
amid growing political freedom, "which exposes the Communist Party's
dictatorship as a lie," he added.</P>
      <P>"If the next century is to be marked by a new Cold War with
China, then its defining conflict will be over Taiwan," wrote Fisher.
However, the Clinton administration refuses to give the next American
president the necessary tools to deter conflict in the Taiwan
Straits. The administration reportedly will oppose Taiwan's requests
for the AEGIS naval defense system, the AMRAAM air-to-air missile and
much needed conventional submarines.</P>
      <P>But by 2010, Communist China could have up to 1,000 ballistic and
cruise missiles pointed at Taiwan and US forces in Asia. These
missiles will be capable of pulverizing Taiwan's air and naval
forces, whose reduced numbers will face hundreds of modern Russian
fighters and new Russian submarines, destroyers and supersonic
anti-ship missiles, he wrote.</P>
      <P>And the US system that could best defend Taiwan, the US Navy's
theater-wide missile defense cruisers, lack funding and may not enter
the fleet until 2010. This trend severely reduces US deterrence,
concluded the former aide to Rep. Christopher Cox (R-CA) on Asian
security affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US PAPERS DENOUNCE CHINA'S LATEST THREAT AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several newspapers in the United
States published editorials Monday denouncing Communist China's
latest threat to use force against Taiwan if the latter does not
start negotiating reunification with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Houston Chronicle wrote in an editorial that only in the
complex, triangular world of US-Sino relations could the PRC threaten
to attack Taiwan for delaying indefinitely reunification negotiations
at the same critical moment Beijing is seeking a favorable vote in
the US Congress on normalized trade relations.</P>
      <P>"The PRC may see the issuance of its threat as a necessary move
to influence the outcome of the ROC's presidential election, but it
cannot bode well for the debate in the US Congress on trade
relations. And, more immediately, such intimidation tactics are
likely to energize more voters on Taiwan to go to the polls and to
consider voting against the goals that mainland China seeks in the
long term," said the Texas newspaper.</P>
      <P>The editorial concluded that "altogether it is a serious
misreading on the part of Beijing of the democratic process both in
the United States and on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Augusta Chronicle in Maine said even more bluntly in an
editorial that "the Communist Chinese regime is not only brutal, it's
none too smart, either. Maybe that explains why it is brutal."</P>
      <P>With the March 18th date for Taiwan's second direct presidential
election fast approaching, "Beijing is unleashing a new round of
threats to force the island nation into immediate talks on
reunification. But once again the tactic appears to be backfiring.
The threats have served only to strengthen the candidacy of strong
anti-Communist Chen Shui-bian," opined the newspaper.</P>
      <P>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette criticized Beijing by saying that its
rhetoric is dangerous and its timing is even worse. "The odd thing is
that the three leading presidential candidates in Taiwan have
soft-pedaled the independence issue, and all are in favor of
continuing negotiations with the mainland. So this blunt warning is
not only uncalled for, it also is harmful to China's immediate
interests."</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's "paper missile" threat against
Taiwan "is folly" as it could sour relations with the United States
and radicalize Taiwan's electorate, commented the Toronto Star on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The largest-circulation daily in Canada stressed that it is in
everyone's interest to cool the squabble over the "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>It said that the "one China" policy is a convenient bit of
diplomatic flummery that has prevented the Chinese Communists, who
represent 1.2 billion people, from going to war with Taiwan's 22
million on their fortress island.</P>
      <P>This policy has let the Taiwanese get on with their lives, as
they promise "only to reunify...one day, maybe." But there's little
to gain, and much to lose, by scrapping it prematurely, the daily
said.</P>
      <P>So, the newspaper sees Jiang Zemin's "paper missile" approach
toward Taiwan, coming at a time "when the mainland and the island are
forging closer ties every day," as folly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND CHINA'S AVERAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE IN 90S RANKED 1ST IN WORLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's average economic
growth rate in the first nine years of the 1990s ranked first in the
world, according to statistics released Monday by the World Bank
(WB).</P>
      <P>The WB report said that in the 1990-1998 period, the world's
average economic growth rate was 2.4 percent, much lower than the 3.2
percent rate in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>The low average world economic growth rate in the period was
largely attributed to the financial turmoil that struck Asia in the
second half of 1997.</P>
      <P>The WB figures show that mainland China registered an average
economic growth rate of 11.2 percent in the first nine years of the
1990s, the highest in the world, followed by Vietnam at 8 percent and
Chile at 7.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Singapore ranked fourth in the world at 7.7 percent, followed by
Sudan at 7.4 percent, Ireland and Uganda at 7.2 percent, and Malaysia
at 6.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The WB did not calculate Taiwan's average economic growth rate in
the 1990s because it regards Taiwan as a part of mainland China. But
according to statistics provided by the island's cabinet-level
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, it is
estimated that Taiwan's rate was 6.2 percent in the first nine years
of the decade, thus giving Taiwan a ranking of ninth in the world.</P>
      <P>The South Korean economy's average growth rate in the 1990s was
5.8 percent, for a 10th place ranking if Taiwan's figure is included.</P>
      <P>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has not listed the four
Asian dragons, namely Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong,
as developing nations since 1997. Instead, it reclassified them as
"advanced economies," an exclusive club that also includes the seven
major industrialized nations (G7).</P>
      <P>Compared with other advanced economies, Taiwan's average economic
growth rate in the first nine years of the 1990s ranked third
overall, behind only Singapore and Ireland.</P>
      <P>The WB report indicated that the average economic growth rate of
the G7 countries in the first nine years of the 1990s was only 2.2
percent. The United States' average economic growth rate was 3.1
percent, while Japan, affected by the most severe economic recession
since the end of the Second World War, only recorded a 1.2 percent
average growth rate during the period.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's average inflation rate in the first nine
years of the 1990s was 3.2 percent. Among the high performing
economies during the 1990s (with economic growth rate exceeding 5
percent), Singapore registered the lowest average inflation rate at
only 2.2 percent, according to the WB report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TERRY CHANG BUILDS HIS INTERNET CAREER WITH BOOKS.COM.TW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 29 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When Terry Chang started his internet book
store -- books.com.tw -- four years ago, internet fever had not yet
reached Taiwan. As a pioneer in the world of internet business, Chang
told a CNA reporter about his experiences in the much-talked about
field of e-commerce and about the prospects for internet business.</P>
      <P>Following is the interview by CNA reporter Jennifer Chung:</P>
      <P>Q: What was the motivation for someone like yourself with a
technical background to start an internet bookstore?</P>
      <P>A: I am a zealous book reader and a strong advocate of
environmental protection. The flood of DMs (direct-mails) from
publishing houses, which proved to be not very effective, made me
begin thinking that there must be a solution and that the internet as
an interactive media might be the answer.</P>
      <P>An internet bookstore can be a good channel for reaching
prospective readers and can replace the use of postal delivery for
promotional efforts. I reckoned there would be a need and I should
take the initiative. After four years of efforts, books.com.tw now
has been able to achieve a double-digit growth rate and has proven
that e-commerce is the trend.</P>
      <P>Q: Could you discuss your four years in this business -- the best
and the hardest parts?</P>
      <P>A: How to recruit and deploy human resources has been the hardest
part. When I started the business years ago, the internet was not yet
a hot topic. With limited capital, good personnel was hard to find. I
was able to recruit the first staff member nearly two months after
the company was set up. During the past four years, our staff
members, though limited in number, have established contacts with the
most important publishing houses in Taiwan step by step.</P>
      <P>Q: What was the turning point for your company in attaining a
high growth rate?</P>
      <P>A: Internet business is becoming more and more mature and many
investment companies have contacted us because we entered the
business early and established our brand name. With new capital, we
can realize our long-term plans and expand our business horizon.</P>
      <P>The internet fever in Taiwan also helps in terms of personnel
recruitment. The company expects to boost the number of its staff
members from 60 to 100.</P>
      <P>Q: Will the internet turn out to be a burble business as many
have described?</P>
      <P>A: With the rapid expansion in the number of internet users, the
internet proves to be a business with prospects. American on Line
(AOL), despite its deficit, was able to merge with the big name
Time-Warner. This merger shows that the combination of the internet's
virtual world and the channels of the real world is the new trend. Of
course, the stock price of internet businesses will be tested in the
market, and only those companies with substance will be able to meet
the challenges.</P>
      <P>Q: How can an internet company attract and keep its customers?</P>
      <P>A: I believe that an internet company with an interface owns an
effective channel. Nevertheless, the business model remains the
determining factor. Kimo's home page, for instance, is much visited,
and Yahoo has an enormous number of visitors from around the globe.
The home pages of Microsoft and NBC have recorded no fewer visitors
than Yahoo. In internet business, it is most important to be user
friendly.</P>
      <P>Some web stations pride themselves on having a large number of
hits. On the other hand, they can not prove the loyalty of these
visitors. Sharing and open-mindedness are the essence of internet
business. Certain ethics should be abided by in internet business.
For one thing, it is not right to jam the web with garbage messages.</P>
      <P>Q: How prospective is the internet business as you see it?</P>
      <P>A: As far as books.com.tw is concerned, in addition to selling
books via the internet, our data bank is a prospective sector of our
business. As an interactive medium, we are able to establish an
interactive relationship with readers by categorizing books and
helping readers make selections.</P>
      <P>An internet company can interact with its customers through
email. Our company receives dozens of emails from our customers every
day, and these are invaluable in helping us improve our services.</P>
      <P>Q: How do you evaluate the stock price and value of an internet
company?</P>
      <P>A: Taking Amazon as an example, the company is still losing money
though its stock price is extremely high. I believe that Amazon will
prove to be a profitable business, judging from its influence upon
society and the industry. With its strengthening logistics, the
company can improve its efficiency and investment returns.</P>
      <P>As for books.com.tw, we are trying to develop a life-time
relationship with our customers. Internet fever has stimulated a cash
inflow.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent opinion poll found that opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Chen
Shui-bian enjoys the highest popularity among local labor union
leaders.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Labor Front sent 523 copies of questionnaires to
managing directors or chairmen of labor unions in major cities and
counties around the island on Jan. 15 with an aim of exploring their
voting preferences concerning the March 18 presidential election and
their views on domestic labor policy. A total of 207 valid replies
were collected.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that 42.6 percent of the respondents would
vote for DPP's Chen if the presidential poll were to take place the
following day.</P>
      <P>Chen's support rating was higher than independent hopeful James
Soong's 28.7 percent and ruling Kuomintang nominee Lien Chan's 14.4
percent. Another independent candidate Hsu Hsin-liang received the
support of 5.9 percent of labor union leaders, while none of the
respondents threw their support behind New Party candidate
Li Ao.</P>
      <P>A cross analysis of the poll results shows that Chen enjoys the
highest support rating among labor union leaders in southern Taiwan,
while Soong leads the pack in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that leading figures of labor unions of
state-owned enterprises are generally more supportive of Soong, while
Chen is the most popular among labor activists in private
enterprises.</P>
      <P>Although KMT's Lien lags behind Chen and Soong in terms of
personal popularity, 38 percent of labor union leaders still put
their bet on Lien's win in the upcoming presidential election. In
comparison, 34.2 percent said they think that Chen would succeed and
23 percent bet on Soong's victory.</P>
      <P>Asked which candidate they think can best express blue-collar
workers' needs and desires, 39.8 percent cites Chen; 18.8 percent
choose Soong; and 6.3 percent refer to Lien.</P>
      <P>As for which party they think can best represent blue-collar
workers, 42.1 percent refer to the DPP; 7.1 percent cite the KMT;
3.6 percent choose the New Party; and only 0.5 percent give credit
to the Taiwan Independence Party.</P>
      <P>A noteworthy finding was that 40.3 percent of the respondents
said they don't think any of the local political parties is
concerned about labor policy, higher than 38.2 percent who said they
think that the DPP is most concerned about labor policy among all
major domestic political parties. Only 7.9 percent chose the KMT and
4.2 percent cited the New Party with regard to this question.</P>
      <P>Liu Poh, chairman of the Taiwan Labor Front, said the finding
indicates that local political parties have not shown enough concern
about labor problems and have done little to help improve
welfare services for blue-collar workers over past years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FUND COMMISSION TO BE SET UP BEFORE ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A commission to oversee the management and
operation of the National Stabilization Fund (NSF) will be set up
before the March 18 presidential election, Vice Finance Minister Yen
Ching-chang said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As the Legislative Yuan has already approved the regulations for
the establishment of the fund under the Executive Yuan, Yen, who
doubles as NSF executive secretary, said a management commission for
the fund should be able to begin operations before the coming
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks when reporting to Acting Premier and NSF
Chairman Liu Chao-shiuan on issues related to the NT$500 billion
fund, set up to help stabilize the local stock market in the run-up
to the election.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the establishment of a management commission for
the fund does not mean that the presidential election will have a
negative impact on the local stock market, Yen said the formation of
such a body is aimed at preventing interference from "other external
elements."</P>
      <P>However, Yen declined to say whether these "external elements"
are mainland China's political moves, saying only that everyone is
aware of where these "barriers" to Taiwan's economic development come
from.</P>
      <P>Beijing issued a white paper on the Taiwan issue early last week
in a bid to influence the island's presidential election, prompting
the local bourse to suffer a string of falls and drop by more than
500 points over the past few days.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, it was normal for the local capital market to
drop in the wake of Beijing's white paper, but its societal impact
will be limited in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESSMAN BLASTS BEIJING'S 'WHITE PAPER' ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Feb.  29  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A congressman from California on
Monday joined his fellow members of the US House of Representatives
in blasting mainland China's "white paper" on the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Tom Campbell (R-Cal.), who is now running for US Senate, said
that China will have to pay a price for its irresponsible behavior,
and that it should not be allowed to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), at least not this year.</P>
      <P>In the Feb. 21 white paper, China warned Taiwan not to
indefinitely delay negotiations on unification, or else face attack.
Beijing's announcement broadened the terms under which it would
invade Taiwan by force. Previously, it had said that it would only
attack Taiwan if it declares independence or is occupied by foreign
forces.</P>
      <P>Campbell expressed his stance at a press conference held in front
of the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>He said that he has always held that the improvement of trade
relations between the United States and China will be beneficial to
the United States and to democratic development in China.</P>
      <P>But he will refuse to support giving China permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR) status due to its recent move.</P>
      <P>Campbell, who has long been supportive of Taiwan, noted that
Beijing has threatened to use force against Taiwan, but that it is
hard to imagine that war could flare up between WTO members. Unless
Beijing changes its attitude, it is obviously not qualified to become
a WTO member.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing should pay a price for its irresponsible
behavior, and that denial of access to the WTO is the consequence it
will most likely shoulder.</P>
      <P>The congressman also said that he did not expect President Bill
Clinton to take any action in this regard, and that it will be up to
Congress to exclude Beijing from the WTO.</P>
      <P>He also said that if Beijing attacks Taiwan, the United States
should be on the side of Taiwan and should express a "clear and
unequivocal" stance, so as to reduce the risk of a Chinese invasion
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A score of leaders of Taiwanese groups joined reporters from
major media outlets in attending the press conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHARE PRICES STICK AROUND 9,400 POINTS AFTER STRUGGLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  29  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei stock market edged up a mere
3.45 points Tuesday amid uncertainty ahead of the presidential
elections, after four government-linked funds made large purchases in
blue chips in a bid to halt the bourse's week-long downward trend.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index climbed
3.45 points to finish at 9,435.94. The turnover shrank to a total of
NT$114.82 billion (US$3.7 billion), compared to previous session's
NT$149.64 billion (US$4.86 billion), with 2.58 billion shares
changing hands.</P>
      <P>The index opened higher but soon lost its momentum as strong
profit-taking pressure and reserved sentiment, which discouraged
buying, eroded early gains, sending the index to close with only an
insignificant gain.</P>
      <P>According to dealers, the index should not expect to enjoy any
obvious rise before the presidential election, after it nose-dived
from nearly 10,100 points to 9,400 points, no matter how the
government seeks to interfere.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the four government-linked funds, electronics shares of
large-scale firms and financial issues stopped falling, while
plastics and paper-making issues also registered solid gains due to
price increases in raw materials.</P>
      <P>Paper-making issues enjoyed a rise of 5.9 percent, the largest
one, while foodstuff issues and construction stocks both suffered
3.3-percent dips.</P>
      <P>Decliners led advancers 356 to 175, with 58 issues remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) reported better performance than the stock market, all
ending with gains, with the exception of September and December
futures, which reported no transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for March rose 28 points to finish at 9,630,
with 1,910 contract transactions. Those for April climbed 39 points
to close at 9,700, with 79 contract transactions, while those for
June advanced 50 points to finish at 9,850, with 17 contract
transactions.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Tuesday were 9,602 points
for March, 9,661 points for April, 9,800 points for June, 9,802
points for September and 9,913 points for December.</P>
      <P>Electronics (TE) futures and financial (TF) futures, which are
sub-index futures based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics
shares and financial shares, both reported gains.</P>
      <P>March TE futures rose 2.95 points to close at 491.95, with 371
contract transactions; April TE futures moved up 2.9 points to close
at 496.5, with five contract transactions; and June TE futures moved
up 4.6 points to close at 498.1, with one contract transaction.</P>
      <P>No transactions were recorded for TE futures for September or
December.</P>
      <P>March TF futures rose 6.6 points to close at 1,115.8, with 389
contract transactions. No transactions were reported for the other

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S LEADING &amp; COINCIDENT INDICES HIT RECORD HIGHS IN JAN.: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both the forward-looking leading index and
the coincident index for Taiwan's economy hit record highs in
January, according to government statistics released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The figures issued by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan showed that
the leading indicator for January surged to 108.8 points, the highest
since April 1989, while the coincident indicator soared to 105.5
points, breaking its record high.</P>
      <P>According to a government-designed monitoring system for the
island's economy, the leading index gauges economic performance three
to six months ahead, while the coincident index measures economic
strength during the month.</P>
      <P>It seems that the island's economic performance has been slightly
overheated and should have the government's attention, said CEPD Vice
Chairman Schive Chi.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, statistics released by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) on Tuesday also show robust prospects for the
manufacturing, industrial and service sectors in the second quarter
of 2000.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of MOEA's Statistics
Department, noted that due to the fact that global economic prospects
have maintained a stable resurgence, the total value of Taiwan's
export orders and the annual growth of the industrial index in 1999
registered the highest levels recorded in the past four years and 12
years, respectively.</P>
      <P>A quicker pace of economic resurgence has been occurring since
the beginning of this year in both the domestic and foreign markets,
and the island is expected to show a better performance in exports
volume in 2000, Chang added.</P>
      <P>Against the backdrop of expanded government expenditures on
reconstruction after the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake last year,
the huge investment in the sixth naphtha cracker plant, and the
construction of the island's high-speed railway, Taiwan's economic
prospects for 2000 are expected to enter a prosperous period, Chang
concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPLAINT AGAINST US DRAM MAKERS THROWN OUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China International Trade
Commission (ITC) issued a final ruling on Tuesday rejecting a dumping
charge by local businesses against US Dynamic Random Access Memory
(DRAM) chip makers.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu said the ITC made the
decision on the basis that US-made DRAM chips have not substantially
damaged the local industry, judging from their market share and
prices in the local market.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, products manufactured by the US companies in
question were sold at higher prices than locally produced goods, an
indication that US DRAM makers have not attempted to dump their
products in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the impact of US imports is limited in Taiwan, as market
share of US DRAM chips has declined to less than 7 percent in the
domestic market since 1997, far lower than the 22 percent market
share enjoyed by South Korean DRAM chips here.</P>
      <P>The vice economics minister added that the case will be closed
after it is sent back to the Finance Ministry by March 13, and that a
temporary anti-dumping tariff imposed previously on US DRAM chips
will be lifted.</P>
      <P>The anti-dumping complaint by several Taiwan companies came after
a group of US firms filed charges against their Taiwan counterparts
last year for dumping their products in the US market, charges which
were rejected by the US International Trade Commission.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS PROTEST INHUMANE TREATMENT OF STRAY DOGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Animal rights groups staged a demonstration
in front of the Taipei City Hall on Tuesday to protest alleged
inhumane treatment of stray dogs by city authorities.</P>
      <P>The demonstration was jointly organized by the Taipei-based
Animal Protection Association (APA), the German Branch of the
International Alliance for Taiwan Dogs (IATD), the Taiwan Alliance
for Promotion of Stray Animal Welfare and several other local animal
rights groups.</P>
      <P>The groups also launched a campaign in Taipei and in the German
city of Frankfurt, advising consumers not to purchase Taiwan-made
electronic products in protest of what they called the island's
inhumane treatment of stray dogs.</P>
      <P>The groups further said they will write letters to the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization urging it to reject Taiwan's
membership bid for its failure to improve the treatment of stray
animals.</P>
      <P>APA President Shen Jung-chen claimed that although the Republic
of China government has implemented an animal protection law for more
than a year, many local stray dogs still do not receive humane
treatment when captured.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Shen alleged that some stray dogs captured by street
cleaners under the authority of the Taipei city government and
several other city and county governments have been illegally sold to
restaurants as ingredients for dog meat dishes.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Shen claimed that some APA volunteers have encountered
harassment or hindrance while endeavoring to protect stray dogs from
being captured by street cleaners.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, a captured stray dog is killed if it
is not adopted within seven days. It costs the government an
estimated NT$7,000 (about US$230) to handle a captured stray.</P>
      <P>Shen said the current practice is expensive and inhumane. "The
government should consider having strays sterilized and inoculated
against rabies instead of killing them," Shen said, adding that
giving each stray such treatment need cost no more than NT$2,200.</P>
      <P>He said the boycott against Taiwan-made electronics goods will
continue until the government takes effective measures to improve its
treatment of stray dogs.</P>
      <P>"If the government ignores our protest and fails to take
immediate measures, we'll expand our campaign and the scope of our
boycott," Shen warned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang is set to expel
several senior members over their public support for independent
presidential candidates James Soong, said KMT sources on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to stop the exodus of party members to Soong's
camp, the KMT Evaluation and Discipline Committee is set to expel a
dozen senior party members in a meeting on Wednesday, said the
sources. Soong is a former KMT secretary-general who is now running
in the presidential race against KMT candidate Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Those expected to be kicked out or reprimanded include: Chien
Han-shen, chairman of the KMT-run China Broadcast Corporation and a
former KMT deputy secretary-general; retired Gen. Huang Hsin-chiang,
former commander in chief of the Army; Lee Pen-jen, former
director-general of the KMT Department of Social Affairs; Chang
Chun-yi, former chairman of the Cabinet-level Mongolian and Tibetan
Affairs Commission, and Chen Pi, former commissioner of Taiwan
Provincial Police Administration.</P>
      <P>Most of them belong to the party's Huang Fu-hsing branch, which
recommended that party authorities discipline them because of their
public endorsement of Soong's candidacy in the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee has already been put on probation by the party for his
pro-Soong remarks. He and Chien have been closely associated with
Soong ever since they served on the KMT Central Committee. Chien was
summoned to the Central Committee on Monday to explain unequivocally
his stance on the race.</P>
      <P>Huang, who stumped for Soong in Taipei County recently, would be
the highest-ranking military officer to be punished in the KMT purge.</P>
      <P>"No man can serve two masters," said a KMT senior official,
adding that the party would brook no hedging by its high-profile
members in the race, and that the anticipated rash of expulsions, the
second of its kind during the run-up to the March 18 election, would
serve as an indication of the party's determination to flush out
fence-sitters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND TO KEEP CLOSE WATCH ON MAINLAND CHINESE MILITARY MOVEMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
on Tuesday that it has not detected any signs of unusual military
movement along mainland China's southeastern coast opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"All the information we have suggests that there is no sign of
unusual military movement in mainland China," said MND spokesman Kung
Fan-ding at a routine news conference.</P>
      <P>Kung further said there has been neither a signal of alert for
mainland Chinese armed forces nor an upgrading of combat
preparedness.</P>
      <P>His comments were a denial of a Hong Kong newspaper report which
said on Monday that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin had
ordered forces in Nanjing, Jinan and Beijing to go on alert from Feb.
23. The report said the mainland's East China Fleet had also been
ordered to go on alert.</P>
      <P>The report followed visits by Jiang to various military regions
in Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Guangdong provinces from Feb. 17.</P>
      <P>Kung said Jiang's visit to southern mainland China was partly
aimed at showing the Beijing government's determination to crack down
on official corruption, smuggling and other criminal activities in
the region where a string of organized crime and financial scandals
have been reported in recent months.</P>
      <P>Kung went on to say that Jiang's visit to the southern province
of Guangdong does not necessarily carry the implication that mainland
China will escalate its military threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said the Republic of China military will keep
close watch over mainland China's military movements or exercises in
the run-up to Taiwan's March 18 presidential election. "We'll
continue strengthening combat preparedness to ensure national
security and stability," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WIRANTO FINISHED: INDONESIAN DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  29  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia's Gen. Wiranto is finished
politically and is unlikely to ever play a dominant role in politics
in Jakarta, Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said in an
interview with Singapore's The Straits Times.</P>
      <P>He said Wiranto does not have the legitimacy to mount a comeback,
even if the Attorney-General's Office does not press charges against
him over the East Timor debacle.</P>
      <P>"Technically, he can return to the Cabinet if the government
cannot find anything against him," he said. "But ... there is a
less-than-50 percent chance of his returning. In the minds of the
public, he is guilty."</P>
      <P>A government-sanctioned inquiry implicated Wiranto and 32
military and civilian officials for being responsible for the
bloodshed and destruction in East Timor after residents voted in
August to separate from Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Pressure has been building since then to prosecute those
responsible, and Attorney-General Marzuki Darusman has indicated that
he will determine within two or three weeks who should stand trial.</P>
      <P>Juwono said that if the general escapes charges, there will be
some concern that Marzuki's office has given in to "pressure from the
military."</P>
      <P>"So it will be convenient for some people to keep him out for
good. Unfortunately for Wiranto, he has become a victim of
circumstances," Juwono said.</P>
      <P>But some of Wiranto's supporters refuse to accept that the man
who played a critical role in Indonesia's political transformation
after former President Suharto resigned is finished, and argue it is
wrong to suggest that national opinion is against him.</P>
      <P>"The views of the intellectual elite in Jakarta are not
reflective of what the silent majority in the country thinks.
Increasingly, a lot are beginning to see Wiranto as being oppressed
by the president in a plot to consolidate his grip on power," an aide
said.</P>
      <P>Juwono said that aside from international pressure, especially
from the United States, political players in Jakarta see the general
as a liability.</P>
      <P>Major parties in the ruling coalition will also not accept him,
he added.</P>
      <P>Analysts also say that Wiranto can no longer turn to the
Indonesian defense forces -- whose political influence is waning --
for direct political backing, given the emasculation of his power
base in the army by President Abdurrahman Wahid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LI AO INTERVIEWED BY BEIJING YOUTH DAILY ON NOBEL PRIZE NOMINATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition New Party presidential candidate
Li Ao said Tuesday that his latest literary work that will presented
for consideration for the Nobel Prize in literature is not only up to
-- but exceeds -- standards for the prestigious award.</P>
      <P>Li made the remark while granting an exclusive interview to
mainland China's Beijing Youth Daily.</P>
      <P>Li, 65, was nominated for the 2000 Nobel Prize in literature
earlier in the month, based on his role as a devout idealist and a
prolific author.</P>
      <P>His latest work, "The Martyrs' Shrine," a novel, was recently
translated into English by Oxford Publishing Co.'s Hong Kong branch.</P>
      <P>Li reiterated that he had not been consecrated by Taiwan's
literary circle in the past and that his name had never been listed
along with Taiwanese authors in the Who's Who directory published by
the Cabinet-level Council for Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Li, a true maverick who served more than seven years in prison
for political dissent, said his nomination for the Nobel Prize in
literature can be seen as a satire on Taiwan's literary circle and
provide it with the opportunity for introspection.</P>
      <P>He said he will consider whether or not to go abroad to accept
the award if he wins. Li has not left Taiwan since arriving from
mainland China as a teenager.</P>
      <P>As yet, no Chinese has ever won the Nobel Prize in literature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US  CAUTIONS  BEIJING  AGAINST  MORE  SABER-RATTLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States on Monday urged
mainland China to avoid additional steps that could increase tensions
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We continue to urge China to look for ways to reduce tensions,"
said State Department spokesman James Rubin. "And we continue to
strongly urge China not to take any additional steps that could
increase tensions."</P>
      <P>Answering questions at a regular briefing, he said that the
Clinton administration regards Beijing's white paper on the one-China
principle, which contains the threat, as "counterproductive and not
helpful."</P>
      <P>Rubin said that Washington has been in touch with Beijing a
number of times since the document was released on Feb. 21.</P>
      <P>The most recent contact was made by Adm. Dennis Blair,
commander-in-chief of the US Pacific Command, who visited Beijing and
expressed concern over the document on behalf of the United States,
Rubin said.</P>
      <P>His predecessor at the US Pacific Command, Joseph Prueher, now US
ambassador to Beijing, also voiced his concern over the "substance,
tone and timing" of the white paper.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Washington, he said the document "just complicates an
already tense situation and makes it more tense."</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the white paper, he added, the United States will
continue to be committed to a peaceful resolution of the cross-strait
issue. "And it certainly won't change our support for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>On the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, a bill already adopted by
the House of Representatives and likely to be taken up by the Senate
later this year, the ambassador said: "Anything that exacerbates the
tension in the strait diminishes the security of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He added that the US backing for Taiwan through the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA), is "the real guarantor of security for Taiwan,
and does a pretty good job of it."</P>
      <P>The ambassador said he favors "the little bit of ambiguity" in
the TRA. "But I think it is important that the Chinese not
misunderstand what I think is the overwhelming sense of our Congress
about support for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Pro-Taiwan members of Congress drew up the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act in an effort to strengthen the TRA, saying that the
United States needs to reaffirm and clarify its commitment to
Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Among other things, the new measure calls for secure
communication links between the US and Taiwan militaries, and
increased exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Beijing has said the final passage of the bill will trigger
unspecified "serious consequences" for its relations with Washington.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Tuesday received Macedonian Foreign Minister Aleksandar Dimitrov at
the Presidential Office to exchange views on bilateral cooperation
and exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lee first expressed a warm welcome to his Macedonian visitor and
said the ROC is willing to share its successful experience in
economic achievement with Macedonia so as to further help that
country's economy develop.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the Kosovo crisis affected the Republic of
Macedonia and, in order to express the ROC's deep concern over the
problem, it has announced a US$300 million humanitarian assistance
program for Kosovo so as to help Macedonia and Kosovo resolve the
refugee problem.</P>
      <P>"We (the ROC) believed that this kind of humanitarian assistance
also helped Macedonia resolve the refugees issue," Lee said,
stressing that the ROC will continue to offer humanitarian
assistance.</P>
      <P>Dimitrov said that Macedonia is positively implementing its
reconstruction projects and needs to learn much from Taiwan. He hoped
that under the assistance of Taiwan, the "Taiwan Economic Miracle"
can be reproduced in Eastern Europe by Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Dimitrov also hoped that bilateral cooperation and exchanges

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAY BE PLACED ON US 'WATCH LIST' FOR IPR INFRINGEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An intellectual property right (IPR)
protection group in the United States has recommended that Taiwan
continue to be listed on the "watch list" for IPR infringement, the
Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials noted that the International Intellectual Property
Alliance (IIPA) has complained to the US Trade Representative (USTR)
office that copyright piracy has become worse in Taiwan over the
past year, with piracy of computer software, books, audio and video
publications, and video games markedly increased.</P>
      <P>The IIPA has therefore asked the USTR to list Taiwan on the
"watch list" under the Special 301 provisions of the 1989 US Omnibus
Trade Acts.</P>
      <P>Each year, the United States releases a list of countries that
require close monitoring and could be subject to trade sanctions if
they fail to address US concerns.</P>
      <P>The USTR has solicited US businesses to express their views by
Feb. 18 before it unveils the list by the end of April.</P>
      <P>At least one US computer company has asked the USTR to list
Taiwan on the "priority watch list," claiming that Taiwan has not
given adequate protection to semiconductor industry patents and
software copyrights, and that the judicial authorities have been too
lenient with violators.</P>
      <P>While Special 301 addresses concerns regarding intellectual
property protection, BOFT officials said that Taiwan should not be
included on the Super 301 watch list, which targets unfair trade
barriers erected by US trade partners.</P>
      <P>They noted that the ROC and the United States reached agreement
on the terms for Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization in
February 1999. Both nations have also held sub ministerial-level
talks, and annual trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA)
consultations, which have eradicated trade barriers between the two
nations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI POSTPONES NEGOTIATIONS WITH MANILA ON AVIATION PACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila, Feb. 29 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei has informed Manila that it will not
start negotiations with Manila on a formal aviation pact for the time
being, in spite of an earlier interim agreement to do so.</P>
      <P>Taipei's representative to Manila, Chan Hsien-ching, relayed the
message to Manila's Transportation Minister Vicente Rivera on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A 1996 aviation pact between the two countries was up for renewal
in 1999, but a quarrel over the allocation of seats between the two
sides led to Manila unilaterally canceling the pact, leading to a
halt in airlinks.</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed on Jan. 28 to resume air services under a
makeshift arrangement which gave Taiwan carriers 4,800 seats per week
while the two sides work on the renewal.</P>
      <P>But an unexpected scuffle between the two sides about how the
4,800 seats should be applied foiled the resumption of flights
between Manila and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Taipei argued that the 4,800 quota did not cover the
Manila-Kaohsiung route, while Manila insisted that it did, leading to
the latest breakdown in talks.</P>

investment cooperation, especially accelerating the construction of
the Skopje Free Economic Zone in Bunardzik and ROC investment in
concrete projects in Macedonia, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The two countries also agreed to waive visa requirement for
diplomatic and official passports and strengthen cooperation in the
international arena, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The Chen-Dimitrov meeting proceeded in a cordial and friendly
atmosphere. Dimitrov invited Chen to visit Macedonia at a time
convenient to both sides. Chen accepted the invitation and may visit
