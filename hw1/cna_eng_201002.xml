      <P>An Air Force C-130 transport plane returned to Taiwan Sunday after an
unprecedented 40,000-kilometer round-trip flight  to deliver  medical  supplies
and  relief  goods  to earthquake-ravaged Haiti, one of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>All of the plane's 23 crew members, led by Col. Chang Hai-pin who also heads the
Air Force 439 Wing, received a hero's welcome from Minister of National Defense
Kao Hua-chu, other defense officials and members of their families after
returning to the Songshan military air base in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Kao said the military mobilized for the humanitarian aid mission immediately
after Haiti was struck by a deadly magnitude-7 earthquake Jan. 12.</P>
      <P>"The round-trip flight across the Pacific Ocean took 15 days to complete, during
which many of Taiwan's diplomatic allies and countries with no diplomatic ties
with Taiwan extended assistance to our propeller-driven plane," Kao said.</P>
      <P>"We are grateful for their generous help...Without their kind assistance, we
would not have been able to complete this trying mission," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the minister, the plane flew over the U.S. mainland and deep into
the Caribbean region and weathered many obstacles, such as refueling,
maintenance, bad weather and jet lag.</P>
      <P>"The smooth completion of the mission was the fruit of stringent regular
training of our military personnel and the assistance of other countries," Kao
said.</P>
      <P>Out of respect for countries that do not diplomatically recognize Taiwan and for
possible future similar cooperation, Kao said he could not go into detail about
the plane's flight route.</P>
      <P>But he indicated that the experience gained from the mission was precious.</P>
      <P>"In the future, our military and medical staff will cooperate even more actively
in regional and global post-disaster humanitarian relief missions," Kao said.</P>
      <P>He presented medals to all of the crew members in recognition of their efforts
in completing the mission as scheduled.</P>
      <P>The plane had to fly up to 10,500 nautical miles over 40 hours on a one-way
flight, both of which set records for Taiwan's Air Force, said Chang, who
disclosed that most of the route was over water.</P>
      <P>The flight marked the first time that Taiwan's Air Force completed a mission
with U.S. assistance since the United States switched diplomatic recognition
from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Specific voter segments key to special municipality polls: scholar</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The outcomes of the critical year-end special municipality elections will hinge
on three narrow voter segments rather than those generally classified as
independent voters, a scholar contended Sunday.</P>
      <P>Kenneth Lin,  a professor of economics at National Taiwan University, asserted
at a forum that the keys to the elections would be voters in central and
southern Taiwan, those from the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector and
those in low-income families, most of them hard core supporters of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>You Ying-lung, a Soochow University professor and former DPP election
strategist, said the municipality elections will not only be a "prelude" to the
2012 presidential election, it will actually be a crucial battle for both the
DPP and ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>You argued that if the DPP intends to win victories in both the municipality
elections and the 2012 presidential election, it should first have an able
leader seasoned in electioneering, well-reputed, strong  enough to settle
internal  disputes,  and capable  of coordinating the "third force, " referring
to swing voters.</P>
      <P>"Lin I-hsiung is the best choice for this role, " he said.</P>
      <P>Lin, who served as DPP chairman in 1998-2000, was one of the DPP's founders and
actively promoted referendums on the construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power
Plant.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the discussion, Lo Chih-cheng, an associate professor at
Soochow University, said if the DPP prevails in the year-end voting, a "Yeltsin
effect" will take shape as a result, with the DPP becoming strong enough to
directly challenge the KMT administration, which would quickly become a lame
duck.</P>

    <DATELINE>01/31/10  19:50:54
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The best selling movie "Avatar" recently sparked debate in online chat rooms,
with many saying it was the same old story of white people serving as the
world's saviors.</P>
      <P>In the movie, however, the white man who saved the world had already been
assimilated by the aboriginal Navis. To say he is a white man just because of
his lineage would be a form of "lineal determinism" and also fails to really
"see" the truth.</P>
      <P>When James Cameron accepted the Golden Globe best director award, he repeated
one of the movie's lines: "I see you." This is actually the code phrase for the
movie, because spoken in the negative, it would mean that human beings cannot
learn to understand each other, not to mention other species.</P>
      <P>And if that is the case, then individual love, communication and world peace
would simply be impossible and be replaced by the tragedy of racial slaughter
and even the termination of the world.</P>
      <P>In the movie, whites are generally stereotyped as being greedy, foolish and
cruel, similar to the image many people around the world have of the United
States.</P>
      <P>But the hero, who was paralyzed in combat, gained a new life both physically and
psychologically as a result of carrying through the "Avatar" plan, enabling him
not only to save himself but also to prevent white hegemony from racial
extermination on other planets in the pursuit of resources.</P>
      <P>The reason he was able to is the line "I see you" -- whether we really see other
ethnic groups with our hearts and not just our eyes.</P>
      <P>"Avatar" is simply an animated film in which the Navis eventually defeat the
invaders from Earth, but in the real world, ethnic slaughter is taking place in
many corners of the world.</P>
      <P>"I See You" is a virtue that goes beyond all ethnic and national boundaries and
could provide a solution to these earthly problems. There would be
understanding, mercy, hope and peace if every one could see others with their
hearts.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The detention of the teenage son of TV host Chen Kai-lun for alleged involvement
in professional baseball bookmaking and violent debt collection has raised
concern in society.</P>
      <P>It is by no means an isolated case but rather reflects how deeply criminal gangs
have penetrated local schools. The detention of Chen's son, Chen Ruei, indicates
that campus security has deteriorated to an alarming level.</P>
      <P>Aside from Chen Ruei, 11 other members of criminal gangs were also rounded up in
the Taipei juvenile police squad's recent crackdown on baseball gambling and
violent debt collection. Even more pathetic is that seven of the suspects were
underage.</P>
      <P>Preventing criminal rings from eroding campus law and order requires the
concerted effort of students themselves as well as their parents, schools and
law enforcement authorities.</P>
      <P>Parents should pay close attention to their children's daily lives and when they
encounter problems should patiently help them deal with those challenges.</P>
      <P>Schools should cooperate with police in criminal investigations instead of
trying to cover up gang behavior simply to protect their school's reputation.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement authorities should step up efforts to drive criminal gangs off
campuses by launching raids every day and improving crime fighting strategies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Service sector to benefit most from pact with China: economist</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The service sector, particularly the banking industry, would be the biggest
beneficiary of a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China because of its ability to serve as a bridge to China
for foreign companies, an economist said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-fu,  an economics  professor  at National Taiwan University and a
member of the president's economic advisory council, said the memorandums of
understanding (MOUs) on financial regulatory cooperation signed by the two sides
late last year have given Taiwan's banks a ticket to China's fast-growing
market.</P>
      <P>If the proposed ECFA is signed, it would be like upgrading the banking sector's
ticket to a VIP pass, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In assessing the overall impact of the trade pact, Lin noted that the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CIER) has estimated Taiwan would gain a net
263,000 jobs if the ECFA is signed.</P>
      <P>But because the pact will include an early harvest list of items given immediate
tariff concessions and will be implemented gradually, Lin believes it might
initially have less of an adverse impact on vulnerable sectors and mitigate job
losses, pushing net job gains higher.</P>
      <P>The agreement would also help attract an inflow of foreign funds as many foreign
companies see Taiwan as an ideal springboard into China's market, according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>For instance, Japanese, U.S. and European enterprises that have had trouble
doing business in China might seek the cooperation of Taiwanese companies and
take advantage of their understanding and knowledge of China to venture into its
market, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He insisted that the opportunity for Taiwan in acting as a bridge between China
and those countries should not be underestimated.</P>
      <P>Lin predicted Taiwan's economy would turn for the better because of the ECFA and
reach President Ma Ying-jeou's "6-3-3" campaign promise goals -- an annual
economic growth rate of 6 percent, a 3 percent unemployment rate and per capita
GDP of US$30,000 by 2016.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is expected to maintain its growth momentum this year after achieving an
enviable 8.7 percent GDP growth in 2009 despite a global recession.</P>
      <P>However, inflationary pressure has grown ever more evident in China. If China
fails to cope with the situation, it may face a situation in which high growth
is accompanied by high consumer prices.</P>
      <P>As China has emerged as Taiwan's most important trading partner, Taiwan's
government should not ignore this emerging trend and should install a "firewall
against inflation" while striving to expand its share of the vast Chinese
market.</P>
      <P>We hope China will adopt a dual strategy to simultaneously maintain growth
momentum and control consumer prices. If it fails to control inflation, it may
have to endure the worst-case scenario of stagflation.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, the government should work out response strategies on various
fronts, such as interest rates, exchange rates, hot money control and assistance
to China-based Taiwanese companies, to cope with China's changing economic
situation.</P>
      <P>With cross-Taiwan Strait economic and trade relations growing increasingly
closer, formulating such response strategies should become a standard process
for our government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is still negotiating with the United States over the sale of
advanced F-16 C/D fighter planes and diesel-electric submarines to Taiwan,
Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday after the two items were left out of an arms
package intended for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Washington is still evaluating the sale of the two weapons systems coveted by
Taipei, Wu said, a day after the U.S. government did not include them in the
US$6.4 billion arms package it approved for sale to Taiwan on Friday.</P>
      <P>The package consists of two Osprey Class mine hunting vessels, 60 UH-60M Black
Hawk helicopters, 114 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile systems, 12 ATM-84L
and RTM-84L Harpoon Block II Telemetry missiles and a range of
telecommunications equipment.</P>
      <P>On whether the price tag of the U.S. package was higher than expected, Wu said
the government will calculate the price of each item based on the price list
provided by the U.S. and make a purchasing decision only after careful
evaluation.</P>
      <P>"We have to figure out whether there is a price difference, " Wu added.</P>
      <P>Buying  weapons  at a reasonable  price for the country's self-defense is the
government's basic guideline, Wu said, noting that the government will handle
the deal based on this principle.</P>
      <P>The purchase of F-16C/D jets and submarines is still under discussion, and
Washington is evaluating the sale, but negotiations on the submarines will be
difficult because of their very high price, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The premier refused to characterize the announcement of the arms sales as part
of an effort to mend fences following a dispute between the two countries over
Taiwan's restriction of some U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the U.S. have long maintained a strong friendship and share common
values and interests, Wu said, and the beef dispute was simply trade friction
that would not impact arms sales, relations and the friendship between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan's government will work to mend the friction between the
two countries with sincerity and concrete action.</P>
      <P>Ministry of National Defense spokesman Yu Sy-tue said Tuesday that Taiwan will
seek to buy modern weapons, equipment and other supplies for self-defense
through various channels.</P>
      <P>Yu said he believes the U.S. will evaluate the balance of military power between
China and Taiwan, and he hoped that Washington would continue to provide the
island with defensive weapons according to the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>On whether the price tag of the U.S. package is too high, the spokesman said the
ministry has not yet received relevant documents from Washington and once they
are received, the ministry would carefully assess whether the budget request is
fair.</P>
      <P>Yu also said the government will do its utmost to negotiate with the U.S. to
protect the country's interests.</P>

      <P>The navy denied a news report Sunday that a Chinese submarine  was spotted in
Taiwan's territorial  waters recently.</P>
      <P>The United Evening News reported earlier in the day that, Taiwan's anti-
submarine helicopters detected an unidentified object under the surface of the
water 24 miles southeast of Zuoying naval base on Jan. 27.</P>
      <P>The surface vessels, out on a training drill, went immediately on alert after
determining the underwater object was a submarine that failed to respond to
signals beamed at it. The submarine left the area soon after it was spotted, the
report said.</P>
      <P>Hsia Te-yu, political warfare chief of the Navy Command, said, however, that the
navy concluded that the target was in fact not a submarine.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise deep sea bombs would have been dumped and other actions taken to
either force it to the surface or confine it to a fixed area, " he added.</P>
      <P>Hsia said many factors could have influenced naval personnel's ability to
identify the underwater object, including its depth, the contour of the sea bed,
sunken ships lying at the bottom of the ocean, and movements of schools of fish.</P>

      <P>The EasyCard that is now limited to use on Taipei MRT and bus systems will soon
become an electronic purse that can be used for small-value purchases at
selected stores.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission has approved Taipei EasyCard Corp.'s
application to join with President Chain Store Corp. in issuing i-cash
EasyCards, most likely to benefit consumers or make transactions more
convenient.</P>
      <P>However, the government should not ignore the potentially adverse impact that
such a decision might have on the principle of fair competition.</P>
      <P>With the Taipei City government offering special discounts for EasyCard holders
on Taipei MRT and bus fares, EasyCard Corp. will enjoy a special competitive
edge in the electronic purse market.</P>
      <P>Since the competitive edge comes from a special concession granted by the city
government rather than its own management acumen, Taipei EasyCard Corp. will not
compete on a level playing field with other electronic purse issuers.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, it is very important for the government to adopt accompanying
measures to prevent the company from monopolizing the domestic electronic purse
market.</P>
      <P>Such preventive measures should be in place before the i-cash EasyCard is
formally launched in March. After that, the card will gain near monopoly status
to its special concession from the city, and problem will be much harder to
resolve.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent survey shows that President Ma Ying-jeou's approval rating has fallen
to 23 percent, even lower than after Typhoon Morakot last August, while the
level of public dissatisfaction with his performance has risen to more than 66
percent.</P>
      <P>Ma, aware that his leadership is in crisis, has made every effort over the past
weeks to meet with those who have criticized him to seek their opinions, and has
also made time to meet with his core supporters.</P>
      <P>He even took the opportunity during his recent visit to Honduras and the
Dominican Republic to talk about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and the U.S. beef
dispute, in an effort to turn around public opinion.</P>
      <P>But has he diffused the crisis? We have not seen any big difference. The
criticisms against him have not subsided, despite his efforts to listen to the
public's views, because the people have not seen real changes in his leadership
or substantive policies.</P>
      <P>He has won back some of his core supporters, particularly among women, on the
basis of their convictions that he is still a "good man, " and that the problem
lies with the media and its "misleading" reports.</P>
      <P>However, we think that while a good man might be able to serve well as a city
mayor and leader of an opposition party, that does not necessarily mean that he
is fit for the huge responsibility of running a country.</P>
      <P>The focus should be on whether Ma has the vision or direction to lead the
nation, to allow the people to live a better life and lead them to the "promised
land." If he can show that he does, only then will we see a new and improved
president. (Feb. 1, 2010)</P>

    <DATELINE>02/01/10  12:13:17
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The navy denied a news report Sunday that its anti-submarine helicopters, during
a training drill on Jan. 27, had detected a Chinese submarine at an underwater
location 24 miles southeast of Taiwan's Zuoying naval base.</P>
      <P>Hsia Te-yu,  political warfare chief of the Navy Command, explained Jan. 30 that
after close observation and verification based on standard operating procedures,
the navy concluded that the object was in fact not a submarine.</P>
      <P>According to the news report, the vessels involved in the training drill
immediately went on alert after they determined that the object was a submarine
and that it had not responded to the signals it was sent. The submarine left the
area soon after it was spotted, the report said.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times</P>
      <P>The navy said that submarines from non-hostile nations usually notify Taiwan if
they plan to pass through Taiwan's territorial waters, or at least they would
respond to inquiry signals.</P>
      <P>There are two possibilities regarding the Jan. 27 incident -- either the
underwater object was a Chinese submarine, or it was some other unimportant
object from which there could be no response, the navy said.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that what the navy said was true. The worst case scenario would be
that it was a Chinese sub and the Taiwan navy was unable to confirm this or to
interpret the information it had detected.</P>
      <P>United Daily News</P>
      <P>Retired Navy Vice Admiral Lan Ning-li said that it is not worth fussing over
whether or not the object was a submarine because one of the missions of
submarines is to covertly obtain intelligence.</P>
      <P>What would be more worrying is if the sonar operators aboard the Taiwan subs had
incorrectly identified what they had detected, Lan said.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang said that if the unidentified
underwater object was a Chinese sub, its motives would be debatable, but added
that there would be no need for Taiwan to be too jittery.</P>
      <P>If the unidentified object was not a sub, then the navy should clearly report
this, Lin said. "Being secretive about the incident will only make things
worse," he added.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times</P>
      <P>Although President Ma Ying-jeou has promoted reconciliation with China, military
sources said China has not reduced its military deployment against Taiwan or its
war games that assume Taiwan is an enemy.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 guided and cruise missiles are under production on the Chinese
mainland and China surveillance vessels have continued to spy in waters
surrounding Taiwan, the sources added.</P>

      <P>prices may spike as the prices of key components and parts, including IGB DDR3
DRAMs and flat panels, are rising, market sources said.</P>
      <P>With the labor shortage problem in China escalating, makers of keyboards, PCBs
and other parts will face yet another challenge.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, wafer prices have dropped as foundry technology has developed.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News</P>
      <P>Scott Lin, president of Acer Taiwan, noted that the average contract price of
1GB DDR3 DRAMs for February rose US$7 on average from the previous month, and
the price of panels also increased US$6 to US$7, depending on the size.</P>
      <P>The rising prices of key parts and components for personal computers are
expected to trigger computer product price increases in low season and boost
business in the DRAM and TFT-LCD manufacturing sectors, Lin anticipated.</P>
      <P>The shipment of brand-name and ultra-slim notebooks is expected to increase this
year. Structural changes that affect the shipment of products is expected to
lead to a rise in computer prices.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times</P>
      <P>Although silicon wafer shipments remained strong in the first quarter of the
year, the cost of eight-inch wafer foundry services dropped surprisingly.</P>
      <P>Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp. predicted the Q1 price for eight-inch
wafter foundry services will fall 7 percent to 8 percent. Vanguard Chairman
Chang Ching-chu admitted that his company has been facing great pressure from
DRAM factories.</P>
      <P>This pressure has forced Vanguard to reduce its fees, he said.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times</P>
      <P>The worsening labor shortage in China has resulted in higher manufacturing
costs. Macquarie Group analyst Daniel Chang said Jan. 31 that this is structural
problem.</P>
      <P>Chang predicted that when the wages of Chinese workers climb by 10 percent,  the
operational  earnings of downstream  hardware manufacturing plants will drop 3
percent to 8 percent.</P>
      <P>Makers of PCBs and computer cases are expected to see bigger losses than OEM
manufacturers, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang also said structural changes would make it more difficult to resolve the
labor shortage problem in China. These changes include afalling birthrate,
rising income levels which make factory jobs less attractive, and the gradual
movement of PC and cell phone production lines from coastal to inland regions,
he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that despite Taiwan's diplomatic isolation,
it has strived to integrate into the international community though humanitarian
efforts.</P>
      <P>Extreme climate change, increasing global warming and rising incidents of
natural disasters everywhere have caused suffering in many nations and left them
dependent on massive and long-term aid in order to survive, the president noted.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan, as a member of the global village, should not sit idly by in the face
of these global issues," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will stand tall in the international community and gain respect so long
as it sticks to the universal value of rendering humanitarian aid and
assistance, he suggested.</P>
      <P>The president praised the civilian Taiwanese rescue teams and crew members of an
Air Force C-130 transport plane, who traveled across the Pacific Ocean and
transversed difficult inland roads to deliver medical supplies and relief goods
to Haiti after the Caribbean ally was struck by a deadly magnitude-7 earthquake
Jan. 12.</P>
      <P>They have demonstrated Taiwan's soft power through constructive and humanitarian
means, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Quoting Ministry of Foreign Affairs figures, the president said the Taiwan
government and the private sector have so far extended relief and medical aid to
Haiti totalling US$13 million.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been invited by Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez to take
part in an international meeting on April 14 to exchange views on long-term aid
to Haiti, Ma added.</P>

      <P>was established in 1971 and its most impressive effort over the past four
decades has been its promotion of economic globalization.</P>
      <P>Among the wide-ranging issues discussed at the just concluded 40th WEF annual
meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the most hotly debated was the financial crisis
as it related to globalization.</P>
      <P>The financial sector, which has come under harsh criticism recently, said that
there is too much state regulation of financial institutions, which increases
operation costs.</P>
      <P>Governments should not only worry about institutions being "too big to fail" but
also about them being "too many to fail," it argued. With this in mind,
government  regulations  should  focus on transparency and risk management of
financial institutions, instead of on restricting the scale and scope of their
business, the sector said.</P>
      <P>But French President Nicolas Sarkozy launched an attack on the structure of
market capitalism, saying currency exchange rates must be controlled and that
the greed and irresponsibility of the system has not been tackled.</P>
      <P>Globalizaiton has helped bring about more efficient use of resources through
free trade, although many emerging countries have deliberately prevented
currency appreciation and amassed huge trade surpluses. Thus, for many emerging
countries in Asia, globalization has become a synonym for world trade expansion
and an impetus for economic growth.</P>
      <P>Globalizaton has its merits, but to achieve its goals, it must return to basics.</P>
      <P>The main issue is that there should be no manipulation of currency rates.
Financial institutions should return to their service role and direct their
innovative efforts toward service quality and risk management instead of high-
risk and high-yielding products. Only then can the WEF creditably tout its
contribution to globaliation.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy will gradually shrink if Taiwan cannot sign free trade
agreements (FTAs) with other countries, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, it is hoped that China will be pleased to see Taiwan signing FTAs
with its major trade partners, " MAC Deputy Chairman Kao Charng said in a radio
interview.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Kao went on, signing FTAs with major trade partners under the World
Trade Organization (WTO) framework is not a political issue.</P>
      <P>"We hope China can understand that it is very important for Taiwan to further
develop trade and economic ties with other countries," Kao added.</P>
      <P>He further said it is difficult to believe the speculations that China will
intervene in any efforts by Taiwan to sign FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>If China imposes any economic sanctions -- such as stopping imports of raw
materials or semi-finished products from Taiwan -- for political or non-economic
purposes, it would also impact negatively on China's economy, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-China  trade relations can be developed parallel to Taiwan-U.S. trade
relations, he suggested.</P>
      <P>The long-term development of Taiwan-U.S. trade relations will be determined

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan economy has faced three crises in recent years: rising unemployment,
decreasing real income, and an unfair tax system. The problem lies mainly in the
continued outflow of Taiwan industries, funds and human resources to China.</P>
      <P>Since the Ma administration took office in May 2008, unemployment has continued
to rise, topping 6 percent at one time, while real income has decreased, which
has affected the quality of life in the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the unfair taxation has not ended with the expiry of the Statute for
Upgrading Industry at the end of 2009. Individuals and businesses that remain in
Taiwan will continue to suffer because another "unfair" tax system will soon
take the place of the old one.</P>
      <P>The Statute for Upgrading Industry, which was put into effect in 1991, allowed
tax incentives for high-tech industries, which meant that traditional industries
had to continue to shoulder high taxes.</P>
      <P>About the same time, China began luring foreign investment with its tax
incentives and low labor costs, and Taiwan's traditional industries flocked to
China in a bid to survive.</P>
      <P>Even manufacturers flocked to China, although that sector still accounts for 20
percent of employment in Taiwan, compared to 7 percent in the high-tech sector.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the tax revenue losses that resulted from the introduction of
the statute have amounted to hundreds of billions of New Taiwan dollars.</P>
      <P>Now, the Ma administration has unfortunately decided to allow mid-and high-end
technology businesses to invest in China. This means that the jobless situation
will become even worse, income levels will stall or even drop, and the nation's
finances could suffer further because of the unfair tax system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will maintain its restrictions on the importation of 830 agricultural
products from China, the deputy minister of the Council of Agriculture
reiterated Monday.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has never been in favor of lifting the ban on the
agricultural products from China, said Hu Hsin-hua, adding that the president
has given a clear directive for the restrictions to remain in place to protect
the interests of local farmers.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Liberty Times reported Monday that, in last week's first
round of cross-strait talks on a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) , China asked Taiwan to open its market to the banned
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a study conducted by scholars, the paper said that at
least 290,000 farmers in the country will lose their income if the restrictions
are lifted.</P>
      <P>In response to the news report, Hu said the assessment was based on the
assumption that Taiwan would fully opens its market to Chinese agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>However, such an assumption is groundless because it is not in line with the
government's firm stance to maintain the current ban, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Agricultural issues will not be put on the agenda for negotiation between the
two sides until after they have signed the ECFA, he stressed. At that time, it
will be up to the people to decide whether or not to open the market wider to
Chinese agricultural products, he added.</P>

weapons sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>What did he mean? Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan promised in 1982 that the
U.S. would not set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan; would not hold prior

mediator between Taiwan and China, revise the Taiwan Relations Act, alter its

China.</P>
      <P>Washington has honored its promises thus far, but there are signs that some of
these promises are wearing out.</P>
      <P>In particular, its promises not to revise the Taiwan Relations Act or hold prior
consultations with Beijing on arms sales to Taiwan seem to be no longer binding.
If Washington wriggles out of those two promises, the other two would be

    <DATELINE>02/01/10  15:11:21
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan's crude birth rate dropped to 8.29 -- the world's lowest --
and the highest number of births in the country was recorded among women over
the age of 30. In addition, the number of marriages fell last year to a record
low of 110,000.</P>
      <P>These statistics indicate that the government's measures to boost the birth rate
are not working.</P>
      <P>The trend of young people preferring not to get married, let alone have
children, should be examined in a social and economic context.</P>
      <P>Young people are not getting married because they would rather not commit to the
obligations of marriage and family.</P>
      <P>There are also some factors unique to Taiwan that contribute to the country's
declining  birth rate.  These include  the stiff competition for good schools
and jobs, the persistent political strife among different parties which dampens
Taiwan's economic growth, and its lack of national status.</P>
      <P>People who live in anxiety and anguish tend not to have a sense of happiness and
are reluctant to have a family and bring up children under such conditions.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu City boasts the highest birth rate in Taiwan, not because of its
generous subsidy of NT$10,000 per birth to parents, but because of the high
wages earned by workers in the city's science park.</P>
      <P>France, which also once had a low birth rate, now has the highest in Europe
because that country's government helps women, married or single, to take care
of their children between the ages of 3 and 5 and has free public kindergartens.</P>
      <P>More than 20 percent of babies in France are born to women over 35 who lead
relatively stable lives and have steady incomes. This type of financial
stability might also explain why the highest number of births in Taiwan are
among women over 30.</P>
      <P>The government has to find the reasons for the country's low birthrate and
address them seriously, rather than simply handing out subsidies in an attempt
to raise the birth rate. (Feb. 1, 2010)</P>

      <P>Over half of 72 dried food items tested recently were substandard, either
tainted with excess sulfur dioxide or containing excessive amounts of pesticide
residue, the Taipei City Department of Health said Monday.</P>
      <P>Of the 72 dried foods tested by the department, 42 items were chemically tainted
or contained unhealthy substances, representing a substandard rate of 58.3
percent.</P>
      <P>Chrysanthemum, silver fungus and day lily topped the substandard list, with 70
percent of the chrysanthemum and 50 percent of the silver fungus containing
residues of the pesticide Methamidophos and 60 percent of the day lily
containing excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide, said Chiang Yu-mei, a senior
technical specialist with the department.</P>
      <P>Most of the products originated from the eastern county of Hualien, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>She said that if these food ingredients must be used, for example in the
preparation of dishes traditionally prepared for the Chinese New Year holiday,
the products can still be eaten safely with the correct preparation.</P>
      <P>People should avoid buying day lily that is bright and vivid in color, she
suggested, adding that soaking the dried flower buds in warm water for more than
an hour and repeating the process three times can reduce sulfur dioxide residue
by 70 percent, while boiling in a pan with the lid off for three minutes can
reduce the residue by 90 percent.</P>
      <P>If dried chrysanthemums are used to make herbal tea, it is safer for the drinker
if the first two brews of the tea are dumped and only tea from the third brew
onward is consumed, she said.</P>

      <P>Andrew H.J. Wang, Vice President of Academia Sinica, was elected as the next

2010, as president from 2011 to 2013 and as past president in 2014 and 2015,
serving a total of six years.</P>
      <P>After being elected, Wang said there is great opportunity for the federation to
find solutions to major challenges such as global warming and sustainability,
economic problems and the imbalance between rich and poor within societies and
among different countries.</P>
      <P>"Our expertise in biochemistry and molecular biology will no doubt have an
impact on biotech, agriculture, medicine, energy and more, " he said, adding
that the FAOBMB will help train a new generation of young scientists who can

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Navy said Monday that a suspicious object detected in Taiwan's territorial
waters recently was neither a whale nor a Chinese submarine, as reported by
local newspapers.</P>
      <P>Lee Tung-fan, a commander of the Navy's 168th fleet, said one of the fleet's
squadron was engaged in an anti-submarine drill in waters off Zuoying, southern
Taiwan, on Jan. 27 when they detected an object just below the surface of the
water.</P>
      <P>The Navy ruled out the possibility of it being a whale or a dolphin and then
continued to track it, but the object did not increase its depth to avoid
detection, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Instead, it maintained its speed at a steady two nautical miles per hour and was
therefore ruled out as a submarine, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said the object was spotted at the edge of China's territorial waters. This,
coupled with the complexity of the hydrology and contour of the continental
shelf, makes detecting a submarine there more difficult.</P>
      <P>"The 168th fleet has in the past detected suspected Chinese submarines
encroaching  on Taiwan  but later  ruled  out the possibility," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The Navy issued a statement Sunday confirming that it had encountered an unknown
object during a drill, but it denied that it was a submarine based on further
tracking and reconnaissance efforts.</P>
      <P>Despite the navy rejected claims that it had spotted a Chinese submarine,
opposition Democratic Progressive Party spokesman Tsai Chi-chang on Monday
called on the government to rigorously enforce its offshore defense.</P>

      <P>The global financial storm has exposed the importance of international
cooperation on financial supervision, a visiting scholar from the University of
Zurich said Monday in Taipei, suggesting that countries should build a joint
consulting mechanism to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Professor Rolf H. Weber said at a seminar on post-financial storm financial
supervision of banking groups that such a mechanism would prevent similar
financial storms from happening again.</P>
      <P>He underlined the importance of country-to-country cooperation in financial
supervisory matters, saying that countries should share data with each other and
establish a joint consulting mechanism to monitor financial activities.</P>
      <P>He also said the supervisory mechanism should have different monitoring methods
for different financial sectors. For example, the method for monitoring
insurance operations should be different from the one used to monitor banking
operations, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>one of the features of this year's Taipei International Book Exhibition that
opened Jan. 27 and closed Feb. 1 was a display by California-based Chinese
exiled poet and essayist Bei Ling on banned books and underground literature
from China.</P>
      <P>Of the 100-odd items of the Chinese banned and underground publications on
display under the banner of "A Tendency Exhibition, " were the hotly sought
"China's Food Contamination" written by Zhou Qing and published in 2007, and
Feng Congde's "June 4 Diary, " published in May 2009, 20 years after the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>The exhibition was aimed at fulfilling a blank left at TIBE in terms of
dissident, underground and counterculture books on display, Bei Ling told CNA.</P>
      <P>"It also reflects that Taiwan is the only Chinese community in the world that
has freedom of publication and freedom of expression," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Bei Ling, founder and editor of Tendency, a literary journal founded in late
1993 and published in Chinese, noted that many Taiwanese visited his TIBE booth
over the five-day exhibition, most of whom bought works on behalf of friends or
relatives in China.</P>
      <P>He disclosed that a number of figures from China's literati, executives of
cultural companies and book stores came to Taiwan under the guise of tourism to
visit his booth.</P>
      <P>He said it would be prohibitively expensive for him to open a bookstore  in
Taipei  but added that he will begin with the establishment of a "Tendency
House" in Taiwan, offering a place for visiting Chinese exiled or dissident
writers to stay and a place where great minds can interact.</P>
      <P>Bei Ling established his Tendency Studio in Taipei in 2003, marking the first
publishing house run by a Chinese writer-in-exile in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The founder  of the Independent  Chinese  PEN Center,  an organization of
Chinese writers and intellectuals based in Boston, Massachusetts, and dedicated
to the freedom of expression, Bei Ling was arrested in China in August 2000 for
"illegally publishing" his journal there.</P>
      <P>After a brief time in a Beijing jail, he was released and expelled from China
with the help of international society and the U.S. State Department.</P>
      <P>He is on the executive board of the International Center for Writing and
Translation at the University of California, Irvine, and a research associate at
Harvard University's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research.</P>
      <P>His poetry, essays and book reviews have been published in the Los Angeles Times
Book Review, The New York Times, Harvard Review and many other U.S.
publications. His poetry has been translated from Chinese into English,
Japanese, German, French and Spanish.</P>
      <P>He once wrote: "I am one for whom personal freedom is a precondition for
survival."</P>

      <P>Wu Shiow-ming, chairman of the Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission (FTC) ,
pledged Monday to crack down on commodity price manipulation on the retail
market ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the holiday, the commission has stepped up its monitoring
of product prices to prevent fluctuations, Wu said during a ceremony in which he
took over as FTC chairman after acting in the post for six months.</P>
      <P>The monitoring work will be carried out by an FTC task force, and shops found
manipulating product prices in the run-up to the Chinese New Year will be fined
up to NT$25 million (US$781,000), Wu said.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu last month asked government agencies to do their
best to ensure that the prices of basic commodities such as rice, sugar, soy
beans, maize and vegetables remain stable ahead of the holiday that marks the
start of the Year of the Tiger on the lunar calendar, which falls on Feb. 14.</P>

      <P>Registered candidates for the International English Language Testing System
(IELTS) test have extra benefits this year, according to the British Council
Taipei, which said it has developed 30 hours of free extra examination
preparation materials available online for test candidates.</P>
      <P>Alison Markwick, director of the council's English Language Services, said the
self-study preparation materials titled "Road to IELTS Online," written by the
British Council, is now available as a free, added-value IELTS service.</P>
      <P>The course complements other forms of IELTS training and takes the test
candidate through all four parts of the test -- reading, listening, speaking and
writing -- she said.</P>
      <P>The material gives explanations of question types, provides tips on how to
handle the tasks and provides online scoring of exercises so that candidates can
assess their level and progress.</P>
      <P>According to the British Council, the number of IELTS test-takers has increased
dramatically in recent years, a trend that is also reflected in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It said this is due to the wide acceptance of the tests by organizations in
Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, as well as more than 2,500
universities and colleges in the United States.</P>
      <P>Greg Selby, British Council IELTS Development Manager for East Asia, cited
another key reason for increased registration for the test in Taiwan, Japan and
Korea.</P>
      <P>"The test takers are very happy with the more `human' aspects of IELTS. In
particular, candidates from countries such as Korea, Japan and Taiwan tell us
they prefer IELTS' face-to-face interviewing method rather than other tests that
require speaking to a computer, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee announced last week that the fund
had expanded to NT$969.2 billion as of the end of last year, including profits
of NT$111.8 billion, representing an earning rate of 12.68 percent that is far
above its legal target of 1 percent and is enough to compensate for the losses
it suffered during the global financial crisis, with money left over.</P>
      <P>That rate is all the more excellent compared to the 1 percent interest rate for
fixed term deposits.</P>
      <P>The fund has posted earning rates between minus 9.3 percent and 13.4 percent in
the 23 years since it was established.</P>
      <P>Most of the high earning rates reconcile with bullish periods on the stock
market, showing that the profits mainly came from the stock market.</P>
      <P>The fund, which was set up to pay pensions for retired workers, is one of the
cornerstones of the country's social security system and therefore has to be
invested safely while generating reasonable profits.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we have to warn the fund's supervisory committee to manage the money
in a safe way rather than seeking maximum profits.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Foreign Minister James Huang gave testimony in Singapore's High Court
Monday in a suit brought by Taiwan to recover nearly US$30 million allegedly
embezzled by a middleman in an abortive attempt to set up relations with Papua
New Guinea.</P>
      <P>Before entering the courtroom, Huang told reporters that he was there as a
witness for Taiwan's government, and he promised to do his best.</P>
      <P>Huang is one of three witnesses who will be presented by Taiwan's government
during the five-day hearing on the case, which dates back to 2006 when Huang
served as Taiwan's foreign minister in the administration of President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is asking the court to order the
businessman, Ching Chi-ju, to return the US$29.8 million he was wired to help
open diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea at the time.</P>
      <P>Huang said he was asked by Chiou I-jen, then secretary-general of the National
Security Council, to meet with businessmen Ching and Wu Shih-tsai, who claimed
they could help Taiwan establish diplomatic ties with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry later remitted US$29.8 million to Ching's bank account in
Singapore's OCBC Bank in September 2006 for the brokers to complete their
mission.</P>
      <P>The plan went awry, however, and Papua New Guinea did not recognize Taiwan, but
Ching and Wu did not return the funds to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The scandal came to light at the end of President Chen's second term. Taiwan's
authorities arrested Wu, but Ching went into hiding in the United States.</P>
      <P>Ching has denied allegations that he embezzled the funds, claiming that they had
all been disbursed in attempts to improve ties between Taiwan and Papua New
Guinea.</P>
      <P>Last December, Taiwan obtained the court's approval to force OCBC Bank to hand
over Wu's deposits of 2.1 million Singapore dollars (US$1.5 million) and to
freeze Ching's account.</P>
      <P>Instead of attending the hearing in person, Ching was allowed by the court to
defend himself from his U.S. home via teleconference.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Audiences responded enthusiastically to a young Taiwanese choreographer's prize-
winning work titled "1875 Ravel and Bolero" Saturday at Sadler's Wells, the
renowned London dance theater.</P>
      <P>Chou Shu-yi, who beat 170 other individual choreographers and groups from 34
countries to capture the top prize in a heavily contested global choreographic
competition sponsored by Sadler's Wells last November, led 12 dancers from
Taiwan in a presentation of the work for the first time in London.</P>
      <P>All 1,800 tickets available for the first of the two performances at the theater
were sold out shortly after going on sale.</P>
      <P>The dancers' extraordinary performance of Chou's extraordinary work elicited
constant delight and enthusiastic acclaim from the packed  audiences,  among
whom was Chang  Siao-yue,  Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom, who
described the performance as marvelous and fascinating.</P>
      <P>"His work is full of life and ingenuity... He is the pride of Taiwan and I
enjoyed the wonderful performance very much," she added.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Chou said that "1875 Ravel and Bolero" was inspired by
French composer Joseph-Maurice Ravel, whose famous "Bolero" was commissioned in
1928 by Ida Rubinstein for a dance recital.</P>
      <P>Chou said he began to create the work in 2006 and that it had its premiere in
Taiwan in 2007.</P>
      <P>"The work conveys the concept of `treasure and live in the moment,'" Chou
explained.</P>
      <P>"The music of `Bolero' is like part of time and also like the composition of
one's life and living... passing swiftly and full of ups and downs... and comes
to an end all of a sudden without leaving any trace, " Chou said, adding he
hopes audiences will adopt an optimistic attitude toward life after seeing the
work.</P>
      <P>On his winning of the Sadler's Wells award, Chou said the honor came as a
surprise.</P>
      <P>"I was very lucky to win the coveted prize... the opportunity to perform in
London, particularly at Sadler's Wells, was very precious and I hope I will be
able to perform here again in the future, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>Sadler's Wells Artistic Director Alistair Spalding said Chou's work is very
interesting and very special and he attributed Chou's win in part to the
familiarity of the music of "Bolero."</P>
      <P>Spalding further said it was a remarkable achievement for a young choreographer.</P>
      <P>Yeh Jih-wen, the artistic director of Step Out Arts who has been promoting
Taiwanese dance in Britain for many years, praised Chou' s talent and creativity
after seeing the performance.</P>
      <P>Hailing Chou as a sensitive and passionate choreographer, Yeh said  his
emergence  as the  winner  of the  first  Sadler's Wells-sponsored global
choreographic competition has helped upgrade the profile of Taiwanese
choreographers and dancers.</P>
      <P>Sadler's Wells is known as one of the world's most famous "sacred palaces" for
modern dance. Only top-notch dancers and dance troupes are invited to grace its
stage. Taiwan's world-renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre has performed there
several times.</P>
      <P>The competition was open to all types of dance. Contestants were required to
choreograph, perform and film an original piece of work and submit it through
the Sadler's Wells Web site.</P>
      <P>In the first stage of competition, a panel of six dance professionals selected
10 finalists from among the entries. Chou was the only Taiwanese choreographer
to make it into the finals of the online video contest.</P>
      <P>Internet users were then invited to vote for their favorites among the 10
finalists and Chou won from a field of competitors from Britain, the United
States, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Israel.</P>
      <P>In addition to an expenses-paid trip to London to perform the work, Chou and his
dancers also received a cash prize of 2,000 pounds (about US$3,278).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The high-speed rail's monthly magazine has touted Hsinchu City's betel nut babes
as one of the city's must-sees, incurring the wrath of the city's mayor Hsu
Ming-tsai and its residents.</P>
      <P>Hsu instructed the city's information officials to file a formal protest with
the magazine's publisher, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) and demand a
correction.</P>
      <P>The article, published in the January edition of the high-speed railway's on-
train travel magazine "T-Life, " has sparked discontent and resentment  among
city residents,  according  to the city government.</P>
      <P>Local residents have complained that since Hsinchu is not the only city where
scantily clad girls sell betel nuts at street stands, they could not understand
why the high-speed railway focused on it as a tourist attraction in Hsinchu, the
city government said.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu City police chief Lee Chin-tien said city police have already begun
cracking down on the practice of using scantily clad girls to sell the product.</P>
      <P>Twenty  betel  nut stands  in the city are under  police surveillance, half of
which are on Chingkuo Road, where betel nut babes are most commonly found, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>But the magazine cited stands on Chunghua Road, where there are fewer betel nut
stands and most of the women vendors are dressed normally, he said.</P>
      <P>The travel magazine not only angered residents of Hsinchu City but also Hsinchu
County Magistrate Chiu Ching-chun, who criticized the magazine for only
reporting sightseeing attractions in Hsinchu City while ignoring the county.</P>
      <P>"Since the high-speed railway is not willing to do the job, we will do it
ourselves," Chiu said at a county affairs meeting.</P>
      <P>He asked the county's tourism and travel department to produce flyers
introducing sightseeing attractions in the county and to update the county
government's Web site.</P>
      <P>In response to the protests, Chung Tao-ming of THSRC's public affairs department
said the magazine is outsourced.</P>
      <P>Although only one sentence in the article on Hsinchu City mentions the betel nut
babes, the company agreed that the reporting was inappropriate, Chung said. He
pledged to review the situation and make improvements.</P>
      <P>The January 00gazine introduces Hsinchu City, Nantou County's Puli Township and
Kaohsiung County's Meinung Township.</P>
      <P>In its story on Hsinchu, it identified the five must-see spots in the city as
visiting Chung Huang Temple and the Image Museum, walking around the rice noodle
district, enjoying the sexy appeal of betel nut girls and touring Green Grass
Lake.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told former Australian Prime Minister John Howard and
other foreign political party delegates in Taipei Monday that Taiwan has
abandoned what Australians have criticized as "checkbook diplomacy" as Taiwan
has eased its relations with long-time political rival China.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at  an  executive  committee  conference  of the International
Democrat Union (IDU) , Ma noted that many people in Australia expressed concern
over the notorious competition between Taiwan and China to lure each other's
diplomatic allies with money when he visited Australia four years ago.</P>
      <P>"Everywhere I went, the media, the think tanks and the parliament complained
about the practices of Taiwan and China in the Pacific -- what our Australian
friends call `checkbook diplomacy, '" he told the conference that was attended
by Howard in his capacity as IDU chairman.</P>
      <P>Ma, whose administration has adopted a friendlier approach toward China since he
took office in 2008, said he later realized that it was necessary to improve
relations with China and stop the zero-sum game of seeking to lure away the
other side's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"I called for a flexible diplomacy, with a diplomatic truce as one of the major
features. By that, we meant we should engage China in the international arena
without trying to squeeze or to win over its diplomatic allies," he said.</P>
      <P>"China now has 171 diplomatic allies, and we have only 23. There is no reason
for the two sides to continue the zero-sum game, which only brings us bad names
in the international arena," Ma said, adding that his efforts to improve
relations with China have paid off, as Taiwan has maintained good relations with
all of its 23 diplomatic allies since he took office.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on how Taiwan and Australia can cooperate to help countries in
the Pacific region,  Howard said only that assistance from all countries is
welcome, as Taiwan, Australia and China want to help countries in the region in
different ways.</P>
      <P>"We, of course, the major country in the region... welcome assistance from all
countries, " he told CNA on the sidelines of the conference.</P>
      <P>Ma also spoke on a personal note, saying that attending the IDU event was "like
home-coming for me."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that his association with the IDU dates back to 1984 when he
first attended the national convention of the Republican Party in Dallas in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , also said that
when he served as KMT deputy secretary-general in charge of the party's
international affairs, he took part in IDU events, including party leadership
conferences in which he met various world leaders.</P>
      <P>Monday marked the first time the KMT had hosted an IDU event for 12 years.</P>
      <P>The IDU is an association of over 80 conservative, Christian democrat and like-
minded  political parties of the center and center-right.</P>
      <P>The two-day meeting is being attended by 60 political party delegates from 28
nations.</P>

an official of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday.</P>
      <P>C. S. Liu, deputy director of the DPP's Policy Research and Coordinating
Committee, said forming a legislative task force to monitor cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs would be the best mechanism for ensuring government policy transparency.</P>
      <P>In line with the proposed mechanism, the Statute Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area,  which allows cross-strait
pacts to automatically become effective one month after they are signed, should
also be revised, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Although President  Ma Ying-jeou  has promised to give an explanation to the
Legislative Yuan each month on the progress of the ECFA, Liu argued that the
legislature needs "concrete participation" rather than just "briefings" from the
executive branch.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and other relevant
agencies are to report to the legislature Feb. 3 on the ECFA, in a meeting that
will be chaired by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>These kinds of one-sided reports, according to Liu, seem designed to obtain the
legislature's endorsement of the controversial trade pact.</P>
      <P>Quoting DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Liu said the party will step up its
oversight of the ECFA in the next legislative session that will begin Feb. 23.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's professional baseball league announced the all-star team that will take
on the Los Angeles Dodgers in two exhibition games in Taiwan next month, but a
dispute over the venue for one of the games could derail the participation of
leading stars.</P>
      <P>The La New Bears, one of Taiwan's four professional baseball teams, raised
objections Monday over arrangements made to use their home field, Kaohsiung's
Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium, for the second exhibition scheduled for March
14.</P>
      <P>La New Bears official Su Ching-hsuan complained that the club has maintained the
field at its own expense over the past six years but said it was virtually
ignored when discussions were held on renting the stadium for the exhibition
game.</P>
      <P>Bros Sports Marketing, the promoter bringing the Dodgers to Taiwan, irked the
club by getting a commitment from the county government to rent the field for
free.</P>
      <P>The marketing company has also assumed that it would collect the gate receipts,
advertising revenues, and other marketing revenue related to the games in trying
to recoup its investment in promoting the event and even turn a profit.</P>
      <P>Bros Sports Marketing has held talks with the Bears on marketing rights, but no
deal has been reached, and the club said it might have to take action to secure
its financial interests.</P>
      <P>"The county government has already agreed to let Bros Sports Marketing use the
field for free. We respect that, and we'll definitely let them play there," Su
said.</P>
      <P>"But if the two sides can't reach an agreement, La New will handle billboards
and stadium advertising, and the other side won't be able to object."</P>
      <P>Su also suggested that the team might ask for a 10 percent cut of the gate
receipts.</P>
      <P>But Su also said the team might hold back their two star players on the all-star
roster -- outfielder Chen Chin-feng and infielder Lin Chih-sheng -- because of
injuries.</P>
      <P>Some interpreted the statement as an attempt by the team to use the players as
leverage in the marketing discussions. Su later told the Central News Agency
that a decision on their participation would be made after discussions between
them and the team.</P>
      <P>Chen, a mainstay of Taiwan's national team, became the country's first player to
perform in the Major Leagues when he was called up by the Dodgers late in the
2002 season.</P>
      <P>But he never was able to stick with the big league club for any extended period
of time, and appeared in only 19 games in short stints with Dodgers between 2002
and 2005.</P>
      <P>For Chen to get a shot to play against his old team in front of hometown fans
would be one of the highlights of the two-game series.</P>
      <P>The roster announced Monday named Uni-President Lions manager Lu Wen-sheng as
the manager of the all-star team, which will include 10 pitchers, two catchers,
seven infielders and six outfielders.</P>
      <P>This will be the Dodgers' second trip to Taiwan, and the third time since 2008
that a big league team has traveled to Asia.</P>

      <P>Around one million people in Taiwan have had extramarital affairs, according to
the results of a poll released by the Millennium Cultural and Educational
Foundation (MCEF) Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey on the state of Taiwanese families found that 3.3 percent of
respondents confessed to having extramarital affairs and 5.8 percent said their
spouses had had affairs with others -- which translates into 1 million people in
a country with a total population of 23 million.</P>
      <P>MCEF research department chief Hu Cheng-wen said 500,000 families of the country
have been negatively affected as a result of the extramarital affairs, leading
children to develop an incorrect view of marriage.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 34 percent of those polled said they could have
children even without being married, while 16.8 percent saw marriage as a
"fixed-term" contract rather than a "lifelong" one -- a situation Hu interpreted
as the result of rising feminism and changes in the traditional concepts of
having children in families.</P>
      <P>Hu said that as the numbers of both unmarried women with strong education
backgrounds and unmarried men with low education levels are increasing, a
marriage imbalance will continue.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Dec. 24, 2009 and Jan. 8 among adults 20 years
or older, and 1,076 valid responses were collected. The poll has a confidence
rate of 95 percent and margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Monday hoped that Taiwan could further develop
relations with Australia, but he said that would not entail pursuing formal ties
under his policy of a diplomatic truce with China.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with former Australian Prime Minister John Howard at the
Presidential Office, Ma said his government will no longer engage in "checkbook
diplomacy, " under which Taiwan and China tried to lure away each other's
diplomatic allies with financial incentives.</P>
      <P>Instead, Ma said, it has opted for a diplomatic truce with its long-time
political rival.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan hopes to see further enhancement in its relations with Australia in
the economic, cultural, trade and humanitarian aid spheres, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma also lauded the close relationship  between Taiwan and Australia, noting that
Australia is Taiwan's 11th largest trading partner and that the two countries
have more than 30 memorandums of understanding (MOUs) covering various fields.</P>
      <P>Australia is also one of the top five destinations for Taiwanese students to
study overseas, he noted.</P>
      <P>Ma also pointed out that when Howard was prime minister, Taiwan and Australia
signed an agreement on a working holiday program to allow Taiwanese young people
to work while traveling in Australia.</P>
      <P>Nearly 10,000 Taiwanese young people visited Australia under the program in
2009, and Ma described it as the most successful in existence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Audiences responded enthusiastically to a young Taiwanese choreographer's prize-
winning work titled "1875 Ravel and Bolero" Saturday at Sadler's Wells, the
renowned London dance theater.</P>
      <P>Chou Shu-yi, who beat 170 other individual choreographers and groups from 34
countries to capture the top prize in a heavily contested global choreographic
competition sponsored by Sadler's Wells last November, led 12 dancers from
Taiwan in a presentation of the work for the first time in London.</P>
      <P>All 1,800 tickets available for the first of the two performances at the theater
were sold out shortly after going on sale.</P>
      <P>The dancers' extraordinary performance of Chou's extraordinary work elicited
constant delight and enthusiastic acclaim from the packed  audiences,  among
whom was Chang  Siao-yue,  Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom, who
described the performance as marvelous and fascinating.</P>
      <P>"His work is full of life and ingenuity... He is the pride of Taiwan and I
enjoyed the wonderful performance very much," she added.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Chou said that "1875 Ravel and Bolero" was inspired by
French composer Joseph-Maurice Ravel, whose famous "Bolero" was commissioned in
1928 by Ida Rubinstein for a dance recital.</P>
      <P>Chou said he began to create the work in 2006 and that it had its premiere in
Taiwan in 2007.</P>
      <P>"The work conveys the concept of `treasure and live in the moment,'" Chou
explained.</P>
      <P>"The music of `Bolero' is like part of time and also like the composition of
one's life and living... passing swiftly and full of ups and downs... and comes
to an end all of a sudden without leaving any trace, " Chou said, adding he
hopes audiences will adopt an optimistic attitude toward life after seeing the
work.</P>
      <P>On his winning of the Sadler's Wells award, Chou said the honor came as a
surprise.</P>
      <P>"I was very lucky to win the coveted prize... the opportunity to perform in
London, particularly at Sadler's Wells, was very precious and I hope I will be
able to perform here again in the future, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>Sadler's Wells Artistic Director Alistair Spalding said Chou's work is very
interesting and very special and he attributed Chou's win in part to the
familiarity of the music of "Bolero."</P>
      <P>Spalding further said it was a remarkable achievement for a young choreographer.</P>
      <P>Yeh Jih-wen, the artistic director of Step Out Arts who has been promoting
Taiwanese dance in Britain for many years, praised Chou' s talent and creativity
after seeing the performance.</P>
      <P>Hailing Chou as a sensitive and passionate choreographer, Yeh said  his
emergence  as the  winner  of the  first  Sadler's Wells-sponsored global
choreographic competition has helped upgrade the profile of Taiwanese
choreographers and dancers.</P>
      <P>Sadler's Wells is known as one of the world's most famous "sacred palaces" for
modern dance. Only top-notch dancers and dance troupes are invited to grace its
stage. Taiwan's world-renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre has performed there
several times.</P>
      <P>The competition was open to all types of dance. Contestants were required to
choreograph, perform and film an original piece of work and submit it through
the Sadler's Wells Web site.</P>
      <P>In the first stage of competition, a panel of six dance professionals selected
10 finalists from among the entries. Chou was the only Taiwanese choreographer
to make it into the finals of the online video contest.</P>
      <P>Internet users were then invited to vote for their favorites among the 10
finalists and Chou won from a field of competitors from Britain, the United
States, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Israel.</P>
      <P>In addition to an expenses-paid trip to London to perform the work, Chou and his
dancers also received a cash prize of 2,000 pounds (about US$3,278).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The high-speed rail's monthly magazine has touted Hsinchu City's betel nut babes
as one of the city's must-sees, incurring the wrath of the city's mayor Hsu
Ming-tsai and its residents.</P>
      <P>Hsu instructed the city's information officials to file a formal protest with
the magazine's publisher, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) and demand a
correction.</P>
      <P>The article, published in the January edition of the high-speed railway's on-
train travel magazine "T-Life, " has sparked discontent and resentment  among
city residents,  according  to the city government.</P>
      <P>Local residents have complained that since Hsinchu is not the only city where
scantily clad girls sell betel nuts at street stands, they could not understand
why the high-speed railway focused on it as a tourist attraction in Hsinchu, the
city government said.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu City police chief Lee Chin-tien said city police have already begun
cracking down on the practice of using scantily clad girls to sell the product.</P>
      <P>Twenty  betel  nut stands  in the city are under  police surveillance, half of
which are on Chingkuo Road, where betel nut babes are most commonly found, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>But the magazine cited stands on Chunghua Road, where there are fewer betel nut
stands and most of the women vendors are dressed normally, he said.</P>
      <P>The travel magazine not only angered residents of Hsinchu City but also Hsinchu
County Magistrate Chiu Ching-chun, who criticized the magazine for only
reporting sightseeing attractions in Hsinchu City while ignoring the county.</P>
      <P>"Since the high-speed railway is not willing to do the job, we will do it
ourselves," Chiu said at a county affairs meeting.</P>
      <P>He asked the county's tourism and travel department to produce flyers
introducing sightseeing attractions in the county and to update the county
government's Web site.</P>
      <P>In response to the protests, Chung Tao-ming of THSRC's public affairs department
said the magazine is outsourced.</P>
      <P>Although only one sentence in the article on Hsinchu City mentions the betel nut
babes, the company agreed that the reporting was inappropriate, Chung said. He
pledged to review the situation and make improvements.</P>
      <P>The January 00gazine introduces Hsinchu City, Nantou County's Puli Township and
Kaohsiung County's Meinung Township.</P>
      <P>In its story on Hsinchu, it identified the five must-see spots in the city as
visiting Chung Huang Temple and the Image Museum, walking around the rice noodle
district, enjoying the sexy appeal of betel nut girls and touring Green Grass
Lake.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told former Australian Prime Minister John Howard and
other foreign political party delegates in Taipei Monday that Taiwan has
abandoned what Australians have criticized as "checkbook diplomacy" as Taiwan
has eased its relations with long-time political rival China.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at  an  executive  committee  conference  of the International
Democrat Union (IDU) , Ma noted that many people in Australia expressed concern
over the notorious competition between Taiwan and China to lure each other's
diplomatic allies with money when he visited Australia four years ago.</P>
      <P>"Everywhere I went, the media, the think tanks and the parliament complained
about the practices of Taiwan and China in the Pacific -- what our Australian
friends call `checkbook diplomacy, '" he told the conference that was attended
by Howard in his capacity as IDU chairman.</P>
      <P>Ma, whose administration has adopted a friendlier approach toward China since he
took office in 2008, said he later realized that it was necessary to improve
relations with China and stop the zero-sum game of seeking to lure away the
other side's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"I called for a flexible diplomacy, with a diplomatic truce as one of the major
features. By that, we meant we should engage China in the international arena
without trying to squeeze or to win over its diplomatic allies," he said.</P>
      <P>"China now has 171 diplomatic allies, and we have only 23. There is no reason
for the two sides to continue the zero-sum game, which only brings us bad names
in the international arena," Ma said, adding that his efforts to improve
relations with China have paid off, as Taiwan has maintained good relations with
all of its 23 diplomatic allies since he took office.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on how Taiwan and Australia can cooperate to help countries in
the Pacific region,  Howard said only that assistance from all countries is
welcome, as Taiwan, Australia and China want to help countries in the region in
different ways.</P>
      <P>"We, of course, the major country in the region... welcome assistance from all
countries, " he told CNA on the sidelines of the conference.</P>
      <P>Ma also spoke on a personal note, saying that attending the IDU event was "like
home-coming for me."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that his association with the IDU dates back to 1984 when he
first attended the national convention of the Republican Party in Dallas in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , also said that
when he served as KMT deputy secretary-general in charge of the party's
international affairs, he took part in IDU events, including party leadership
conferences in which he met various world leaders.</P>
      <P>Monday marked the first time the KMT had hosted an IDU event for 12 years.</P>
      <P>The IDU is an association of over 80 conservative, Christian democrat and like-
minded  political parties of the center and center-right.</P>
      <P>The two-day meeting is being attended by 60 political party delegates from 28
nations.</P>

on the Los Angeles Dodgers in two exhibition games in Taiwan next month, but a

leading stars.</P>
      <P>The La New Bears, one of Taiwan's four professional baseball teams, raised

receipts.</P>
      <P>But Su also said the team might hold back their two star players on the all-star
roster -- outfielder Chen Chin-feng and infielder Lin Chih-sheng -- because of
injuries.</P>
      <P>Some interpreted the statement as an attempt by the team to use the players as
leverage in the marketing discussions. Su later told the Central News Agency
that a decision on their participation would be made after discussions between
them and the team.</P>
      <P>Chen, a mainstay of Taiwan's national team, became the country's first player to
perform in the Major Leagues when he was called up by the Dodgers late in the
2002 season.</P>
      <P>But he never was able to stick with the big league club for any extended period
of time, and appeared in only 19 games in short stints with Dodgers between 2002
and 2005.</P>
      <P>For Chen to get a shot to play against his old team in front of hometown fans
would be one of the highlights of the two-game series.</P>
      <P>The roster announced Monday named Uni-President Lions manager Lu Wen-sheng as
the manager of the all-star team, which will include 10 pitchers, two catchers,
seven infielders and six outfielders.</P>
      <P>This will be the Dodgers' second trip to Taiwan, and the third time since 2008
that a big league team has traveled to Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1 million in Taiwan have had extramarital affairs: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Around one million people in Taiwan have had extramarital affairs, according to
the results of a poll released by the Millennium Cultural and Educational
Foundation (MCEF) Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey on the state of Taiwanese families found that 3.3 percent of
respondents confessed to having extramarital affairs and 5.8 percent said their
spouses had had affairs with others -- which translates into 1 million people in
a country with a total population of 23 million.</P>
      <P>MCEF research department chief Hu Cheng-wen said 500,000 families of the country
have been negatively affected as a result of the extramarital affairs, leading
children to develop an incorrect view of marriage.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 34 percent of those polled said they could have
children even without being married, while 16.8 percent saw marriage as a
"fixed-term" contract rather than a "lifelong" one -- a situation Hu interpreted
as the result of rising feminism and changes in the traditional concepts of
having children in families.</P>
      <P>Hu said that as the numbers of both unmarried women with strong education
backgrounds and unmarried men with low education levels are increasing, a
marriage imbalance will continue.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Dec. 24, 2009 and Jan. 8 among adults 20 years
or older, and 1,076 valid responses were collected. The poll has a confidence
rate of 95 percent and margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Monday hoped that Taiwan could further develop
relations with Australia, but he said that would not entail pursuing formal ties
under his policy of a diplomatic truce with China.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with former Australian Prime Minister John Howard at the
Presidential Office, Ma said his government will no longer engage in "checkbook
diplomacy, " under which Taiwan and China tried to lure away each other's
diplomatic allies with financial incentives.</P>
      <P>Instead, Ma said, it has opted for a diplomatic truce with its long-time
political rival.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan hopes to see further enhancement in its relations with Australia in
the economic, cultural, trade and humanitarian aid spheres, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma also lauded the close relationship  between Taiwan and Australia, noting that
Australia is Taiwan's 11th largest trading partner and that the two countries
have more than 30 memorandums of understanding (MOUs) covering various fields.</P>
      <P>Australia is also one of the top five destinations for Taiwanese students to
study overseas, he noted.</P>
      <P>Ma also pointed out that when Howard was prime minister, Taiwan and Australia
signed an agreement on a working holiday program to allow Taiwanese young people
to work while traveling in Australia.</P>
      <P>Nearly 10,000 Taiwanese young people visited Australia under the program in
2009, and Ma described it as the most successful in existence.</P>
      <P>Howard is visiting Taipei for a two-day executive committee conference of the
International Democrat Union (IDU), an organization formed by over 80 political
parties, in his capacity as the IDU chairman. The conference ends Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day -- Hiking health premium rate</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Department of Health (DOH)
02/02/10  11:25:08
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister Yaung Chih-liang's recently stated that health insurance premium rates
would have to be adjusted before the Lunar New Year holiday, but the Executive
Yuan slammed the brakes on the plan Monday in a move seen to avoid fueling
public backlash ahead of legislative  by-elections  in four electroal districts.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou was also cited as having instructed government officials
to refrain from revealing details of public policy before it became mature, in
an apparent reference to Yaung's outspokenness.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday after listening to Yaung's briefing on the DOH-
initiated premium adjustment plan that there is no timetable for adjusting
health insurance premium rates.</P>
      <P>He also asked the DOH to design  better  or more viable complementary  measures
to mitigate possible backlashes  before unveiling any adjustment plan.</P>
      <P>For possible future adjustments, the premier outlined several principles,
including that increases in premium rates should be limited to less than half of
the population and premium rates should even be cut for Taiwan's bottom 25
percent income earners. (Feb. 2, 2010)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>During a meeting Monday with Yaung and Cheng Shou-hsia, head of the DOH's Bureau
of National Health Insurance, Premier Wu asked them not to publicly talk about
any premium rate increase plan before a well-rounded plan or policy discourse
had been formulated.</P>
      <P>Wu also directed the DOH to accelerate  preparations  for implementing a new
generation health insurance system, with premiums collected on the basis of
overall household income or overall personal income instead of the current
system based solely on earned income.</P>
      <P>Wu further requested that the health insurance bureau prioritize three tasks in
drafting reform initiatives: fairness in premium collection, review of problems
in the current system, such as possible loopholes in drug pricing formulas, and
increasing health care demand due to an increasing elderly population.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a private health insurance program watchdog body slammed the
President Ma Ying-jeou administration Monday for failing to actively promote
health insurance reform.</P>
      <P>The group critized the Executive Yuan for not including a draft bill on revising
the current health insurance act among the three top priority bills that it
wants the legislature to pass after it returns from its winter recess later this
month. (Feb. 2, 2010)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party said the government should resolve
the issue concerning local governments' huge debts to the health insurance
bureau before considering any premium hike program.</P>
      <P>Only when such a debt issue is resolved can the government reform the health
insurance system on the basis of social justice and fairness, the DPP
headquarters said in a statement.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The eurozone, which was established in 1999, entered its second decade this
year. But it immediately faces financial crises in Greece and Spain, resulting
in a warning that the monetary union could be dragged down by the two countries.</P>
      <P>Such forecasts are not new, although European Central Bank Chairman Jean-Claude
Trichet has dismissed as "absurd" financial market chatter about Greece ever
leaving the eurozone.</P>
      <P>Europeans have spent nearly half a century to integrate both politically and
economically and create a single currency. During the process, the world has
continued to be amazed.</P>
      <P>One of the wonders is that the Maastricht Treaty (the Treaty on European Union)
set a high standard for EU membership. The second is that no member recklessly
quit after entering.</P>
      <P>The eurozone has made it through its first decade and proved that a fixed
exchange rate mechanism is workable under the trend of rapid globalization.</P>
      <P>Fixed exchange rate mechanisms are not perfect, however, and the global
financial crisis has also exposed its vulnerability.</P>
      <P>The eurozone obviously cannot be guided by rules based on the high standards of
the Maastricht Treaty, and the rules must be eased. Second, authorities must
design exit mechanisms to let those who are lagging behind quit the union.</P>
      <P>With the impact of the global financial crisis not yet ended, the eurozone will
face stark challenges ahead. For those who have advocated the establishment of
an Asian dollar, the eurozone's ability to tide over its difficulties will be a
living reference book. (Feb. 2, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: About Education Ministry's swimming pool project</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/02/10  12:11:51
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education announced recently that it would help 300 schools
build swimming pools over the next ten years. At the rate of NT$50 million
(US$1.56 million) per swimming pool, the project will cost the country NT$15
billion, quite a fortune in light of the government's tight budget.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Department of Health is trying to scrape up NT$58.8
billion to close the National Health Insurance program's financial shortfall,
with its chief vowing to raise insurance premium rates even it costs him his job
in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Both are agencies under the Cabinet. Why does the education ministry have money
to burn while the health ministry has to live on a shoestring budget?</P>
      <P>Building swimming pools is not the education ministry's priority. The ministry
probably came up with the swimming pool project because President Ma Ying-jeou
is an enthusiastic swimmer, and here we would like to throw in our two cents.</P>
      <P>Ma recommended swimming to a student during his term as Taipei mayor when
incumbent Education Minister Wu Ching-chi was the city's education chief. When
asked why he recommended swimming, Ma answered, less than seriously, "because
Taiwan is surrounded by the sea."</P>
      <P>It wasn't a good reason to build new pools, and Ma didn't squeeze the city's
budget to finance them in city schools because of it. So that reason can't
justify a project costing NT$15 billion.</P>
      <P>Swimming pools are not only expensive to build but also costly to maintain and
could ruin a school. If the ministry is really concerned about the health of
students, it should try to ease their stress.</P>
      <P>As a loyal subordinate of President Ma, Wu won't necessarily earn credit from Ma
for carrying out Ma's campaign promises, which were patched up in haste for the
presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Finding the right person for the right place is the most demanding job of a
chief. Whether President Ma can reverse his flagging approval rating depends on
it. (Feb. 2, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: U.S.-China-Taiwan ties after arms sale</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/02/10  12:25:54
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Obama administration recently announced arms sales worth about US$6.4
billion to Taiwan, which immediately drew strong protests from China.</P>
      <P>Relations between the U.S. and China seemed to be in their best shape in a long
time after Barack Obama's visit to China last year, but the arms sale changed
that.</P>
      <P>Why would the U.S. want to do that? The stock answer is that Washington wants to
fulfill its commitment to the island's security, but in fact, the U.S. wants to
maintain its influence in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>We can get a fuller picture why the U.S. wants to maintain its influence from
its recent strategic intent toward Japan. The U.S. marine base in Okinawa has
become the focus of U.S.-Japan conflict. The row actually reflects a change in
Washington-Beijing-Tokyo triangular relations.</P>
      <P>Japan has developed close relations with China since the Hatoyama government's
inauguration, which worries the United States, as its alliance with Japan has
been the cornerstone of security in Asia.</P>
      <P>Washington's security alliance with Japan is the most important hedge mechanism
against the threat posed by an emerging China, meaning the U.S. cannot allow
Japan to tilt toward China.</P>
      <P>Facing an emerging China, the first flashpoint may be in the Taiwan Strait.
Although Washington does not want to get involved, it also cannot let go.</P>
      <P>Beijing has so far targeted its anger against the arms deal at the U.S. while
avoiding a direct attack on Taiwan so as not to harm warm cross-strait
relations. But Beijing is still upset.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing expressed goodwill in the proposed signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement with Taiwan, it has not relaxed its security
threat. It has still not promised to renounce the use of force against Taiwan
nor has it removed missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ruling and opposition camps have expressed support for the arms sale,
showing that on national security, the mainstream view of the majority is
identical. We hope that more similar examples of consensus will be seen on
cross-strait policies.  (Feb. 2, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day -- Downpour blamed for wiping off Siaolin village</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The Cabinet-level  Public Construction Commission (PCC)
02/02/10  12:42:41
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>released on Monday a report in which it concluded that massive rainfall was the
culprit that doomed the mountain village of Siaolin in southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung County in August 2009.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,856 mm of rainfall pounded Siaolin in two days during Typhoon
Morakot, far surpassing the critical point of 1,700 mm in that area, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>Siaolin ended up being covered by mudslides, with nearly 500 people buried
alive.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The PCC report pinpointed "super large rainfall" as the cause of landslides that
resulted in the major disaster. It concluded that other factors, including the
Tsengwen Reservoir diversion project, mass stockpiles at gravel yards and forest
logging, could not have caused as devastating a disaster as was seen in Siaolin.</P>
      <P>Responding to the conviction of some Siaolin survivors that the Tsengwen
Reservoir project was the killer, PCC chief secretary Wu Kuo-an stated that
theoretically and practically, the procedure of tunnel drilling had not affected
the geological structure in that area in a significant manner.</P>
      <P>While explosions set off by dynamite might make local residents feel
uncomfortable, houses located 150 meters away from the explosion zone are safe
and structures are unaffected, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Takao Green Association for Ecology and Humane Studies Director Lu Tai-ying
said, however, that the Tsengwen Reservoir Cross-Border Channeling project
involved two geologic faults. He noted that the report failed to explain whether
the faults were active or not, and whether the drilling explosions had affected
underground  rock formations.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Kaohsiung County Siaolin Village Development Association,
Tsai Sung-yu, said he and all Siaolin village residents will not accept the
report, and that village residents will organize a truth investigation committee
to probe the case.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Siaolin Village Development Association Chairman Tsai Sung-yu was extremely
displeased with the report's conclusion, suspecting that it was arrived at so
that the suspended construction of the Tsengwen Reservoir project could be
resumed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Takao Green Association Director Lu Tai-ying believed the PCC
investigation report was made based on a presumptive stance.</P>
      <P>Lu said that 30,000 kilograms of dynamite had been used in the project, which he
believed affected the rock formation. He suggested that the government be honest
with the people and admit the project was related to the tragedy to a certain
extent.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Tsai Sung-yu, who is also the chief executive of the Siaolin village self-saving
association, said his group will not accept the government investigation's
conclusion that the project did not cause the tragedy.</P>
      <P>"No procedural justice! " Tsai said, arguing that the entire investigation
process was never transparent. Though they were the direct victims, Siaolin
village residents were never invited to join the probe, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: Capital punishment should be abolished</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Entertainer Pai Pin-pin,  whose daughter was kidnapped and brutally murdered
more than a decade ago, fumed when she learned that the Ministry of Justice was
considering abolishing capital punishment.</P>
      <P>The abolishment of capital punishment is the set policy of the ministry. Two
thirds of the world, or 132 countries, have abolished or not executed capital
punishment.</P>
      <P>It has become a trend in the world. From the Christian point of view, man's life
is created by God, and only God can take it away. But for non-Christian society,
it is a hard point to swallow. It believes in an eye for an eye for the sake of
upholding justice.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has already signed several international conventions on human rights,
which include the abolishment of capital punishment, and it has the obligation
to abide by them.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is no evidence to indicate that the social order of those
countries with capital punishment is better than those without.</P>
      <P>The nature of a democracy is not to strip the basic rights of the people,
especially the right to live. If complementary measures, such as life
imprisonment or no parole, could fill in the gaps in legislation, then capital
punishment should really be consigned to the dustbin of history. (Feb. 2, 2010)</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus said
Tuesday that its members will not attend a briefing on a proposed economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China given by Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>"The DPP opposes the briefing, because it is being held outside the legislative
system, and we will boycott it, " asserted DPP legislative caucus whip Lee Chun-
yi.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MAC and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are scheduled to
report to the legislature Wednesday on the progress in negotiations of the
controversial trade deal at a meeting to be chaired by Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>Lee argued that the legislature should set up a dedicated supervisory mechanism
by forming a legislative task force to oversee cross-Taiwan Strait affairs,
including the ECFA issue.</P>
      <P>He asked Wang to host negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties to
determine how the legislature should oversee the administration's ECFA talks
with China.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin Hung-chih, a whip of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative
caucus,  said listening to the briefing will help lawmakers better grasp the
process behind negotiations on the trade pact.</P>
      <P>Lin called for his DPP colleagues to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng criticized Lin's proposal of establishing
a separate task force as "needlessly redundant."</P>
      <P>"What is crucial is whether the legislators are attentive enough to the ECFA
issue, rather than establishing a separate task force, " Wu argued.</P>
      <P>Besides, he said, when the DPP was the ruling party during the Chen Shui-bian
era, it opposed a proposal by the then opposition KMT caucus to set up a
legislative task force on cross-strait affairs and labeled it
"unconstitutional."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has elevated its travel alert level for
Indonesia and the United Kingdom (U.K.) over concerns of potential terrorist
attacks, the ministry said in a statement Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry has elevated the travel alert level for Indonesia and the U.K. to
yellow, the second lowest on the MOFA's four-scale system, and also issued a red
travel alert, the highest on the scale, for Iraq.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said Indonesia, and especially Bali which attracts the most Taiwanese
tourists, could possibly be targeted for a terrorist attack.</P>
      <P>The ministry issued the new alert for Britain after the U.K.'s Home Office
raised its domestic terrorism threat level in late January from substantial to
severe, the second highest in its five-tier threat warning system, which means
an attack is highly likely.</P>
      <P>A yellow alert warns travelers to take extra precautions and reassess their
travel plans for the place in question.</P>
      <P>The terrorist group Al Qaida could also possibly launch attacks in Iraq,
prompting the ministry to issue the highest red alert before the country holds
its parliamentary elections on March 7. The ministry again advised Taiwanese
travelers against visiting the Middle East country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. defense ministry announced it would sell a package of five weapons
systems to Taiwan last week. Unfortunately, the F-16 C/D fighters and diesel
submarines that were urgently needed by Taiwan were not included.</P>
      <P>We are not surprised by U.S. President Barack Obama's decision to announce the
arms sales at this time, as he is trying to show that his country is still a
state to be reckoned with in Asia.</P>
      <P>What  about  Taiwan?  Some weapons  --  Patriot  missiles, anti-submarine
aircraft and the submarines -- were approved in 2001 by President George Bush.
However, Taiwan's Legislative Yuan didn't approve the budget for the procurement
until 2007 owing to the opposition by the Kuomintang when it was in the
opposition.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's requests for F-16C/Ds and submarines were put on hold by
Washington in 2006 because of Taiwan's delay in preparing its budget for the
Bush package.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, President Ma welcomed the U.S. decision, saying it gives Taiwan more
confidence in engaging with China.</P>
      <P>If this is true, why would his party block the arms procurement budget in the
legislature when it was in opposition?</P>
      <P>Angered by Washington's announcement, Beijing suspended its military exchanges
with the U.S. But why didn't China punish Ma's administration by stopping its
negotiations on a proposed trade pact with Taiwan, if that pact is really as
favorable to Taiwan as is claimed?</P>
      <P>Why would China snarl at the U.S. but coddle Taiwan? The answer is obvious that
U.S. arms sales would hinder its ambition to take over Taiwan while Ma's
administration is favorable to that cause.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the Taiwan issue is an international one and not to be decided
solely by Ma's administration. Even if Ma ignores public opinion at home, the
international community won't let him have his way.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is contemplating new legislation that would
redefine prostitutes' legal status, but it said that the idea of having sex
workers get spousal consent to do the job was not its stance, as was reported in
the local media.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Tuesday that requiring prior consent was
only a suggestion  made by scholars  in a study commissioned by the ministry
last year on decriminalizing the sex trade.</P>
      <P>The suggestion and other issues -- whether to set up special zones, whether to
hold a local referendum on the issue, and whether the trade could be operated by
corporate entities -- are all being studied and have yet to be finalized, he
added.</P>
      <P>"There is no draft law on adult sex transaction management, only the studies by
scholars, " he said. "The issues involved are wide-ranging."</P>
      <P>Jiang said the ministry hopes to complete its preparations for drafting new
legislation within six months.</P>
      <P>During that time, it will invite experts, scholars, religious groups, and sex
worker representatives to seminars to solicit their views and help it balance
the rights of sex workers with concepts of decency.</P>
      <P>The ministry needs to revise the legal framework covering the sex trade
following a ruling by Taiwan's constitutional court last November.</P>
      <P>The Justices of the Constitutional Court found that a provision in the Social
Order Maintenance Act allowing prostitutes, but not their patrons, to be
punished was unconstitutional, and they ordered that it be invalidated within
two years.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will complete the legislation within the two years, " Jiang said,
pledging not only to revise the law but also establish a set of rules guiding
adult sex transactions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the reports on the spousal consent suggestion drew flak from
lawmakers, scholars and sex workers Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Female legislators  from the ruling Kuomintang  (KMT)  and opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) blasted the proposal as chauvinistic  and argued  it
could  not achieve  the goal of decriminalizing prositution.</P>
      <P>Legislators Lo Shu-lei of the KMT and Huang Sue-ying and Chen Ting-fei of the
DPP said the proposal came from the point of view of men.</P>
      <P>"If the government sees prostitution as a job, then it should protect the
women's right to work without the need for the husband's consent, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>Attorney Yu Mei-nu said the Ministry of the Interior has to first figure out
whether it wants to decriminalize or legalize sex workers.</P>
      <P>"If it is to legalize the sex workers, then it is to say that the work is legal.
In that case, legal work does not need spousal consent," she added.</P>
      <P>A sex worker said the idea of spousal consent was "absurd" and "impossible."

      <P>For the first time ever, Taiwan is working with the United States' National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to monitor environmental quality in
the South China Sea, an environmental official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"NASA has provided Taiwan's National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium with
state-of-the-art equipment to help check background air quality in the South
China Sea area, starting in January this year, " said the official of the
Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has two similar monitoring stations on the Dongsha Islands in the South
China Sea and on the country's highest peak, Jade Mountain, to measure the
impact of biomass burning in Southeast Asia on Taiwan's environment, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The installation of the NASA equipment at the coastal national marine biology
museum in Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung is part of an international
cooperative project to study and monitor special features of biomass burning in
Southeast Asia, long-haul transmission of pollutants, atmospheric chemicals and
global climate changes, the official said.</P>
      <P>Major Southeast Asian countries,  including Singapore,  the Philippines,
Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia, are also taking part in the four-year
research program, from 2010 to 2013.</P>
      <P>Under the project, Taiwanese researchers, along with research teams from the
United States and Southeast Asian countries, are collecting and monitoring
background air quality data, the official said.</P>
      <P>"This is the first time that Taiwan has joined a NASA-organized international
cooperative project to monitor environmental quality in the South China Sea,"
said the official.</P>
      <P>The project is expected to help upgrade Taiwan's environmental monitoring
capability and documentation technology and facilitate the integration  of

      <P>Information on global warming alerts and prevention should be made part of the
school curriculum to help raise environmental awareness among younger
generations, first lady Chow Mei-ching suggested Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chow called for the government  to develop an integrated, environmentally
friendly industrial policy and include global warming issues and green lifestyle
information in school courses.</P>
      <P>In a blog article in the magazine Education, Parenting, Family and Lifestyle,
Chow noted that Taiwan is on a U.N. list of Pacific island nations classified as
"the first batch of climate change refugees." However, most Taiwanese children
have little knowledge of global warming and climate change issues, she wrote.</P>
      <P>In the article titled "Green lifestyle starts from childhood, " Chow said it
would not be very difficult to lead an environmentally friendly lifestyle once
people put into practice the notion of reducing their carbon footprint and
saving energy and resources.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan society should strive to make energy saving and carbon reduction a trend
or fashion," she suggested.</P>
      <P>Only when people agree that personal vanity, luxury and fun should not lead to a
scarcity of resources for future generations will they develop environmental
consciousness as a sustainable way of life, she stated.</P>
      <P>Chow said she was invited to participate in several reading sessions for
children in local communities last December when global warming issues were
being hotly debated in Copenhagen. She discovered that most of the children who
attended the sessions knew little about global warming or energy and carbon
emissions issues, she stated.</P>
      <P>However, this is not the children's fault, she wrote, adding that the
government, society, schools and parents will have to take the blame for the
failure to integrate environmental issues and relevant human responses into the
education system.</P>
      <P>Children  must be taught about social responsibility,  the relationship between
humans and their environment, and how to live in harmony with Mother Nature, she
suggested.</P>

      <P>The tests found that the lead content in 10 of the samples, or 12.5 perent,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former residents of a village that was buried by landslides last August have
voiced anger over the official explanation given for the disaster, but
authorities insisted Tuesday that a tunnel project could not have caused the
tragedy, as some of the survivors suspect.</P>
      <P>Fan  Liang-shiow,  chairman  of  the  Cabinet-level  Public Construction
Commission (PCC) , reiterated that the energy released during the explosions set
off for the tunnel project was far weaker than the minimum needed to trigger a
disaster.</P>
      <P>The commission on Monday released a report on its investigation into what caused
Siaolin Village in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan, to be buried by landslides
during Typhoon Morakot last August.</P>
      <P>The report fingered massive rainfall as the culprit that doomed the mountain
village.</P>
      <P>Siaolin absorbed 1,856 mm of rainfall in 72 hours during the typhoon, triggering
mudslides that covered the village and buried nearly 500 people alive.</P>
      <P>Survivors  and environmental  protection  activists believe, however, that
explosions to build tunnels for the Tsengwen Reservoir water diversion project,
as well as other factors including mass stockpiles at gravel yards and
overlogging, were also behind the disaster.</P>
      <P>They did not accept the report's conclusions, but Fan explained that a research
team analyzed the explosion-triggered energy release in four  fields  from  four
perspectives:  scientific  theory, international  experience,  construction
records and seismologic monitoring.</P>
      <P>Based on its conservative calculations, the research team found that the energy
released during the construction was far lower than the trigger point of 120
gal.</P>
      <P>Gal, formerly known as galileo, is the unit of acceleration in the centimeter-
gram-second system, equal to 1 centimeter per second squared.</P>
      <P>Fan pointed out that although a blast of such a degree can be felt at a distance
by people sensitive to tremors, it was not big enough to cause a disaster.</P>
      <P>According to records on vibrations caused by construction in the area between
Dec. 20, 2006, when the explosions began, and Aug. 6, 2009, only 0.51 percent of
the records showed figures higher than noise vibration standards set by the
Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>By comparison, 0.6 percent of the vibrations recorded between Sept. 10, 2004 and
Dec. 20, 2006, before the blasting began, exceeded EPA standards, Fan said.</P>
      <P>The figures show that the tremors caused by project's explosions could not have
caused a disaster.</P>
      <P>Fan stressed that an evaluation by the Central Weather Bureau's seismologic

dynamite also reached the same conclusion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, when asked whether the suspended Tsengwen Reservoir water diversion
project would be resumed, Fan said a PCC research team has suggested that the
water channels be completed to prevent them from collapsing.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that it would be up to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan helps eradicate epidemic diseases in Haiti</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's medical assistance mission currently working in Haiti will focus its
efforts in the future on eradicating epidemic diseases and rebuilding public
health systems in the Caribbean ally ravaged by a magnitude 7.0 earthquake
recently, medical sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The efforts need governmental and NGO collaboration to become effective and
influential, said officials from the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Emergency medical aid have been donated by countries around the world to Haiti.
The international community now needs to rebuild Haiti's public health systems
in the following three to five years, with setting up an epidemic disease
prevention system topping the list, said Steve Kuo, director-general of the DOH
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will be among the few countries offering personnel and goods to help
Haiti build a disease prevention system," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The long-term disease-battling task in Haiti will represent the first time that
Taiwan helps a diplomatic ally to form part of a national  public health system
since Taiwan launched  "medical diplomacy" several years ago, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>The International Cooperation and Development Fund, a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs operation, will dispatch its officials to Haiti next week to probe the
situation and assess actual needs for the establishment of the disease
prevention system, he added.</P>
      <P>The CDC head made the remarks after talking via mobile phone with two members of
the Taiwanese medical assistance mission currently working in Haiti.</P>
      <P>Lien Chia-en, a CDC physician in charge of epidemic prevention, told Kuo over
phone that he has helped identify and prevent two cases of measles in Haiti's
capital Port-au-Prince.</P>
      <P>As the rainy season is approaching in Haiti, a disease prevention system needs
to be built there quickly to closely monitor the epidemic situation, said Lien,
a graduate of National Yang Ming University's medical school who gained
prominence serving as a health care worker in Burkina Faso from 2001-2003.</P>
      <P>Chuang Chia-chang, head of the Taiwan International Health Action, who was with
Lien, said that only about 40-50 percent of Haitians have been vaccinated
against lockjaw and diphtheria, a bacterial disease characterized by infectious
lesions in the mouth area.</P>
      <P>Coordination over vaccine requisition and distributions, led by the World Health
Organization, was not smooth, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>The progress of other efforts, including mother and child health care and
rehabilitation  and artificial  limb service for the earthquake survivors, will
need further cooperation and coordination by governments and non-governmental
organizations, Chuang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian, who has been convicted on corruption charges,
was indicted again Tuesday on charges of abetting his subordinates to give false
testimony.</P>
      <P>Taiwan District prosecutors  accused Chen of coaching  Lin Teh-hsun, who served
as a Presidential Office director during Chen's presidency, and three other
aides to mislead prosecutors in August 2006 during an investigation into
corruption allegations against Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>According  to the indictment,  Lin falsely claimed  during questioning that Chen
had used a special state affairs account to fund two secret  diplomatic
missions,  while the other aides untruthfully denied that Wu Shu-jen had ever
used invoices provided by other people to claim reimbursements from the state
affairs fund.</P>
      <P>Lin was indicted for perjury in the case, but the other aides were let off
because they had only trivial roles, the prosecutors' office said.</P>
      <P>Since Lin has already lodged an appeal with the Taiwan High Court against a
16-year sentence for perjury and embezzlement in another case involving Chen,
his latest indictment will be referred to the same court for trial.</P>
      <P>James J. Lee, a former chief of the Hsinchu Science Park, was also indicted
Tuesday for perjury.</P>
      <P>The indictment states that Lee went to Chen's official residence sometime on
Dec. 30 or 31 2003 to discuss the difficulty Lee was having to acquire a piece
of land in Taoyuan for the Hsinchu Science Park.</P>
      <P>Chen promised to help and instructed Wei Che-ho, then-minister of the National
Science Council, to allow the science park to first rent the land and then buy
it, according to the indictment.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife obtained NT$300 million in kickbacks from the private owner of
the land, according to prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors  said Lee gave false testimony during the prosecutors'
investigation  of the case and during the trial, insisting that his briefing was
to the first lady and that Chen was not involved.</P>
      <P>Lee was found to have received a NT$30 million kickbacks in the land deal and
was given a six-year sentence for corruption.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been in custody since Dec. 30, 2008, and his wife have been given
life sentences on charges of embezzlement of the state affairs fund, money
laundering and corruption.</P>
      <P>They have both denied the charges and appealed their sentences.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the United States, which is a world model for the presidential system of
government, the president gives a state of the union address to the Congress
every year, although he is not responsible for the legislature.</P>
      <P>His address is usually watched closely by people around the world for
indications of his agenda and U.S. policy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should also follow that trend because its government is a hybrid of the
presidential and parliamentary systems. The government is headed by the
president who is not answerable to the legislature. The premier, who heads the
Cabinet and is subject to legislative oversight, is in effect the president's
chief aide.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the people are eager for their president to outline his political
agenda at least once a year, explain his vision for the state and detail his
responses to the problems facing the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, like the U.S, has suffered as a result of the global financial crisis
and its leader is facing the same mounting public anger over economic problems.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan people listened to U.S. President Barack Obama's address to hear if
there were any antidotes that could be applied to Taiwan's economic problems.</P>
      <P>To our surprise, we learned that the U.S.' economic problems are not as serious
as ours. However, many of Obama's solutions seem almost tailor-made for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of particular interest was Obama's promise to set aside US$30 billion to help
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) . Taiwan's SMEs, which used to be the
backbone of its economy, have been ignored for many years and have withered
under the government's policy of nurturing giant companies and hi-tech
industries.</P>
      <P>When those large enterprises were hard hit by the global financial crisis,
Taiwan could not fall back on its SMEs to tide over the crisis.</P>
      <P>More urgently than the U.S., Taiwan needs to revitalize its SMEs. But will
President Ma Ying-jeou follow Obama's lead and earmark funds for that purpose?</P>

      <P>The Taipei Fine Arts Museum (TFAM) is hosting a solo exhibition, "Wunderkammer,
" that features the sculpture installations and architectural proposals of young
Taiwanese artist E Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen's works are full of imagination but his ideas are inspired by real life,
the organizer of the exhibition said.</P>
      <P>According to the TFAM, the exhibition includes six installation works and three
architectural proposals.</P>
      <P>One of Chen's architectural  proposals  is to establish a Titanic-themed casino
in Las Vegas that would include a 5-star hotel, a fun park, high class
restaurants, luxury stores and movie theaters. This concept explores the
juxtaposition of tragedy and gambling, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>"This proposal caught the attention of the media when it was exhibited in the
United States, and some people even believed it would really be developed," she
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, his works attempt to reinterpret artificial object space and
subvert the functionality of artificial objects. His pieces are closely related
to anti-consumerism, he said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Chen has been very active on the international arts scene.
After the TFAM exhibition ends on March 14, one of his architectural proposals,
"Lost City," will be shown in London.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Tuesday touted his administration's policy to broaden
exchanges between students of Taiwan and China on condition that the rights of
Taiwan students will not be affected.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of a two-day meeting of university presidents at I-Shou
University in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan, Ma said the government will
definitely take steps to avoid pitfalls in the process of allowing Chinese
college students to study in Taiwan and recognizing diplomas issued by some of
China's elite higher education institutions.</P>
      <P>Ma listed three reasons for his decision to implement the policy.</P>
      <P>First, he said, it forms part of the government's China policy and the goal of
forging friendly ties with other countries around the world, including China.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that under the fremework of the Republic of China Constitution,
Taiwan will maintain the status-quo in relation to China, which means no
unification, no independence and no use of force across the Taiwan Strait. This
will allow exchanges between youth from both sides, he added.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the president said, he thinks the youths of Taiwan and China should
learn from each other and sharpen their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Thirdly,  Chinese  students  could help to boost dwindling registrations in
Taiwan's colleges due to a falling birth rate in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>However, the main aim of the policy is to allow for deeper interaction between
young people on both sides of the strait and to create greater possibilities in
bilateral exchanges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The public has mixed views on whether prostitution should be a punishable
offense, according to a poll conducted by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Tuesday that the survey, which was
completed in the last half of 2009, found that 48.8 percent of the people think
the government should protect the working rights of prostitutes, while 43.2
percent disagree.</P>
      <P>"The results were just as mixed among women's groups, with some advocating the
decriminalization of prostitution, some taking the opposite view, and others
suggesting that any penalties should be extended to patrons of the trade," Jiang
said.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 60.1 percent said they are aware that the Social Order
Maintenance  Act stipulates "prostitution  is prohibited and violators should be
punished."</P>
      <P>However, only 23.3 percent of the respondents were aware that the penalties
apply only to prostitutes and not to patrons.</P>
      <P>The majority -- 52.9 percent -- were of the opinion that consensual sex trade
between adults is not a crime and should not be punishable, while 42.7 percent
disagreed with that view.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 74.6 percent think that sex trade among adults is
common in Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Some 68.5 percent of the respondents said that sex trade between adults should
be managed, with 83.6 percent of that group favoring the establishment of a
special zone, and 25.1 percent saying the sex trade should not be restricted to
any particular area.</P>
      <P>As for the opinions of local governments, Taipei and Chiayi cities are opposed
to setting up special zones, while Kaohsiung, Hsinchu, and Taichung cities and
Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Penghu counties favore special zones.</P>
      <P>Taipei County is in favor of designating red-light districts, but does not want

    <HEADLINE>King working from outside in to reform KMT: scholar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
02/02/10  21:21:18
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) latest hire of a human resource  expert shows
its Secretary-General  King Pu-tsung's determination to reform the century-old
party despite mixed responses to his decision across party lines, scholars said.</P>
      <P>King confirmed Saturday that Ryan Wu, former executive vice president of the
online 1111 job bank, has been hired to help plan KMT human resource
initiatives. Wu will work as a personnel project manager in the party's
Administration Committee on a one-year contract.</P>
      <P>"This is a move that aims to bring a breath of fresh air into the KMT's  rigid
system  and transform  its image  into that of 'youth-friendly' party, " said
Liao Da-chi, a political scientist at National Sun Yet-sen University.</P>
      <P>King's first major hire since he assumed office last December drew attention
because of the timing and Wu's controversial past. King, however, brushed off
the criticisms from some quarters, and said he hired Wu for his expertise.</P>
      <P>The appointment came in the wake of King's pledge to reform the KMT in three
years and turn the party into an election machine. Since last year, the KMT has
suffered three straight setbacks in two by-elections and a mayoral election, and
many of the party's employees have expressed fears about losing their jobs.</P>
      <P>Post-election analysis suggested that the KMT needs more young talent at the
local level to boost its appeal to young people.</P>
      <P>Wu, 43, worked as a media relations chief at the Taipei City Department of Labor
in 2001 when King was deputy mayor. However, his appointment to the party post
came as a surprise as he has had little connection to the KMT and is seen as an
"outsider".</P>
      <P>Several KMT legislators have spoken against the appointment. Legislator Lu
Hsueh-Chang said that while it's a good thing to bring in "corporate management,
" Wu is not familiar with the way party affairs are run, which could be
dangerous. Some KMT legislators have claimed that they do not know Wu.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me King is trying to use outside resources to carry out his reform,
working his way in from the outside rather than taking the 'inside-out
approach', " said Hsu Yung-ming, a political scientist at Soochow University.</P>
      <P>Wu's appointment could be the "turning point" for the KMT, which now has little
or no appeal for young people because of all its old politicians, Liao said.</P>
      <P>"In addition to having a human resource background, Wu is media-savvy and
outgoing. That can be a plus for the party. And he has been hired on a one-year
contract. If he does not deliver, he can be let go. The KMT has nothing to
lose," Liao asserted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) legislator Huang
Wei-cher was quoted as saying that Wu's appointment was "a brilliant tactic
because, as an outsider, Wu carries no baggage and can do what he wants based on
his own assessment."</P>
      <P>For a party with 106 years of history, a full-scale reform will be difficult,
Liao said. That is why King is giving priority to party image and communication
before restructuring, the scholar added.</P>
      <P>King's main options now are to create a new image for the party and build a
human resource pool so that the young generation can step in when the current
generation fades away, Liao said.</P>
      <P>"I also think it would be better if King avoided any action that involved local
party factions, as it is one of the most complicated factors related to party
reform," she said.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, King's short-term goal would be winning the next two
elections -- a by-election involving four legislative seats in late February and
the elections in five special municipalities later this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's famous Cloud Gate Dance Theatre's performances at the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington has won rave acclaims.</P>
      <P>Sarah Kaufman,  the arts reporter of The Washington  Post particularly gave high
praise to the performance "Moon Water" in a dance review published in the
newspaper on Monday.</P>
      <P>Kaufman gave a great deal of attention to the power and idea of the performance
of the theatre's young dancers Tsai Ming-yuan and Huang Pei-hua.</P>
      <P>Kaufman described the movement of Tsai in her report as something that "seem to
melt away as he lunges and folds, then, as he is still crouching, a leg will
lift, spiral, slice the air around him like a blade and slowly, slowly descend
with the weightlessness of tissue."</P>
      <P>"It brought to mind that staple of the ballet gala 'The Dying Swan', a solo of
great pathos and no small degree of virtuosic flexibility in the arms and upper
body." she said in her report.</P>
      <P>Kaufman also indicated that tai chi's inner calm and outer poise is reflected in
the work of "Moon Water"," adding that its "unhurried elegance and pliable
movement can be beautiful and even uplifting to watch."</P>
      <P>She also praised Lin Hwai-min, the founder of the troupe, saying Lin has lit the
way to a new vocabulary in dance, one that reaches back to ancient wisdom and
ahead to future fruitfulness, with a cool, unforced, yet insistent power, like
water, "Moon Water," indeed.</P>
      <P>After finishing the performance in Washington, the troupe will fly to Canada to
perform at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver Feb. 5-6.</P>
      <P>The performance is the group's first at the Kennedy Center since 1995 -
something Kaufman found perplexing, saying more performances soon by the troupe
ought to be "inevitable."</P>

      <P>More than 11,000 housing units will be affected by a Taipei City government plan
to raise taxes on upscale residential properties, a city official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Some properties will be subject to twice the amount of taxes being paid on them
at present, while others will be taxed NT$30,000 to NT$60,000 (US$1,870) more,
said Taipei City Department of Finance Director Chiu Ta-chan.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the so-called "luxury house tax" is aimed at making the
system of taxation "more fair and reasonable," he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, a residential property valued at NT$100 million is subject to the
same tax rate of 1.2 percent as one valued at NT$3 million, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, the definition of a "luxury residential
property" will no longer be based on the ground size of a housing unit or its
market price.</P>
      <P>The definition will take into account the number of households on each floor of
the building, the construction materials, the number of parking places, and
security in the building, Hau added.</P>
      <P>Commercial buildings and villas will not be subject to the luxury house tax
because they are already listed in another taxation category, Hau said.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the city government plans to introduce the luxury house tax
in 2011.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, revenue officers at a meeting held by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
earlier in the day agreed that the existing house tax system must be adjusted
because the house value assessment standard is unreasonably low, said MOF Deputy
Minister Chang Sheng-ho.</P>
      <P>For example, the current assessment value of a 10-story building in Taipei City
is NT$4,580 per square meter, but the construction cost is NT$21,000 to
NT$26,000 per square meter, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, house tax rates are decided by local governments.</P>

      <P>Five thousand gift certificates for free steak meals were distributed to blood
donors hours after a one-day nationwide blood collection drive kicked off
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>For the third year in a row, Tasty steakhouse joined forces with the Taiwan
Blood Services Foundation to launch a blood donation drive, said Hung Ching-yu,
the steakhouse's spokesperson.</P>
      <P>Long lines were seen at the 40 designated sites around the country, with
latecomers sighing and complaining.</P>
      <P>"I came here with my friends who got up at 3 a.m or 4 a.m. to get ahead in the
line, " a Taipei woman, who was identified as Chu, told the CNA's English Web
site Focus Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In fact, people should rest well before donating blood, " said Lee Hui-chen,
spokesperson for the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation.</P>
      <P>"Simple tests are usually conducted on the potential donors to ensure the
quality of the blood," she said.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the public to donate blood regularly over the long term.</P>
      <P>"Donated blood expires in 35 days, so it is not a good idea to collect too much
in one day as it will all expire at the same time, " she said.</P>

      <P>Hotai Motor Co., the Taiwan distributor of the Japanese car maker Toyota, is
offering free inspection service to users of Toyota vehicles who may be
concerned about problematic gas pedals that have prompted massive recalls in the
United States and Europe.</P>
      <P>However, Hotai Motor Co. executives claimed Tuesday that the defective
accelerator pedal made by CTS Corp. is not found in vehicles on the Taiwan
market, as they use an entirely different one produced by Denso Corp.</P>
      <P>The two types of gas pedals were displayed at a press briefing held by the car

and experts.</P>
      <P>Auto parts for the same car model can be different because they have to be

      <P>Hotai Motor has promised to confirm the cause of the recall of over four million
cars in the U.S. and Europe in recent weeks. The Japanese company CTS has denied
that there is any problem with the quality of the gas pedal it designed.</P>
      <P>The commission will ask the transport ministry to investigate whether local car

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou stressed Tuesday the importance of making Taiwan
universities globally competitive, and said he hopes they can attract 30,000
foreign students over the next four years.</P>
      <P>"It is urgently important to make local universities and colleges
internationally efficient so as to recruit more students from other countries to
help Taiwan sharpen its competitive edge, " Ma said at the opening of a two-day
meeting of university and college presidents at I-Shou University in Kaohsiung
County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently foreign students account for only 10 percent of the student body at
Taiwan's tertiary institutions, he noted.</P>
      <P>"Judging from Taiwan's past history, it is a fact that opening to the rest of
the world will make our country strong, and we hope to lure more foreign
students," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president said a scholarship program run by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
has initially succeeded in attracting foreign college students, but he called
for a further upgrade so that all courses can be taught in English. So far, all-
English courses are offered at 39 Taiwanese universities, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan's dwindling crude birth rate -- which was the world's lowest at
8.29 last year -- poses a great threat to its higher education system, which
might see an oversupply of places in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The president announced that the government is planning to implement a
performance-based "flexible salary program" from the fall semester of this year,
to keep good professors and researchers at home as part of its efforts to
cultivate world-class human resources over the long term.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, education is at the core of the government's efforts to secure
Taiwan's continued survival, as the country does not have rich natural resources
and because of its disaster-prone environment.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education (MOE) Wu Ching-ji also announced in the meeting later the
same day that tuition and miscellaneous fees at nationwide universities and
colleges will not be raised for the next academic year.</P>
      <P>In light of rising consumer prices, decreasing salaries and shrinking household
incomes, the MOE has decided to freeze tuition for one academic year, starting
from September, until the economic recovery takes hold, Wu said.</P>

      <P>The public has mixed views on whether prostitution should be a punishable
offense, according to a poll conducted by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Tuesday that the survey, which was
completed in the last half of 2009, found that 48.8 percent of the people think
the government should protect the working rights of prostitutes, while 43.2
percent disagree.</P>
      <P>"The results were just as mixed among women's groups, with some advocating the
decriminalization of prostitution, some taking the opposite view, and others
suggesting that any penalties should be extended to patrons of the trade," Jiang
said.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 60.1 percent said they are aware that the Social Order
Maintenance  Act stipulates "prostitution  is prohibited and violators should be
punished."</P>
      <P>However, only 23.3 percent of the respondents were aware that the penalties
apply only to prostitutes and not to patrons.</P>
      <P>The majority -- 52.9 percent -- were of the opinion that consensual sex trade
between adults is not a crime and should not be punishable, while 42.7 percent
disagreed with that view.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 74.6 percent think that sex trade among adults is
common in Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Some 68.5 percent of the respondents said that sex trade between adults should
be managed, with 83.6 percent of that group favoring the establishment of a
special zone, and 25.1 percent saying the sex trade should not be restricted to
any particular area.</P>
      <P>As for the opinions of local governments, Taipei and Chiayi cities are opposed
to setting up special zones, while Kaohsiung, Hsinchu, and Taichung cities and
Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Penghu counties favore special zones.</P>
      <P>Taipei County is in favor of designating red-light districts, but does not want

    <HEADLINE>King working from outside in to reform KMT: scholar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
02/02/10  21:21:18
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) latest hire of a human resource  expert shows
its Secretary-General  King Pu-tsung's determination to reform the century-old
party despite mixed responses to his decision across party lines, scholars said.</P>
      <P>King confirmed Saturday that Ryan Wu, former executive vice president of the
online 1111 job bank, has been hired to help plan KMT human resource
initiatives. Wu will work as a personnel project manager in the party's
Administration Committee on a one-year contract.</P>
      <P>"This is a move that aims to bring a breath of fresh air into the KMT's  rigid
system  and transform  its image  into that of 'youth-friendly' party, " said
Liao Da-chi, a political scientist at National Sun Yet-sen University.</P>
      <P>King's first major hire since he assumed office last December drew attention
because of the timing and Wu's controversial past. King, however, brushed off
the criticisms from some quarters, and said he hired Wu for his expertise.</P>
      <P>The appointment came in the wake of King's pledge to reform the KMT in three
years and turn the party into an election machine. Since last year, the KMT has
suffered three straight setbacks in two by-elections and a mayoral election, and
many of the party's employees have expressed fears about losing their jobs.</P>
      <P>Post-election analysis suggested that the KMT needs more young talent at the
local level to boost its appeal to young people.</P>
      <P>Wu, 43, worked as a media relations chief at the Taipei City Department of Labor
in 2001 when King was deputy mayor. However, his appointment to the party post
came as a surprise as he has had little connection to the KMT and is seen as an
"outsider".</P>
      <P>Several KMT legislators have spoken against the appointment. Legislator Lu
Hsueh-Chang said that while it's a good thing to bring in "corporate management,
" Wu is not familiar with the way party affairs are run, which could be
dangerous. Some KMT legislators have claimed that they do not know Wu.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me King is trying to use outside resources to carry out his reform,
working his way in from the outside rather than taking the 'inside-out
approach', " said Hsu Yung-ming, a political scientist at Soochow University.</P>
      <P>Wu's appointment could be the "turning point" for the KMT, which now has little
or no appeal for young people because of all its old politicians, Liao said.</P>
      <P>"In addition to having a human resource background, Wu is media-savvy and
outgoing. That can be a plus for the party. And he has been hired on a one-year
contract. If he does not deliver, he can be let go. The KMT has nothing to
lose," Liao asserted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) legislator Huang
Wei-cher was quoted as saying that Wu's appointment was "a brilliant tactic
because, as an outsider, Wu carries no baggage and can do what he wants based on
his own assessment."</P>
      <P>For a party with 106 years of history, a full-scale reform will be difficult,
Liao said. That is why King is giving priority to party image and communication
before restructuring, the scholar added.</P>
      <P>King's main options now are to create a new image for the party and build a
human resource pool so that the young generation can step in when the current
generation fades away, Liao said.</P>
      <P>"I also think it would be better if King avoided any action that involved local
party factions, as it is one of the most complicated factors related to party
reform," she said.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, King's short-term goal would be winning the next two
elections -- a by-election involving four legislative seats in late February and
the elections in five special municipalities later this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's famous Cloud Gate Dance Theatre's performances at the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington has won rave acclaims.</P>
      <P>Sarah Kaufman,  the arts reporter of The Washington  Post particularly gave high
praise to the performance "Moon Water" in a dance review published in the
newspaper on Monday.</P>
      <P>Kaufman gave a great deal of attention to the power and idea of the performance
of the theatre's young dancers Tsai Ming-yuan and Huang Pei-hua.</P>
      <P>Kaufman described the movement of Tsai in her report as something that "seem to
melt away as he lunges and folds, then, as he is still crouching, a leg will
lift, spiral, slice the air around him like a blade and slowly, slowly descend
with the weightlessness of tissue."</P>
      <P>"It brought to mind that staple of the ballet gala 'The Dying Swan', a solo of
great pathos and no small degree of virtuosic flexibility in the arms and upper
body." she said in her report.</P>
      <P>Kaufman also indicated that tai chi's inner calm and outer poise is reflected in
the work of "Moon Water"," adding that its "unhurried elegance and pliable
movement can be beautiful and even uplifting to watch."</P>
      <P>She also praised Lin Hwai-min, the founder of the troupe, saying Lin has lit the
way to a new vocabulary in dance, one that reaches back to ancient wisdom and
ahead to future fruitfulness, with a cool, unforced, yet insistent power, like
water, "Moon Water," indeed.</P>
      <P>After finishing the performance in Washington, the troupe will fly to Canada to
perform at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver Feb. 5-6.</P>
      <P>The performance is the group's first at the Kennedy Center since 1995 -
something Kaufman found perplexing, saying more performances soon by the troupe
ought to be "inevitable."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tax on upscale residential properties expected to double</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 11,000 housing units will be affected by a Taipei City government plan
to raise taxes on upscale residential properties, a city official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Some properties will be subject to twice the amount of taxes being paid on them
at present, while others will be taxed NT$30,000 to NT$60,000 (US$1,870) more,
said Taipei City Department of Finance Director Chiu Ta-chan.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the so-called "luxury house tax" is aimed at making the
system of taxation "more fair and reasonable," he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, a residential property valued at NT$100 million is subject to the
same tax rate of 1.2 percent as one valued at NT$3 million, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, the definition of a "luxury residential
property" will no longer be based on the ground size of a housing unit or its
market price.</P>
      <P>The definition will take into account the number of households on each floor of
the building, the construction materials, the number of parking places, and
security in the building, Hau added.</P>
      <P>Commercial buildings and villas will not be subject to the luxury house tax
because they are already listed in another taxation category, Hau said.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the city government plans to introduce the luxury house tax
in 2011.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, revenue officers at a meeting held by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
earlier in the day agreed that the existing house tax system must be adjusted
because the house value assessment standard is unreasonably low, said MOF Deputy
Minister Chang Sheng-ho.</P>
      <P>For example, the current assessment value of a 10-story building in Taipei City
is NT$4,580 per square meter, but the construction cost is NT$21,000 to
NT$26,000 per square meter, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, house tax rates are decided by local governments.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's transportation minister has cried foul over China's unfair treatment
of Taiwanese  carriers in allocating additional cross-Taiwan Strait flights
during the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>"China has not treated  our carriers  fairly in allotting additional cross-
strait flights during the Lunar New Year holiday. Chinese carriers are allowed
to operate far more extra flights than Taiwanese airline companies,  " Minister
of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese carriers will operate a total of 350 additional flights
during the Feb. 13-21 Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Of the amount, 252 flights have been allocated to Chinese carriers,  while the
remaining 98 were allocated to Taiwanese carriers.</P>
      <P>"The more-than-two-fold gap is very regrettable and extremely unfair to our
carriers," Mao said.</P>
      <P>The imbalance resulted from a different approach by the two saides to carrier
applications for extra flights, airline sources said.</P>
      <P>While  Taiwan's  authorities  agreed  to Chinese  carriers' applications for
extra flights as long as they complied with local regulations, the sources said,
China rejected a number of requests by Taiwanese carriers on technical grounds,
brandishing the excuse that its flight routes were overcrowded.</P>
      <P>An indignant Mao described Beijing's action as a "technical contradiction" in
its flight allotment.</P>
      <P>Even more ugly and outrageous, Mao said, is that many of the additional flights
allocated to Taiwanese carriers will land or take off at around midnight or in
the early hours of the morning in popular destinations such as Beijing and
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>This year's Lunar New Year festival is the first since the two sides opened
regularly scheduled non-stop flight services, and Mao said this year's
experience should serve as a new starting point for future cross-strait
negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Similar unfair treatment for Taiwanese carriers should never happen again, " he
said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States' recent announcement that it will sell US$6.4 billion worth of
arms to Taiwan highlights a continued stable relation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>But the arms sale, which has excluded submarines and F-16 C/D fighters requested
by Taiwan, fell far short of expectations.</P>
      <P>The deal will represent 69 percent of Taiwan's defense budget this year. As
stunning as that may seem, the weaponry has been in discussions for years and
the U.S. should have approved the package earlier without delaying it for six
months, a never-seen-before phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Arms sales have been a key indicator of the stability of Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>The fact that approval for this latest package of arms has been delayed for so
long seems to send a sort of warning signal, with some asking if this will be
the last and the largest arms sale by the United States to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Such worries are not entirely unwarranted. The U.S. is willing to sell defensive
weaponry to Taiwan not because of the law, or the Taiwan Relations Act signed
after it broke diplomatic ties with the Republic of China on Taiwan, but its
firm political commitment to Taiwan's freedom.</P>
      <P>The strength of such a commitment will hinge on whether the strategic interests
of Taiwan and the United States are identical and on the impact of China's
emergence. Past U.S. administrations have tried to maintain the balance, and if
the Obama administration attaches greater importance to the latter than the
former, then the Ma administration will have to be cautious.</P>
      <P>Politically, the arms sale will involve the three parties of the U.S. , China
and Taiwan. But the issue belongs to a dispute that should be put aside. That
is, if the arms sale could not be solved in a short time, why not put it aside?</P>
      <P>Militarily, Beijing's worries that Taiwan will "use force to reject
unification," or "maintain the status quo forever" are also unwarranted.</P>
      <P>The United States has never sold offensive arms to Taiwan, and Taiwan could only
maintain minimum defense. Taiwan's military has also begun a transformation with
the emergence of non-conventional security issues, epitomized by its C-130
transport plane carrying relief goods to quake-stricken Haiti recently.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan arms sale will be the cornerstone of a stable bilateral
relationship. With the warmer cross-strait relations, arms sales could be
adjusted based on Taiwan's defense needs and the transformation of its military,
but it should never end because of threats.</P>
      <P>Past experience has shown that without stable Taiwan-U.S. relations, there will
be no stable cross-strait relations.</P>

States. This is an issue that concerns the security and well-being of Taiwan's

      <P>Despite its brilliant economic performance, China is in fact one of the gaggle
led by Japan in the "flying geese" model for Asia's economic development. It is
China's 1.3 billion population that gives the false impression that it is a huge

China on an equal footing with the United States.</P>
      <P>Among those who have indulged themselves in this serious illusion is Ma, who
believes that China is the savior of the world's economy and the hero of his

      <P>Worldwide, both developed and developing countries are on the alert against

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day -- Luxury home tax could push up property prices</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/03/10  12:11:45
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government has decided to increase property taxes on upscale
residential properties in 2011. The plan, designed to promote tax fairness, has
sparked widespread debate and could lead to further fluctuations in property
prices.</P>
      <P>Real estate brokers believe the so-called "luxury home tax" will not dampen the
market for luxury housing units but rather push prices higher because the tax
will endorse the targeted properties as brand names synonymous with luxury, on a
par with such brands as Hermes or Lamborghini.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City, over 11,000 housing units will be subject to 120-280 percent
hikes in property taxes.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The luxury home tax will trigger a "price tag effect, " said DTZ Taiwan general
manager Billy Yen on Feb. 2.</P>
      <P>Yen described the planned tax hike as akin to "government certification" of
upscale properties, and he anticipated that this endorsement would prove
attractive to some buyers and actually help push prices of the "certified"
housing units higher.</P>
      <P>He predicted the price of some luxury residential properties will increase by 20
percent.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan Chairman Wang Yao-shing expressed support for the move to
impose a luxury home tax, saying that while it only represents a drop in the
bucket to wealthy people, it could increase the state's revenues.</P>
      <P>However, Chao Teng-hsiung, chairman of the Taipei-based Far Glory Group, argued
that raising taxes on luxury properties might have violated the principle of tax
fairness.</P>
      <P>Factors such as the building's structure, its location, and the floor the home
is on have already been taken into account in assessing property values under
the existing property tax system, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Only if wealthy people purchase property in Taiwan will the country's economic
development benefit, he argued. Chao said it was not good for the government to
solicit inflows of overseas funds while taking measures to frustrate wealthy
people from investing in the country.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin defined upscale residential properties as "properties
that the public commonly defines as luxury."</P>
      <P>According to a city government survey, 269 buildings with 11,177 housing units
will fall into the category of luxury housing units.</P>
      <P>According to preliminary estimates, the city will collect more than NT$300
million in revenues annually after the tax is imposed on July 1, 2011.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Foreign brokerage houses said the tax increase will still be lower than the
properties' monthly management fees. At the same time, however, the prices of
the luxury housing units could rise by 20 percent because the tax would be a
form of brand endorsement, they believed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, scholars described the luxury home tax as a "fake issue, " a measure
they felt would not stem short-term property profiteering. They suggested that
the government impose a true capital gains tax on real estate.</P>
      <P>Yang Song-ling, dean of National Cheng Chi University's College of Social
Sciences, said the Taipei City government's tax measure would do nothing but
increase the cost of owning property over the long term.</P>
      <P>But to those buying and then selling housing units valued at over NT$100 million
within a year or two and making a profit of at least NT$10 million, a tax
increase of NT$20,000 would mean nothing, Yang said.</P>

      <P>The executive branch will brief the legislature Wednesday on the first round of

agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>It will mark the first time that senior officials responsible for the issue have
briefed  the legislature  on progress  on the controversial deal that has yet to
win a consensus in society.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang and Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan will lead a group of working-level officials in giving
the briefing at a meeting chaired by Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>In response to criticism of the lack of transparency in the government's
handling of cross-Taiwan Strait engagements, senior officials will brief
lawmakers Wednesday on the first round of cross-strait ECFA talks held in
Beijing Jan. 26.</P>
      <P>Only lawmakers from the ruling Kuomintang  and its allied Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union will attend. The legislative caucus of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday it will boycott the event
because it is being held "outside the legislative system."</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Lin Hung-chih said the DPP's boycott could not be
justified, as listening to the briefing will help lawmakers better grasp the
process behind negotiations on the trade accord.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  Lin added,  the administration has not rejected legislative
supervision within the legislature's system since the MAC has agreed to give
regular reports on ECFA talks to the legislature's economics and internal
administration committees.</P>
      <P>On the DPP proposal that the legislature set up a special panel to oversee
cross-strait engagements and treaty talks, Speaker Wang said he already conveyed
the message to President Ma Ying-jeou. Ma did not express his own opinion but
said instead that the KMT legislative caucus should further discuss such a
proposal.</P>
      <P>The caucus vetoed the proposal on the ground that the legislature already has an
effective  mechanism  to supervise cross-strait engagements and did not need to
create redundant bodies. (Feb. 3, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu will interview President Ma Ying-jeou Thursday
in her capacity as Formosa Media Co. founder.</P>
      <P>Lu said Tuesday her interview will focus on a range of topics, including cross-
strait relations, national defense, and diplomatic, financial, economic and
social issues.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Lu said, the government should forge a national
consensus first. Regrettably, she complained,  the Ma administration has often
struck deals or signed accords with China before informing the legislature.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih took the initiative to investigate public grievances last
year, but there is still a clear and present one -- traffic tickets that are
sent to one's registered address, which might not be the offender's actual
address.</P>
      <P>There is a dateline to meet for paying fines, but if the ticket is sent to an
address that makes it difficult to pay, then the administrative measure is
obviously deviating from its original intent.</P>
      <P>The  relevant  government  agencies  have  shirked  their responsibility, making
what should be a simple issue very sticky. The root of the problem lies in the
executive branch's mentality of "maintaining the status quo, " which is after
all the least risky option.</P>
      <P>If the premier is serious about addressing this public grievance, he can start
by making sure the tickets are sent to people who have clearly registered their
present address. In the case of those who have not registered clearly, then the
tickets should be sent to both the registered place and the present address.</P>

    <DATELINE>02/03/10  13:08:50
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Share prices of the Far Eastern Department Store plunged over 20 percent in one
week over fears among investors that it may lose the ownership of one of its
subsidiaries, the Pacific SOGO Department Store.</P>
      <P>The uncertainty on the ownership of SOGO arose from a ruling by the High Court
recently that the Far Eastern forged the conference records of both its share
holders and board of directors in capital replenishment by which Far Eastern was
able to become owner of SOGO in 2002.</P>
      <P>Based on the ruling, the Prosecutors Office of the High Court asked the MOEA's
Commerce Department to nullify Far Eastern's official replenishment registration
-- a move that will make Far Eastern's acquisition of SOGO void.</P>
      <P>The Commerce Department, however, has not taken any immediate action on the
case, saying more considerations are needed since the ruling is not final after
Far Eastern appealed the case to the higher court.</P>
      <P>The controversy highlights the role of the Commerce Department in approving
business registrations based on a documental rather than substantial screening
process, leading to its failure to prevent those disqualified corporations from
completing registration.</P>
      <P>To prevent the SOGO ownership dispute from hanging in the balance for too long,
the department should move soon to conduct a substantial screening and to decide
whether to drop Far Eastern's registration, so as to help maintain share market
stability and boost investors' confidence.</P>
      <P>For the long term, the Commerce Department should consider requiring accountants
of companies to improve their screening accuracy before giving endorsements, and
introduce change in the system to stop businesses from resorting to means of
forgery to defraud the government agencies and investors.</P>

      <P>A group of high school students who are elected to be young diplomats of Taiwan,
and are on a visit to Washington D.C., asked U.S. officials they met many
questions, including about U.S.-Taiwan relations, Taiwan's Representative Office
in the United States said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It was the first time young Taiwanese diplomats visited the capital city since
Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) launched the annual program eight

city, according to the group leader James Chang, deputy dorector-general of the
MOFA Department of Information and Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Praising the students'  performance,  Chang said the young diplomats had raised
many questions about issues concerning traffic and unemployment during their
meeting with U.S. officials, whom he noted sometimes appeared not quite able to
cope with the students' sharp questions.</P>
      <P>The students had also asked about Taiwan-U.S. ties and beef disputes in the
conference with AIT representatives, he added.</P>
      <P>Some students said the trip to New York and Washington D. C. enabled them to
better understand the United States, and that the contact with foreign officials
raised their self-confidence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Industry upgrade or migration</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/03/10  13:58:25
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An increase in operating costs and a shortage of migrant workers are the two
biggest challenges facing many enterprises in China's coastal areas ahead of the
upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The migrant worker shortage is a problem that has lingered for some time. In
early 2009, many companies in China hit by the global financial crisis were
forced to scale back spending, and laid off a great number of workers from rural
areas, most of whom had no choice but to return to their hometowns.</P>
      <P>However, following a surge in exports amid a gradual economic recovery in the
second half of 2009, companies tried to recall their laid-off workers, only to
find that the demand for such workers far outstripped the supply.</P>
      <P>The problem is especially serious in the Yangtze River Delta area of Guangzhou
Province and the Pearl River Delta region around Nanjing, two of the main areas
in which Taiwanese businesses have invested.</P>
      <P>Even though some enterprises are offering financial incentives such as pay
hikes, bonuses and fringe benefits to lure employees, it apparently does not
help much, mainly because most laid-off workers are unwilling to take the risk
of leaving their hometowns after suffering their previous setbacks.</P>
      <P>In addition, job opportunities in some inland Chinese provinces have been
increasing because of the launch of various economic stimulus projects in the
provinces over the past two years, which has also dampened local residents'
interest in working in urban areas.</P>
      <P>As the Chinese New Year approaches, companies in coastal areas are worried that
many of their employees will not return to work after the holiday, making the
worker shortage even worse.</P>
      <P>In addition, after various parts of Jiangsu Province announced a minimum wage
increase from Feb. 1, other cities in the country are also mulling increasing
their minimum wages.</P>
      <P>Wage hikes would put businesses under tremendous pressure because of higher
personnel costs and could undermine their competitiveness. However, they could
help ease the labor shortage.</P>
      <P>Another wave of industry migration could also be triggered, either because of
factory closures as a result of the labor shortage or business failures due to
higher operating costs.</P>
      <P>The migration could be characterized by the move of industries from the high-
cost Yangtze Delta and Pearl River Delta regions to Southeast Asia and inland
Chinese provinces, where land and personnel costs are low and there is an
abundant supply of cheap labor.</P>
      <P>Aside from migration, companies have been given another choice in the face of
the challenges -- transform and upgrade in order to survive.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC to step up communication with public on ECFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   3  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government  will step up its communication with the public on the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China in an effort to
assuage misgivings about the trade pact, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Three categories of individuals will be targeted -- residents in central and
southern Taiwan, those from low- and middle-income households, and owners of
small- and medium-sized businesses, Lai said while briefing legislators on the
progress of the ECFA talks with China.</P>
      <P>She said the MAC will send officials on campus visits to discuss the issue with
students, using "the language of young people" and will also explain the policy
to the public using clear, easily understood language.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the Cabinet has arranged a series of briefing sessions on the
ECFA issue for various legislative committees and will also report to the
legislative speaker and the legislative caucuses of the various political
parties.</P>
      <P>"This is aimed at showing the executive branch's sincerity in communicating with
the legislature and accepting its supervision. We hope the public will see our
hard work," she said.</P>
      <P>Lai said it remains the government's goal to have the deal sealed during the
fifth round of talks between  the leaders of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) slated to take place at some point in the first half of
this year.</P>
      <P>To pave the way for the signing of the agreement, the two sides held the first
round of formal negotiations Jan. 26 in Beijing, in which they discussed issues
such as the title and basic structure of the agreement and the establishment of
a consulting mechanism.</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed that the pact will cover the liberalization of the trade of
goods and services, rules of origin, an early harvest list, trade remedies and
dispute arbitration, as well as investment and economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said the date for the second round
of talks has not been decided upon, but added that they will not take place
before the Chinese New Year holiday in mid-February.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Hung-chih, a whip of the ruling Kuomintang's legislative
caucus, between February and June, the MAC and the Ministry of Economic Affairs
will deliver a total of 10 reports to the Legislative Yuan, including five to be
given in joint committee meetings.</P>
      <P>After the pact is signed, the document will be required to pass a legislative
review before it can be put into force, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
which did not attend Wednesday's briefing, demanded that a cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs panel be set up under the Legislative Yuan to monitor the signing of the
ECFA.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-yee, a DPP caucus whip, said his caucus did not receive an invitation
from the MAC to attend the briefing, although it was invited by Legislative
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng to take part as an "auditor."</P>
      <P>"This was an insult to the DPP caucus, so it rejected the non-institutional,
informal report that lacks any legal grounding, " he said.</P>
      <P>Unless the Cabinet submits its ECFA impact assessment report to the legislature,
legislators will have no way to monitor the matter, he argued.</P>

      <P>With the government' s efforts to develop green forms of energy, Taiwan's
production value in the sector is forecast to have hit NT$1.15 trillion (around
US$35.9 billion) by 2015, an official in charge of energy affairs said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Taipei seminar on the era of low carbon emissions, Wang Yun-ming,
deputy director-general of the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, said that "green investment" now dominates the economic development
agendas of many countries.</P>
      <P>He cited statistics compiled by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as
saying that the U.S. government has set aside US$67.7 billion in its economic
stimulus measures for developing clean and green energy, while the European
Union has committed 105 billion euros by 2013, South Korea has earmarked 50
trillion won over the next four years, and Japan has decided to make available
100 trillion yen by 2015.</P>
      <P>Taiwan for its part will focus on solar power, LED lighting, wind power, bio-
energy, fuel cells, energy information communication technology and electric
vehicles.</P>
      <P>He said the production value of the local green energy sector will have
increased from NT$160 billion last year to NT$1.15 trillion by 2015, attracting
private investment worth NT$200 billion and creating 110, 000 jobs,</P>
      <P>By that time, Wang went on, with its backbone industries having shifted to areas
featuring low carbon emissions and high added value, Taiwan will be one of the
leading countries in terms of new energy technology development and production.</P>

the country's top sports administrator said Wednesday.</P>

sports or exercise centers in cities and counties around Taiwan to encourage
local residents to exercise regularly.</P>
      <P>The council also intends to invest NT$4 billion over the next four years to
build new cycling trails in northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan. Tai
said.</P>
      <P>"The trails will connect with 17 road networks around Taiwan to form two round-
the-island cycling trails -- one a 1,022-kilometer coastal path and another a
907-km mountain trail, " explained Tai, who said the new trails would give local
cycling enthusiasts a wide variety of options.</P>
      <P>With the Asian Games coming up in November, the council is actively helping
athletes prepare for the event, but it has also launched a medium- and long-term

      <P>The government has increased its annual budget for assisting research and
development institutes in the development of lithium fuel cells as part of
efforts to promote the development of the electric vehicle industry.</P>
      <P>The budget was increased from last year's NT$120 million (US$3.75 million)  to
NT$160 million this year,  Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) officials
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Electric automobiles carry high price tags because of the expensive batteries
they require and this has become a major factor in the low popularity of green
vehicles.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the cost of the batteries alone accounts for nearly 50
percent of the cost of making an electric car.</P>
      <P>Last year, Japan introduced fuel cell-leasing services in an attempt to reduce

      <P>Former first lady Wu Shu-jen was sentenced Wednesday to nine months in prison
for abetting false testimony by her family members.</P>
      <P>In the High Court case, Wu's son Chen Chih-chung, her daughter Chen Hsing-yu and
son-in-law Chao Chien-ming  each received a three-month sentence for giving
false testimony on Wu's instruction.</P>
      <P>In addition, former chairwoman of the Taipei 101 tower, Diana Chen, was
sentenced to eight months in jail for her involvement in the same case.</P>
      <P>Wu was found guilty of prompting her son,  her daughter, son-in-law to tell the
court that the invoices Wu used to claim reimbursements from a special state
affairs fund during her husband's presidential term were from the first family's
spending for shopping and entertainment.</P>
      <P>Wu and her husband, former President Chen Shui-bian, were convicted last year
for embezzlement of the state affairs fund.</P>
      <P>It was found that Wu had collected invoices from her family members  and used
them to claim the reimbursements  from the Presidential Office special state
affairs fund.</P>
      <P>It was also later determined that she coached her children to tell investigators
the invoices were from "public affairs spending."</P>
      <P>In the ruling against Diana Chen, it was found that in April 2009 she gave court
testimony that conflicted with her statements during the investigation of the
former president and his wife.</P>
      <P>In the District Court trial of the case last September, Wu was sentenced to one
year in jail, while her son, daughter and son-in-law were each given six months,

      <P>In response to the High Court ruling, Chen Chih-chung said although they were
all given lighter sentences, the punishment was still "too heavy."</P>

    <HEADLINE>President meets with Control Yuan members over MRT Neihu Line</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou defended his decision to make the Taipei MRT's Neihu Line
a medium-capacity system when questioned Tuesday by Control Yuan members
investigating alleged irregularities in the planning and construction of the
line.</P>
      <P>Four members of the Control Yuan, the nation's leading monitor of the
government, visited the Presidential Office as part of its investigation to
question Ma, who served as Taipei mayor when the Neihu Line was planned and when
construction began.</P>
      <P>Ger Yeong-kuang, the leader of Control Yuan's investigation, said the group's
focus was "mainly on the decision-making process of the construction of the
line."</P>
      <P>On why he decided to make the Neihu Line a medium-capacity system,  Ma said an
assessment at the time suggested that a medium-capacity system was more
workable.</P>
      <P>Also, the then central government controlled by the Democratic Progressive Party
government did not support a large-capacity system and would not have helped the
Taipei city government finance a larger-scale project, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the city council and public opinion were both in favor of a medium-
capacity system, Ger cited Ma as saying.</P>
      <P>According to Ger, the president also defended his decision by saying that
because there were so many pipelines under Neihu, the line might not have opened
last year if a large-capacity underground system had been selected.</P>
      <P>On why the project's electrical and mechanical work was tied to the civil
engineering tender, Ma said it was based on concerns that German engineering
giant Siemens would have monopolized the bidding and forced the city to pay more
than its budget could afford.</P>
      <P>A local construction company, Kung Sing Engineering Corp., won the civil
engineering bid for the MRT's Neihu section and selected Canada-based Bombardier
to be responsible for the electrical and mechanical part of the system.</P>
      <P>The Neihu Line was designed to link up with the former Muzha Line, which was
built by French contractor Matra Co. in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>But because of compatibility problems between the Matra and Bombardier systems,
the line suffered repeated glitches after opening last July, leading to
questions over its design and quality.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan member Hung Chao-nan asked Ma if he would be willing to share
responsibility for the problems since the line was built in part during Ma's
term before being inaugurated under his successor, Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>Ma answered that "if there is responsibility to take, I'm willing to shoulder
it," according to Hung.</P>
      <P>Ger said the meeting shed light on the controversy and that the investigation
would conclude at the earliest before Chinese New Year, which falls on Feb. 14
this year.</P>
      <P>Ger said investigation officers did not accompany the Control Yuan members to
the Presidential  Office to avoid giving the impression that the president was
"under investigation."</P>
      <P>But the DPP criticized the encounter, contending that the Control Yuan should
have first determined if it has the right to investigate Ma for possible
negligence occurring before he served as the president.</P>
      <P>If such a right exists, they should have had investigators accompany them, DPP
spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said. If they do not have such a right, they should not
be allowed to investigate the case until after the president steps down"</P>
      <P>"They should by no means close the case rashly," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The right to impeach a president belongs to the legislature, and whether the
Control Yuan members have the right to investigate the president is a gray area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan may allow voters more flexibility on where to vote</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
02/03/10  19:21:31

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese voters may be allowed to vote at the constituencies where they work
rather than where their legal residences are registered in the year-end
elections for heads of five special municipalities, a senior official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"If necessary revisions to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law and
relevant preparatory work can be completed in time, we will not rule out the
possibility of introducing transfer voting in the year-end mayoral elections, "
said Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-hua at a news conference.</P>
      <P>The move could have an impact on the results of the elections as many people,
especially young people, do not work or live in the same cities where they are
registered to live. In previous elections, voters have had to take trains, buses
or planes to go back to the city of their legal residence to cast their vote.</P>
      <P>Also according to Jiang, the Ministry of the Interior has been studying the
feasibility of enacting absentee voting to provide a means for eligible voters
to participate in upcoming elections even though they may not be able to go to
the polls on election day.</P>
      <P>Absentee voting can be implemented in several variations or options, including
vote-by-mail or postal voting, proxy voting, voting in advance and transfer
voting.</P>
      <P>After discussing with the Central Election Commission, however, Jiang said the
ministry has tentatively decided to first introduce transfer voting, which will
allow eligible voters to vote in the constituencies where they work instead of
the constituencies where their legal residencies are registered.</P>
      <P>"We are scheduled to come up with a draft package of amendments to the election
and recall law for legislative screening during its new session to pave the way
for enacting transfer voting for the convenience of our voters," Jiang said.</P>
      <P>The ministry originally planned to introduce transfer voting in the next
presidential election in 2012, but if legal revisions and preparatory work can
be completed in time, the new voting option may be launched in the year-end
elections for mayors of the country's five special municipalities, Jiang
explained.</P>
      <P>"If necessary legal amendments and preparations  cannot be finalized in time,
the new system will be put into practice in the next presidential election,"
Jiang added.</P>
      <P>As the year-end  elections  will  only  be held  in five municipalities --
Taipei City, Taipei County, combined Taichung City and County, Tainan City and
County, and Kaohsiung City and County -- many other cities and counties will
have to set up polling stations if the transfer voting is indeed adopted.</P>
      <P>"Although such a measure may increase cost, we will work to the best of our
ability to overcome all obstacles to protect our people's voting right," Jiang
said.</P>
      <P>The year-end elections are being seen as a key indicator of the popularity of
President Ma Ying-jeou and his party -- the ruling Kuomintang -- as well as a
gauge of whether Ma might win a second term in the 2012 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Overseas Taiwanese, however, will still have to fly home to vote, as transfer
voting will be restricted to voters working in Taiwan and will not be applied to
those staying abroad, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>Jiang admitted that the study about transfer voting has not been finalized.</P>
      <P>"Our major goal now is to come up with a comprehensive raft of amendments this
year," Jiang said, adding that the U.S.-style postal voting by absentee ballots
may be adopted one day when security and confidentiality can be ensured.</P>

      <P>Nearly 100 guests representing foreign missions in Taipei, as well as
international and domestic media and government officials attended a launch
party Wednesday for CNA's new English-language Web site, Focus Taiwan
(focustaiwan.tw).</P>
      <P>Guy Ledoux, head of the European Economic and Trade Office, said that since the
establishment of the CNA, the foreign community has always relied on it as a
truly dependable source of information.</P>
      <P>"It is precisely due to this reason that a Web site like Focus Taiwan will play
such an essential role for us," Ledoux said, adding that the news agency's
effort is "testimony to Taiwan's freedom of speech."</P>
      <P>"The function of a Taiwan editorials abstract is extremely valuable as it gives
an insight of Taiwanese opinion makers, " Ledoux noted, referring to a new
section on the Web site.</P>
      <P>Welcoming the guests, CNA President Chen Shen-ching said the agency is offering
news services for the Internet age. Focus Taiwan provides real-time English-
language news reports, while mobile phone news services in Chinese and English
started Feb. 1, and video news will soon be available online and for mobile
phones.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said that while the 86
-year-old CNA has reported on major news events and has recorded the history of
the Republic of China over the decades, the agency's English-language news
serves as the voice of the nation to the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) Chairman Wang Chi-kang said
in his speech that like economic and trade personnel, journalists play the roles
of pioneers on the international frontier.</P>
      <P>In today's era of globalization, Taiwan's contributions should be made known to
the world, Wang said, adding that TAITRA and CNA should work together to promote
the country's integration with the world.</P>
      <P>The features of Focus Taiwan include Talk of the Day, a roundup of various
newspaper reportage on the events of the day; editorial abstracts from six of
Taiwan's major newspapers; Forum, which presents views on issues of concern; and
Who's Who, which offers background information on the newsmakers.</P>
      <P>Presenting Taiwan's many faces through real-time, objective and in-depth reports
in English, Focus Taiwan hopes to function as the prime English-language news
resource in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In Ledoux' words, CNA's new package of service provides easy access to news
stories and more communication options in a time "when we are sometimes lost in
identifying what information is relevant."</P>

      <P>Legislative by-elections for four seats to be held Feb. 27 are so crucial for
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) that the party is under tremendous pressure to win,
President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a morale-booster at a KMT meeting for the party's candidates in the by-
elections in four counties, Ma called on all party members to strive for victory
in the upcoming battle.</P>
      <P>Ma said that since the KMT came to power, it has encountered numerous challenges
and that as success in the by-elections is so vitally important to make up for
the party's setback in Jan. 9 by-elections, everyone in the party should do
their parts to drum up support for the KMT candidates.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Ma also presented party flags to all four candidates -- Chen
Shueh-sheng for Taoyuan County, Cheng Yung-tang for Hsinchu County, Lin Teh-jui
for Chiayi County and Wang Ting-sheng for Hualien County.</P>
      <P>Chen described the by-elections as a crucial point in the party's efforts to
move from defeat to victory, adding that "I have to win."</P>
      <P>Cheng for his part said he hoped to secure a victory in Hsinchu County by
integrating various local factions.</P>
      <P>Proposing a new vision for Chiayi County, meanwhile, Lin vowed to break former
Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen's political monopoly because after serving out
his term as magistrate, he will also be eyeing a legislative seat.</P>
      <P>Vowing to seek more budget for construction of the controversial Suhua highway
if elected, Wang urged voters "not to be fooled" by opposition Democratic
Progressive Party candidate Hsiao Bi-khim, who has promised to cut train ticket
prices by half for county residents instead of going ahead with the new road.</P>

      <P>As cross-Taiwan Strait travel has become more convenient, several international
corporations have expressed interest in investing in Taiwan, and in particular
the American wholesale chain Costco is planning a NT$30 billion investment,
according to an official of the Investment Commission under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Director of the commission Ning Chia-yu said recently that Costco plans to set
up an Asian-Pacific regional distribution center near Taoyuan International
Airport, in addition to its business expansion plan in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Since the first Costco warehouse was opened in Kaohsiung in 1997, the American
company has established five more warehouses in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung.
Its latest NT$30 billion investment plan includes the establishment of another
20 warehouses around the island.</P>
      <P>Ning said that direct cross-strait transportation has also boosted interest
among overseas Taiwanese businessmen  to make investments in Taiwan. In 2009,
overseas Taiwanese investments amounted to NT$36.2 billion, compared to the
total of NT$20.4 billion in 2008, and NT$14.1 billion in 2007. The Investment
Commission projected an 8% growth this year, to NT$38 billion.</P>
      <P>Ning said that as the government is ready to further loosen the restrictions on
investments by mainland Chinese, the Investment Commission plans to organize an
investment promotion mission to China in April, targeting leading Chinese
businesses.</P>

      <P>Three indigenous Taiwanese broadleaf tree species -- Taiwan acacia, Formosan ash
and Taiwan zelkova -- have been found to be very effective in removing carbon
dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, a researcher said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"In a series of studies on the subject, it was found that the Taiwan acacia has
the highest CO2 absorbency of all tree varieties, " said Huang Yu-hsing, head of
the Forestry Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The Formosan ash was second, followed by the Taiwan zelkova, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said his institute has cultivated seedlings of the three endemic tree
species for forestation programs around the island to help reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and contribute to the fight against global warming.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, he added, broadleaf trees have higher carbon absorption
capacity than needleleaf trees.</P>
      <P>Compared with fossil fuel restrictions, tree planting is a far more effective
and cost efficient way to cut greenhouse  gas emissions, Huang said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyodo Protocol on greenhouse gas emission
reduction, it cannot secure international certification for the carbon
absorption of local tree-planting programs at present, Huang said.</P>
      <P>In the future, he said, the government should formulate a comprehensive set of
rules to regulate forest carbon sequestration operations. This should include
the establishment of a certification mechanism to pave the way for local
companies to take part in global carbon trading and offsetting, he suggested.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is expanding its participation in the international relief efforts in
earthquake-ravaged Haiti by sending an assessment team to join forces with
United Nations-related organizations in the Caribbean country,  a Taiwan agency
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The effort is also in keeping with the Taiwan government's promise to fund four
aid projects in Haiti, said Lee Pai-po, deputy secretary-general of the
International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) under Taiwan's foreign
ministry.</P>
      <P>"It is not easy for Taiwan to join international  relief operations, as it is
not a member of the United Nations, " Lee said at a press briefing. "But this
time, it's very different because the United Nations has included Taiwan's
relief efforts as part of its rescue system. "</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also been invited by Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez to
take part in an international meeting in mid-April to exchange views on long-
term aid to Haiti.</P>
      <P>So far, the Taiwan government and private sector have provided a total of US$13
million in aid to Haiti.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan mission, led by ICDF Secretary-General Tao Wen-lung and other
officials, will depart Thursday for Haiti to carry out the assessment, according
to an ICDF statement.</P>
      <P>The team will focus on public health, the settlement of victims, vocational
training and orphan adoption, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the third medical team from Taiwan will leave Friday for Haiti on a
two week mission.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Chen, head of the 15-member medical team, said that when the rainy
season begins in Haiti in March it "will make the rescue work much more
difficult."</P>
      <P>"By then, the safety of drinking water will be a top concern as the drainage
system is poor," he added.</P>
      <P>"This will also make it difficult to control contagious diseases at a time when

      <P>Officials of the Taiwan representative office in Yakohama urged Japanese
authorities Wednesday to release the captain of a Taiwanese fishing boat that
was seized as it was entering Japan waters earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Ke Ching-kuo, captain of the Yilan-registered fishing vessel the Chuansheng No.
36, was brought to Yakohama for questioning after his fishing boat was seized by
Japanese marine patrol personnel for allegedly crossing a temporary marine
boundary between Taiwan and Japan in waters near the Iwo Jiwa islands, 1,200 km
south of Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan officials, who visited Ke soon after his arrival in the city, said
that he was in relatively good shape but needed medicine for his diabetes.</P>
      <P>Japanese officials said the Taiwanese boat was intercepted and seized after it
refused to be checked by the Japan coast guard.</P>
      <P>The 98-ton Chuansheng No. 36 left its base in Suao, Yilan, northeastern Taiwan,

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Official quits over surcharge controversy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/04/10  12:11:05
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of highway transportation and relevant affairs
quit Wednesday over an NT$8 surcharge controversy.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-ming, head of the Directorate General of Highways under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC), offered to resign, saying in the
written statement that he had not properly managed a proposal to increase the
service charge for the collection of motor vehicle fuel tax at convenience
stores.</P>
      <P>Lin's resignation was accepted by MOTC Minister Mao Chi-kuo the same day.
Premier Wu Den-yih was said to be "very upset" the previous day over the MOTC
plan that would have raised the fuel tax service charge at convenience stores
from NT$8 to NT$15 per vehicle.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih was reportedly very upset about the proposed NT$8 service
charge increase. He said officials should empathize more with ordinary
consumers, and officials who turn a deaf ear to the people's outcry are not fit
to hold their positions.</P>
      <P>It is not known whether it was Wu's remarks that prompted Lin to step down, but
following the premier's statement, Transportation Minister Mao Chi-kuo on
Wednesday nixed the plan for the service charge hike.</P>
      <P>The merits of the proposed increase were indeed debatable, but allowing the top
highway official to step down simply because of an NT$8 surcharge controversy
seems to be a disproportionate response.</P>
      <P>Mao said he was accepting Lin's resignation with a heavy heart.</P>
      <P>Lin was awarded two major merits by the MOTC last year for his part in the
government's rescue, relief and reconstruction work in the wake of Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>Lin, a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) , said at the
time that when he was engrossed in the post-typhoon work, he had not even
stopped to see his mother while he was on the road in Wanluan township in
Pingtung County near where she lives.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>One day after the MOTC responded to Premier Wu's comments and defused the
surcharge hike controversy by dropping the plan, the top highway official
resigned.</P>
      <P>While approving Lin's resignation, Minister Mao said he respects Lin's decision
to quit and referred to him as a "gentleman."</P>
      <P>Mao said Premier Wu attaches great importance to the people's feelings and had
asked for a prompt resolution of the controversy over the proposed price hike
plan.</P>

      <P>The 2010 Taipei Game Show will open Friday at the Taipei World Trade Center,
with 62 game developers and distributors presenting hundreds of new games at 450
booths.</P>
      <P>On of big events at the five-day show will be the Intel Extreme Masters Asian
contest, which will feature such exciting games as "Counter- Strike 1.6," "World
of Warcraft," and "Quake Live."</P>
      <P>The competitions are expected to draw large crowds, mostly young fans, as
students are on winter vacation, the longest break in the academic year.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer the Taiwan Computer Association, the Taipei Game
Show, which is now in its 18th year, has become a springboard for the Asia-
Pacific digital content industry to explore the tremendous potential of the
Chinese market.</P>
      <P>With 57.5 percent of Taiwan households having access to the Internet and 72.1
percent of them using broadband connectivity, the Taiwan environment is suitable
for further development of the game industry, the association said.</P>
      <P>Digital content development  has become the focus of many university and college
programs in Taiwan, and this year, 18 college departments and institutes will
display the creative works of their students at the exhibition, according to the
organizer.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will run from Feb. 5-9 and will be open daily from 10 a.m.to 6

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: Ma bashing becomes pop culture</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/04/10  12:31:15
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bashing President Ma Ying-jeou seems to have become a fad in Taiwan society.
That's because he holds power and sits in a high position. Criticizing him
probably gives people a kind of false gratification.</P>
      <P>Ma's detractors like most to bash him as being timid and lacking guts. Pro-
independence activists slammed him for his refusal to meet with the Dalai Lama
in Taiwan last year for fear of offending China, while pro-unification
proponents criticized him for failing to take bold enough steps to move Taiwan
closer to China. Beijing is also dissatisfied with Ma's reluctance to take
strong action against pro-independence advocacy.</P>
      <P>Semiconductor business tycoon Robert Tsao mentioned in a recent speech that many
people have taken Ma to task for what they call his lack of courage and resolve.
Tsao expressed the view that a stiff backbone is the most important attribute in
corporate manpower because a timid and spineless person tends to lack vision and
superior judgement.</P>
      <P>However, a democratically elected president should demonstrate his courage and
boldness only within the realms of his power, and should not flex his muscles to
abuse his position. In a democratic country, every citizen has his own personal
rights that should not be infringed upon by national leaders or agencies. (Feb.

      <P>EVA Airways, Taiwan's second largest air carrier by revenue, is scheduled to
launch a fleet of four passenger planes with floral themed cabins Friday to help
promote the Taipei International Flora Expo (TIFE) 2010.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City government has designated EVA Air as the official carrier for
the TIFE, which will run from Nov. 6, 2010 to April 25, 2011. The airline said
the four planes will take each off from a different Asian city Friday to launch
the TIFE promotion drive.</P>
      <P>The four Asian cities will be selected later Thursday from among Nanjing, Hong
Kong, Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, Seoul and Bangkok.</P>
      <P>EVA Air has outfitted with floral themes four of its Airbus 330-200s that fly
shorter-haul and regional routes. More than 40 items, including place mats, cups
and head-rest covers, have been imprinted with flora expo images, the Taipei
City Department of Economic Development (DED) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The airline is also featuring expo images on its luggage tags and boarding
passes, which can be kept by passengers as collectors' items.</P>
      <P>In addition, EVA Airways said, it will also offer special fares and airfreight
rates for visitors to the expo and for participating exhibitors.</P>
      <P>A ceremony to launch the expo theme on EVA flights is scheduled to be held at
the airline's hangar near Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport later Thursday,
with Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin officiating.</P>
      <P>Children from an orphanage run by the non-profit Taiwan Fund for Children and
Families will be invited to board one of the theme flights and will be treated
to a "TIFE inflight dinner, " DED officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the DED, as of January, 99 organizations and groups from 68 cities
in 37 countries had registered to take part in the 2010 Taipei flora expo as
exhibitors.</P>

    <DATELINE>02/04/10  14:41:57
(Feb. 4, 2010)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the latest twist in the fight for control of SOGO Department Store, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Feb. 3 invalidated a 2002 decision by
Pacific Logistics Co. Ltd., which controls SOGO, to allow the Far East
Department Store to invest in the company. The MOEA's move brings into question
the Far East Group's control of SOGO's Taiwan stores.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of local media coverage of the issue: The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The MOEA's decision was in line with a 2009 judgment by the Taiwan High Court
which found that Far East's investment in SOGO was null and void. The minutes of
a Pacific Logistics board meeting, which claimed that approval was given for the
Far East investment, were in fact forged, the court found.</P>
      <P>According to the court ruling, the board meeting never took place. The Far East
executive who forged the minutes was sentenced to two months in jail. (Feb. 4,
2010) China Times:</P>
      <P>By revoking the legitimacy of the Pacific Logistics' minutes, the MOEA has set
the stage for a rematch between the Far East group and SOGO's founder Pacific
Construction Co., Ltd. for control of SOGO.</P>
      <P>It also reinstates Lee Heng-lung, chairman of Pacific Logistics in 2002, as the
logistics' head and thereby gives him a deciding role in the battle between
Pacific Construction and the Far East group.</P>
      <P>This senario seems unfair to the Far East group, as it has funnelled more than
NT$4 billion into SOGO through Pacific Logistics in the last eight years, while
Lee holds only NT$6 million worth of shares.</P>
      <P>Pacific Construction, which is the founder of Pacific Logistics, said it would
ask the court to appoint a caretaker for SOGO rather than hand control to Lee
Heng-lung who, according to Pacific Construction, acquired control of Pacific
Logistics by fraudulent means. (Feb. 4, 2010) United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Lee Heng-lung rebutted Pacific Construction's claims, and argued that the
dispute is between him and the Far East Group and has nothing to do with Pacific
Construction, which he said would never get back SOGO.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the Far East group said it would appeal to the MOEA to reverse its
decision and will ask that any action be put on hold while the appeal is being
considered.</P>
      <P>The group said in a written  statement  that the dispute surrounding SOGO is
very complicated and has given rise to many lawsuits. The ministry should not
interfere with the matter and let the court settle all related cases.</P>
      <P>An MOEA official said the ministry has only invalidated the Pacific Logistics
board meeting minutes and is in no position to decide who should control SOGO.</P>
      <P>This means the Far East group's NT$4 billion investment in Pacific Logistic will
be converted into loans, the official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that he hopes Taiwan and Japan can start
negotiations on signing a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) this year, while
continuing to promote their strategic partnership.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Japan maintain very close economic relations, so both will benefit
greatly if they can sign a bilateral FTA," Ma said while meeting with the new
Japanese representative to Taiwan, Tadashi Imai, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Japan is Taiwan's second-largest trade partner, while Taiwan is Japan's fourth-
largest  trade partner,  according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>After designating 2009 as the year in which Taiwan was supposed to have forged a
special strategic relationship with Japan, Ma said, his administration will
continue to boost bilateral exchanges and cooperation in various fields this
year.</P>
      <P>"In addition, we hope to start discussions with Japan on the feasibility of
striking an FTA that will bring good fortune and well-being to our business
community and ordinary people," said Ma.</P>
      <P>The 2010 work agenda also includes preparations for opening direct flight
services between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport in
October, as well as the promotion of an exhibition in Japan of ancient Chinese
art treasures from the National Palace Museum in Taipei, he went on.</P>
      <P>Touching  on  Taiwan's  diplomatic  policy,  Ma  said  his administration's
main goal is to pursue  peace  and balanced development.</P>
      <P>"We believe our efforts to improve relations with China are conducive to Japan,
South Korea and other East Asian countries, " he said.</P>
      <P>Under his "modus vivendi" policy toward China, Ma continued, relations across
the Taiwan Strait have improved greatly since his inauguration in May 2008,
while his flexible diplomatic approach has also allowed the two sides of the
strait to respect each other and avoid their previous controversial tug-of-war
to lure away each other's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>While working to improve cross-strait ties, Ma said, Taiwan has also spared no
efforts to strengthen relations with Japan, the United States, the European
Union and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>On East Asian security, Ma said Taiwan attaches great importance to the
continuity of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, describing it as a cornerstone for
regional security and stability.</P>
      <P>According to the president, Taiwan has never overlooked its security relations
with the U.S., and he hailed a recent U.S. decision to sell Taiwan a package of
weapons as a further guarantee of Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will be more willing to improve relations with China when our people
feel safe and confident in our country's defense ability," Ma told Imai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Advice to health minister --think before you speak</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/04/10  15:52:03
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang  announced last week that National Health
Insurance premiums will be raised, only to have the information denied by the
premier.</P>
      <P>It was not the first time that Yaung said health premiums were to be raised.
However, his proposal has never been discussed in the Cabinet, let alone
approved.</P>
      <P>Yaung's plans for a premium hike have been shelved mainly because they were made
too close to election time and the ruling party did not want the issue to become
an election albatross.</P>
      <P>However, our focus is on the minister's plan to raise premium rates rather than
broaden the base for calculating payments, to include total personal income
instead of just wages.</P>
      <P>Raising premium rates seems to be an easy way out of the health insurance
program's financial problems, but as the ruling Kuomintang controls a majority
in the Legislative Yuan, it can easily pass a bill to broaden the premium
calculation base.</P>
      <P>We fully agree with the premier that the health ministry should try every
possible means to address the program's financial problems before resorting to
an increase in premiums. For example, computerization of patients' case
histories would help save costs.</P>
      <P>It is only natural to want to raise premiums when a health insurance program is
in the red, but Yaung needs to convince the public of the need for the increase,
explain fully why that particular option is being chosen, and obtain approval
for his proposal through the legal process.</P>
      <P>As he has not taken his premium increase proposal through that process, Minister
Yaung should be more contemplative and thorough in the execution of his duties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-U.S. Major leaguers impressed with Taiwan's youth baseball</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
02/04/10  16:26:52
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former U.S. Major League baseball stars Barry Larkin and Joseph Logan said
Thursday they were impressed with the development of youth baseball in Taiwan
and they encouraged young players to work hard on the fundamentals of the game
and "dream big."</P>
      <P>Larkin and Logan are visiting Taiwan as part of the Sports Envoy Program co-
sponsored by the U.S. Department of State and the American Institute in Taiwan
-- the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The pair have been coaching high school players in various clinics in northern
Taiwan over the past three days, and are now in the south of the country.
Larkin, a former All-Star shortstop, focused on infielders' training, while
Logan coached pitchers.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held midway through the week-long tour, Logan praised the
enthusiasm of Taiwan players and the "above-average velocity and potential" of
the young players.</P>
      <P>Larkin said one of his surprises was that while young players in the U.S are not
receiving enough training and attention due to the economic downturn, this is
not the case in Taiwan. He said he has seen "a lot of voluntarism, hard work and
attention from coaches, who have been doing a phenomenal job."</P>
      <P>A legitimate candidate for the Hall of Fame, Larkin was one of the rare players
in the modern era who stayed with the same team throughout  his entire career,
starring at shortstop for the Cincinnati Reds from 1986 to 2004.</P>
      <P>He was a key member of the Reds' 1990 World Series championship team and was
named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1995. He also earned three
gold gloves and was a 12-time All-Star.</P>
      <P>Citing his own history as an example of persistence, Larkin said when he was a
boy his feet were turned inward and had to be treated by doctors. However, his
love of the game, dedication to baseball and perseverance helped him to reach
Major League stardom, he said.</P>
      <P>He said he was very happy that after he told his life story to youngsters in the
clinics to inspire them, the number who said they wanted to someday play in the
Major League rose from "maybe one or two to almost 120."</P>
      <P>The Cincinnati native declined to comment on a game-fixing scandal that has
rocked Taiwanese professional baseball, but he urged Taiwan baseballers to "do
what's right" and resist temptation because "regardless of what you do, you have
to look at yourself in the mirror every day."</P>
      <P>He also paid respect to all those foreigners, including players from Taiwan, who
chase their dreams of playing in the Major League.</P>
      <P>There are many barriers and obstacles to the dream of playing in the U.S.,
including language, a different culture and different skill levels, he said.</P>
      <P>"You have to be a special talent, a special person, and then the skills, work
ethic... all of these are important" to get into the Major League, which is "an
elite class," Larkins said.</P>
      <P>Larkin finished his career with 2340 hits, 441 doubles, 198 home runs and 960
runs batted in. He had only one season in which he made more than 20 errors. He
is considered to be a legitimate Hall of Fame candidate.</P>
      <P>Logan pitched in the Montreal Expos organization between 1989 and 1991.</P>
      <P>Larkin and Logan will travel to Kaohsiung and Pintung where they will hold more
clinics before concluding their Feb. 2-6 visit to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Sports Affairs Council will draft an amendment of the law
governing the issuance of work permits to Chinese athletes, in response to
suggestions from legislators that Chinese basketball players should be allowed
to join Taiwan's semi- professional basketball teams and play in Super
Basketball League (SBL) contests.</P>
      <P>Now entering its seventh season, the SBL boasts seven teams -- Bank of Taiwan,
Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor, Dacin Tigers, Pure Youth, Taiwan Beer, Taiwan Mobile
Clouded Leopards and Yulon Luxgen.</P>
      <P>Legislators Ting Shou-chung and Chang Hsien-yao called a meeting at the
Legislative Yuan Thursday to make the request.</P>
      <P>Vice Sports Minister Tseng Tsan-pao pointed out that under existing laws and
regulations, Chinese referees and coaches can apply to visit Taiwan to attend
conferences, while Chinese athletes can attend only non-profit sports
activities. The duration of stay is from two months to four months.</P>
      <P>In order to join Taiwanese semi-professional teams, Chinese basketball players
would need to apply for work permits, Tseng said, adding that the authorities
must also work out tax issues.</P>
      <P>Beginning this year, all SBL teams are allowed to hire foreign players. An
immigration official who attended the meeting suggested that the authorities
take into consideration a possible crowding-out effect upon foreign recruits, as
well as Taiwanese players, should Chinese players be permitted to play.</P>
      <P>The legislators suggested that the seven SBL teams should prepare a report on
the possible impact of opening to Chinese players and that the Sports Affairs
Council should complete a law amendment draft within a month, while the Mainland
Affairs Council should organize a cross-agency coordination meeting in two
months.</P>

      <P>In a contest organized by the U.S. State Department, the winner, a Chinese
political dissent, characterized democracy as a gradually improving game in
which an independent identity and organization seeks to optimize its interests
through transparent means other than violence.</P>
      <P>By this definition, many people question whether Taiwan under the leadership of
President Ma Ying-jeou is still a democracy.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan have long forsaken violent means, but the ruling Kuomintang
resorted to violence to push through a revision of the Local Government Act in
the legislature recently.</P>
      <P>The  transparency  of  policy-making  is  ignored  by Ma's administration, which
kept secret the content of its proposed trade pact with China and refused to
send it to the legislature for approval after it was wrapped up.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  the  wealth  gap  is  widening  under  Ma's administration, owing
to Ma's policy of seeking detente with China, which benefits the country's giant
companies at the cost of the little man.</P>
      <P>Under the governance of Ma's administration, Taiwan is regressing in both
democracy and economy. When they dip to the levels of China, it will be time for

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet denies premier's role in official's resignation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for the Executive Yuan denied Thursday that Premier Wu Den-yih
played a role in the resignation of Taiwan's top official in charge of highways
over an NT$8 surcharge controversy.</P>
      <P>Su Jun-pin said Wu made some remarks two days earlier in which he urged civil
servants to empathize more with ordinary consumers, but did not "hint" or
"imply" that anyone in the government should step down, nor did he offer
suggestions on any specific personnel reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-ming, head of the Directorate General of Highways under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC), offered to resign Wednesday, saying in
a written statement that he failed to properly manage a proposal to increase
service charges for the collection of motor vehicle fuel tax at convenience
stores.</P>
      <P>Lin's resignation was accepted by Transport Minister Mao Chi-kuo that same day.
Premier Wu Den-yih was said to be "very upset" over the MOTC proposal, which
would have raised the fuel tax service charge at convenience stores from NT$7 to
NT$15 per vehicle.</P>
      <P>A local daily reported that Lin resigned after the premier "hinted" that he
should quit over the proposal.</P>
      <P>The spokesman further said that Wu said Tuesday that the people's
dissatisfaction with the government will mount even further should problems that
have existed for decades remain unaddressed.</P>
      <P>Those problems include motorists often failing to receive traffic tickets  or
fuel tax notifications  because  the tickets  and notifications are mailed to
motorists' household registration address rather than to the address they
currently live at, Su said.</P>
      <P>Wu was reported to have been very angry about the proposed NT$8 service charge
increase and to have said that officials who turn a deaf ear to the people's
outrage are not fit to hold their positions.</P>
      <P>It was unclear whether it was Wu's remarks that prompted Lin to step down, but
following the premier's statement, Mao nixed the plan for the service charge
hike and signed Lin's resignation letter.</P>
      <P>Mao referred to Lin as a "gentleman" and said he accepted Lin's resignation with
a heavy heart.</P>
      <P>Lin sent an open letter Thursday to his colleagues at the Directorate General of
Highways in which he offered his heartfelt appreciation to them for their
unwavering devotion to work aimed at making Taiwan a better place in which to
travel and live.</P>
      <P>He exhorted his former colleagues to work hard on a string of reconstruction
projects still requiring completion, including 50 old bridges that need to be
rebuilt within two years, the integration and computerization of all motor
vehicle service and management units, and a review and overhaul of the safety of
tour buses.</P>

      <P>The demand for various self-paid childhood vaccines has slowed down in Taiwan
amid reports of severe side effects allegedly linked to the influenza A(H1N1)
vaccine,  a pediatrician said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Ping-ying from National Taiwan University Hospital, fewer
children are receiving self-paid vaccines such as the rotavirus vaccine and
pneumococcal vaccine due to the public's hysterical reaction to those reports.</P>
      <P>Other government-funded  vaccination  programs for children, however, have not
been affected, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Officials of pharmaceutical firms said that parents are hesitant about their
children having the shots because of the many reports about needle phobia and
limb weakness allegedly related to the H1N1 vaccine.</P>
      <P>Also, many parents are terrified by reports that the thimerosal contained in
most vaccines can cause autism, they said.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yih, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) ,
said the incidents have had little impact on the existing government-funded
childhood vaccination against hepatitis and the three-in-one vaccination against
measles, mumps and rubella.</P>
      <P>From March 1, the CDC will provide children with free five-in-one shots against
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b disease,
replacing the existing polio drops and three-in-one shots that cover only
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the five-in-one vaccine produces significantly fewer side effects
than the traditional three-in-one  vaccine,  Shih predicted that the new program
will not face many barriers.</P>

    <DATELINE>02/04/10  17:22:07
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are four scenarios for the future of Taiwan and China -- Taiwan
independence, maintaining the status quo, uniting under a union or confederacy
and united together.</P>
      <P>All of them have to be based on the so-called "1992 consensus" that there is
only one China, with each side of the Taiwan Strait free to interpret the
meaning of "one China" as they see fit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan independence is hardly a viable option for Taiwan, as was shown by former
President Chen Shui-bian, who did not seek permanent separation from China
during his eight-year term, despite his support for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>He concealed his cause for independence in the guise of the Republic of China,
and used that cause only in his domestic political struggle.</P>
      <P>As to maintaining the status quo, that means maintaining the Republic of China
and the People's Republic of China, both of which have the standpoint that there
is only one China, although they disagree on whether one is a part of the other
and whether Taiwanese are Chinese, so this option has to be based on the
differing interpretations of what "China" is.</P>
      <P>Wang Daohan,  the late chief of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits, said in 1997 that "one China" is an idea under development that
is neither China nor Taiwan.</P>
      <P>What he meant was a China under the umbrella of a confederacy or union, which
would also entail the prerequisite of acknowledging "one China" with different
interpretations.</P>
      <P>This shows whatever political option Taiwan prefers, it has to be based on "one
China" with different interpretations. (Feb. 4, 2010)</P>

      <P>After one year in power, U.S. President Barack Obama's approval rating has
fallen to a nadir and his Democratic Party has lost a series of critical
elections, including the special election for the U.S. Senate seat of the late
Ted Kennedy.</P>
      <P>Similar scenarios have occurred in Taiwan, with President Ma Ying-jeou's
approval rating standing at a record low and the ruling Kuomintang having
endured one election setback after another since its return to power in 2008.</P>
      <P>Their plights should not be attributed to the volatility of voters but rather to
the poor economic situation. Society tends to be volatile and unstable when the
number of unemployed increases sharply and the incomes of middle-class families
drop substantially.</P>
      <P>To address the economic woes, the Obama administration has decided to spend
US$100 billion to rev up the U.S. economy and create jobs. Similarly, Taiwan's
government has also come up with various job creation programs, with the aim of
creating more than 100,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>However, such programs tend to offer only temporary or short-term jobs rather
than solve unemployment problems caused by changes in the local economic or
industrial structures. Joblessness will increase again when the emergency
programs come to an end.</P>
      <P>To fundamentally resolve the problems, the government should make job creation
its top policy goal. In the past, the government has offered tax and financial
incentives to encourage R&amp;D. In the future, the government should enact laws
to encourage the creation of jobs.</P>
      <P>For instance, the government should include job creation in the proposed statute
on the promotion of industrial innovation as a criteria for tax exemption and
other financial benefits. Only by so doing can the unemployment issue be
resolved. (Feb. 4, 2010)</P>

      <P>Trend Micro Inc., a global leader in network antivirus and Internet content
security software and services, announced Thursday that it has established an
affiliated firm to put itself "in the clouds, " as 2010 is forecast to be "the
Year of Cloud Computing."</P>
      <P>Trend Micro founder and chairman Steve Chang said at a news conference that the
affiliated firm, PCloud Computing, is aiming at putting forth its self-developed
cloud computing operating system software in the second quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>"Compared to Microsoft, Amazon or Google, Taiwan has started relatively late in
terms of cloud computing," said Chang.</P>
      <P>Noting that Trend Micro has been developing cloud computing technology and
relevant knowledge for the last four years, Chang said the purpose of PCloud
Computing's founding is to create an open platform for cloud computing and
consolidate the power of the global open-source communities to offer users more
choice.</P>
      <P>Describing PCloud Computing as a driving force behind the development of cloud
computing technology, Chang said the new company will offer technical
assistance, training courses and consultation services to potential users.</P>

      <P>Chen  quoted  International  Data  Corporation  (IDC) ,  a Massachusetts-based

into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times reported Thursday that the KMT's National Policy Foundation
(NPF) recently published a research paper on the feasibility of expanding the
imports of Chinese farm produce, although President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Wu
Den-yi have many times promised not to open Taiwan up to Chinese agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>The trade agreement would lead to a lifting or reduction in tariffs for imports
from China and vice versa.</P>
      <P>In rebutting the report, NPF President Tsai Cheng-wen said the research was

deficits and public debts. The current fragile recovery is not expected to
resolve all these issues, while any slips could trigger more serious problems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, developing countries, particularly those in Asia, face the threats of
economic overheating and the bursting of property bubbles due to hot money
inflows and fast expansion of domestic demand.</P>
      <P>According to the World Bank report, China has shown signs of a property bubble
and its government has taken measures in response.</P>
      <P>As the economic growth in advanced countries still largely relies on their
governments' stimulus measures, the IMF report has advised those countries not
to stop their emergency measures too soon.</P>
      <P>The World Bank report even warned that if private demand cannot grow swiftly
enough to replace  government-sponsored  stimulus measures, the threat of a
double-dip recession cannot be ruled out.</P>
      <P>More worrisome is that the global trade volume cannot rebound to the pre-
recession  level  until 2012 after last year's  steep contraction, according to
both reports.</P>
      <P>Shrinking global trade volume poses a challenge to Taiwan's export-driven
economy. With China -- the country's largest trade partner -- showing signs of a
property bubble and facing ever-rising inflationary pressure, Taiwan's
government should take precautions to ensure steady growth of the local economy.

      <P>In view of a rapid surge in property values in the Taipei area, Taiwan should
adopt measures to fend off an assets bubble, according to a senior analyst with
Fitch Ratings.</P>
      <P>Jonathan Lee,  senior director of Fitch Rating's Financial Institution  Group
and lead analyst  for Taiwanese  financial institution products, raised the
suggestion in a report titled "Assets Bubble in Asia?" issued Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee called for great attention to be paid by the government sector given that
the housing value in Taipei City increased 20 percent last year alone. Since
2003, after the outbreak of SARS, property values in Taiwan's largest city has
grown by a compound annual growth rate of 11 percent due to an oversupply of
capital as a result of low interest rates, he noted.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon has also trickled into second-tier cities in neighboring Taipei
County such as Banciao, Hsinchuan and Tucheng, he added. Fueled by incentives
from a government urban renewal program, prices of second-hand houses have also
increased markedly to a point that puts them beyond the reach of salaried
workers, he added.</P>
      <P>To ease the people's misery index for buying houses, several Asian countries
have taken action to cool off the overheated housing market, including China,
which has imposed a real estate transaction tax and is planning to build
affordable public housing, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government has also since last year reduced the amount of bank
loans to 60 percent for house buyers, while the South Korean government has
slashed its bank loan rate to 50 percent for real estate buyers and investors.</P>
      <P>Lee warned that a U-turn will take place in the property and real estate market
and that financial institutions'  operations and Taiwan's economic growth will
be hobbled if the central bank decides to increase key interest rates in an
attempt to contain the bubble.</P>

      <P>Two aboriginal musicians from Taiwan have been enchanting Thai audiences with
their marvelous singing.</P>
      <P>Yun Li-su of the Atayal tribe and Lu Chieh-hsing of the Puyuma tribe joined
Japanese guitarist Ken Ohtake in a performance Wednesday at the Rhythm Of the
Earth World Music Festival in Bangkok, winning resounding acclaim from locals
and foreign tourists alike.</P>
      <P>With her clear, resonant voice, Yun immediately became the focus of the concert
held at the plaza in front of the Central World department store.</P>
      <P>Todd Lavelle, the organizer of the music festival that is now in its fifth year,
said Yun's voice epitomizes the wonder of Taiwan's myriad mountain deities.  Her
lyrical performances  echoed the festival's theme of celebrating ethnic
diversity and borderlessness, as well as supporting minority voices, he added.</P>
      <P>Lu followed Yun performances with passionate readings of tribal love ballads,
which drew enthusiastic responses from the audience.</P>
      <P>At Lavelle's invitation, Lu also performed Atayal folk songs on the jaw harp and
bamboo flute, while Yun presented tribal dances.</P>
      <P>Huang Hung-tuan, the wife of Taiwan's representative to Thailand, attended the
concert and provided an English introduction to the jaw harp, which is made of
bamboo and hemp string and is the oldest musical instrument of Taiwan's
indigenous people.</P>
      <P>Eleven other bands and ensembles from the United States, Israel, Kenya and South
Korea are also taking part in the event, which will run until Feb. 7.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is assisting the Taiwan Innovation
Memory Co. (TIMC) in obtaining private capital, as government investment in the
company has been forbidden  by the legislature,  Economic Affairs Minister Shih
Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry is not playing a dominating role in the matter, since TIMC
is a private company, Shih added.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, TIMC needs capital of NT$11 billion in the initial
stage, 55 percent of which has already been raised.</P>
      <P>As far as the remaining 45 percent is concerned, the MOEA has been helping to
introduce TIMC to potential investors such as financial holding companies, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>TIMC was established in August 2009 as part of a government plan to restructure
the country's DRAM industry.</P>
      <P>However, the Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution in the last legislative
session requiring that the MOEA withdraw an earlier commitment to fund the
company "to prevent a waste of government funds."</P>
      <P>The venture was originally intended to salvage the local DRAM sector, which was
haemmorhaging money during the global financial crisis because of oversupply and
plummeting demand.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government will provide monetary compensation for farmers who have left
their rice paddies fallow to save water due to a looming drought, the Council of
Agriculture's Agriculture and Food Agency said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Farmers who halted irrigation for rice cultivation and converted their farm for
growing drought-reistant green manures will be given the monetary compensation,
the agency added.</P>
      <P>The compensation will be up to NT$80,000 for each hectare of such rice fields,
the agency said.</P>
      <P>To ensure adequate water supplies for household and industrial use, rice
cultivation in parts of southern Taiwan was suspended for the first harvest of
this year, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>The compensation figures were derived from the calculation of 105 percent of the
average income each farming household makes from one hectare of rice paddy last
year, which stood at NT$72,821.</P>
      <P>The amount of compensation marked a significant rise from the NT$60,000 per
hectare offered in 2003, when the average farming household income per hectare
was at merely NT$53,661.</P>
      <P>Farmers who leave their rice paddies fallow, but have not planted other crops
will be granted NT$73,000 for each hectare of the rice field.</P>
      <P>As for farmers who got water themselves for rice irrigation, the government will
not provide monetary compensation for them, but will procure rice from them
according to the stipulated price, according to the agency.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday that they are
studying the issues of allowing Taiwanese people to accept work in China's
public agencies and of allowing Chinese basketball players to play
professionally in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported that day that China's Fujian Province plans to
invest 200 million Chinese yuan (US$29.36 million) to attract overseas talent,
including professionals from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, over the next five to
10 years to work for corporations. It will also recruit Taiwanese to work in
public institutions.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said that according to
the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and
the Mainland Area, Taiwanese are not allowed to work for Chinese political,
government or military institutions without approval from the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators Ting Shou-chung, Chang Hsien-yao
and Huang Chih-hsiung discussed in a public forum the possibility of bringing
Chinese players into Taiwan's professional basketball league, the Super
Basketball League (SBL) to "increase cross-Taiwan Strait basketball exchanges."</P>
      <P>Some of Taiwan's top basketball talent has opted to play in China this year,
attracted by higher salaries, but Chinese players are still banned from playing
in Taiwan, which has created "an imbalance between cross-strait sports
exchanges," Ting said.</P>
      <P>Liu said for his part that one of the important issues in hiring Chinese players
will be how their presence and status in Taiwan is recognized, Liu said, adding
that if they are classed as workers rather than "professional  expertise
exchange  personnel, " a legislative resolution will be required.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait relations have relaxed over the past year, more bilateral
personnel exchanges and movement have been discussed or implemented, including
the enrollment of Chinese students in local universities and further opening
Taiwan to Chinese white-collar workers.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of Chinese basketball players will probably squeeze out job
opportunities for local players, which is why the proposal should be carefully
examined, Liu added.</P>

      <P>The financial situation of the state-run Pension Fund for Defense Personnel is
at stake and it might go bankrupt in a few years, an official of the Ministry of
Civil Service said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The fund recorded NT$8.421 billion (US$263 million) in revenue last year,
outpacing its spending of NT$6.365 billion, the official said. Although spending
did not exceed revenue in 2009 as had been expected, he warned that the
possibility of the fund going bankrupt by 2018 remains and predicted that a
planned voluntary military service system will deal a further blow to the fund.</P>
      <P>As of the end of December last year, the fund had to pay out NT$63.33 for every
NT$100 in revenue, according to a ministry report.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, a voluntary military service system could incite a wave of early
retirements among existing career military personnel, while newly recruited
personnel, after serving only three years, might have paid NT$70,000 to their
retirement fund, but would receive more than NT$100,000 from the pension fund
when quitting under the existing rules, the official explained.</P>
      <P>To keep the pension fund from going broke, the government must increase its
contribution rate of 12 percent to a range between 30 percent and 40 percent on
the military personnel, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Should the contribution rate for individuals be raised, the portion sustained by
the government should also be hiked, which would further worsen its finances, he
went on.</P>
      <P>Over the long term, adjustments in the military's retirement system will be
necessary to improve the situation, the official said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's military personnel on average are entitled to receive
retirement pay 8.29 times the total amount of money they pay into their pension
funds, higher than the 5.97 times for teaching staff and the 5.43 times for
government employees, according to the ministry.</P>

      <P>Public transport accounts for only an average of 13.4 percent of the daily
commutes made by local people on work days, according to the results of a
massive government survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the survey, Taipei City boasted the highest public transport usage rate among
the country's cities and counties, but even there, the rate was just 34.1
percent.</P>
      <P>Up to 72 percent of the respondents said they commute by motorcycle or car.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that only three other  administrative districts,  all of
them located  in northern  Taiwan,  had a higher-than-10-percent public
transport usage rate -- Keelung City at 29.4 percent, Taipei County at 24.9
percent and Taoyuan County at 11.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Chiayi City had the lowest public transport usage rate at 2.5 percent, while the
usage rates in many other areas also fell below 5 percent, such as Yunlin County
at 4.8 percent, Chiayi County at 4.8 percent, Tainan City at 4.7 percent,
Taitung County at 4.2 percent, Penghu County at 4.1 percent and Hualien County
at 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey, the first of its kind, was conducted by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) between Oct. 6 and Dec. 18, 2009 to
explore the country's daily commuting methods.</P>
      <P>A total of 24,943 valid samples were collected in the survey, with at least
1,067 valid replies from each of the 23 cities and counties in Taiwan. The poll
had a confidence level of 95 percent, with a margin of error of 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, motorcycles are the most common commuting vehicle,
accounting for 49 percent. Meanwhile, 23 percent said they commute in their own
cars, 7.2 percent said they walk and 5.9 percent said they travel by bicycle.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that more women than men use public transport for the daily
commute -- 17 percent compared to 9.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The reasons given by respondents for their reluctance to use public transport
were the convenience of personal private transport, the fact that public
transport stations are too far away, or the destination of their daily commute
is very close to the point of departure.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A middleman who embezzled US$29.8 million from the Taiwanese government defended
himself via video from the United States Thursday as the High Court of Singapore
continued a hearing in a lawsuit brought by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) to recover the money.</P>
      <P>The ministry is trying to recover the money that was remitted to Ching Chi-ju's
account in a Singapore bank in September 2006 for the purpose of making
arrangements  for the opening of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Papua
New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The diplomatic relations deal fell through after the money was wired to Ching,
but Ching and another middleman, Wu Shih-Tsai, refused to return the funds to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu was arrested by the Taiwanese authorities when the scandal came to light at
the end of President Chen Shui-bian's second term, but Ching managed to flee to
the U.S.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the Singapore court, Ching claimed that part of the money was his
remuneration for being a secret emissary for Taiwan in negotiations with Chinese
officials during the years from 1995 to 2006.</P>
      <P>He said that according to an agreement he reached with Chiou I-jen, then
secretary-general of the National Security Council, only US$10 million would be
used as aid for Papua New Guinea, US$10 million would be given to him and Wu for
making the arrangements, and the remaining US$10 million would be his
remuneration for working as a secret emissary for former presidents Lee Teng-hui
and Chen.</P>
      <P>He said that as a secret emissary, he twice helped reduce tension between Taiwan
and China -- first in August 2002, when Chen's statement of "one country on each
side of the Taiwan Strait" outraged Beijing and later in 2006 when Chen again
irritated Beijing with independence-leaning comments.</P>
      <P>However, MOFA attorney Loo Chun-chao rebutted Ching's claims, saying that
ministry personnel involved in the case all rebutted Ching's claims and none of
the documentary evidence presented by Ching could be proved genuine.</P>
      <P>Former Foreign Minister James Huang, who appeared in court Monday to give
witness testimony, said the entire US$30 million was intended solely for
pursuing full diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea and that he was not
aware of any emissary role played by Ching.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou met former Vice President Annette Lu Thursday for an
interview with the media organization she founded.</P>
      <P>Lu, founder of Formosa Media, described the meeting as a "national affairs
dialogue, " but the Presidential Office said it was just a media interview.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said the 75-minute interview proceeded
"in a good and natural atmosphere" and that the Presidential Office would
release the full video footage of the interview later in the evening after
obtaining approval from Formosa Media.</P>
      <P>Lu, who served as vice president between 2000 and 20008, raised such issues as
whether the "(Taiwan-China) 1992 consensus" actually exists, the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement that Taiwan is set to sign with China
in the first half of this year and whether Ma is considering convening a
national affairs conference.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Ma shunned none of the questions, although he and Lu
disagreed on some of the issues, especially the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to a tacit agreement that both Taiwan and China
accept the "one China"  principle,  with respective interpretations on the
definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>It serves as the basis for the resumption of cross-strait negotiations after a
nearly 10-year hiatus following Ma's assumption of the presidency in May 2008.</P>
      <P>However, the controversy surrounding the consensus has never been resolved, as
China only stresses the "one China principle", while Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang
prefers the right to define the meaning of "one China." The opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) holds the viewpoint that there is in fact no
"1992 consensus" at all.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Presidential Office would be happy to see a similar dialogue
between Ma and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.</P>

      <P>Petrochemical giant the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) plans to invest NT$650
billion (US$20.31 billion) in several projects this year in an attempt to boost
its growth amid rising hopes of an economic revival this year,  Chairman Lee
Chih-tsuen of Formosa Plastics Corp.,  a FPG subsidiary, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Of the total amount, NT$280 billion will be used for the fifth phase of the
group's the sixth naphtha cracking plant project, which is still under
environmental assessment, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Another NT$280 billion will be invested in the construction of a major steel
mill in Vietnam's Ha Tinh Province, for which ground breaking is expected in
April, Lee added.</P>
      <P>The group generated a combined turnover of NT$1.75 trillion last year, a decline
of 19 percent from 2008.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Corp. recorded a turnover of NT$156 billion, representing a
fall of 13.8 percent year-on-year due to a drop in the prices of petrochemical
raw materials following the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Expressing optimism over the outlook for this year, Lee said that as China's
Ministry of Commerce has been promoting construction in rural areas, " sales of
the group's PVC, 60 percent of which is used for construction, are expected to
increase significantly this year.</P>
      <P>The global PVC production capacity was about 4.5 million tons last year and is
expected to drop to 4 million tons this year because of shortages of natural gas
in the Middle East that could send the prices of PVC and polypropylene higher,
according to Lee.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is assisting the Taiwan Innovation
Memory Co. (TIMC) in obtaining private capital, as government investment in the
company has been forbidden  by the legislature,  Economic Affairs Minister Shih
Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry is not playing a dominating role in the matter, since TIMC
is a private company, Shih added.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, TIMC needs capital of NT$11 billion in the initial
stage, 55 percent of which has already been raised.</P>
      <P>As far as the remaining 45 percent is concerned, the MOEA has been helping to
introduce TIMC to potential investors such as financial holding companies, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>TIMC was established in August 2009 as part of a government plan to restructure
the country's DRAM industry.</P>
      <P>However, the Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution in the last legislative
session requiring that the MOEA withdraw an earlier commitment to fund the
company "to prevent a waste of government funds."</P>
      <P>The venture was originally intended to salvage the local DRAM sector, which was
haemmorhaging money during the global financial crisis because of oversupply and
plummeting demand.</P>
      <P>However, doubts mounted about the need for the venture once the market began
picking up again.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government will provide monetary compensation for farmers who have left
their rice paddies fallow to save water due to a looming drought, the Council of
Agriculture's Agriculture and Food Agency said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Farmers who halted irrigation for rice cultivation and converted their farm for
growing drought-reistant green manures will be given the monetary compensation,
the agency added.</P>
      <P>The compensation will be up to NT$80,000 for each hectare of such rice fields,
the agency said.</P>
      <P>To ensure adequate water supplies for household and industrial use, rice
cultivation in parts of southern Taiwan was suspended for the first harvest of
this year, according to the agency.</P>
      <P>The compensation figures were derived from the calculation of 105 percent of the
average income each farming household makes from one hectare of rice paddy last
year, which stood at NT$72,821.</P>
      <P>The amount of compensation marked a significant rise from the NT$60,000 per
hectare offered in 2003, when the average farming household income per hectare
was at merely NT$53,661.</P>
      <P>Farmers who leave their rice paddies fallow, but have not planted other crops
will be granted NT$73,000 for each hectare of the rice field.</P>
      <P>As for farmers who got water themselves for rice irrigation, the government will
not provide monetary compensation for them, but will procure rice from them
according to the stipulated price, according to the agency.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday that they are
studying the issues of allowing Taiwanese people to accept work in China's
public agencies and of allowing Chinese basketball players to play
professionally in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported that day that China's Fujian Province plans to
invest 200 million Chinese yuan (US$29.36 million) to attract overseas talent,
including professionals from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, over the next five to
10 years to work for corporations. It will also recruit Taiwanese to work in
public institutions.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said that according to
the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and
the Mainland Area, Taiwanese are not allowed to work for Chinese political,
government or military institutions without approval from the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators Ting Shou-chung, Chang Hsien-yao
and Huang Chih-hsiung discussed in a public forum the possibility of bringing
Chinese players into Taiwan's professional basketball league, the Super
Basketball League (SBL) to "increase cross-Taiwan Strait basketball exchanges."</P>
      <P>Some of Taiwan's top basketball talent has opted to play in China this year,
attracted by higher salaries, but Chinese players are still banned from playing
in Taiwan, which has created "an imbalance between cross-strait sports
exchanges," Ting said.</P>
      <P>Liu said for his part that one of the important issues in hiring Chinese players
will be how their presence and status in Taiwan is recognized, Liu said, adding
that if they are classed as workers rather than "professional  expertise
exchange  personnel, " a legislative resolution will be required.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait relations have relaxed over the past year, more bilateral
personnel exchanges and movement have been discussed or implemented, including
the enrollment of Chinese students in local universities and further opening
Taiwan to Chinese white-collar workers.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of Chinese basketball players will probably squeeze out job
opportunities for local players, which is why the proposal should be carefully
examined, Liu added.</P>

      <P>The financial situation of the state-run Pension Fund for Defense Personnel is
at stake and it might go bankrupt in a few years, an official of the Ministry of
Civil Service said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The fund recorded NT$8.421 billion (US$263 million) in revenue last year,
outpacing its spending of NT$6.365 billion, the official said. Although spending
did not exceed revenue in 2009 as had been expected, he warned that the
possibility of the fund going bankrupt by 2018 remains and predicted that a
planned voluntary military service system will deal a further blow to the fund.</P>
      <P>As of the end of December last year, the fund had to pay out NT$63.33 for every
NT$100 in revenue, according to a ministry report.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, a voluntary military service system could incite a wave of early
retirements among existing career military personnel, while newly recruited
personnel, after serving only three years, might have paid NT$70,000 to their
retirement fund, but would receive more than NT$100,000 from the pension fund
when quitting under the existing rules, the official explained.</P>
      <P>To keep the pension fund from going broke, the government must increase its
contribution rate of 12 percent to a range between 30 percent and 40 percent on
the military personnel, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Should the contribution rate for individuals be raised, the portion sustained by
the government should also be hiked, which would further worsen its finances, he
went on.</P>
      <P>Over the long term, adjustments in the military's retirement system will be
necessary to improve the situation, the official said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's military personnel on average are entitled to receive
retirement pay 8.29 times the total amount of money they pay into their pension
funds, higher than the 5.97 times for teaching staff and the 5.43 times for
government employees, according to the ministry.</P>

      <P>According to media reports, hearing-impaired Taiwanese physicist Cheng Yao, who

      <P>Public transport accounts for only an average of 13.4 percent of the daily
commutes made by local people on work days, according to the results of a
massive government survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the survey, Taipei City boasted the highest public transport usage rate among
the country's cities and counties, but even there, the rate was just 34.1
percent.</P>
      <P>Up to 72 percent of the respondents said they commute by motorcycle or car.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that only three other  administrative districts,  all of
them located  in northern  Taiwan,  had a higher-than-10-percent public
transport usage rate -- Keelung City at 29.4 percent, Taipei County at 24.9
percent and Taoyuan County at 11.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Chiayi City had the lowest public transport usage rate at 2.5 percent, while the
usage rates in many other areas also fell below 5 percent, such as Yunlin County
at 4.8 percent, Chiayi County at 4.8 percent, Tainan City at 4.7 percent,
Taitung County at 4.2 percent, Penghu County at 4.1 percent and Hualien County
at 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey, the first of its kind, was conducted by the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) between Oct. 6 and Dec. 18, 2009 to
explore the country's daily commuting methods.</P>
      <P>A total of 24,943 valid samples were collected in the survey, with at least
1,067 valid replies from each of the 23 cities and counties in Taiwan. The poll
had a confidence level of 95 percent, with a margin of error of 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, motorcycles are the most common commuting vehicle,
accounting for 49 percent. Meanwhile, 23 percent said they commute in their own
cars, 7.2 percent said they walk and 5.9 percent said they travel by bicycle.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that more women than men use public transport for the daily
commute -- 17 percent compared to 9.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The reasons given by respondents for their reluctance to use public transport
were the convenience of personal private transport, the fact that public
transport stations are too far away, or the destination of their daily commute
is very close to the point of departure.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A middleman who embezzled US$29.8 million from the Taiwanese government defended
himself via video from the United States Thursday as the High Court of Singapore
continued a hearing in a lawsuit brought by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) to recover the money.</P>
      <P>The ministry is trying to recover the money that was remitted to Ching Chi-ju's
account in a Singapore bank in September 2006 for the purpose of making
arrangements  for the opening of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Papua
New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The diplomatic relations deal fell through after the money was wired to Ching,
but Ching and another middleman, Wu Shih-Tsai, refused to return the funds to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu was arrested by the Taiwanese authorities when the scandal came to light at
the end of President Chen Shui-bian's second term, but Ching managed to flee to
the U.S.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the Singapore court, Ching claimed that part of the money was his
remuneration for being a secret emissary for Taiwan in negotiations with Chinese
officials during the years from 1995 to 2006.</P>
      <P>He said that according to an agreement he reached with Chiou I-jen, then
secretary-general of the National Security Council, only US$10 million would be
used as aid for Papua New Guinea, US$10 million would be given to him and Wu for
making the arrangements, and the remaining US$10 million would be his
remuneration for working as a secret emissary for former presidents Lee Teng-hui
and Chen.</P>
      <P>He said that as a secret emissary, he twice helped reduce tension between Taiwan
and China -- first in August 2002, when Chen's statement of "one country on each
side of the Taiwan Strait" outraged Beijing and later in 2006 when Chen again
irritated Beijing with independence-leaning comments.</P>
      <P>However, MOFA attorney Loo Chun-chao rebutted Ching's claims, saying that
ministry personnel involved in the case all rebutted Ching's claims and none of
the documentary evidence presented by Ching could be proved genuine.</P>
      <P>Former Foreign Minister James Huang, who appeared in court Monday to give
witness testimony, said the entire US$30 million was intended solely for
pursuing full diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea and that he was not
aware of any emissary role played by Ching.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou met former Vice President Annette Lu Thursday for an
interview with the media organization she founded.</P>
      <P>Lu, founder of Formosa Media, described the meeting as a "national affairs
dialogue, " but the Presidential Office said it was just a media interview.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said the 75-minute interview proceeded
"in a good and natural atmosphere" and that the Presidential Office would
release the full video footage of the interview later in the evening after
obtaining approval from Formosa Media.</P>
      <P>Lu, who served as vice president between 2000 and 20008, raised such issues as
whether the "(Taiwan-China) 1992 consensus" actually exists, the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement that Taiwan is set to sign with China
in the first half of this year and whether Ma is considering convening a
national affairs conference.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Ma shunned none of the questions, although he and Lu
disagreed on some of the issues, especially the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to a tacit agreement that both Taiwan and China
accept the "one China"  principle,  with respective interpretations on the
definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>It serves as the basis for the resumption of cross-strait negotiations after a
nearly 10-year hiatus following Ma's assumption of the presidency in May 2008.</P>
      <P>However, the controversy surrounding the consensus has never been resolved, as
China only stresses the "one China principle", while Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang
prefers the right to define the meaning of "one China." The opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) holds the viewpoint that there is in fact no
"1992 consensus" at all.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Presidential Office would be happy to see a similar dialogue
between Ma and DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.</P>

      <P>Another NT$280 billion will be invested in the construction of a major steel
mill in Vietnam's Ha Tinh Province, for which ground breaking is expected in

      <P>Formosa Plastics Corp. recorded a turnover of NT$156 billion, representing a

      <P>The global PVC production capacity was about 4.5 million tons last year and is
expected to drop to 4 million tons this year because of shortages of natural gas

    <HEADLINE>U.S.-China spat would not turn uncontrollable: former premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 4 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington and Beijing may have given each other a hard time over a host of
disputes, including arms sales to Taiwan, the Google controversy and the Dalai
Lama, but such spats would not escalate to an uncontrollable, a senior adviser
to President Ma Ying-jeou said here Thursday.</P>
      <P>On the U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, Liu Chao-hsiuan, who is leading a Taiwan
delegation to attend the U.S. National Prayer Breakfast (NPB) Feb. 3-5, said
there is good news and bad news. The bad news is that the United States and
China may get tougher with each other over the arms sales plan, although it
still remains to be seen how that would unfold, he said.</P>
      <P>The good news is that both Beijing and Washington have said they have no wish to
see tensions mounting to an uncontrollable level and both sides have at least
exercised self-restraint, said Liu, who served as Taiwan's premier from May 2008
to September 2009.</P>
      <P>Liu, along with ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yi-shih and VIA Technologies
and HTC chairwoman Cher Wang, attended the 2010 NPB in Washington, D.C. Thursday
morning.</P>
      <P>Before and after the NPB, the Taiwan delegation met with U.S. officials, members
of Congress and experts from U.S. think tanks to exchange views on issues of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>On the controversy over U.S. beef exports to Taiwan, the three delegates told
their U.S. hosts that the beef issue should not be dealt with emotionally,
according to Liu.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, the decision by Taiwan's legislature to pass an
amendment to ban U.S. beef offal and ground beef from entering Taiwan was in
line with the people's will.</P>
      <P>"Our explanation of the issue has been acknowledged by some of our U.S. hosts,"
Liu told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>However,  it would be reasonable to assume that the beef controversy could
undermine any plans by the U.S. to grant visa free treatment to Taiwanese
visitors, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: Recipe for riots</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/05/10  11:28:42
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Wednesday that his ministry is studying the
possibility of introducing absentee voting, and will start with a transfer
system that will allow eligible voters cast their ballots in the constituencies
where they work rather than in area of their household registrations.</P>
      <P>Devising an absentee ballot system that would allow voting by Taiwan businessmen
operating in China and by other Taiwanese abroad is more difficult and will
require further discussions, he said.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) immediately voiced opposition
to the proposal.</P>
      <P>We are in favor of the transfer system to facilitate voters in the country and
to reflect the true public will, but we are strongly opposed to absentee voting
by Taiwan businessmen operating in China and by other emigrants.</P>
      <P>China has been known to influence the political views of Taiwan businessmen and
it is a country that rigorously monitors all types of communications. If
absentee voting is allowed, Taiwan businessmen would vote under circumstances of
fear and restriction of free will.</P>
      <P>China would naturally want the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to win and absentee
voting by Taiwan businessmen operating in China will be favorable to the KMT.</P>
      <P>The KMT also enjoys other unfair advantages -- it has a bigger party staff, more
party assets and more media affiliations.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan businessmen operating in China are allowed to cast absentee votes, it
will be tantamount to open interference by China in Taiwan's internal affairs,
through campaigning for the KMT. The elections will therefore lack legitimacy.</P>
      <P>If the Interior Ministry dares to implement such a measure, it is sure to spark
riots and revolution. (Feb. 5, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Former distinguished lawmaker convicted of fraud</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/05/10  12:34:33
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Legislator Lee Ching-an was sentenced Thursday by the Taipei District
Court to two years in prison for fraud in connection with her dual citizenship
status.</P>
      <P>The court has also ruled that the sentence cannot be suspended.</P>
      <P>Lee was indicted Sept. 16,  2009 for concealing her dual citizenship status and
defrauding the public coffers of over NT$100 million in salary as a Taipei City
councilor between 1994 and 1998 and as a Kuomintang legislator from 1999 to
2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality  Act stipulates  that holders of dual citizenship must
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office.</P>
      <P>Lee had been in public office for some 14 years before it was discovered in
March 2008 that she had never relinquished her U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>It is up to the Taipei City Council and Legislative Yuan to decide whether or
not to file a civil suit against Lee to recover the amount she was paid during
her perid of public service.</P>
      <P>Lee was seen as a star legislator because of her distinguished service for three
consecutive terms between 1999 and 2008. She resigned in January 2009, a few
months into her fourth term, amid public pressure.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the heaviest blow to Lee is not the loss of her legislative
seat, but rather the court's description of her as a "deceiver, " "a fraud" and
a "dishonest" person, which completely demolished the reputation she had earned
during her two decades of public service.</P>
      <P>"Honesty and uprightness" were once her strongest attributes in elections, and
won her the solid endorsement of most pan-blue bigwigs, including Lien Chan, Wu
Poh-hsiung and Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the case, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator
Lee Chun-yee said that justice had come too late.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus has demanded that Lee refund all her pay as a
legislator from 1999 to 2009 because she was holding U.S. citizenship throughout
that period. (Feb. 5, 2010)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Lee's lawyer Chuang Hsiu-ming said that they will appeal the ruling because his
client did not have the slightest intention of bilking the public coffers.</P>
      <P>Legal experts have said that the question of whether Lee should be made to
refund her salary should be decided by the city council and the legislature.</P>
      <P>However, given that Lee had to pay her assistants during her period of public
service, it would not be that simple to have her refund her salary, the experts
said. (Feb. 5, 2010)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers denounced the court for not convicting Lee on corruption charges
because it had neglected to look at the truth.</P>
      <P>Although the court ruled that the NT$102.77 million Lee obtained in salary from
1994-2008 as city and legislator was "illegal income," the amount is not
reclaimable because she was not convicted on corruption charges. (Feb. 5, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu interviewed President Ma Ying-jeou on Feb. 4
for the Formosa Weekly which she founded.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of local media coverage of the event: United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The 75-minute interview was more a political debate than an interview, with Ma
gaining the upper hand and Lu having to concede that "you really are eloquent
today."</P>
      <P>However Lu said at a news conference afterward that she didn't agree with all of
Ma's views, but could not chip in with her own opinions. "I gave Ma a chance to
air his views fully, " she said, noting that it was not a debate.</P>
      <P>Although Lu had promised to report the interview accurately, the Presidential
Office later released video footage of the full interview rather than a three-
minute preview as Lu's aide has requested.</P>
      <P>The interview began with Lu questioning the existence of the 1992 Consensus,
which refers to the recognition by Taiwan and China that there is but "one
China, " but each side is free to interpret the definition of the term as they
see fit.</P>
      <P>Citing a telephone conversation between Chinese leader Hu Jintao and former U.S.
President George Bush, Ma confirmed the existence of the 1992 Consensus, adding
that dialogue between Taiwan and China could not have resumed without the
consensus.</P>
      <P>As to Lu's  question  on Taiwan's  status,  Ma said  his administration adheres
to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area, which was enacted during President Lee Teng-hui's term
and was also adhered to by President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Ma rejected Lu's request for Taiwan to negotiate a trade pact with China only
after Beijing promises  not to block similar negotiations between Taiwan with
other countries, saying that it is unbecoming for a sovereignty to ask another
state's permission to act.</P>
      <P>The president also defended his efforts to seek a diplomatic truce with China,
saying that his administration has not lost any allies to date, while the
preceding DPP government lost nine allies and gained three.</P>
      <P>Lu said this is because Beijing has suddenly realized that the diplomatic tug of
war serves no interest. Ma snapped back with the question of why China had not
come to that realization when the DPP was in power.(Feb. 5, 2010) China Times:</P>
      <P>The only point that both Ma and Lu agreed on is the need for a national
conference between the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has written to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen asking for a meeting to
exchange views on national policy, "but she didn't bother to reply. I don't
blame her for not responding, because I understand some of her feelings," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lu's interview with Ma has been criticized by DPP heavyweights, with Chen Chi-
mai, former vice secretary-general of the Presidential Office, saying that Lu
had debased herself by meeting Ma as a reporter rather than a former vice
president.</P>
      <P>Lu dismissed the criticism, saying that she met Ma in her capacity as publisher
of Formosa Weekly and former vice president.</P>
      <P>Her stance was supported by the fact that during the interview Ma addressed her
as vice president.</P>
      <P>Ma was obviously on edge at the start of the interview, but spoke fluently and
confidently as it progressed, and toward the end he dominated the discussion.</P>

      <P>A renowned husband-and-wife piano duo, Rolf-Peter Wille and Lina Yeh of Taiwan,
has been invited by the Vatican to perform at the 25th founding anniversary
celebrations of the Pontifical Council for Health Care Workers, a diplomatic
source said Friday.</P>
      <P>Larry Yu-yuan Wang, Taiwan's ambassador to the Holy See, said he was asked by
the council's chairman Zygmunt Zimowski to invite Wille and Yeh as guest
performers at the event.</P>
      <P>Wang said the invitation underlines the Holy See's recognition of Taiwan's
musicians and marks the first time that musicians from Taiwan will perform in
Vatican City.</P>
      <P>The duo is expected to perform music by Bach, Brahms, Edvard Grieg and Francis
Poulenc at the function. Yeh also plans to play pieces by renowned Taiwanese
composer Chen Yang, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Yeh, born in the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung, was a child prodigy who
went on to study at the Mozart Academy in Salzburg, Austria, and to later learn
from world-class masters such as Hans Leygraf, Kurt Leimer and Jacob Lateiner.</P>
      <P>Wille is a German who came to Taiwan at the age of 23 to teach, soon after he
graduated from Staatlich Hochschule Fur Musik Hannover. He went on to obtain a
doctorate in piano performance at the Manhattan School of Music, New York.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News : Why bother to implement a luxury house tax</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/05/10  15:06:37
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City has beat the Ministry of Finance to the punch by introducing
what it called a luxury housing tax.</P>
      <P>According to the city government, the tax is part of its efforts to address the
country's top 10 public grievances, of which the main one is skyrocketing
housing prices.</P>
      <P>It is not a new tax, but rather an increase of existing house tax rates.</P>
      <P>Currently, house taxes are calculated according to a universal percentage of the
house value as determined by the local governments, rather than on market value,
because of the difficulty in fixing the market price.</P>
      <P>Not wanting to impose too heavy a tax burden on home owners, local governments
usually value residential properties below the market price, which leads to a
problem of similar taxes for ordinary and luxury homes.</P>
      <P>However there are three problems with the proposed luxury housing tax:</P>
      <P>First, the definition of luxury housing is too vague. The criteria used by
Taipei City depends heavily on the subjective assessment of tax collectors.</P>
      <P>Also it is widely perceived that luxury residences exist only in the
metropolises of Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung, which hinders efforts elsewhere
to narrow the gap between market prices and their assessed values.</P>
      <P>Second, the luxury tax is not an effective means of controlling rising housing
prices. Housing tax rates are usually not very high, and the tax agencies are
not likely to raise their value assessments to the level of the market prices,
therefore the new tax would not effectively drive down housing prices.</P>
      <P>Third, the luxury tax is not consistent with the goal of achieving parity in the
taxation system. Houses are usually bought with personal post-tax incomes, and
their owners have to pay various taxes in the process of acquiring,
transferring, or bequeathing the properties. Imposing a special tax on luxury
houses would only increase public hostility toward the rich, which would not
serve the national interest. (Feb. 5, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will decide after the final court ruling whether a former
lawmaker, who was convicted of fraud in a case involving dual citizenship
status, should return her aggregate salary, the legislative speaker said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng stressed that the Legislative Yuan will handle the case based on
the law and will make a decision unclouded by personal sympathy.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court on Thursday sentenced former Legislator Lee Ching-an,
also known as Diane Lee, to two years in prison for fraud. Lee was convicted on
charges related to holding U.S. citizenship while serving as a Taipei city
councilor from 1994 to 1998 and a Kuomintang legislator from 1999 to 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality  Act stipulates  that holders of dual citizenship must
surrender their foreign citizenship before assuming public office.</P>
      <P>Lee had been in public office for some 14 years before it was discovered in
March 2008 that she had never relinquished her U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>The district court also ruled that Lee's sentence cannot be suspended, but it
can be appealed.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that Thursday's ruling was made in a criminal case, but
possible civil action had not yet been resolved.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will take action based on the law as soon as the final
court ruling is made, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the legislature's Research Bureau, the Taipei district prosecutors
office indicted Lee on charges of forgery and fraud.</P>
      <P>On the charge of fraud, the court is empowered to declare in the final ruling
that Lee must refund all of her pay for the entire period of her public service,
the bureau said.</P>
      <P>If the court does not make such a ruling, it will be up to the legislature,
which paid Lee's salary, to decide whether or not to file a civil suit against
Lee to recoup the funds, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. unveiled a US$6.4 billion arms package for Taiwan last week, to China's
irritation, and U.S. President Barack Obama said he would meet with Tibetan
spiritual leader the Dala Lama at the end of this month during the later's visit
to Washington.</P>
      <P>At the peak of the financial crisis last year, Washington was pursuing a policy
of conciliation with China, but this year, the Obama administration seems ready
to change tack.</P>
      <P>Based on these frictions and the disputes over trade and the value of the
Chinese yuan, Chinese political analysts have predicted that strategic
competition will replace strategic cooperation between Beijing and Washington.</P>
      <P>U.S. think tanks have floated similar views, forecasting that relations between
Beijing and Washington in 2010 will not progress as well as in the previous
year.</P>
      <P>China owes much of its peaceful rise to its huge trade surplus with the U. S.
Competition with the U.S. will inevitably dampen China's economic growth and
drive down its employment rate and domestic consumption.</P>
      <P>China's threat to boycott U.S. firms that sell arms to Taiwan is likely to be
nothing but rhetoric because these American firms have markets other than China.</P>
      <P>However, China could hold Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland hostage
and compel Taiwan to acknowledge the one-China principle on Beijing's terms.</P>
      <P>We are not concerned about the strife between Beijing and Washington, as long as
Taipei is not drawn into it. But the risk of Taiwan's involvement would become
real if President Ma Ying-jeou achieves economic integration with China through
his proposed trade pact.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should plant itself firmly in the democracy camp rather than on the anti-
democracy side. (Feb. 5, 2010)</P>

      <P>Following overnight heavy losses on Wall Street, Taiwan's share prices plunged
4.29 percent Friday to finish below 7,300, its lowest level since Nov. 2, 2009.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, lost 324.21 points to close at
7,217.83.</P>
      <P>At the opening of the trading session, the Taiex lost 218.88 points, dropping to
7,323.16 and fluctuated between a high of 7,352.98 and a low of 7,196.39 during
the day's trading.</P>
      <P>A total of 4.61 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$121.69
billion (US$3.80 billion).</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories lost ground, with construction stocks dropping
the steepest, at 6.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Cement shares lost 6 percent, textile issues fell 5.9 percent, and paper and
pulp stocks dipped 5.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Banking and financial stocks dropped 5.5 percent, foodstuff shares shed 4.5
percent, machinery and electronics shares lost 4.4 percent, and plastics and
chemicals issues fell 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The sharp plunge in such shares was attributed partly to the fact that a ruling
by the economics ministry earlier in the week canceled six items on Pacific
Distribution Investment's business registration, including three capital
increases on behalf of the Far Eastern Group.</P>
      <P>The ministry's ruling cast doubts on the Far Eastern Group's control over the
popular Sogo department stores.</P>
      <P>The ruling has sent Far Eastern Group shares into a downward spiral over several

NT$1.83 billion by investment trust firms and NT$2.29 billion by securities

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of people newly diagnosed with cancer edged higher in 2007, with
colorectal cancer remaining the most common form of the disease, ahead of liver
cancer, according to a Department of Health report issued Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recorded 75,769 new cancer cases in 2007, 3.4 percent more than in 2006,
said Chiou Shu-ti, director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion.</P>
      <P>Those figures equate to a new cancer patient being diagnosed roughly every 7
minutes in 2007, slightly faster than every 7 minutes and 10 seconds in the
previous year, when 73,293 new cases were recorded, Chiou said.</P>
      <P>The statistics are available only up through 2007 because the Department of
Health needs time to collect raw cancer data from local hospitals and then
cross-check it to be sure patients are not counted twice (if, for example, they
have been to more than one hospital for a diagnosis) or misidentified.</P>
      <P>In the latest version of the DOH annual report on cancer, colorectal cancer
remained the most diagnosed type of cancer in 2007 after displacing liver cancer
as the most common form of the disease in 2006.</P>
      <P>After colorectal  cancer and liver cancer,  the next most frequently diagnosed
forms of the disease in 2007 were lung cancer, breast cancer and oral cancer.</P>
      <P>These five types accounted for 56 percent of all new cancer patients in the
country for the year.</P>
      <P>The risk of cancer among men was 1.4 times higher than among women in Taiwan,
Chiou said.</P>
      <P>Because of the largely male habits of smoking and chewing betel nuts, the age-
adjusted incidence rates of esophageal cancer and oral cancer among men were
12.7 times and 11.3 times higher respectively than among women in 2007, Chiou
added.</P>
      <P>According to Kung Hsien-lan, a section chief with the Cancer Control and
Prevention Division, the incidence of breast cancer and thyroid gland cancer
increased the most among Taiwanese women. Both diseases were related to
imbalances in female sex hormones, she said.</P>
      <P>High fat diets and high caloric intakes, which disturb female sex hormones, have
raised the risk of Taiwanese women being afflicted with cancer, Kung said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she noted, Taiwanese women were found to develop breast cancer an
average 10 years earlier than their Western counterparts.</P>
      <P>She attributed the increased prevalence of colorectal cancer among Taiwan's
people to increasingly unhealthy dietary habits, such as the high consumption of
red meat and fat and a low fiber intake.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both Chiou and Kung said that the Bureau of Health Promotion will
expand its free early cancer detection program by offering more free tests --
mammography screening for breast cancer, Pap smear tests for cervical cancer,
taking samples of a patient's mucous membrane for oral cancer, and fecal occult
blood tests for colorectal cancer.</P>
      <P>Chiou estimates that the program will help detect an additional 10,000 new
cancer cases this year, and those identified as having the disease will be given
immediate medical attention.</P>

      <P>At the request of Premier Wu Den-yih, the Ministry of the Interior recently came
up with a plan to build 4,000 low-cost apartments near the site of a proposed
rapid transit system station in Linko, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The housing project will be linked to the development of an industrial zone.</P>
      <P>This plan is similar to the successful "new towns" in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of the population in Singapore live in these new towns that
boast sport centers, schools, supermarkets, a shopping street, bus stations and
rapid transit system stations.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior's plan has a good chance of success because of the
proposed location near a rapid transit system station, which was one of the
prerequisites for Singapore's new towns.</P>
      <P>Taiwan tried three decades ago to adopt Singapore's new town idea, but the
government housing projects turned into slums because of shoddy construction
work and ill-conceived planning.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will encourage local universities to seek out and expand exchanges with
their U.S. counterparts in the hope of giving Taiwan a voice in public policy
debates in the United States, Minister of Education Wu Ching-ji said Friday.</P>
      <P>The government will encourage cooperation and exchanges with prestigious U.S.
schools through its five-year, NT$50 billion program to help local universities
transform themselves into among the world's elite, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Aside from that funding, the ministry hopes that more funds will be allocated to
establish educational foundations or research centers at renowned U.S. schools
at which Taiwanese students can continue their education.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese students can graduate from highly reputed schools in the U.S., they
will have a better chance of finding a good job and be better placed to speak
for Taiwan there, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to the minister, Beijing has spent a great deal of money over the past
decade in forging cooperative relationships with reputed U.S. schools like those
in the Ivy League.</P>
      <P>Through the ties, many Chinese students have gained enrollment in premier U.S.
schools, but the number of Taiwanese students studying at those same
universities has been on the decline, and top schools are now less likely to
offer scholarships to students from Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"If we do not have footholds at the top schools, there will be only Chinese
voices in public hearings in the U.S. in the future, " he explained.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that those studying in the U.S. on the recommendation of the local
schools subsidized by the government's elite university development program are
not obliged to return to Taiwan for work after graduation.</P>

      <P>Responding to a warning that the state-run Pension Fund for Defense Personnel
might go bankrupt in a few years, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Friday it is considering a number of measures, to prevent the situation from
deteriorating further.</P>
      <P>They include offering incentives to military personnel to extend their careers
rather than taking retirement.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Civil Service (MCS) warned Friday that the pension fund's
financial situation was precarious, even though expectations that disbursements
would exceed revenues for the first time in 2009 did not materialize.</P>
      <P>The MND warned that the fund could still go bankrupt by 2018 and predicted that
a planned voluntary military service system will deal it a further blow.</P>
      <P>The ministry attributed the pension fund's financial difficulties to personnel
streamlining programs implemented in recent years that have cut Taiwan's
military personnel from 452,000 people to the current level of 275,000.</P>
      <P>The large number of retired personnel has placed a heavy burden on the pension
fund, the ministry said, with 80 percent of the fund's revenues over the past
three years being paid out in retirement benefits.</P>
      <P>The situation leaves little cushion for the future, especially when if existing
career military personnel retire in waves when the voluntary military service
system takes effect.</P>
      <P>Also, under existing rules, newly recruited servicemen could receive NT$100,000
in benefits if they quit after three years despite having paid only NT$70,000
into the fund over that time, MCS officials said.</P>
      <P>Over the long term, adjustments in the military's retirement system will be
necessary to improve the pension fund's finances, they contended.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's military personnel can receive retirement benefits that are
8.29 times the amount they paid into their pension fund, far higher than the
5.97 times for teachers and the 5.43 times for government employees, according
to the MCS report.</P>

      <P>Singapore's trade representative to Taiwan visited Kinmen Friday to provide the
water-strapped island county his country's successful experience in water
resources development, especially in water reclamation.</P>
      <P>The visit by Stanley Loh came seven months after President Ma Ying-jeou
proposed  that Kinmen learn from Singapore's  water reclamation model to solve
the island's perennial water shortages.</P>
      <P>During the trip, Loh inspected Kinmen's sea water desalination plant and water
purification and sewage treatment facilities and held discussions with Kinmen
County government officials.</P>
      <P>He also presented Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Wo-shi with bottled reclaimed
drinking water from Singapore.</P>
      <P>Loh noted that Singapore has been facing a lack of water resources since it
achieved independence from Malaysia in 1965.</P>
      <P>The country now relies on rainwater collection, water imports from Malaysia, sea
water desalination and water reclamation as its major sources of the precious
resource, he said.</P>
      <P>Singapore built is first water reclamation plant in 2002 and will be completing
the fifth such facility later this year, when recycled water will meet 30
percent of the country's total demand, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Loh, the reclamation process involves purifying used water with
advanced membrane technology, and the quality of the reclaimed water exceeds the
criteria set by the World Health Organization for drinking water.</P>
      <P>Minerals are added into the pure water for drinking purposes. Loh said everyone
who has visited Singapore has also drunk the reclaimed water, called NEWater,
including leaders who took part in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
held late last year in the city state.</P>

      <P>recently fine tuned its local branch leadership and hired a human resource
expert, with the goal of winning the year-end elections in five municipalities.</P>
      <P>But we believe the most important factor is still whether the party's nominees
can inspire confidence at the grassroots level. If they have good images and
governing ability, it will be an easy task to garner support for them.</P>
      <P>The KMT has hired an outsider to help with its human resource assessment and to
rebuild an election volunteer network. Looking back on past elections, we can
see that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , whether in government or
opposition, has always been better than the KMT at deploying volunteers. The DPP
mobilizes volunteers at election time and disbands them after, which leaves the
party with no personnel burden.</P>
      <P>The KMT has tried to emulate the DPP, but has never learned the process well.</P>
      <P>The KMT did once have a youth corps, but it is far more difficult for young
people to make their mark in the grand old party than in the DPP.</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances, a stronger volunteer force can help propel the party
toward its goal of becoming an "election machine."</P>
      <P>However, great efficiency does not necessarily translate into election wins.</P>
      <P>The DPP has strong candidates in the southern municipalities of Kaohsiung and
Tainan, and its heavyweights are preparing for the elections in Taipei City and
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the KMT has no strong candidates in southern Taiwan and is facing
the problem of whether to nominate an incumbent Taipei County head to run in the
upgraded county despite his low popularity ratings.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are no internal debates in the KMT on candidate selection.
If the KMT wants to win, it should encourage aspirants to stand up and throw

    <HEADLINE>Funding, culture key to developing soccer in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
02/05/10  18:26:40

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the 2010 soccer World Cup only a few months away, World Cup fever is
picking up around the world.</P>
      <P>Even in Taiwan, the event will attract a devout following, but contemplating the
day when the national team actually makes the big event is an entirely different
story.</P>
      <P>Local soccer experts agree that funding, culture and a proper structure are the
keys to developing the sport in Taiwan, where the game has long struggled to
gain a foothold.</P>
      <P>The foremost goal is to create a "soccer culture, " which to date has been
nonexistent in a nation far more passionate about basketball and baseball, says
Lin De-jia, secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei Soccer Association (CTFA).</P>
      <P>Without a professional league and a soccer culture, children don't have the
motivation to participate in the sport, Lin tells the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>It's not a secret that Taiwan, currently ranked 162nd in the world, has long
been an international soccer minnow, registering five wins, five draws, and 41
losses World Cup qualifying matches from 1958-2010. It scorded only 28 goals in
those games while surrending 182.</P>
      <P>Led by Japanese head coach Toshiaki Imai, Taiwan's World Cup qualifying campaign
for the 2010 event quickly evaporated in October 2007 when it was swept by
Uzbekistan in a home-and-home series by an aggregate 11-0 score.</P>
      <P>In order to change its lowly status, Taiwan needs to focus on developing its
youth soccer programs, said David Camhi, who is familiar with Taiwanese soccer
and has been running a soccer camp for children in Taipei with friends for six
years.</P>
      <P>All training and competitions in Taiwan take place within the education system,
based on the U.S. model, as was the case in Japan in the late 1980s and early
1990s, Camhi wrote in his Kick-Off magazine, and he argues it is the wrong
approach.</P>
      <P>"Japan now has three professional leagues, nine regional leagues, 46 prefecture
leagues and many more municipal leagues. A football pyramid with eight levels,"
Camhi wrote.</P>
      <P>With  such a structure  in place,  Japan  managed  within approximately 12 years
to progress to the second round of the FIFA World Cup in 2002 and qualify for
the 2006 and 2010 editions.</P>
      <P>"It's something the football authorities and other sporting bodies in Taiwan
should look into," Camhi wrote.</P>
      <P>When there is a much larger talent pool in Taiwan, the overall competition level
of the sport will be elevated, said Camhi, who arrived in Taiwan in 1999 and has
been working on promoting the game and teaching fundamentals to children since
then.</P>
      <P>Other than the lack of a professional league, funding also has been a problem,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's government sees the CTFA as nothing more than one of more than 60
sports associations in the country, " he complains.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the association previously received NT$10 million in funding
from the government every year, but the amount dropped to NT$6 million last
year.</P>
      <P>That's a pittance compared to the NT$30 million alone the association must spend
to send national teams ranging from under-13 to the senior level abroad to play
in 20 to 30 international competitions every year, Lin says.</P>
      <P>He does acknowledge that there have been some sparks of interest over the past
decade, including after the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea when
Taiwan's passion for "the beautiful game" did pick up a little.</P>
      <P>Since then, Lin said, more schoolchildren have participated in the game, and
more schools have organized soccer teams, enabling Taiwan's national youth teams
to fare better in competitions.</P>
      <P>Camhi said a number of elite young Taiwanese players are even capable of playing
professionally overseas now, though because they lack exposure they are not
recruited by European or South American clubs.</P>
      <P>But both Lin and Camhi acknowledge that the development of the local game will
take a long time and requires patience.</P>
      <P>Lin urged the government to plan for the long-term rather than rush for
immediate results, and he urged authorities to rethink their policy of
establishing "sports classes" -- which gather athletes into a single class --
because it works against achieving the objective.</P>
      <P>Such classes  actually  limit participation  in sports and discourages schools
without sports classes from organizing athletic teams because they cannot keep
up with better schools, he argues.</P>
      <P>And that's not good because the future is with the younger generation, Camhi
insists. Only by working from the bottom up can Taiwan improve its soccer
performance and some day "reach my ultimate goal for Taiwan to qualify for the
soccer World Cup."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The biggest event in China this year will be the Shanghai Expo, which will open
May 1 and run until Oct. 31. It is expected to attract up to 100 million
visitors if the economic environment is good.</P>
      <P>Considering the close trade and business exchanges between Taiwan and China, the
government should not ignore it but rather actively make good use of the
opportunities offered by the "nearest ever expo" to the country.</P>
      <P>In fact, the Shanghai expo has presented some opportunities to Taiwan, and
Taiwan's private sector has gladly accepted them and greatly advanced the
country's visibility at the event, in sharp contrast to Taiwan's overall profile
at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>Another development could help push the event to the level of an official cross-
strait exchange -- Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng will lead a delegation to visit
Taiwan in April.</P>
      <P>The expo will be a major topic, but as the head of China's largest economic

exchanges. The government should form a task force to seize the opportunities

      <P>The convener of the task force could be a minister without portfolio-level
official, and its members could come from the Mainland Affairs Council, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and all related government agencies.</P>
      <P>The task force will help support Taiwan's exhibitions and performance at the

    <TEXT>
      <P>David Camhi has a goal that most Taiwanese would not even dare to dream --
seeing Taiwan qualify for soccer's World Cup one day. But that goal can only be
achieved if more attention is given to youth soccer in the country.</P>
      <P>Frenchman Camhi shares the same vision with Britons Daniel Calvert and Michael
Chandler, so they started a children's soccer camp in 2004 to promote "the
beautiful game" and build a foundation for the sport by teaching fundamentals to
children from 3-9 years old.</P>
      <P>They launched the program because of their love of the game and desire to see
Taiwan do well in international soccer competitions, Camhi said at Shi Pai
Junior High School's soccer field, where the team runs the Master Football
Academy (MFA), a weekly camp.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is probably the only country in Asia where soccer is not a popular
sport, " Camhi said on a sunny morning as he watched Calvert, the camp's head
coach, lead dozens of children in a warm-up drill with parents looking on.</P>
      <P>Children in the camp participate in training sessions every Saturday and play in
real games in a league every Sunday, going up against teams from other Taipei
soccer academies at Dazhi Riverside Park.</P>
      <P>About 300 children attend the weekly camp, which sells coupons and does not
require full registration. That means children can join and drop out any time,
said Camhi, certified as a soccer coach by the French Football Federation and
the Football Association of England.</P>
      <P>The camp's participants have different motivations.</P>
      <P>Yvonne Neddo, whose five-year-old son Gabriel signed on with the camp about
three months ago,  said she thought soccer to be appropriate for her child.</P>
      <P>"Soccer is a good sport, aerobic exercise for the body, and keeps you 'on your
toes' -- nothing heavyweight for muscle building, " she said.</P>
      <P>A fourth-grade boy surnamed Chao joined the camp when he was riding a bike with
his father -- a soccer player in college -- in the park two years ago and saw a
training session.</P>
      <P>"I think he was influenced by his father's love of the game. They watched games
on television together all the time, and he found out that he loved it too, "
said Mrs. Chao.</P>
      <P>Mr. Huang said his daughter, who is one of the few girls in the male-dominated
camp, "joined the camp purely for excercise."</P>
      <P>The MFA is very happy with how the camp is developing, although it means the
coaches "have almost no off days, " Camhi said, but the academy has even bolder
plans ahead.</P>
      <P>It will hold an event in collaboration with the Ministry of Education in May to
promote youth soccer and the upcoming soccer World  Cup in South Africa  as well
as a Tottenhem  Hotspur International Player Development Course camp from July
12-16 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tottenham Hotspur, an English Premier League team, sees the potential in
Taiwan's market and is scheduled to bring in six coaches and an ambassador who
is a former Hotspur player for the camp, which will consist of 50 youth players
and 50 underprivileged children, said Calvert.</P>
      <P>"We hope that this camp will be a starting point for a long-term relationship
with the team to help Taiwan develop its youth soccer, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will regularly brief the public on progress in talks
between Taiwan and China on an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ,
officials at the Presidential Office said Friday.</P>
      <P>The office has decided to hold a press conference Feb. 9 to present such a
briefing.</P>
      <P>"It will be the first of its kind. In the future, there will be regular
presidential  press  conferences  on progress  in the negotiations," the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Ma asked officials to make negotiations on the cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact
open and transparent after his government was stung by an outcry over the
signing of a protocol with Washington on opening Taiwan's market to U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Mounting public protests pushed the legislature to pass an amendment
contravening part of the protocol,  embarrassing the government and creating
tensions in Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>The administration attributed the public resistance to poor communications and
hopes to make the process over the controversial ECFA less contentious.</P>
      <P>Ma, who sees the ECFA talks as the government's most important issue this year,
instructed relevant authorities to brief the legislature on progress in the
negotiations every month.</P>
      <P>Publicity on the negotiations will be based on the principle that "negotiators
must talk to the other side first and then brief the legislature before
President Ma addresses the public, " his office said.</P>
      <P>Ma has revealed that the second round of cross-strait talks on the ECFA will be
held some time between late February and early March, and that the negotiations
will focus on a range of issues, including an "early harvest" program, a list of
items that could be first to enjoy tariff exemptions.</P>

      <P>Seven activities featuring Taiwan's national parks kicked off Friday as a
prelude to a series of celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the founding of
the Republic of China in 2011, officials of the Construction and Planning Agency
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The activities were planned to promote the natural beauty and historic sites of
the country's eight national parks, including hikes of Taiwan's seven famous
mountains that will begin March 6 and a marathon to be held March 14 in Kenting
in the southernmost county of Pingtung, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Other activities include exhibitions, a forum and a bicycle tour centered around
Taiwan's national parks, as well as an environmental education session on how to
explore them.</P>
      <P>National parks have always been considered as a country's natural and cultural

      <P>Taiwan's pavilion at the Brussels Holiday Show,  the biggest annual travel fair
in Belgium,  has drawn considerable attention as it promotes the country's
natural beauty, culture, fine foods and free and democratic society.</P>
      <P>This is the seventh year Taiwan is participating in the travel fair, which is
being held at Brussels Expo, the city's major exhibition center, until Feb. 8.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's booth, shaped like an island and open on all four sides, is decorated
with billboards to highlight Taiwan's abundant tourism resources and culture,
Wang Chen-tai, an official at Taiwan's representative office in the EU and
Belgium, said on Friday.</P>
      <P>A wide variety of brochures, maps, and souvenirs introducing Taiwan's top
tourist attractions and culture were available at the booth, and a series of
documentaries and videos were screened repeatedly.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based China Airlines and tour operator VTB/Jetair also sent
representatives  to offer  customers  advice,  promotional literature and
information about holiday and travel planning.</P>
      <P>Belgians made 10.4 million overseas visits last year, though not many visited
Taiwan. Still, with the help of a low baseline, the number of Belgian tourists
traveling to Taiwan in 2008 rose 53 percent, according to statistics compiled by

      <P>The government should help remove barriers imposed against Taiwan's game
software companies in China's market, a local association aimed at promoting the
local game industry said Friday.</P>
      <P>"There is unfair competition between Taiwanese and Chinese online game
companies, " said Aaron Hsu, the head of the association consisting of Taiwan's
20 game software companies, at a seminar held at the Taipei Game Show on its
opening day.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwanese products cannot enter China's market as quickly as Chinese
products do because they are subject to a stricter and more protracted screening
process.</P>
      <P>But Chinese games can compete without restrictions in Taiwan, he complained.</P>
      <P>"New game products from China account for over 40 percent of the total number of
new products in Taiwan's market, " Hsu, also the chairman of XPEC Entertainment
Inc., told an audience of over 200 people.</P>
      <P>"This means that Taiwan has opened itself to Chinese products. There is no
barrier at all."</P>
      <P>However, new products made by Taiwanese companies account for less than 1
percent of the total number of new products in China, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged Taiwan's government to deal with this unfair treatment during  the
upcoming  fifth round  of talks aimed at further liberalizing trade between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Albert Liu, chairman and CEO of Gamania Digital Entertainment Co.,
argued that the government is not efficient enough to help local online game
companies,  and he called for the establishment of a digital content industrial
park to create a cluster effect.</P>
      <P>Asked about the industry's prospects for 2010,  Soft-World International Corp.
Chairman Wang Chun-po said Taiwan's online game companies should not only focus
on the Chinese market, but also on markets in Russia, Turkey, Europe, the United
States and Japan.</P>
      <P>"These markets have already accepted games featuring Chinese cultural elements,
" he said. "The first best-selling games in Russia and Vietnam all had Chinese
elements."</P>
      <P>Paul Chiang,  president of International Games System Co., suggested that
Taiwanese firms should seek partnership with leading U.S. or European companies
to outperform their Chinese or South Korea competitors.</P>
      <P>A total of 62 companies are taking part in the Taipei Game Show this year. The
show is expected to draw 300,000 visitors during its five-day run that concludes

    <TEXT>
      <P>Arms sales have long been viewed as a barometer of the strength of U.S.
commitment to Taiwan. However, some people have ridiculed Taiwan's use of big
money to buy weapons from the United States, likening the situation to "a
nightwalker trying to brace up his own courage by whistling." This may sound
acrimonious, but it is an indisputable fact that Taiwan lacks the ability to
wage "a war to end all wars."</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Taiwan has to use other ways to avoid going to war.
Taiwan needs to use "soft power" to defend itself and help maintain regional
stability.</P>
      <P>There are many kinds of "soft power," the most important of which is having a
well-developed democracy. Others include economic and trade power, talent and
intellectual power, as well as cultural power.</P>
      <P>Based on all these, there is a kind of "soft power" that Taiwan needs to employ
using high levels of wisdom, which is to function as a leverage for peace in
between the two superpowers of China and the United States. As the smallest one,
Taiwan has a delicate role to play. And if such a role is played well, it will
become a "soft power" that boosts Taiwan's security.</P>

      <P>Delayed trade talks between Taiwan and the United States should be resumed as
soon as possible, former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said here Friday.</P>
      <P>The talks, originally scheduled to be held in Taipei this month, were delayed
due to a dispute over Taiwan's decision to resume a ban on certain U.S. beef
products.</P>
      <P>Liu said talks under the trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA) would
not only strengthen bilateral relations but would also allow U.S. businessmen to
fully enjoy the trade opportunities created by a planned trade pact between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>He noted that a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) is
expected to be signed in the next round of cross-strait talks that are likely to
take place in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>The agreement will help businesses on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to adjust
their fundamentals and allow global businesses to use Taiwan as a springboard
into the Asia-Pacific region, especially China, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu, who is a senior adviser to President Ma Ying-jeou, made the remarks while
speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank, during which he
stressed the importance of the TIFA as well as the benefits of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>Liu said the TIFA talks  have become  the most important communication platform
on trade and economic issues since the two countries severed formal diplomatic
ties in 1979.</P>
      <P>However, they have not taken place since Taiwan's decision to resume a ban on
imports of U.S. bovine offal and ground beef amid public misgivings about their
connections with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese  government  is seriously  and substantively responding to the
U.S. request to resume imports and is trying to assuage the public misgivings
over U.S. beef," he said.</P>
      <P>Liu is leading a Taiwanese delegation attending the U.S. National Prayer
Breakfast Feb. 3-5.</P>
      <P>During his speech, Liu also said U.S.-Taiwan relations are close, adding that
they are major trade partners and have made big investments in each other's
countries.</P>
      <P>Politically, there have also been positive exchanges, with the U.S. helping
Taiwan to enter the World Trade Organization and participate in the World Health
Organization as an observer, he went on.</P>
      <P>He further expressed hope that the U.S. will continue to assist Taiwan to join
such international organizations as the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change and International Civil Aviation Organization.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Game Show opened Friday, attracting hordes of people, mostly
teenagers.</P>
      <P>Video games are magnets to many because the players can place themselves into
the games and vicariously experience the scenarios depicted.</P>
      <P>The movie Avatar is greatly loved by teenagers, not because of its addressing of
issues related to environmental protection or naturalism, but because of the
surreal effect produced by its visual high-tech 3-D viewing mode.</P>
      <P>This paper cannot determine if video games have any impact on the development of
the intelligence, psychology or mentality of young people, and cannot predict
the impact on the social development of this video game generation.</P>
      <P>However,  through young people's participation and expanded imagination through
video games, future society might be more pluralistic and interesting.</P>
      <P>The insistence on ideology and traditional romanticism will be diluted, replaced

    <HEADLINE>Banker released after questioning for suspected bribery</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of one of Taiwan's largest banks, Taishin Financial Holding Co.,
was released in the early hours of Saturday after being questioned by the
Supreme Prosecutors Office for suspected involvement in the alleged corruption
scandal of former president Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Wu Tung-liang, board chairman of Taishin, was suspected to have paid a huge sum
of money as bribery to former president Chen's wife, Wu Shu-jen, as the private
bank was planning to invest in the government-linked Chang Hwa Bank when the
government was implementing a second phase of financial reforms and encouraging
mergers of monetary institutions.</P>
      <P>Wu was called in for questioning by the Special Investigative Division of the
prosecutors' office after dozens of investigators made surprise raids at Taishin
bank's headquarters and Wu's residence in Taipei Friday afternoon upon the
closing of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Four others suspected of involvement in the case were taken to the prosecutors'
office for questioning.</P>
      <P>Local media have reported that in the former first lady's statement to the
Special Investigative Division last February, Wu Shu-jen claimed that the
hundreds of millions she had deposited at the safe of Cathay United Bank since
2006 were contributed by 20 executives  of Taiwanese  banks,  high-tech  firms
and  media organizations, among which NT$100 million was paid by Wu Tung-liang.</P>
      <P>Taishin holds a 22.5 percent stake in Chang Hwa Bank and is the largest
shareholder of the state-owned bank.</P>
      <P>Taishin has been targeted by investigators since the bank was mentioned in the
Cabinet's "second phase monetary reform review report" released last February.</P>
      <P>The report indicated that when Taishin was in the process of acquiring special
shares of Chang Hwa Bank, its debt ratio was relatively high.</P>
      <P>Some financial specialists have also pointed out that it did not make sense for
Chang Hwa bank to be merged with Taishin because Chang Hwa was in good financial
health whereas Taishin was not at the time of the proposed merger, meaning
Taishin was in no position to buy up the state-owned financial institution.</P>
      <P>Before Friday's questioning, the Taishin chairman had twice been summoned by the
investigators as a witness of the suspected money laundering and bribery case of
the former first family.</P>
      <P>He has claimed that Taishin was helping the government settle problems when it
acquired shares of Chang Hwa Bank, and had abided by every legal procedure. Wu
Tung-liang had also denied any involvement in the money laundering or bribery
case.</P>
      <P>In a similar case, the Special Investigative Division last December indicted
executives of Cathay United Bank and Yuanta Financial Holding, which were
accused of bribing the former first lady in order to "smooth" government
requirements to merge with Fuhwa Financial Holding Co.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Shares slump on fear over euro zone defaults</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/06/10  17:23:34
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan shares tumbled heavily Friday on fears about possible euro zone defaults,
with the benchmark weighted index plunging by 324.21 points to close at 7,217.83
points. The 4.3 percent drop, the biggest in Asia, was the 14th-largest single-
day decline since 2000 in the local bourse.</P>
      <P>The weighted index has dropped by over 1,000 points from a relative high of
8,300 points two weeks ago, which means that every retail investor suffered a
loss of NT$350,000 (US$10,940) on average -- dashing investors' high hopes for a
"new year bonus."</P>
      <P>Analysts pointed out that Taiwanese investor confidence remained shaky amid
selling pressure, with only four days to go before the Feb. 14 Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue.</P>
      <P>The China Times:</P>
      <P>Three major institutional investors sold a total of NT$19.8 billion-worth of
Taiwanese shares Friday, with foreign investors selling out NT$15.7 billion
(US$490 million) of stocks. DRAM, flat panel displays, notebooks and financial
shares were under heavy selling pressure.</P>
      <P>As of Feb. 5, foreign institutional investors had sold a combined NT$l17.2
billion worth in net value of Taiwanese shares over the past 11 trading
sessions, while the weighted index had plunged by more than 1,100 points, or
13.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Market observers attributed the plunge to the drops in global stock markets and
profit-taking on the local bourse after a 70 percent surge last year due to a
continued influx of hot money from around the world.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwanese shares plunged heavily Friday, market turnover stood at
NT$121.69 billion -- a sign that investors are still optimistic about the local
bourses' future performance, financial officials said. (Feb. 6, 2010).</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>With the plummets in the U.S. and European markets and grave concern among
investors as the 11-day Lunar New Year holiday approaches, share prices fell
like dominoes Friday on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex).</P>
      <P>In the face of uncertainties in the international stock market, analysts said
fearful Taiwanese investors will not risk maintaining their share holdings
through the holiday and predicted that selling pressure in the local bourse will
persist until Feb. 12, the last trading day before the market closes Feb. 13.</P>
      <P>As the Taiex is closely linked to the performance of the world's major stock
markets, foreign investors are likely to continue selling Taiwanese shares if
the U.S. stock market finishes lower Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-mount, a leading analyst at Citibank Taiwan, said strong doubts
about the euro zone defaults remain, as the incident is still brewing. But he
attributed the global market falls to the credit-tightening measures adopted by
China and the U.S. rather than to the troubles facing Greece, Ireland, Portugal
and Spain, which are having difficulties paying their sovereign debts. (Feb. 6,
2010)</P>
      <P>The United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The amount of marginal trading, which signals the movement of retail investors
in the stock market, plummeted NT$6.3 billion on Friday alone. With the rout in
the U.S. and European markets, foreign institutional investors who had been
investing in the local bourse began pulling their capital out of Taiwan in
recent days. Foreign investors recorded a net sale of NT$117.2 billion worth of
Taiwanese shares over the past 11 trading sessions.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation has found that Taiwan's financial institutions'
exposure to the debts of Portugal, Spain and Greece stands close to NT$16
billion, a level that experts think does not merit overreaction.</P>
      <P>But the local currency sharply depreciated NT$0.167 Friday to close at NT$32.187
against the greenback in the Taipei foreign exchange market -- the lowest in
more than one month -- as a result of foreign investors' heavy remittances of
capital out of Taiwan after selling their Taiwanese holdings. (Feb. 6, 2010)</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Prosecutors Office's special investigation division (SID) launched a
search Feb. 5 of 11 offices of the Taipei-based Taishin Financial Holdings Co.
(TFH) and interrogated TFH Chairman Thomas T.L. Wu.</P>
      <P>According to the office, during its investigation into alleged scandals
involving the second phase of financial reforms promoted by former President
Chen Shui-bian in 2004, the SID discovered that the private banking group might
have been part of illegal conduct during the process when it bought preferred
stocks of the Chang Hwa Bank in 2005.</P>
      <P>The deal made TFH the bank's largest stock holder.</P>
      <P>It is suspected that in 2005, when the government auctioned its Chang Hwa Bank
stocks, it set up regulations that helped TFH to be the largest winner of the
auction.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Prosecutors and inspectors suspect that the Ministry of Finance gave TFH
"technical assistance, " helping the private consortium acquire the right to
control Chang Hwa Bank, a commercial bank once owned by the provincial
government before privatization in 1998.</P>
      <P>Political machinations might have been involved in the case.</P>
      <P>Testimonies from relevant sources reveal that Thomas Wu's family is suspected of
having established a connection through a middleman, former Shin Kong Hospital
Vice President Huang Fang-yen, with the family of scandal-ridden former
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Wu's financial offers to Chen's family gave him access to the presidential
residence.</P>
      <P>The SID found that Huang was commissioned by former first lady Wu Shu-chen to
handle her financial affairs and that massive cash transactions were recorded in
Chen's election account at Taishin Bank. The SID suspects that Taishin might
have benefited from its direct connection with the Chen family.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Commenting on the SID search, TFH spokesman Lin Ko-hsiao said the company had
cooperated with the investigators and that the raid had not affected TFH's
financial and business operations.</P>
      <P>On the Taiwan stock market, the price of TFH stocks plummeted to a nearly six-
month low of NT$10.45 per share Friday.</P>
      <P>TFH stated that it hoped its control over the Chang Hwa Bank would help offset
the two companies' separate weaknesses. However, because of political
interference, its 300,000 stockowners suffered losses, it said.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Friday, TFH said it would cooperate fully with the
investigation but would take legal action against any defamation.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>SID Director Chen Yun-lin said TFH Chairman Thomas Wu has been listed as a
defendant after SID prosecutors and inspectors conducted asearch for evidence at
11 TFH offices Friday.</P>
      <P>On an accusation that Wu bribed former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu
Shu-chen before his company invested in the Chang Hwa Bank, Chen Yun-lin said
further investigation is needed on the case.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Chen instructed during the implementation of his second phase of financial
reforms in 2004 that mergers of local banks must be completed within a certain
timeframe.</P>
      <P>At that time, there were rumors that administration departments had assisted
certain financial  holding companies  in turning themselves into a major banking
consortium through mergers.</P>
      <P>After the former president and his wife were found to have been involved in many
corruption scandals, the SID launched a full investigation into bank accounts of
the Chen family, discovering suspicious funds the former first lady claimed were
donations from local entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>The funds included NT$50 million that Thomas Wu said was a "political donation"
to Chen. The testimony, however, has failed to convince the prosecutors. (Feb.

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Luxury house tax is phony issue</HEADLINE>

(Feb. 6, 2010)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance decided recently that Taipei City should take the lead
in imposing a luxury house tax, which seems to reflect concerns by the
government on soaring house prices and the widening gap between the rich and
poor.</P>
      <P>But thinking more deeply, one can see that the issue is a phony one designed by
the government to divert public attention.</P>
      <P>The concept began being promoted by the nation's top economic planner -- the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) -- late last year. Scholars
suggested to the CEPD at that time that an additional tax -- a luxury house tax
-- should be levied.</P>
      <P>However, the Ministry of Finance's approach has been to increase existing
housing tax rates, which goes against public expectations on tax reform.</P>
      <P>The level of housing prices reflects supply and demand in the market. If the
government does not start with the basics -- the rule of the game --  such as
financial policy,  the openness and transparency of property price information,
and the use and overall planning of land resources, a simple adjustment of the
tax system will never be successful.</P>
      <P>In addition, housing and land are inseparable. If the Ministry of Finance wants
to raise housing values to achieve its end of imposing a heavy tax on luxury
houses, then it should take the complementary measure of raising land prices.</P>
      <P>Moreover, housing taxes are local government taxes. Although the tax law
stipulates that the standard price should be reassessed every three years, the
assessed price and the real housing price have a huge gap due to the laziness of
the local assessment committee.</P>
      <P>Whether from the perspective of curbing the surging housing prices or promoting
fair taxes, the use of increasing assessed values to impose a luxury housing tax
will only be a half-hearted approach.</P>
      <P>If we support the measure, it will simply be because "to have done something is
better than to have done nothing" and will not show any kind of measure of
confidence in the government's move.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Saturday that a move to change the
administrative district map is being taken to promote Taiwan's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>As leader of the country, Ma said at a gathering in Taoyuan County attended by
the mayors of township-level cities that he cares about "the happiness of the
next generation rather than the next election. "</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after many of the mayors expressed concern that their cities
will be marginalized after Taipei County is upgraded into a municipality at the
end of the year, while Taichung City and Taichung County will be merged into a
single municipality, as well as Tainan City and Tainan County, and Kaohsiung
City and Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Currently, only Taipei City and Kaohsiung City are municipalities under the
direct jurisdiction of the central government.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the formation of the five municipalities was designed so that
the government can control the direction of future national development in order
to boost the nation's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He said it is a model that is being adopted by many cities and countries in
Asia.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to pacify the mayors, Ma promised that funding for local
governments will be allocated fairly.</P>
      <P>Also that day Ma, in his capacity as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang, attended
an election activity in Taoyuan to stump for Apollo Chen, the party's candidate
in an legislative by-election slated for Feb. 27.</P>
      <P>Ma said the party must spare no efforts to achieve victory in the upcoming
battle after its dismal showing in three Jan. 9 legislative by-elections in
Taoyuan, Taichung and Taitung counties.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won all three seats contested
in Taoyuan, Taichung and Taitung counties to boost its seats in the legislature
from 27 to 30. With more than 25 percent of the seats in the 113-member

    <TEXT>
      <P>A major issue currently being discussed inside the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party is whether the party's nominee for the 2012 presidential
election should first undergo the test of the elections slated for late 2010 in
five new special municipalities.</P>
      <P>Precedent was set by former president Chen Shui-bian, who was elected to the
presidency in 2000 after losing a Taipei mayoral re-election bid in 1998. An
election loss in Taipei City has since become a lucky symbol and a path that DPP
presidential aspirants must take.</P>
      <P>Following this format was Frank Hsieh, who ran for the 2008 presidency after
losing a 2006 mayoral bid in the capital city. Hsieh,  however, was again
defeated. Despite this unsuccessful example, major DPP members still think
aspirants should first embark on a crusade for the party before they can become
a presidential nominee.</P>
      <P>However, the situation might be different now that the DPP has scored landslide
wins in the December 2009 three-in-one elections and the January by-elections
for three legislative seats. Thanks to President Ma Ying-jeou's low approval
rating, the DPP is likely to again achieve an overwhelming victory in the year-
end special municipality elections. Under these circumstances, it would be
inconceivable to nominate someone who has just been elected mayor to run
immediately for the next presidency.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that DPP has turned what are supposed to be election
expediencies into normal party operations. It seems that the DPP has still has a
long way to go before it can become a normal political party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The auto market has gradually rebounded, but major car maker Toyota has had to
recall 2.3 million vehicles over a faulty gas pedal, as well as suffering brake
problems with its hybrid Prius.</P>
      <P>In January, Toyota car sales dropped 16 percent in the U.S., while sales of its
major rivals -- Ford, Nissan and General Motors -- increased by 25 percent, 16
percent, 14 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Another Japanese car maker, Honda, also announced the recall of 646,000 cars due
to possible overheating of power windows. But they were cars for overseas
markets. The Japanese versions had no such problem as they use different parts.</P>
      <P>It seems that the factors affecting the landscape of the car market will not be
confined to new energy technology or new emerging markets. Future car makers
will also face big changes in production modes.</P>
      <P>That is, cost-cutting will require more and more outsourcing and sharing parts,
creating a problem of how to maintain quality.</P>
      <P>The auto production model has gradually shifted to one similar to the division
of labor in the production of computer parts. As long as a company can design
and has money, it can become a brand car maker because most of the parts will be
outsourced.</P>
      <P>For example, different car makers and car brands could use the same engines
produced by an engine supplier. Thus, even if Mitsubishi Motors had no big
global market share, it would still be the largest engine supplier for Chinese
vehicles.</P>
      <P>Under this trend, Taiwan's auto parts sector is promising, because it has good
quality and cheap prices.</P>
      <P>More importantly, Taiwanese businessmen have learned how to create parts supply
chains by making good use of Asian production resources.</P>
      <P>We are looking forward to seeing the emergence of a car parts equivalent of

    <HEADLINE>Renewable energy policy to start this year: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite considerable difficulties at present in the government's efforts to
promote a renewable energy policy, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-
chiou said Saturday the policy must be implemented this year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a public hearing on the issue held by lawmaker Cheng Lee-wen at the
Legislative Yuan and attended by government officials, academics and business
representatives, Hwang made it clear that the policy must hit the road in 2010,
although he admitted that this will be difficult to implement.</P>
      <P>"It might seem an easy task to promote the policy in theory, but it is actually
almost a political mission impossible in practice, if we take the ensuing
difficulties into consideration, " he explained, adding that persuading
Taiwanese households to pay higher monthly water fees after the implementation
of the policy  would be particularly difficult.</P>
      <P>As an example of this, Hwang said, Taipei City once tried to impose a NT$0.5
hike in the unit price for water, but the proposal was met with strong
objections from local councilors. At present, each unit in Taipei City costs
NT$7.8, lower than the NT$10 charged in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's water price, far below the cost of production, is extremely cheap
compared with developed countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese families spend 0.5 percent-0.6 percent of their annual expenditure on
piped water each year, much lower than the 2 percent-4 percent suggested by the
World Health Organization, a local water company said.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration Minister Steven Shen, who also attended
the hearing, suggested that auxiliary measures should be put in place across
the board  to be in line with the implementation of the renewable energy policy,
following the method used in Germany.</P>
      <P>According to Sheng, Germany is the only country in the world that has succeeded
in holding on to a renewable energy policy.</P>

      <P>The number of telephone scams in which callers try to defraud people of money,
averages 10,000 per day in Taiwan, a major telecommunications operator estimated
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  Mobile said it has spent more than NT$10 million (US$311,530) on
developing interception measures in a bid to protect the interests of
subscribers and cut the harassment by fraudsters to a minimum.</P>
      <P>Just one month after adopting measures to intercept scam calls, Taiwan Mobile
reported that it had blocked 77,000 such calls.</P>
      <P>The company found that the number of calls blocked during weekdays accounts for
90 percent of the week's total, with calls peaking on Wednesdays.</P>
      <P>The major time period of scam calls was between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., with the
number of calls blocked during the period accounting for 87 percent of the day.</P>
      <P>The number of calls blocked was the highest at 9 a.m., showing that the
scamsters use a time when people are going to work or schools, and when public
offices open, to confuse the receiver into thinking that the calls are real.</P>
      <P>The criminals often use fake telephone numbers of government agencies so that
people receiving the calls think that they have received calls from police
stations or prosecutors office.</P>
      <P>Police station numbers are most often used by the fraud rings in Taiwan, with
the number of intercepted calls supposedly from such facilities reaching as high
as 6,000 per month.</P>
      <P>In terms of localities, people in Taipei County, Taipei City and Taoyuan County
received the most phone scam calls.</P>

with a strong odor such as fermented bean curd and fried chicken, an official

buy from the theater's concession stands.</P>
      <P>The GIO will make formal announcement Feb. 8 that effective immediately, movie
theaters must not impose a ban on outside food and drink, but will suggest that
moviegoers refrain from bringing in foods with strong odor or snacks that are
noisy to eat, such as melon seeds.</P>
      <P>The authorities will make random inspections of theaters to make sure they are
not maintaining an outside food ban, according to the official.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) heavyweight Frank Hsieh broke his
silence Saturday over his preferred candidate in the year-end election for the
first mayor of the new municipality of a merged Taichung City and Taichung
County.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who served as premier for less than a year between 2005 and 2006, made
public his support Saturday in the central Taiwan city for DPP Secretary-General
Lin Chia-lung, saying he would be a perfect candidate.</P>
      <P>The merger is part of the government's move to change the administration
district map, which will also see Taipei County upgraded into a municipality,
while Tainan City and Tainan County will be merged into a single municipality,
as well as Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The mayoral elections of the five municipalities -- including Taipei City -- are
planned to take place in late 2010, just before the new administration districts
are formally established.</P>
      <P>Most of the DPP bigwigs, including incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu and former
Premier Su Tseng-chang, have been tight-lipped on whether they will run.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he also wants to help DPP candidates win the Feb. 27 legislative by-

      <P>Upon being informed of Hsieh's support, Lin said he will spare no effort to seek

society in which men must pretend to possess what they really do not possess;
pretend to have plenty, when they have really nothing; and pretend to be in
affluence when they are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is
difficult to be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan's first lady, Chow Mei-ching, became a focus of attention in downtown
Vancouver Saturday when she visited several spots where cultural activities take
place.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by her daughter Lesley Ma, Chow visited the Museum of Vancouver,
where Taiwan-born Canadian artist Ed Pien is staging a solo show titled "Tracing
Night" -- a large maze-like installation that combines drawing, video and sound
to recreate the phenomenon of night and darkness.</P>
      <P>Chow later visited the "Lantern Forest" -- a corridor that displays over 2,000
lanterns created by children from Canada and Taiwan designed to celebrate the
Chinese New Year and the opening of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.</P>

Republic of China President Ma Ying-jeou and started taking pictures of her,
several tourists also took out their cameras to grab some images with Taiwan's
first lady.</P>
      <P>Chow arrived in Vancouver Thursday as the honorary head of the Cloud Gate Dance
Theatre, marking the first time Taiwan's first lady has visited Canada since
diplomatic ties were severed between the two countries in 1970.</P>
      <P>She attended a Cloud Gate performance Friday at the Cultural Olympiad being held
in the city.</P>
      <P>Chow was also scheduled to attend a book donation ceremony at the Vancouver

base in Huaian City, in China's Jiangsu Province, to pave the way for its Taiwan
Beer brand to enter China's market, Huaian Mayor Gao Xuekun said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The plan was unveiled after TTLC set up branch offices in Beijing and Shanghai
and was named as a partner in the 16th Guangzhou Asian Games last November.</P>
      <P>Huaian, an important city in northern Jiangsu famous for its wine production,
was chosen by TTLC as its beer production base because of the high quality of
its artesian water. In addition to TTLC, Japan's Suntory  International  Corp.

      <P>Earlier this year, TTLC announced plans to select an exclusive agent among five
Chinese  cities  and to appoint  a contract manufacturer to produce and package
its Taiwan Beer products in China.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Have you been cheated on purchases of takeaway Lunar New Year dishes?</P>
      <P>One Taipei County consumers' rights protection official has taken three local
convenience store chains to task on their labeling of takeaway New Year dishes
made by a food processing company as "designed or prepared by chefs at five-star
hotels."</P>
      <P>Yang Shun-hui said at a Saturday news conference that she will ask FamilyMart,
OK and Hi Life convenience store chains and their business associates -- the
food processor and three tourist hotels in Taipei City -- to explain their
takeaway dish production and labeling within one week.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ordering takeaway Lunar New Year dishes from convenience stores has been popular
in Taiwan for years.</P>
      <P>While convenience store chains tend to advertise their dishes as being prepared
by award-winning cooks or chefs at five-star hotels, Yang said the dishes are
all actually made by a food processor in the county's Yingge township.</P>
      <P>Yang noted that she personally ordered a FamilyMart taro cake -- a popular
festive snack -- which the convenience store claimed in its advertising as
having been made by a culinary team headed by Lo Chin-han, who won a world
gastronomy contest last year.</P>
      <P>"After I picked up the product recently, I found that the product was actually
prepared by a factory called the AWH food processing company," Yang said.</P>
      <P>According to initial investigations, Yang went on, the food processor in Yingge
township has also produced takeaway New Year dishes for the OK and Hi Life
convenience store chains.</P>
      <P>Yang said that although the OK convenience store chain has advertised its New
Year dishes as being "designed" rather than " personally made" by three chefs at
Taipei's Grand Hotel, it has failed to label them as having actually been made
in a factory.</P>
      <P>By advertising their takeaway dishes as having been made by noted chefs, Yang
said, the convenience store chains might be misleading consumers for the sake of
profit.</P>
      <P>Yang said her office will invite executives from the store chains, hotels and
the processing company in the coming week to clarify relevant issues and will
ask them to honestly identify the genuine producer of their takeaway dishes.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Fair Trade Act and the Consumer Protection Act, companies
that run misleading advertisements can be slapped with fines ranging between
NT$50,000 and NT$25 million. (Feb. 7, 2010)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>AWH manager Chen Chun-yuan said convenience store chains and noted hotels have
cooperated with food processors in marketing takeaway festive dishes for many
years.</P>
      <P>"While we are responsible for production, the ingredients and flavors are chosen
and decided by each store chain or hotel for exclusive sale under specific brand
names," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Both FamilyMart and Grand Hotel executives confirmed that it is actually AWH and
not the noted chefs that makes the food. They said AWH has been certified as a
good manufacturing food processor with GMP and HACCP logos and added that they
do not know why the county official would take issue with their products after
the business has been in place for so many years.</P>
      <P>Yang said the stores should inform consumers about who really produces their
food. (Feb. 7, 2010)</P>

      <P>The development of the electronic publishing industry is in the best interests
of both Taiwan and China and the two sides are coming to terms with each other
to jointly tap the vast Chinese-language e-book market, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Officials from the MOEA and the non-profit  Institute for Information Industry
have been exchanging views with their Chinese counterparts on technical
integration and standardization of the digital content of the e-publishing
industry, including simplified and traditional Chinese characters as well as the
different terms and phrases used on the two sides for identical ideas, the MOEA
said.</P>
      <P>China's vast Chinese-language market is the key to a boom in Taiwan's electronic
publishing industry and e-book development, the officials said.</P>
      <P>With anticipation of booming development in the e-publishing market and the
pitching in of big makers such as AU Optronics, Delta and Hon Hai, Taiwanese
companies' global output of e-books is expected to increase by NT$30 billion
(US$937.5 million) in two years to reach NT$42 billion, they predicted.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwanese companies dominate some 80 percent of the components  and
related hardware  used in the world's  e-book manufacturing industry, with sales
topping a combined NT$12 billion per year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOEA predicted that the number of e-book readers in Taiwan will
have reached 10,000 by the end of 2010 and grow 100-fold to hit 1 million by
2013.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also funnel NT$2.13 billion over the next five years into
creating large Chinese-language content trading centers, promoting e-learning
model projects and seeking cooperation between Taiwan's and China's publishing
markets, as well as subsidizing the research and development of related
industries, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foremost semi-official trade promotion organization will assist local
manufactures of consumer electronics to take part in trade fairs in China's
second-tier cities this year, with the aim of boosting their products'
visibility in the targeted cities.</P>
      <P>The plan was mapped out after several Taiwanese electronics spare parts and flat
panel manufacturers successfully tapped into the vast Chinese market by
capitalizing on a subsidy program launched by China in 2009 to boost electronic
appliance sales in rural areas, said Huang Wen-jung, deputy secretary-general of
the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>The subsidy program has been beneficial mainly to Taiwanese flat panel and spare
parts producers, but not to its finished product manufacturers, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Chinese products account for 80 percent of the country's total TV market, with
the other 20 percent shared by Japan and South Korean products. Taiwan's TV
manufacturers do not have much of a market share there, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Therefore, TAITRA plans to help Taiwanese manufacturers take part in trade shows
in China's second-tier cities, which include Tianjin, Jinan, Dongguan, Chongqing
and Chengdu, as costs for promotion in first-tier cities are considered too
high, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Although Acer and Asus -- Taiwan's two leading providers of computers -- have a
presence in China, it is much smaller than that of China's Lenovo, Huang went
on, adding that there is a need to promote Taiwanese name brand products in
China.</P>
      <P>According to market research firm DisplaySearch, LCD TV shipments in China are
set to top 33 million in 2010, up from 25 million in 2009. The shipments will
reach 372 million in 2011, surpassing the total units projected for the whole
North American market and making China the biggest LCD TV market in the world,
Huang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>launched a "coming home to vote" drive last year, ahead of the three-in-one
elections, to encourage its supporters to return to the districts of their
household registrations to cast their ballots.</P>
      <P>The party, however, immediately voiced objection to a recent Interior Ministry
proposal to devise a transfer ballot system that would allow  eligible  voters
to cast their ballots  in the constituencies where they work instead of the
areas of their household registrations.</P>
      <P>The DPP's opposition is unwarranted, particularly since the ministry has clearly
ruled out the inclusion of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China and other
overseas emigres into the application of the proposed transfer ballot system.</P>
      <P>Transfer voting is a form of absentee voting that also includes voting by mail,
proxy voting, designated voting and advance voting.</P>
      <P>Voting by mail is the most popular form of absentee voting, but it is not
expected to be implemented in Taiwan in the foreseeable future because of
widespread misgivings of possible Chinese influence in Taiwan's elections
through the large numbers of Taiwanese businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>The Interior Ministry has decided not to adopt the postal voting system, at
least at present, and will instead focus on promoting a transfer ballot system
allowing those who cannot vote in their hometowns on election day to register in
advance to cast their ballots in the areas in which they work.</P>
      <P>Many people could be eligible to apply for transfer voting, including soldiers,
police officers, prison inmates, students and white-collar and blue-collar
workers.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, at least 15 percent of local people do not
reside or work in the areas of their household registrations.</P>
      <P>In light of protecting the civil rights of such a large group of people and
reducing social costs, the government should introduce a transfer ballot system
as soon as possible. If it does not, the government might violate its
constitutional obligations.</P>
      <P>Under the current Public Officials Election and Recall Law, polling station
staff can cast their ballots at polling stations in which they work instead of
the areas of their household registration. With this precedent in place, the
government should not drag its feet in preparing for installing this system on a
larger scale.</P>
      <P>The DPP should also stop its opposition and instead push for its implementation
at an early date for the convenience of its supporters who work outside their
hometowns or areas of their household registrations. (Feb. 7, 2010)</P>

      <P>Cabinet officials should observe certain principles when they canvass votes or
stump for candidates in the upcoming legislative by-elections, Premier Wu Den-
yih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu said he does not oppose ministerial-level officials canvassing votes for
ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  candidates  running in the by-elections for four
legislative seats slated for Feb. 27, but said that the vote-soliciting
initiatives must not run against party or government norms.</P>
      <P>He said the vote-canvassing initiatives must be carried out under the principles
that the activity does not contradict the propriety of the minister's position,
that no national resources or budget should be used for particular candidates
and that the officials must be careful with their language when canvassing.</P>
      <P>The premier pinpointed the ministers of justice and education, as well as the
director-general of the National Police Agency, as being unsuitable for
appearances at stumping functions.</P>
      <P>He said that while civil servants have the right to extend verbal support for
election candidates when they are off-duty, such stumping must not be "too
much."</P>
      <P>The KMT has fielded Chen Shueh-sheng, Cheng Yung-tang, Lin Teh-jui and Wang
Ting-sheng as candidates in the Feb. 27 legislative by-elections for Taoyuan,
Hsinchu, Chiayi and Hualien counties, respectively.</P>

      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou said Sunday at a charity carnival that it was
his happiest day since the financial crisis erupted as he made a donation of
NT$300 million (US$9.38 million) to several social welfare organizations.</P>
      <P>At the event held by the Yong Lin Charity Foundation -- which he founded -- the

      <P>Guo said that he had been gloomy since Taiwan was hit by the global financial
crisis and Typhoon Morakot last year. However, he said he finally felt happy
again after seeing so many people turn out for the carnival.</P>
      <P>He said the carnival was aimed at raising funds ahead of the Chinese New Year
for various social groups in view of an imbalanced distribution of social
resources following the channeling of most donations into Morakot-affected
areas, resulting in insufficient financial support for many social welfare

    <TEXT>
      <P>This year' s basic competitive tests -- used to gauge the academic  performance
of senior school students applying  for enrollment in universities -- just drew
to an end, and many said that the subject title of the Chinese composition --
"The soliloquy of driftwood" -- was among the best the tests have had. In
general, though, the questions in the Chinese test were deemed too difficult for
most of the examinees.</P>
      <P>The Chinese course offered to students has many missions -- to cultivate their
ability to think about life, to know the world, to deal properly with things and
people and to train their ability of expression. It even involves an ideological
dispute -- the ratio of the classical and vernacular Chinese articles to be
presented in the text books.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder, then, that many students have to attend additional Chinese
courses at cram schools after their normal school studies in order to score well
-- a phenomenon that confuses many parents, who themselves had to attend cram
classes when they were students, but only for English, mathematics and the
sciences.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Chinese course should be to cultivate students' interest in
Chinese language, literacy and creativity, developing in them the habit of
reading that will stay with them for life rather than just to cope with exams.</P>
      <P>Without cultivating the reading habit among students, who can expect them to
love reading after leaving campus? This is why the number of people who love
reading is declining in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: On the brink of `monetary war'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/07/10  18:49:07
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of the recent global financial crisis, the thorny issue regarding
the Chinese currency's exchange rate has again surfaced, particularly after
China outshone all other countries around the world by registering an enviable
8.7 percent growth in 2009.</P>
      <P>U.S. President Barack Obama recently vowed to keep pressure on countries whose
currencies have been unnaturally undervalued and whose markets have not been
open enough in proportion to thier economic strength.</P>
      <P>Obama's statement should not be taken lightly, as it could be a harbinger for a
"monetary war" over currency exchange rates that might stymie the current
fragile global economic recovery and send the world's financial markets into
disarray again.</P>
      <P>Thanks to its continued huge trade surpluses, China had grossed more than US$2.4
trillion in foreign exchange reserves as of the end of 2009. The amount was only
US$330 billion in 2003. The figures indicate how fast China's trade surplus is
growing.</P>
      <P>In terms of normal market mechanisms, countries that enjoy huge trade surpluses
should allow their currencies to appreciate to reflect their economic might.
Otherwise, their trade partners and competitors will not have any more means to
trade with them.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the United States has incurred a huge trade deficit with China,
partly because China has deliberately pegged its currency, the renminbi, to the
U.S. greenback at a fixed rate -- about RMB6.83 to the U.S. dollar at present.</P>
      <P>By so doing, the Chinese currency has also depreciated against the currencies of
other major countries such as the euro and the Japanese yen, which has in turn
allowed China to enjoy trade surpluses with European countries and Japan.</P>
      <P>In the long run, many countries could join the United States in protest against
China's refusal to allow its currency to appreciate to a level that fairly
reflects its economic might and trade competitiveness.</P>
      <P>More worrisome is that some developing countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia and even Taiwan and South Korea, have also been hurt by the renminbi's
unnaturally low value. Worse still, these countries will not adjust their
currency exchange rates or monetary policies until China appreciates its
currency, for fear of undermining their trade competitiveness.</P>
      <P>With international pressure increasing on China, the renminbi appreciation may
be an inevitable trend. Taiwan's government and businesses should be prepared
and should work out response measures in advance to mitigate any possible
adverse impact.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou hosted a party at the Presidential Office Sunday to
entertain some 400 disadvantaged children to mark Chinese New Year's Day, which
this year falls on Feb. 14.</P>
      <P>The children  were mostly from orphanages,  foster  homes, low-income families,
families displaced by Typhoon Morakot last year, kindergartens in aboriginal
areas, and those who are mentally or physically challenged.</P>
      <P>At the party, Ma spoon-fed a wheelchair-bound 10-year-old girl who suffers from
cerebral palsy with cake. He said to the child's grandmother, who was also
present that "it is indeed tough for you (to raise a child like this)."</P>
      <P>Foot and mouth painter and calligrapher Chen Wen-chieh was one of the few adult
guests at Sunday's function. Chen wrote with a brush held in his right foot the
Chinese character "yung, " meaning "courage," on a folding fan and gave it to Ma
as a present.</P>
      <P>In return, Ma also wrote with a brush -- although with his hand -- the Chinese
character, "ai, " meaning "love, " on another folding fan that he gave to Chen.</P>
      <P>He played  host to the children,  introducing  the nearly 100-year-old
Presidential Office building and telling them that "this is where I work."</P>
      <P>He told them that more than 500 typhoon evacuee families are moving into new
homes at the Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation Park built in
Shanlin township, Kaohsiung County, one of the areas hardest-hit by Morakot.</P>
      <P>"We hope that all the rest of the displaced families will be settled by the end
of this year," he went on.</P>
      <P>He called for the country to trust the government in its resolve and efforts to
facilitate post-disaster reconstruction despite the many difficulties and
challenges.</P>
      <P>Ma also urged the children to get vaccinated against influenza H1N1, saying that

      <P>Tourism is one of the six emerging industries that the President Ma Ying-jeou
administration has targeted for vigorous promotion to boost Taiwan's
competitiveness and sustain its economic growth.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to realize the goal, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications has launched a program to select 10 potential sites for
intensified  development  into new tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's selection criteria, the qualified locations should
be unique and should be able to persuade foreign tourists to stay for at least a
day.</P>
      <P>Much to our disappointment, however, none of the five locations announced by the
ministry so far meet its own criteria, far less symbolize Taiwan's image or
special characteristics.</P>
      <P>The five places selected by the ministry are Taichung City's Chingkuo Boulevard
near the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, the vicinity  of Taipei City's
Confucius  Temple,  Taipei County's Shuinandong, Jinguashi and Jiufen area,
Changhua County's Lugang and Fuhsing townships, and Pingtung County's Hengchun
old town.</P>
      <P>While the ministry is eyeing developing Chingkuo Boulevard into a shopping
center patterned after Paris' Champs-Elysees dotted with brand name stores, the
other four areas are mostly historical relics with relative short histories in
terms of world standards.</P>
      <P>Our view is that none of them is unique or special enough to attract foreign
tourists to travel a long way to visit. The ministry should change its way of
thinking, otherwise, it will only end up misleading travelers into overlooking
other Taiwan locations that are charming and far more worthy of a visit. (Feb.

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that he will respect the legislature if it moves
to amend the Constitution in deciding whether either a presidential or cabinet
political system should be adopted.</P>
      <P>Wu said both systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, and that he
will respect the legislative decision.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to a proposal raised by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Huang Yi-
chiao at a luncheon party the premier attended with lawmakers from
constituencies in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said a cabinet government system would be more suitable for Taiwan and
that a constitutional amendment to achieve this end is necessary.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the inflated power wielded by the president under the
presidential system tends to cause national uncertainty should the head of the
state appear motivated to incite ethnic confrontations or negative political
competition for personal gain, which he said can be seen in many other
countries.</P>
      <P>Under a cabinet system, he contended, national conflict is unlikely,  as all the
cabinet ministers,  selected from among legislators who are all elected by
voters, are subject to oversight by the public.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will step up efforts to unify the "pan-blue camp"
ahead of the year-end elections for mayors and councilors of the five special
municipalities, the party's top day-to-day manager said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Previous records show that the `pan-blue camp' has scored wins in major
elections only when its ranks stood united and worked in concert," said KMT
Secretary-General King Pu-tsung.</P>
      <P>Noting that preparing for the year-end elections is like playing a game of
chess, King said the "pan-blue camp" must consolidate at every step and act
cautiously if it wants to emerge as a true victor.</P>
      <P>In terms of candidate nominations, King continued, the KMT will adopt a flexible
approach in which each area's special political or demographic situations will
be taken into account.</P>
      <P>"We will speed up our preparations and come up with a nomination list as soon as
possible," he added.</P>
      <P>He was responding to reports that the KMT's pan-blue allies -- the New Party and
the People First Party -- will nominate their own members to run for seats on
the councils of the five special municipalities.</P>
      <P>Sources said the two KMT-allied pro-unification parties will field their own
candidates in the elections because they are dissatisfied with what they see as
President Ma Ying-jeou's inability to take firm steps to promote closer
relations across the Taiwan Strait and to more effectively investigate
corruption allegations against officials of the former Democratic  Progressive
Party administration.</P>
      <P>New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming said recently that his party will definitely
nominate  its own candidates  in each Taipei City constituency, as well as in
some districts in the four other municipalities.</P>
      <P>People First Party Chairman James Soong has also been preparing for the year-end
elections. In addition to fielding candidates for councilor elections, the party
is also considering fielding hopefuls for the mayoral elections in some of the
municipalities, sources close to the party said.</P>
      <P>The four other municipalities are New Taipei City (an upgrade of Taipei County),
Taichung City (a merger of Taichung City and Taichung County), Tainan City (a

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange market experienced roller coaster fluctuations
Saturday,  attributed by traders to central bank intervention aimed at
discouraging speculation that it fears could hurt the economy.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar rose by NT$0.487 to as high as NT$31.70 against the U.S.
dollar Saturday, its strongest intraday level since Jan. 15, before paring its
gains to end the session largely flat at NT$32.184.</P>
      <P>The dramatic fluctuations were widely seen as the result of the central bank's
action to combat hot money, however, they also signaled the central bank's
determination to hold the local currency at around NT$32.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue: Liberty
Times:</P>
      <P>The central bank's intervention was in line with its monetary policy aimed at
maintaining commodity prices and financial stability for long-term economic
growth.</P>
      <P>Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan warned in a report released Saturday that
the nature of a financial crisis is reflected in financial instability and big
ups and downs in the assets market.</P>
      <P>Perng attributed  the global financial crisis partially to financial supervisory
systems' failure to keep up the pace of financial liberalization and the process
of financial innovation.</P>
      <P>The development of a more market-oriented global financial system coupled with
financial liberalization and globalization has not only given a boost to the
financial and banking sector and facilitated the free flow of capital across
borders, but has also triggered financial crises, according to Perng.</P>
      <P>He said finding ways to prevent financial crises in the future will be a key
issue all over the world. Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The central bank said in the report that inaccurate forecasts by researchers
should also be held responsible for the financial crisis.</P>
      <P>It ascribed the financial crisis to people's irrationality that might have
caused assets bubbles, as well as illegal operations by financial institutions
such as providing fake account books and hollowing out company assets.</P>
      <P>The central bank said financial supervisors should conduct reforms that include
strengthening the monitoring of financial institutions, giving the central bank
a free hand to correct economic imbalances and keep inflation under control.</P>
      <P>It also suggested that policy makers should not underestimate the risks of
deflation and the near-zero interest rate policy, but rather should adopt more
flexible monetary policies.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Touching on measures to prevent destructive bubbles in the property and stock
markets, the central bank noted that it will ask banks to tighten their lending
risk management to avoid assets bubbles instead of raising interest rates or
using other monetary tools to help bring down housing prices.</P>

      <P>An annual floral season in Meinung township in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung
County opened Sunday, drawing large crowds of holidaymakers to the blossom-
drenched area.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said he took the initiative six years ago
to encourage farmers in Meinung to plant cosmos and other flowers on their land
during the winter when their farms were lying fallow, in order to create a draw
for visitors.</P>
      <P>"Today, the event has blossomed into a new tourist attraction, bringing
additional income to local residents, " Yang said, adding that 60 hectares of
farm land in Meinung township have planted cosmos and other flowers this eyar.</P>
      <P>Although several other Taiwan townships have followed suit, Meinung, a Hakka
stronghold, is the only place where cosmos blooms around the Lunar New Year
festival, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Last year, more than 200,000 people visited Meinung during the floral season,
generating lucrative business opportunities for traditional Hakka-style eateries
in the township, Yang said.</P>
      <P>This year's floral season will run until March 10, Yang said, adding that
neighboring Chishan township now also boasts many floral farms with colorful
cosmos and other blossoms.</P>
      <P>A national acrobatics troupe Mongolia has been invited to perform during the
Feb. 14-21 Lunar New Year holiday and many other cultural and entertainment
programs will also be staged during the period.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tourism is one of the six emerging industries that the President Ma Ying-jeou
administration has targeted for vigorous promotion to boost Taiwan's
competitiveness and sustain its economic growth.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to realize the goal, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications has launched a program to select 10 potential sites for
intensified  development  into new tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's selection criteria, the qualified locations should
be unique and should be able to persuade foreign tourists to stay for at least a
day.</P>
      <P>Much to our disappointment, however, none of the five locations announced by the
ministry so far meet its own criteria, far less symbolize Taiwan's image or
special characteristics.</P>
      <P>The five places selected by the ministry are Taichung City's Chingkuo Boulevard
near the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, the vicinity  of Taipei City's
Confucius  Temple,  Taipei County's Shuinandong, Jinguashi and Jiufen area,
Changhua County's Lugang and Fuhsing townships, and Pingtung County's Hengchun
old town.</P>
      <P>While the ministry is eyeing developing Chingkuo Boulevard into a shopping
center patterned after Paris' Champs-Elysees dotted with brand name stores, the
other four areas are mostly historical relics with relative short histories in
terms of world standards.</P>
      <P>Our view is that none of them is unique or special enough to attract foreign
tourists to travel a long way to visit. The ministry should change its way of
thinking, otherwise, it will only end up misleading travelers into overlooking
other Taiwan locations that are charming and far more worthy of a visit. (Feb.

    <HEADLINE>Premier: No preference for presidential over cabinet system</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Sunday that he will respect the legislature if it moves
to amend the Constitution in deciding whether either a presidential or cabinet
political system should be adopted.</P>
      <P>Wu said both systems have their own advantages and disadvantages, and that he
will respect the legislative decision.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to a proposal raised by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Huang Yi-
chiao at a luncheon party the premier attended with lawmakers from
constituencies in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said a cabinet government system would be more suitable for Taiwan and
that a constitutional amendment to achieve this end is necessary.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the inflated power wielded by the president under the
presidential system tends to cause national uncertainty should the head of the
state appear motivated to incite ethnic confrontations or negative political
competition for personal gain, which he said can be seen in many other
countries.</P>
      <P>Under a cabinet system, he contended, national conflict is unlikely,  as all the
cabinet ministers,  selected from among legislators who are all elected by
voters, are subject to oversight by the public.</P>
      <P>Many political  analysts have categorized  Taiwan's present government system as
a "mix" between the two systems, with the premier -- the head of the
administration and held accountable to the legislature -- being actually the
president's "chief of staff."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT secretary-general vows to consolidate pan-blue camp</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will step up efforts to unify the "pan-blue camp"
ahead of the year-end elections for mayors and councilors of the five special
municipalities, the party's top day-to-day manager said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Previous records show that the `pan-blue camp' has scored wins in major
elections only when its ranks stood united and worked in concert," said KMT
Secretary-General King Pu-tsung.</P>
      <P>Noting that preparing for the year-end elections is like playing a game of
chess, King said the "pan-blue camp" must consolidate at every step and act
cautiously if it wants to emerge as a true victor.</P>
      <P>In terms of candidate nominations, King continued, the KMT will adopt a flexible
approach in which each area's special political or demographic situations will
be taken into account.</P>
      <P>"We will speed up our preparations and come up with a nomination list as soon as
possible," he added.</P>
      <P>He was responding to reports that the KMT's pan-blue allies -- the New Party and
the People First Party -- will nominate their own members to run for seats on
the councils of the five special municipalities.</P>
      <P>Sources said the two KMT-allied pro-unification parties will field their own
candidates in the elections because they are dissatisfied with what they see as
President Ma Ying-jeou's inability to take firm steps to promote closer
relations across the Taiwan Strait and to more effectively investigate
corruption allegations against officials of the former Democratic  Progressive
Party administration.</P>
      <P>New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming said recently that his party will definitely
nominate  its own candidates  in each Taipei City constituency, as well as in
some districts in the four other municipalities.</P>
      <P>People First Party Chairman James Soong has also been preparing for the year-end
elections. In addition to fielding candidates for councilor elections, the party
is also considering fielding hopefuls for the mayoral elections in some of the
municipalities, sources close to the party said.</P>
      <P>The four other municipalities are New Taipei City (an upgrade of Taipei County),
Taichung City (a merger of Taichung City and Taichung County), Tainan City (a
merger of Tainan City and Tainan County), and Kaohsiung City (a merger of
Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County.)</P>

(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange market experienced roller coaster fluctuations
Saturday,  attributed by traders to central bank intervention aimed at
discouraging speculation that it fears could hurt the economy.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar rose by NT$0.487 to as high as NT$31.70 against the U.S.
dollar Saturday, its strongest intraday level since Jan. 15, before paring its
gains to end the session largely flat at NT$32.184.</P>
      <P>The dramatic fluctuations were widely seen as the result of the central bank's
action to combat hot money, however, they also signaled the central bank's
determination to hold the local currency at around NT$32.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue: Liberty
Times:</P>
      <P>The central bank's intervention was in line with its monetary policy aimed at
maintaining commodity prices and financial stability for long-term economic
growth.</P>
      <P>Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan warned in a report released Saturday that
the nature of a financial crisis is reflected in financial instability and big
ups and downs in the assets market.</P>
      <P>Perng attributed  the global financial crisis partially to financial supervisory
systems' failure to keep up the pace of financial liberalization and the process
of financial innovation.</P>
      <P>The development of a more market-oriented global financial system coupled with
financial liberalization and globalization has not only given a boost to the
financial and banking sector and facilitated the free flow of capital across
borders, but has also triggered financial crises, according to Perng.</P>
      <P>He said finding ways to prevent financial crises in the future will be a key
issue all over the world. Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The central bank said in the report that inaccurate forecasts by researchers
should also be held responsible for the financial crisis.</P>
      <P>It ascribed the financial crisis to people's irrationality that might have
caused assets bubbles, as well as illegal operations by financial institutions
such as providing fake account books and hollowing out company assets.</P>
      <P>The central bank said financial supervisors should conduct reforms that include
strengthening the monitoring of financial institutions, giving the central bank
a free hand to correct economic imbalances and keep inflation under control.</P>
      <P>It also suggested that policy makers should not underestimate the risks of
deflation and the near-zero interest rate policy, but rather should adopt more
flexible monetary policies.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Touching on measures to prevent destructive bubbles in the property and stock
markets, the central bank noted that it will ask banks to tighten their lending
risk management to avoid assets bubbles instead of raising interest rates or
using other monetary tools to help bring down housing prices.</P>
      <P>It also said it will work to maintain order in the foreign exchange market to
damp down expectations that the New Taiwan dollar will appreciate significantly.</P>

      <P>Republic of China first lady, Chow Mei-ching, on Sunday paid a visit to the
Vancouver Art Gallery where Taiwanese artist Lin Ming-hung is exhibiting his art
of packaging using traditional Taiwanese floral cloth.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is part of the Cultural Olympiad being held in celebration of the
2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.</P>
      <P>Upon arrival at the gallery, Chow and her entourage were greeted by the chief
curator.</P>
      <P>The facade of the gallery is draped with three large brightly colored cloth
hangings featuring traditional  Taiwanese  floral patterns, which have attracted
the attention of many tourists.</P>
      <P>As photography is prohibited inside the gallery, Chow politely asked a group of
Taiwan reporters covering her current overseas trip to stop following her to
avoid breaking the museum's regulations or disturbing other visitors.</P>
      <P>Chow arrived in Vancouver Feb. 4 as the honorary head of Cloud Gate Dance
Theatre of Taiwan. She is the first ROC first lady ever to visit Canada since
diplomatic ties were severed between the two countries in 1970.</P>
      <P>She attended a Cloud Gate performance Feb. 5 at the Cultural Olympiad being held
in the city.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Chow visited the Museum of Vancouver,  where Taiwan-born Canadian
artist Ed Pien is staging a solo show titled "Tracing Night" -- a large maze-
like installation that combines drawing, video and sound to recreate the
phenomenon of night and darkness.</P>
      <P>Chow later visited the "Lantern Forest" -- a corridor that displays over 2,000
lanterns created by children from Canada and Taiwan to celebrate the upcoming
Lunar New Year Festival and the opening of the Vancouver Winter Olympics.</P>
      <P>During her stay, Chow was also scheduled to attend a book donation ceremony at
the Vancouver Public Library, where she was to read stories to local children.</P>
      <P>Before the Vancouver leg of her trip, she had accompanied the Cloud Gate dancers
to Washington, D.C. and Chicago in the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>02/08/10  11:34:08
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After interviewing President Ma Ying-jeou Feb. 4 in her capacity as founder of
the Formosa Weekly, former Vice President Annette Lu said that she had relayed
to opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen the
president's request for a meeting.</P>
      <P>Tsai offhandedly turned down the president's request the next day, saying "the
meeting should be meaningful. If it is only a political gesture, there is no
need for it."</P>
      <P>When Lee Teng-hui was president, he often exchanged views with opposition
leaders who freely offered him advice.</P>
      <P>But opposition  party leaders were reluctant to meet with President Chen Shui-
bian when he was in power from 2000 to 2008 because he halted construction of
the Fourth Nuclear Plant hours after a high-profile meeting with then-Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan who asked him not to stop the project.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen's groundless claim the People First Party Chairman James Soong
had met secretly with a senior Beijing official in the United States soon after
their meeting at the Taipei Guest House was a slap in face to Soong.</P>
      <P>For Chen, meetings with opposition leaders were simply political gambits.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is the country's most inept leader in terms of political
maneuvering, which has contributed in part to his plunging approval ratings.
Tsai Ing-wen should not measure Ma by her own standards.</P>
      <P>If Ma was more adroit at political maneuvering, as Chen Shui-bian was, he would
not have ended up in the political plight he is in today.</P>
      <P>Tsai's worry that the meeting would be meaningless could be addressed through
careful advance preparation.</P>
      <P>The question is not who will gain more from such a meeting, but whether our

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Innovation bill will benefit SMEs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/08/10  12:24:58
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has identified a draft bill to promote industrial
innovation as a major strategy in the effort to develop Taiwan into a global
innovation center, an Asia-Pacific trade and economic hub, and the operational
headquarters of international enterprises.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with Premier Wu Deh-yih on Feb.6, Ma gave a directive for an all-
out effort to be made to pass the bill, which failed to clear the legislative
floor before the last session closed at the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>President Ma has said that the provisions of the draft statute should not just
benefit large enterprises.</P>
      <P>The day after a meeting with the president, Premier Wu said the bill, which is
meant to fill the void left by the invalidated Statute for Upgrading Industry,
will also include provisions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and
traditional industries.</P>
      <P>Under the bill, such companies will be entitled to government subsidies of
NT$10,000 (US$311) per month for each job that they provide to an unemployed
person, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The original version of the draft bill stated that only big international
enterprises with operational headquarters in Taiwan would be entitled to a
preferential 15 percent business income tax rate.</P>
      <P>That article in the bill came under criticism as an "anomaly," in light of the
fact that there are currently only four companies that would have qualified --
Hon Hai, Guanta, ASUSTek and Acer.</P>
      <P>After hearing Wu's briefing on the draft bill Saturday, Ma said the article
should be scrapped.</P>
      <P>As a result, the government decided to adopt the preferential taxation system
for Taiwan-headquartered businesses,  which was proposed by the Cabinet under
the leadership of former Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.</P>
      <P>The proposal states that all companies will be subject to a business income tax
rate of 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>A draft statute to promote industrial innovation will be put on the agenda again
when the new legislative session opens at the end of the month.</P>
      <P>The new version of the bill proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
has undergone moderate changes with the addition of a new article to help create
employment.</P>
      <P>On the controversial "operational headquarters article," the MOEA said there
will be clearly defined regulations pertaining to big international enterprises
headquartered in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The draft bill has been listed as top priority when the legislature reconvenes
on Feb. 23.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Election fever is heating up again in Taiwan with the approach of the
legislative by-elections in four counties on Feb. 27 and the year-end polls in
five new municipalities.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of local media coverage of the event:</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, former
Vice President Annette Lu, and former Premier Su Tzeng-chang went to Taoyuan
County Sunday to stump for Huang Jen-chu, the DPP candidate there in the
upcoming legislative by-election.</P>
      <P>During the campaign event, Su described the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , which
holds over two-thirds of the legislative seats, as a "big bus rolling downhill
without brakes." The situation will get worse if the KMT is allowed to win the
by-elections in the four counties, namely Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Chiayi and Hualien,
he added.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih was also in Taoyuan Sunday stumping for the KMT candidate
Chen Shueh-sheng. Wu said at the campaign rally that if Chen is elected, the KMT
administration will be better able to push its policies with greater support
from Taoyuan, one of the biggest constituencies in the country.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu was rated in a recent public opinion poll as a superstar
who will score a convincing victory in the Taichung municipality, a merger of
Taichung City and Taichung County.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 55 percent of residents in the greater Taichung area
support the idea of Hu as the KMT's candidate in Taichung, while 7 percent are
backing former Interior Minister Liao Liao-yi, and 6 percent are behind KMT
Legislator Lu Shiow-yen.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that if DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen throws her hat into the
ring for the Taichung mayoral election, she will win 23 percent support,
compared to Hu's 51 percent.</P>
      <P>Two DPP heavyweights -- former Premier Frank Hsieh and former Cabinet member Lin
Chia-lung -- will each draw 15 percent support if they decide to run, the poll
found.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Sunday that it would be best to select the KMT's
candidates for the mayoral elections in the five new municipalities by means of
public opinion polls.</P>
      <P>Hu suggested the KMT forego primaries as they tend to "kill relations."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung recently told Taipei Magistrate
Chou Hsi-wei that the KMT leadership has decided to select its Taipei County
candidate for the year-end elections based on public opinion polls to be
conducted by three survey firms.</P>

      <P>British taxis, subway trains and news media have all become new vehicles to help
attract visitors to Taiwan, as part of a massive tourism promotion blitz
launched in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau has paid 75 classic London black cabs a total of 250,000
British pounds (about US$390,625) to carry "Where else but Taiwan" posters on
their daily street cruises over the next three months.</P>
      <P>The bureau has also commissioned British public relations and creative
advertisement companies to design and put out 1,000 ads, which promote Taiwan as
Asia's least known travel destination, in the London subway system weekly over
the next six weeks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-themed promotional anime will also be displayed on panels close to
escalators in some very busy subway stations during that period.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Tourism Bureau will place promotional ads in mass-circulation
publications, including The Sunday Times Travel Magazine,  The Daily Telegraph

    <HEADLINE>DPP presses for legislative task force on cross-strait affairs</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) reiterated Monday what it sees
as the importance of setting up a legislative task force to oversee cross-Taiwan
Strait affairs, including a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>According to DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang, 74.1 percent of the public agree that
a cross-strait task force should be established in the Legislative Yuan to
supervise the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The spokesman called for President Ma Ying-jeou to explain the administration's
stance on the legislative cross-strait task force issue when he briefs the
public on the progress of the ECFA talks Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai quoted the results of a poll conducted by the DPP earlier this month as
showing that 68.2 percent of the people who answered the poll do not think the
legislature is able to effectively supervise the administration's cross-strait
policies and only 20.9 percent of the respondents said the legislature is able
to do so.</P>
      <P>"Even a high of 58 percent of the respondents who are largely considered
supporters of the ruling Kuomintang do not think the legislature has any teeth
as far as the government's cross-strait policies are concerned," he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai continued that 52.2 percent of the respondents oppose Taiwan's plan to
recognize Chinese academic credentials, while 65.2 percent are against a plan to
recognize professional licenses issued in China.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the DPP conducted the poll Feb. 3-4. A total of 978 valid
samples were collected in the survey, which had a confidence level of 95 percent
and a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, Tsai said.</P>

      <P>on Feb. 3 revoked the validity of three paid-in capital increases by Pacific
Logistics Corp., which put into question the Far Eastern Group's control of Sogo
Department Store.</P>
      <P>The ministry's move, which was in line with a court judgment, deserves praise,
even though the Far Eastern Group has appealed the MOEA decision and the
question of control over Sogo is still up in the air.</P>
      <P>It is expected that prosecutors will reopen a probe into transactions pertaining
to Sogo, as requested by its former owner.</P>
      <P>By the same token, we urge prosecutors to launch a new investigation into the
second wave of financial reforms during which many state-run financial
institutes were sold to private companies amid rumors of corruption and illegal
influence peddling.</P>
      <P>None of the rumors were confirmed in an ensuring probe by prosecutors during the
administration of former President Chen Shui-bian, who was allegedly at the
center of the scandal.</P>
      <P>The Sogo case bore out the falsehood of a widely held concept that the collapse
of giant business groups would cause great tumult in the society and should be
prevented at all costs.</P>
      <P>This theory is often aired by business tycoons and senior government officials
who prefer to maintain the status quo and protect vested interests, regardless
of fair play.</P>
      <P>The Sogo case proved that a decision could be rolled back after eight years
without much fuss. Why then cannot the second wave of financial reforms be
reexamined after only six years?</P>
      <P>The parties involved in the Sogo case were all private firms, but the financial
reform concerned not only the private financial groups that took over state-run
banking institutes,  but also public interests. Therefore, it is much more
worthy of a fresh probe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to pursue water-saving measures: economics minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is promoting a nationwide water conservation campaign that sets the goal
of reducing the average amount of water consumed per person per day from the
present 274 liters to 250 liters.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang described the campaign to
counteract the drought in a report at the Presidential Office's monthly
gathering Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih said the ministry hopes to build Taiwan into a water-saving society  and
has  outlined  measures,  including  implementing preferential water rates and
providing subsidies for people who purchase water-saving products, to encourage
people to reduce their water consumption.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has been promoting water conservation since he assumed
office in May 2008. In that year, his administration set a water consumption
ceiling in the hope of saving Taiwan from drought crises.</P>
      <P>On the question of how much 250 liters of water represents in terms of household
use, Ma has said that flushing the toilet consumes 6-12 liters, while a complete
cycle of a washing machine uses up to 40 liters of water.</P>
      <P>In his report, Shih pointed out that in the period between September 2009 and
January, among the 12 major reservoirs in Taiwan, only Xinshan Reservoir in the
Keelung area, Feitsui Reservoir in Taipei County,  and Lantan-Renyitan Reservoir
in Chiayi County received rainfall that either surpassed or approached their
average annual levels.</P>
      <P>The rainfall at other reservoirs has been less than 70 percent of the average
annual level, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's annual water consumption is around 18 billion tons, 4.3 billion tons of
which comes from reservoirs. However, the current effective storage capacity of
the more than 40 reservoirs in the country recorded a combined total of only 1.9
billion tons.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent weather forecast that predicted that rainfall in the first
three  months  of the year  will be "toward  the lower-than-normal level, " Shih
said that "we must face the water resource problem seriously."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Stock market plunge exposes rebound lie</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/08/10  15:08:03
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan stock market rose a whopping 78 percent last year, but over the past
month, it has plunged 12 percent. The bearish performance has caught the public
off-guard.</P>
      <P>Why has there been such a big plunge? Both European and U.S. stock markets have
taken hits recently as investors worry about the debt crisis enveloping Europe,
but the recent local stock market fall of over 1,000 points has been nothing but
the result of weak economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Last year's brilliant stock market performance was no reflection of what
President Ma Ying-jeou vaunted as a "V-shaped" economic rebound, but was due
mainly to the influx of funds and international hot money.</P>
      <P>In other words, the stunning surge last year was not because of substantial
economic improvements. On the contrary, Taiwan's economic growth and
unemployment rate have been the worst in years.</P>
      <P>The incompetent Ma administration wants to claim the glory for economic recovery
after seeing the rising stock market, but his big lie has been exposed in just
one month. (Feb. 8, 2010)</P>

(Feb. 8, 2010)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid reports of debt crises in three southern European states, Taiwan's central
bank last weekend unveiled a long-planned report on the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The report analyzes in detail the causes of the worldwide financial crisis,
response measures adopted by the United States and major European countries,
necessary financial reforms, suggestions on supervision and control of
derivatives trading risks, and other relevant topics.</P>
      <P>The report, which also touches on macroeconomic theory and the international
monetary system, is the most systematic research on critical economic issues
since the world financial meltdown started in September 2008.</P>
      <P>The report not only answers  questions  but also provides insightful and
inspiring policy initiatives for long-term economic development.</P>
      <P>Some of its proposals are especially worthy of attention because of their
potential to significantly shape future economic policies.</P>
      <P>First, the financial crisis has again inspired thoughts on property market risk
control in the formulation of economic policy. In the pre-crisis period,  the
mainstream theory assumed that financial market fluctuation would have a
secondary rather than a primary effect on real economy.</P>
      <P>Based on such thinking, central banks around the world for years tended to offer
money to cope with property bubbles, which in turn often sowed the seeds for a
new set of problems and exacerbated the situation.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the global financial crunch, a new approach of "prevention is
better than cure" is taking hold in the global community. It requires
governments around the world to pay more heed to fluctuations of property prices
to avoid another bubble explosion.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, the central bank's main function has centered around controlling
inflation through adjustment of money supply.</P>
      <P>The recent global financial crisis, however, indicated that low inflation would
not necessarily help maintain financial stability, as unusually low interest
rates could fuel speculation on property, crude oil and stock markets in
emerging countries.</P>
      <P>In the future, control of inflation should not be the only goal of the central
bank's monetary policy, which should instead place equal emphasis on consumer
price stability and the overall health of financial markets.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  financial  supervision  should  be  vigorously strengthened,
particularly in the area of controlling derivative trading risks.</P>
      <P>In light of the global changes in financial theories, we hope our central  bank
will cooperate  more closely with the Financial Supervisory Commission in the
future to oversee the domestic market.</P>

      <P>The average starting salary for female workers in Taiwan is about 18 percent
lower than the average for their male counterparts, according to the results of
a survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>As years go by in the workplace, the salary gap between female and male workers
continues to widen, and in seven to nine years, the gap could have widened to
some 30.6 percent, the poll conducted by 1111 Job Bank in 2009 found.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted over the whole of 2009, found that although both male and
female workers in Taiwan suffered from declining salaries last year, the
starting salary for male workers averaged NT$29,711 (US$928) per month, while
that for female workers averaged NT$25,066, representing a gap of 18 percent.</P>
      <P>The average monthly salary increased to NT$39,681 for males five to seven years
into their jobs, while that for their female counterparts climbed to an average
of just NT$30,971, a gap of 28 percent.</P>
      <P>Seven to nine years into their jobs, males received an average monthly salary of
NT$41,846, compared to NT$32,403 for females, representing a gap of 30.59
percent, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Henry Ho, public relations director of the 1111 Job Bank, said most males work
in technical or engineering fields or hold core positions in the workplace,
while most females are given service or support jobs, facts that contribute to
the salary gap and the disproportionate increases over the years.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ho said, pregnancy and family care also contribute to hinder
females' career prospects.</P>
      <P>Finding ways to narrow the salary gap and observe workplace gender equality
remain issues that need to be tackled by both the government and the private
sectors, Ho added.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the starting monthly salary averaged NT$38,939 for
first-time workers with a master's degree in 2009, marking a year-on-year
decline of 9.49 percent.</P>
      <P>The starting salary averaged NT$27,150 per month for first-time workers with a
college diploma, representing a decline of 5.93 percent year on year, the survey
found.</P>

      <P>The bra is more than just an undergarment worn by women to support their
breasts. In addition to giving a desirable contour to the bust, it catches the

world market worth billions of dollars.</P>
      <P>Female entertainers snap up bras that fallter their bosoms and highlight their
cleavages to enhance their sexuality. No wonder a well-known clothing designer
has said that without bras, there would be no garment industry.</P>
      <P>Ever since women shed their loose garments in the 14th century, underwear
tailored to accommodate the breasts has become fashionable, to the great delight

      <P>Feminine is the superior gender, as modern women have become the most attractive
people in human history owing to the well-developed cosmetics and garment
industry, and their beauty would shame that of Helen of Troy.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder many men want to transform themselves into women through surgery

      <P>In Thailand, transsexual performances are one of the pillars of the tourism

    <TEXT>
      <P>Football fans in Taiwan had a chance to watch Super Bowl XLIV live and feel the
same excitement as audiences back in the United States. The difference is they
had to get up early rather than stay up late, which was exactly what they did
Monday to see the New Orleans Saints win their first Super Bowl.</P>
      <P>The game was broadcast live at eight locations in Taipei and in Taiwan's second
largest city Kaohsiung, at six sports restaurants and the American Institute in
Taiwan's (AIT's) offices in both cities, for fans to watch the biggest U.S.
sports event of the year.</P>
      <P>The game kicked off at 6:25 p.m. Sunday U.S. eastern time, which meant fans in
Taiwan had to get up early Monday to catch the kickoff at 7:25 a.m. local time.
But that did not deter them.</P>
      <P>Canadian Lalit Golani, a former college offensive lineman who arrived in Taiwan
two days ago on a two-week tour, said he was surprised to learn about the live
broadcasts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>What he found even more surprising, he said, and was the sight of more than 200
screaming fans packed into the Brass Monkey pub in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>"I think this game will be a toss-up. What do you think? " Golani said. Three
hours later, the Saints had beaten the Indianapolis Colts 31-17 to win their
first NFL title in their 43-year history.</P>
      <P>The game was tight in the first half,  which ended with Indianapolis holding a
10-6 lead, but the tension was broken by the funny TV commercials that had fans
laughing and applauding.</P>
      <P>A man surnamed Tsai, wearing the No. 9 jersey of Saints quarterback Drew Brees,
chanted with his friends whenever New Orleans gained ground.</P>
      <P>Brees tied a Super Bowl record with 32 completions and was named Most Valuable
Player of the game.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he skipped work to watch the live broadcast and that he idolizes Colts
quarterback Peyton Manning.</P>
      <P>"I also brought Manning's jersey with me but since my friend's a Saints fan,
we're going to root for New Orleans today," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>It seemed that the Saints fans in the pub were louder and outnumbered the Colts
supporters, some of whom were diehard fans.</P>
      <P>Jay Lin, an associate research fellow at the National Center for Research on
Earthquake Engineering, said he supported the Colts because he was educated at
the University of Illinois.</P>
      <P>"I've been following American football since high school when I was on the
Jianguo High School rugby team, " said Lin.</P>
      <P>"It is natural for me to support Midwest sports teams such as the Chicago Bears
and Indianapolis because of my alma mater, " Lin said, adding that when he's on
business trips in the U.S. he takes the time to watch National Football League
(NFL) games live whenever possible.</P>
      <P>The NFL has not been  very  popular  in Taiwan  because, traditionally, baseball
and basketball are the dominant sports here, Lin said. But it has become even
harder to follow American football since sports channels in the country stopped
carrying NFL games three years ago, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With China's growing economy creating more jobs, the number of Chinese stowaways
who made their way into Taiwan dropped sharply last year, a Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian said the number of Chinese stowaways dropped to
246 in 2009, down almost 96 percent from the 6,000 that came to Taiwan in 1993,
when the number of Chinese people risking their lives on boats to enter Taiwan
illegally reached its peak.</P>
      <P>With cross-Taiwan  Strait relations  improving  and Chinese authorities taking
back Chinese stowaways more quickly, only 34 of them remain detained in Taiwan
at present, Kao said.</P>
      <P>"China's  economy  is  growing  and  generating  more  job opportunities, so
there is no need for Chinese people to become stowaways anymore," Kao added.</P>
      <P>Since the number of Chinese detainees has fallen to a mere 34, the SEF might not
visit them at their detention centers during the Chinese New Year, he said.</P>
      <P>Improved cross-Strait relations also generated more business for the SEF last
year, Kao noted. The number of people visiting the SEF to take care of a range
of issues rose more than 50 percent to 600 per day in 2009, while the number of
document certification cases increased 43 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan nationals made 4.48 million visits to China in 2009, up 2.5 percent from
the previous year, Kao said.</P>
      <P>A total of 960,000 Chinese people visited Taiwan in 2009, of which 600,000 were
tourists and the remainder came on business, he indicated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Because of the passage of an amendment to the Insurance Law, local insurance
companies have started refusing to provide accidental death insurance policies
for people aged under 15, directly affecting the minors' ability to take part in
outdoor activities.</P>
      <P>Since the amendment to Article 107 of Insurance Law governing child insurance
took effect Feb. 3, which states clearly that a policy holder must be 15 or
above before death benefits can be received in the event of the policyholder's
death,  insurance companies have stopped offering accidental death coverage for
people aged under 15.</P>
      <P>This change has caused many charity organizations to cancel outdoor activities
for disadvantaged children, while many schools have called a halt to graduation
trips.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said the amendment -- initiated following strong
pressure from C.V. Chen, a local attorney and president of the Red Cross Society
of the Republic of China, to prevent insurance fraud in which parents murder
their children in order to claim the insurance money -- was passed into law in a
spirit of goodwill, but he questioned whether the insurance companies had
overreacted to the change in the law.</P>
      <P>The amendment forbids any payments at all in the event of the death of an
insured child less than 15 years of age. It requires that if a minor is insured
for accidental death and dies before 15 years of age, the insurer should pay out
only the premium plus interest accrued.</P>
      <P>Previously, the beneficiary could receive up to NT$2 million (US$62,500) in
funeral expenses for an insured minor aged 14 or under, or those diagnosed as
suffering from a mental disorder who die before the age of 14.</P>
      <P>As the amendment does not apply retroactively to insurance policies sold prior
to the amendment, about 520,000 insured minors are unaffected by the amendment.</P>
      <P>Hu instructed Taichung city officials to find out whether the amendment is too
restrictive or prohibitive and to notify the administration and the Legislative
Yuan if there should be any remedial measures applied to the new law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: World takes beating due to PIGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/08/10  17:34:55
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Global stock and currency markets have taken a beating as investors worry about
the debt crisis in Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain, known now by the acronym
PIGS.</P>
      <P>People are joking that the world is suffering because of the PIGS, but their
woes have actually had major significance because of their fast and immediate
impact on world financial stability due to globalization.</P>
      <P>We should also more cautiously examine the existing financial system to see if
it contains inherently uncertain factors that have enabled the financial crisis
of 2008, the Dubai crisis and the credit crisis of the PIGS to deliver swift and
strong blows to global financial markets.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of economic theory, the huge double deficit of the United
States (its fiscal deficit and international trade deficit) should hurt the U.S.
dollar and cause it to depreciate in a major financial crisis, but the truth is
just the opposite.</P>
      <P>In other words, since the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate
system in 1971, the greenback is no longer the world's official settlement
currency, but in practice, it remains a major reserve currency for international
finance and trade.</P>
      <P>Being the dominant international reserve currency allows the United States to
print money in exchange for the real resources of other countries, which
obviously leads to an unfair distribution of international resources.</P>
      <P>The weak U.S. dollar is the currency of choice among money to finance the carry
trade, with the federal funds rate sitting consistently between 0-0.25 percent.
But the dollar tends to rise in times of financial crisis because of its status
as a safe haven. This double-edged role is a fundamental problem in
international finance.</P>
      <P>Maybe the issue has become too big to deal with, but if major countries do not
address it and seek a basic solution, then international financial volatility
will be hard to bring under control and could even grow more turbulent. (Feb. 8,

      <P>The country's top economic planner, the Council for Economic Planning and

and Lieyu, also known as Xiao Kinmen, in that outlying county.</P>
      <P>Construction for the 5.43 km bridge between Hushia in Kinmen and Houtou on Lieyu
will begin by the end of this year with a total cost cost of NT$5.7 billion
(US$177.59 million) , according to the plan drawn up by the county.</P>
      <P>The plan will still require Cabinet approval.</P>
      <P>With 4.78 km of it stretching over the sea, the bridge will take six years to
build, with completion expected in 2105.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Wo-shih, who was present when the council approved the
plan, said the bridge is "necessary for the overall development of the county."</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the bridge will have two lanes, in addition to one bicycle lane
in either direction that could be converted into car lanes if necessary.</P>
      <P>The bridge will generate a net value of NT$2.6 billion in transportation cost
savings and tourism in the first five years of its opening, which would
represent a return of 8.21 percent on the investment, according to Lee.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's dream to spend the upcoming Lunar New Year
holiday with his family was shattered Monday when the Taiwan High Court ruled
that he remain in custody for another two months.</P>
      <P>The three-judge panel decided to continue holding him at a detention center
because many issues related to pending corruption and money laundering  charges
must still be investigated  and clarified.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and his wife Wu Shu-jen were sentenced to life in prison on Sept. 11,
2009 by the Taipei District Court and fined NT$200 million (US$6.13 million) and
NT$300 million, respectively, on several counts of corruption, including
embezzling money from a discretionary state affairs fund and taking bribes from
local businessmen.</P>
      <P>The high court panel took charge of Chen's case on Sept. 24 after he appealed
the ruling. The panel ruled that same day that Chen should remain in custody for

      <P>An exhibition exploring the histories of the English city of Liverpool and
southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung opened Monday at the Former British Consulate
Residence in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According to Christine Skinner, director of the British Council, the consulate
was built in 1879 and was the first building to be built in Taiwan under the
sponsorship of the British government, as well as the origin of cultural
exchanges between Britain and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Urban revival: The story of Liverpool, songs from the
Beatles and re-imagining Kaohsiung, " explores the theme of urban regeneration
and the creative industries in the two port cities, Skinner said.</P>
      <P>Utilizing modern retro-imagery and vinyl aesthetics, and with original tunes
from the Beatles, Skinner said the exhibition will show Liverpool's
revitalization, which she said has a great deal of similarity to Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According to an organizer from the British Council, the history of Liverpool can
be traced back more than 800 years. It was once an important port city and
visitors can now see the legacy of different eras in its development such as the
docks, transport facilities, factories and business buildings from the Age of
Discovery.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee listed Liverpool as a World
Heritage Site under the name: "Liverpool -- Maritime Mercantile City."</P>
      <P>Using Liverpool as an example, the Bureau of Cultural Affairs of the Kaohsiung

    <HEADLINE>CEPD approves plan to upgrade Suhua Highway</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
02/08/10  18:54:54

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) approved on Monday a
plan to upgrade the Suhua Highway on Taiwan's east coast, which it believes will
cut travel time between Suao and Hualien by 25 percent when construction is
completed in 2016.</P>
      <P>Under the plan to enhance the safety of the highway, seven tunnels covering 22.2
kilometers and 7.7 km of viaducts and bridges will be built to replace dangerous
sections of the road lining coastal cliffs, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The improved roadway will be 16.7 kilometers shorter than the existing single-
lane 118-km highway -- the main artery connecting Yilan County and Hualien City
that takes just under three hours to navigate and is vulnerable to landslides.</P>
      <P>Most of the new construction will take place on the 77-km section between Suao
and Chungte Township, which lies at the entrance to the central cross-island
highway leading to Taroko Gorge.</P>
      <P>It usually takes about two hours to cover this stretch of road, but the CEPD
said travel time will be cut to 72 minutes once the modified roadway is
completed.</P>
      <P>Construction on the highway upgrade, estimated to cost NT$40 billion, is
expected to begin in 2011, the CEPD added.</P>
      <P>Before construction begins, however, the proposed upgrade project must still
pass an environmental impact assessment review and then be approved by the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The CEPD stressed that the main purpose of fixing the existing highway is to
improve its safety, unlike other road upgrade plans that generally focus on
expanding capacity and cutting travel time.</P>
      <P>The feasibility study of the plan approved Monday by the CEPD was drafted by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) , which will undertake the
environment impact assessment review and propose a construction plan, which will
also need to be submitted to the CEPD for approval.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to build a more expensive expressway, the CEPD emphasized,
because improving the existing highway is still seen as the best solution.</P>
      <P>The controversial Suao-Hualien expressway was proposed more than a decade ago
but faced strong opposition by environmental experts and activists who believed
it would destroy the scenic beauty, flora, fauna and ecological balance in the
area.</P>
      <P>Proponents of the expressway argued that it would boost the economy in eastern
Taiwan, a region that is relatively underdeveloped and consists mostly of
farming townships.</P>

      <P>The humble tea egg, cheap and unassuming though it might be, has made an 80
-year-old vendor indispensable in the scenic area surrounding Sun Moon Lake, one
of Taiwan's most popular tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Chou Chin-pen was asked to inform the national scenic area administration in
advance of her day off because her tea egg stand is a "must-visit" from tourists
from China, the Chinese-language United Daily News reported Monday on its front
page.</P>
      <P>Daily sales on holidays could reach 4,000 eggs, which Chou cooks with local
black tea and dried mushrooms, she said.</P>
      <P>The eggs, priced at NT$10 apiece, help not only feed her big family but also
have benefits for related up- and downstream industries, the report said,
describing Chou as a legend of "plebeian economy."</P>
      <P>"Cheap and god quality" are perhaps the keywords for success during the economic
downturn tainted by high unemployment, shrinking incomes and an expanding gap
between rich and poor.</P>
      <P>While "saving" has become the golden principle for survival in an M-shape
economy -- in which wealthy people might spend NT$100 million in cash on a
Lamborghini while those on the other side cannot survive at all without
government relief -- cheap products that can be easily purchased are the new
trend, reported the Taipei-based newspaper China Times.</P>
      <P>In a commercial area in Taichung City, central Taiwan, a wooden street stand
selling iced black tea for NT$15 per cup has always drawn a long line of buyers.</P>
      <P>The stand owners, Yu Tsai-sin and his son, could never have imagined that their
small business, which began five years ago with sales of 20 to 30 cups a day,
would one day increase to more than 1,000 cups a day.</P>
      <P>Now Yu has opened a chain of 11 stands in the central Taiwan region.</P>
      <P>Yu's wife said even an everyday item like black tea has its value, touting the
tea they brew with locally grown tea as having a traditional flavor.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, he and his son traveled the country to find a recipe for
brewing black tea with the same flavor he remembered tasting in the countryside
when he was a boy.</P>
      <P>Holding fast to the principle of not increasing his price since starting the
business, his success has convinced him that running business on small profits
is the best marketing strategy.</P>

      <P>Around 15 percent of Chinese New Year specialities tested recently by the
Consumers' Foundation were found to contain excessive levels of germicides and
preservatives, the foundation said Monday.</P>
      <P>With less than a week to go before the first day of the Year of the Tiger Sunday
and consumers shopping feverishly for popular holiday foods, the foundation
tested 38 randomly selected samples of rice,  noodle, bean and processed
products for germicides and preservatives.</P>
      <P>Four were found to contain the germicide hydrogen peroxide, and one had an
excessively high level of preservatives. Two processed food products did not
list the product's preservatives on the label.</P>
      <P>The foundation said that although hydrogen peroxide has been confirmed to cause
cancer in animals, it is not carcinogenic in humans.</P>
      <P>But it will indiscriminately kill both good and bad bacteria in humans. If
people are exposed to it in low concentrations, it could still harm cells'
chromosomes.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, food additive regulations stipulate that germicides
can be used in processed fish products but not in other foods.</P>
      <P>"The public should exercise caution by smelling items when purchasing foods for
the Chinese New Year, " one foundation official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City's Department of Health said that nearly half of the bean
curd products sold in local markets and 15 percent of steamed cakes and white
radish cakes sold for New Year's festivities have excessive amounts of
preservatives.</P>

      <P>Brand name bell fruit produced in southern Taiwan's Nanchou Township will be
exported to Germany and France late this month for the first time, industry
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The fruit, also known as wax apples, is being grown by graduates of a fruit
plantation and marketing class sponsored by the Nanchou Farmers Association in
the southernmost county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Led by class leader Tsai Shun-teh, the 17 young entrepreneurs have worked hard
to improve their growing techniques over the years and are now searching for
overseas markets for their brand name "Honey Fruit."</P>
      <P>They began exporting their product to Canada some 10 years ago and successfully
tapped into the Chinese market in 2005.</P>
      <P>"Today, 'Honey Fruit' is one of the most popular gift items in China and Hong
Kong," Tsai said proudly.</P>
      <P>After many years of effort, the "Honey Fruit" passed the European Union's
rigorous quality tests and secured export certification three years ago and will
be shipped to Germany and France after the Lunar New Year holiday for the first
time, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>To maintain the fine quality of their bell fruit, Tsai said his class has
insisted on only one harvest per year. One local trading company has
consistently ordered 60 to 100 tons of the fruit for delivery to China and Hong
Kong annually, he added.</P>
      <P>Because of damage from Typhoon Morakot, which wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan
last August, the bell fruit harvest season in Nanchou started one month later
than normal, pushing the export season back.</P>
      <P>"Right now, our Honey Fruit is mainly being sold in the domestic market. The
harvest season is expected to peak after the Lunar New Year holiday when exports
will also shift into high gear," he said.</P>
      <P>This year's Lunar New Year holiday falls between Feb. 13 and Feb. 21.</P>

      <P>The government should step up its inspection of tea imported from China through
Vietnam as it contains excessive levels of pesticides and poses a serious health
threat, local tea farmers and an opposition lawmaker said Monday.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Pan Men-an accused the government
of failing to take action against the low quality tea products, even though they
were found to have high pesticide residues and their countries of origin were
not properly shown.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Monday, Pan displayed dried tea leaves that came from a
vacuum-packed bag to help the local farmers make their case.</P>
      <P>"The eyes cannot tell bad tea from good tea, " said Wang Chao-kun, chairman of a
tea association in Alishan, a mountain area in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County
famed for producing quality tea.</P>
      <P>"You have to taste it to know the difference because good tea will leave a
slightly sweet taste in the back of your throat, while low quality tea does
not," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang said these imported teas had led to a 60-percent decline in local tea
farmers' business.</P>
      <P>"Local TV shopping channels and telephone marketers are the major sellers of
these low quality tea products," Wang contended.</P>
      <P>Pan said imports of Chinese tea have also surged ahead of the Lunar New Year
holiday to meet rising demand, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Citing custom figures, he said that 537.63 tons of Chinese tea were imported
into Taiwan in January this year, representing a 115.23 percent increase from
the 249.79 tons imported the same month a year ago.</P>
      <P>He also noted that Taiwan imported 27,734.14 tons of tea last year, of which
Chinese and Vietnamese tea accounted for 85 percent, compared with 80 percent

      <P>One of the problems, Pan said, is that a barrel of tea with 99 percent of its
leaves from Vietnam and only 1 percent from Taiwan can still be labeled as being
"Made in Taiwan, " according to the Ministry of Finance's rules on the origin of
imported goods.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker urged the Department of Health (DOH) to issue an executive order
requiring tea vendors to clearly identify every tea product's country of origin
and list the different countries of origin and their ratios if the tea is a
blend.</P>
      <P>He also asked the government to intensify testing for pesticides in tea products
imported from China and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu Chung-si, a DOH section chief, said that the results of
inspections on unsafe food products, including teas, will be posted on the
ministry's Web site.</P>
      <P>Liu Fang-ming, another DOH section chief, said that those who fail to indicate
the country of origin of their products will be subject to fines of between
NT$30,000 (US$934) and NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>Those who inaccurately label their products will be subject to fines of between
NT$40,000 and NT$200,000, he added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will hold a press conference Tuesday to brief the public
on progress in talks between Taiwan and China on an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA), a Presidential Office official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said President Ma will hold similar
briefings on a regular basis in the future.</P>
      <P>The press conference will be held at 2 p.m. Tuesday and is expected to last
about 30 minutes, with questions to be taken from two or three reporters, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih, Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang, Mainland Affairs
Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan, and Presidential Office Secretary-General Liao
Liou-yi will also attend the press conference.</P>
      <P>The press conference will start with Ma's remarks, in which he will explain why
Taiwan needs to sign the trade pact with China and what would happen if Taiwan
does not sign the deal, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Ma, who sees the ECFA talks as the government's most important issue to deal
with this year, has also instructed agencies involved in the negotiations to
brief the legislature on progress in the negotiations every month.</P>
      <P>The president's press conferences will follow the briefings at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma has said that the second round of talks on the ECFA will be held some time
between late February and early March, and that the negotiations will focus on a
range of issues, including the ECFA's "early harvest" program, a list of items
that could be first to enjoy tariff exemptions.</P>
      <P>The last time President Ma held a press conference on a specific issue was on
Aug. 18 last year, when his administration was criticized for its slow response
to Typhoon Morakot and its poor handling of ensuing rescue and relief
operations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will increase its subsidies for foreign movie producers who film all or
part of their pictures in the country, according to newly revised regulations
announced by the Government Information Office (GIO) Monday.</P>
      <P>Foreign producers can apply for the subsidies to the GIO before coming to Taiwan
to make their movies.</P>
      <P>The newly revised regulations will raise personnel subsidies to 30 percent of
the cost of hiring Taiwanese actors and production staff, from the original 20
percent and 15 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Foreign producers will also be eligible to have 25 percent of their production
expenses and 15 percent of their transportation, accommodation and insurance
expenses in Taiwan subsidized, up from the original 15 percent and 5 percent
respectively.</P>
      <P>But producers whose films have won best picture awards in the competition
category at four major film festivals -- Cannes, Venice, Berlin and the Oscars
-- or productions co-produced by directors who have won a best director award at
the festivals, will be granted more generous subsidies because their films will
go further in raising Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Su Jun-pin expressed the hope that the newly revised regulations
will help lure more foreign film makers to Taiwan to shoot their productions.</P>
      <P>"This will help promote  exchanges  of cross-border  movie production technology

    <HEADLINE>Challenges, opportunities for ECFA negotiations: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
02/08/10  21:49:13</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming Year of the Tiger will present both challenges and opportunities
for negotiations on a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact that Taiwan hopes
to ink with the consensus of the public, Taiwan's top China affairs negotiators
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end press conference,  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Chiang Ping-kung said the priority for the coming year will be signing
the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China on the basis of
consensus among the Taiwanese public.</P>
      <P>In terms of cross-strait relations, the coming year will be more challenging
than previous years because of ECFA, while at the same time presenting more
opportunities than ever before, he said.</P>
      <P>"The ECFA will be the core of cross-strait exchanges in the new year, " he went
on.</P>
      <P>While both sides concluded their first round of talks in late January and a
substantial part of the agreement has yet to be discussed at all, Taiwan still
intends to sign the agreement as soon as possible, preferably before the
Legislative Yuan's June recess, so that the agreement can take effect in 2011,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>As the ECFA support rate plummeted from 70 percent in April last year to 50.9
percent in an Executive Yuan survey in early January, the administrative branch
knows it must do a better job of convincing the general public, as well as the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), as to why the deal is important
for Taiwan's economy, he added.</P>
      <P>Waving goodbye to the Year of the Ox, the government has vowed to be transparent
during the negotiations process, to notify the legislative branch about progress
of the negotiations and to put the agreement under legislative review. It has
also promised to improve its communication with the public on the ECFA, which
many fear would cause an influx of Chinese products and job losses.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,  Taiwan's  top China policy-making
authority, said the ECFA negotiation team is scheduled to brief the Legislative
Yuan 10 times from February to June.</P>
      <P>The MAC also plans to step up its communication on ECFA with three groups --
residents in central and southern Taiwan, those from low-  and middle-income
households and owners of small-  and medium-sized businesses -- in which ECFA
support is particularly low.</P>
      <P>Chiang acknowledged that both sides are present in a "World Trade Organization
(WTO) -minus" status, as Taiwan has banned 830 Chinese agricultural products and
about 1,300 industrial products from being imported while China has demanded
"normalization of cross-strait trade relations, " but he said Taiwan and China
should work the issue out together.</P>
      <P>While the WTO norms are important, so is the special relationship between Taiwan
and China, Chiang said, adding that both sides should negotiate on the basis of
that special relationship.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has pledged that the ban on Chinese agricultural imports
will not be lifted, but the opposition has questioned the promise, saying that
under WTO regulations, Taiwan will in that case have to make concessions in
other areas.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, Taiwan is determined to boost its exchanges with China but
will uphold the interests of Taiwan people's every step of the way.</P>
      <P>He also said U.S. arms sale to Taiwan will not threaten the future of bilateral
exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. arms sales to Taiwan... are nothing new to us. They will not have any
negative impact on Taiwan's future negotiations and exchanges with China, "
Chiang said in response to a reporter's question. (By Chris Wang)</P>

      <P>More than 500 families in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County who were displaced
by Typhoon Morakot will begin moving into new houses built by a leading Buddhist
charitable group Tuesday, ahead of a holiday that traditionally brings families
together.</P>
      <P>"We thank the Taiwan Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation for building solid houses to
help us begin a new life, " said a typhoon survivor identified as Da Hu at a
press conference held by the government on reconstruction efforts in the past
six months.</P>
      <P>"Although we have lost a lot, Tzu Chi members have opened classes on humanism
for us, which have taught us a great deal," he said.</P>
      <P>Over the next three years, Tzu Chi members will also help these residents
develop traditional skills, including wood and stone carving, Da Hu added.</P>
      <P>The typhoon claimed more than 100 lives and hundreds more were believed to be
buried alive when it battered central, southern and eastern Taiwan last August.</P>
      <P>Foundation spokesman Her Rey-sheng told the Central News Agency that more
displaced people will move into the houses after they are formally recognized by
the government as flood victims.</P>
      <P>He also said collective efforts have accelerated the building process.</P>
      <P>"Hundreds of thousands of Tzu Chi members helped build houses for more than 600
households in less than three months, " he said. The 59.29-hectare area will
accommodate about 1,540 households.</P>
      <P>"We hope to give them a homeland forever, " he noted. "We are very happy that
500 households will move in ahead of the Lunar New Year."</P>
      <P>The victims need to carry nothing but their own clothes when they move into the
new dwellings, as everything, including closets, a dining table, rice and
cooking materials, has been prepared for them, he said.</P>
      <P>At present, 824 of 1,204 households in typhoon-ravaged parts of Taiwan have been
allowed to live in the houses established by Tzu Chi, said Chen Chen-chuan, vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Post-Typhoon Morakot Reconstruction Commission.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said at the press conference that the completion of the
houses was the first step in the reconstruction work, which will be followed by
creating jobs, re-establishing conventional industries, and preserving local
cultures.</P>

      <P>Much to the jubilation of domestic filmmakers, the Taiwan-produced crime movie
"Monga" grossed more at the box office on its first day Friday than the
Hollywood blockbuster "Avatar," market sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics, "Monga, " a youth gang film set in Taipei's
Wanhua district in the 1980s, has grossed more than NT$59.32 million (US$1.85
million) since it premiered in Taiwan Feb. 5. Its first day box office was
NT$8.31 million,  outshining "Avatar's" first-day receipts of NT$6.97 million.</P>
      <P>On Sunday alone, "Monga" grossed more than NT$20 million around Taiwan,
according to the film's producer Lee Lieh.</P>
      <P>The film has not only scored box-office success but also won critical acclaim
for its interesting storyline and its cast's vivid portrayal of its leading
characters.</P>
      <P>Despite its relatively low budget, the film is expected to emerge as another
box-office hit and replicate the success of Cape No. 7, which became Taiwan's
most popular Mandarin film in 2008.</P>
      <P>Industry insiders said they hope "Monga" can inject new vitality into Taiwan's
movie industry, which has been on the decline for years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Avatar's box-office gross broke NT$800 million this past weekend to
replace James Cameron's another megahit "Titanic" as the highest grossing film

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday that the government will invite authoritative
foreign groups to further investigate and identify what caused the mudslides
that buried almost 500 people alive in a southern Taiwan village last August.</P>
      <P>In its report on an investigation into the tragedy released last Monday, the
Cabinet-level Public Construction Commission (PCC) cited massive rainfall,
rather than a water diversion project, as the main factor that doomed the
mountain village in Kaohsiung County during Typhoon Morakot on Aug. 8 last year.</P>
      <P>But many former Siaolin residents who survived the tragedy did not find the
report convincing,  and they demanded a further investigation into the matter to
find out the truth. The premier agreed.</P>
      <P>"I respect the PCC report, but it's not final since it's not acceptable to many
Siaolin residents and environmentalists," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In presenting the report, PCC Chairman Fan Liang-shiow, said that the energy
released during the explosions set off for the tunnel project was far weaker
than the minimum needed to trigger a disaster.</P>
      <P>Fingering massive rainfall as the culprit that doomed the mountain village, the
report said Siaolin absorbed 1,856 mm of rainfall in 72 hours during the
typhoon, well past the critical point in triggering the lethal mudslides that
covered the village.</P>
      <P>Siaolin residents and environmentalists believe, however, that the explosions
set off to build tunnels for the Tsengwen Reservoir water diversion project, as
well as other factors including mass stockpiles at gravel yards and overlogging,
were also behind the disaster.</P>
      <P>At a press  conference  on the  progress  in post-Morakot reconstruction, the
premier said the government will only decide on whether to continue building
tunnels for the water diversion project after foreign groups have reached their
conclusions.</P>
      <P>Wu said that according to another investigative report by Taiwan's water agency,
the area's terrain has changed dramatically, which might make the water
diversion project ineffective once it is launched.</P>
      <P>Because of that, he said, further studies are necessary.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports to China totaled US$9.54 billion in January, setting a 17-month
high, and could exceed US$10 billion in a single month later this year, the
Ministry of Finance said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-chen,  director general of the MOF's Department of Statistics, said
January's exports to China accounted for 43.9 percent of the total exports, the
highest level since October 2007.</P>
      <P>The figure also represented the second highest since statistics were compiled,
trailing only the 44.1 percent share seen in September 2007.</P>
      <P>She said exports to China were up mainly because of increasing demand prior to
the Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>Of the products exported to China, sales of electronic products rose by US$330
million in January, the most of any category, while shipments of optical
equipment increased by US$300 million.</P>
      <P>The MOF said January exports totaled US$21.75 billion, the most in 16 months,
and exceeded US$20 billion for the third consecutive month. The total
represented year-on-year growth of 75.8 percent, the largest increase since
August 1976.</P>
      <P>Imports in January totaled US$19.25 billion, also a 16-month high and the third
consecutive month in which there was positive growth. The total was 114.7
percent higher than in January 2009, the largest monthly increase since
September 1974.</P>
      <P>Lin said the high annual increase was due to the stable growth of exports and
imports in January and the low baseline set last year when the Chinese New Year
holiday came in January and Taiwan was in the throes of the global economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>In January, Taiwan's exports of NT$3.16 billion to the six major members of the
Association for Southeast Asian Nations, US$2.43 billion to Europe, and US$1.47
billion to Japan all set new highs in over a year.</P>
      <P>Only exports to the United States, which totaled US$2.22 billion, were down from

      <P>He also said collective efforts have accelerated the building process.</P>
      <P>"Hundreds of thousands of Tzu Chi members helped build houses for more than 600
households in less than three months, " he said. The 59.29-hectare area will
accommodate about 1,540 households.</P>
      <P>"We hope to give them a homeland forever, " he noted. "We are very happy that
500 households will move in ahead of the Lunar New Year."</P>
      <P>The victims need to carry nothing but their own clothes when they move into the
new dwellings, as everything, including closets, a dining table, rice and
cooking materials, has been prepared for them, he said.</P>
      <P>At present, 824 of 1,204 households in typhoon-ravaged parts of Taiwan have been
allowed to live in the houses established by Tzu Chi, said Chen Chen-chuan, vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Post-Typhoon Morakot Reconstruction Commission.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said at the press conference that the completion of the
houses was the first step in the reconstruction work, which will be followed by
creating jobs, re-establishing conventional industries, and preserving local
cultures.</P>

      <P>Much to the jubilation of domestic filmmakers, the Taiwan-produced crime movie
"Monga" grossed more at the box office on its first day Friday than the
Hollywood blockbuster "Avatar," market sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics, "Monga, " a youth gang film set in Taipei's
Wanhua district in the 1980s, has grossed more than NT$59.32 million (US$1.85
million) since it premiered in Taiwan Feb. 5. Its first day box office was
NT$8.31 million,  outshining "Avatar's" first-day receipts of NT$6.97 million.</P>
      <P>On Sunday alone, "Monga" grossed more than NT$20 million around Taiwan,
according to the film's producer Lee Lieh.</P>
      <P>The film has not only scored box-office success but also won critical acclaim
for its interesting storyline and its cast's vivid portrayal of its leading
characters.</P>
      <P>Despite its relatively low budget, the film is expected to emerge as another
box-office hit and replicate the success of Cape No. 7, which became Taiwan's
most popular Mandarin film in 2008.</P>
      <P>Industry insiders said they hope "Monga" can inject new vitality into Taiwan's
movie industry, which has been on the decline for years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Avatar's box-office gross broke NT$800 million this past weekend to
replace James Cameron's another megahit "Titanic" as the highest grossing film
of all time in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Avatar had already become the world's best selling film ever with US$2.21

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Monday that the government will invite authoritative
foreign groups to further investigate and identify what caused the mudslides
that buried almost 500 people alive in a southern Taiwan village last August.</P>
      <P>In its report on an investigation into the tragedy released last Monday, the
Cabinet-level Public Construction Commission (PCC) cited massive rainfall,
rather than a water diversion project, as the main factor that doomed the
mountain village in Kaohsiung County during Typhoon Morakot on Aug. 8 last year.</P>
      <P>But many former Siaolin residents who survived the tragedy did not find the
report convincing,  and they demanded a further investigation into the matter to
find out the truth. The premier agreed.</P>
      <P>"I respect the PCC report, but it's not final since it's not acceptable to many
Siaolin residents and environmentalists," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In presenting the report, PCC Chairman Fan Liang-shiow, said that the energy
released during the explosions set off for the tunnel project was far weaker
than the minimum needed to trigger a disaster.</P>
      <P>Fingering massive rainfall as the culprit that doomed the mountain village, the
report said Siaolin absorbed 1,856 mm of rainfall in 72 hours during the
typhoon, well past the critical point in triggering the lethal mudslides that
covered the village.</P>
      <P>Siaolin residents and environmentalists believe, however, that the explosions
set off to build tunnels for the Tsengwen Reservoir water diversion project, as
well as other factors including mass stockpiles at gravel yards and overlogging,
were also behind the disaster.</P>
      <P>At a press  conference  on the  progress  in post-Morakot reconstruction, the
premier said the government will only decide on whether to continue building
tunnels for the water diversion project after foreign groups have reached their
conclusions.</P>
      <P>Wu said that according to another investigative report by Taiwan's water agency,
the area's terrain has changed dramatically, which might make the water
diversion project ineffective once it is launched.</P>
      <P>Because of that, he said, further studies are necessary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan exports to China in January rise to 17-month high</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to China totaled US$9.54 billion in January, setting a 17-month
high, and could exceed US$10 billion in a single month later this year, the
Ministry of Finance said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-chen,  director general of the MOF's Department of Statistics, said
January's exports to China accounted for 43.9 percent of the total exports, the
highest level since October 2007.</P>
      <P>The figure also represented the second highest since statistics were compiled,
trailing only the 44.1 percent share seen in September 2007.</P>
      <P>She said exports to China were up mainly because of increasing demand prior to
the Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>Of the products exported to China, sales of electronic products rose by US$330
million in January, the most of any category, while shipments of optical
equipment increased by US$300 million.</P>
      <P>The MOF said January exports totaled US$21.75 billion, the most in 16 months,
and exceeded US$20 billion for the third consecutive month. The total
represented year-on-year growth of 75.8 percent, the largest increase since
August 1976.</P>
      <P>Imports in January totaled US$19.25 billion, also a 16-month high and the third
consecutive month in which there was positive growth. The total was 114.7
percent higher than in January 2009, the largest monthly increase since
September 1974.</P>
      <P>Lin said the high annual increase was due to the stable growth of exports and
imports in January and the low baseline set last year when the Chinese New Year
holiday came in January and Taiwan was in the throes of the global economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>In January, Taiwan's exports of NT$3.16 billion to the six major members of the
Association for Southeast Asian Nations, US$2.43 billion to Europe, and US$1.47
billion to Japan all set new highs in over a year.</P>
      <P>Only exports to the United States, which totaled US$2.22 billion, were down from
the previous month.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Why should one be too severe? When a man reforms
and comes to me for advice, I accept his present reformation without inquiring
what his past life has been. I am satisfied if I find that, for the present, he
has really reformed, without being able to guarantee that he will not relapse
again. But why should one be too severe?"</TEXT>

      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching returned to Taipei early Tuesday after a 12-day
overseas trip that took her to the United States and Canada.</P>
      <P>Consistent with her low-profile style, Chow smiled to a group of reporters after
arriving at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 5 a.m. but did not respond
to their questions on how she felt about her just-concluded journey.</P>
      <P>She instead asked reporters how they could get up so early to cover her return.</P>
      <P>Chow departed Taipei Jan. 28 on the culture-themed trip in her capacity as
honorary head of the Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan, which performed in
Washington, D.C. and Vancouver during the visit.</P>
      <P>Council for Cultural Affairs Minister Emile Chih-jen Sheng, who accompanied Chow
on her trip, said the visit was simply for cultural exchanges and did not carry
any political implications.</P>
      <P>"The Cloud Gate consistently received an enthusiastic response from the
audiences for its exquisite performance, which made every one of us feel proud,
" Sheng said. "It was indeed a very successful cultural tour."</P>
      <P>At the invitation of Cloud Gate founder Lin Hwai-ming, Chou accompanied the
troupe on its North American tour that took it to the U.S. capital and the
Cultural Olympiad in Vancouver, Canada.</P>
      <P>The troupe performed its signature work "Moon Water" at the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington Jan. 29-30 and at the Cultural
Olympiad in Vancouver Feb. 5-6.</P>
      <P>Chow was the first Republic of China first lady ever to visit Canada since the
two countries severed diplomatic ties in 1970.</P>
      <P>During her stay in Vancouver, Chow also attended a book donation ceremony at the
Vancouver Public Library and read story books to local children. She also
visited several cultural institutions in the city.</P>
      <P>In addition to Cloud Gate, Taiwan's U Theatre, Chai Found Music Work and LAFA
&amp; Artists Dance Group have also been invited to perform at the Vancouver
Cultural Olympiad, which has been organized in celebration of the 2010 Vancouver

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Affordable housing quandary</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/09/10  11:07:26
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Skyrocketing property prices, particularly those for upscale residential
properties, have fueled anger and complaints from average citizens, many of whom
have either lost their jobs or seen their incomes decline as a result of the
muddling economy over the past several years.</P>
      <P>The government has therefore come up with an idea to build inexpensive
residential units for young home buyers, who cannot even afford a small bathroom
in high-priced luxury apartments that are now selling for over NT$100 million
(US$3 million) apiece.</P>
      <P>The government has also mulled imposing a "luxury home tax" in a bid to calm the
average person's dissatisfaction, promote tax fairness and halt speculative
rises in property prices.</P>
      <P>The "luxury home tax" notion, however, has not contributed to slowing the rise
of property prices but instead helped shore up the prices of those upscale
residences.</P>
      <P>Since imposing a "luxury home tax" is not a good way to fight property price
fluctuations, why not emulate Shanghai in developing idle land or backwater
areas into new business zones or follow Singapore in developing new towns with
affordable housing units for the ordinary person.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih proposed recently that some 10,000 inexpensive housing units
be built in a Taipei suburb located about 20 minutes outside of Taipei but near
an MRT stop to help families who cannot afford a house in Taipei buy their own
home.</P>
      <P>The premier's proposal is laudable, but we urge him to learn the lessons from
the low-cost public housing projects built in the past for low-income families
or military dependents. They developed bad reputations because of shabby design
and poor construction quality, and the government should try to prevent
repeating the mistakes of the past. (Feb. 9, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Europe's sovereign debt crisis has shattered the optimism and hope that recently
pervaded financial markets amid an economic recovery. The world suddenly
panicked over the possible resurgence of the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Stock markets around the world plunged last Friday after a debt crisis in Greek
engulfed weaker Spain and Portugal in the euro zone.</P>
      <P>From the viewpoint of global financial markets, the European sovereign debt
crisis is worse than the Dubai financial crisis in terms of the size of the
economies involved. Significantly, all three debt-ridden countries are from the
euro zone.</P>
      <P>The market is still waiting to see how euro-zone economies will handle the mess.
Another selling spree on bearish news is still possible.</P>
      <P>After experiencing  the global financial tsunami,  however, countries should be
expected not to allow bad news to swell up. It's all about how and when to
handle the debt trouble.</P>
      <P>Because of the European debt crisis, people can see that although the global
economy trended toward recovery, it is actually like a candle in the wind. The
candle's fickle flame can easily go out without careful attention. (Feb. 9,

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Cross-strait talks enter tough period</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/09/10  12:15:38
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China said in a year-end press conference Monday
that systematic dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since June
2008 has focused mostly on less contentious issues to date but that tougher
issues will be dealt with this year.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>The United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Monday that
bilateral talks will focus this year on the core issues of direct cross-strait
trade -- an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA), taxation agreement
and intellectual property protection.</P>
      <P>Chiang, reporting on issues and progress in cross-strait talks, also admitted
that based on the principle of "easy issues come first and difficult issues
later, " the talks will enter the "difficult issues" period this year.</P>
      <P>At this juncture, mutual trust built by the two sides will be a valuable asset
in the negotiations. Despite differences of opinion, the two sides should be
able to solve problems and reach agreements, Chiang asserted.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Chiang said that the exchange of offices between the two</P>
      <P>quasi-official intermediary bodies -- SEF and its Chinese counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- will be discussed
sooner or later.</P>
      <P>But it will have to wait until the government determines its policy on the
issue. The government will have to consider many objective  factors,  and the
SEF has yet to receive  related information.</P>
      <P>He also said he hopes to forge a national consensus to sign the ECFA in the next
round of cross-strait talks, preferably before the Legislative Yuan's June
recess, so that the agreement can take effect in 2011.</P>
      <P>Chiang revealed that cross-strait  exchanges will start in mid-March, and that
he will lead a delegation to mainly visit Taiwanese businessmen in central
China.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, the SEF's vice chairman and secretary-general, said talks on the
ECFA have yet to enter into the substantive negotiation stage.</P>
      <P>Both sides have only exchanged information and conducted studies on a proposed
deal, but the talks have yet to touch on the "early harvest" program, a list of
items that could be the first to enjoy tariff exemptions.</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Ma administration has geared up to publicize the ECFA as the support rate
for the pact has fallen from 70 percent in April last year to 50.9 percent in an
Executive Yuan survey in early January.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will call a press conference later today to explain the
importance of signing the agreement.</P>
      <P>Before Ma, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has since February 2009 held weekly
seminars to try to assuage public misgivings about the trade pact.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) chairman and deputy chairmen have also
presided over 100 meetings related to the ECFA and they have also stated the
case for the trade pact on radio and TV programs.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission has also made presentations on the ECFA in
Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung and will speak in Hsinchu and Tainan in mid-
March.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News -- Impact of decriminalizing sex trade</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/09/10  13:12:04
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>How to handle the issue of prostitution is one of the benchmarks used to
determine administrators' integrity and guts.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, with a law that allows prostitutes to be punished but not their
patrons,  underground  adult sex transactions  have flourished, often in upscale
venues under official protection, leaving only old, cheap prostitutes working
the lower rungs of society to be caught.</P>
      <P>The Justices of the Constitutional Court recently asserted that a provision in
the Social Order Maintenance Act allowing prostitutes, but not their patrons, to
be punished was unconstitutional, and they ordered that it be invalidated within
two years.</P>
      <P>The assertion forced the Ma Ying-jeou administration to face the issue -- it
must come up with measures in two years not only to revise the law but also
establish a set of rules governing adult sex transactions.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, decriminalizing the sex trade would only be a "small step"

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local newspapers gave plenty of space to analyze the year-end mayoral elections
in five special municipalities -- Taipei City, New Taipei City (currently Taipei
County) , and the merged Taichung City and County, Tainan City and County, and
Kaohsiung City and County.</P>
      <P>The following are excepts of their reports: China Times:</P>
      <P>Former Premier Su Tseng-chang is the only potential Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) candidate who would pose a threat to Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin's re-
election bid, according to a survey conducted by the China Times.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that Su would defeat Hau 41 percent to 38 percent in a two-way
race, a virtual toss-up, if the election were held today.</P>
      <P>However, the incumbent mayor would be a shoo-in in a race against either former
Premier Yu Shyi-kun or DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen.</P>
      <P>The mayor's aides were surprised by the survey, with spokeswoman Chao Hsin-ping
saying the poll result did not coincide with two similar surveys conducted by
City Hall at the end of last year and in January,  which gave the mayor 7.5
percentage point and 17.2 percentage point advantages, respectively, over Su.</P>
      <P>Citing the mayor's 48 percent approval rating, the spokeswoman said Hau was
confident of being re-elected.</P>
      <P>The China Times survey confirmed Hau's dominant position among KMT aspirants for
Taipei mayor. He led his closest rival, Legislator Ting Shou-chung, 38 percent
to 22 percent.</P>
      <P>Su has not yet decided whether to throw his hat in the ring in Taipei thus far.</P>
      <P>One of Su's aides said the former premier is caught in a dilemma, because if he
wins the mayoral election in Taiwan he would be trapped in City Hall and miss
the chance to run as the DPP's presidential nominee in 2012.</P>
      <P>If he loses in Taipei, it would dash his hopes for the presidency. (Feb. 9,
2010) The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu is far ahead of other possible candidates to head the
new Taichung special municipality in a survey released recently.</P>
      <P>He told journalists that he appreciates voters' support and said he would decide
after the Chinese New Year holiday whether to enter into the race.</P>
      <P>"I'll let you know immediately if I decide to quit."</P>
      <P>If he decides to run, Hu said, he would inform the ruling KMT first and give the
party apparatus  time to go through  its candidate-choosing procedures.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-lung, who hopes to represent the Democratic Progressive Party in the
Taichung mayoral election, remained undaunted by Hu's lead in the survey, saying
that Taichung needs a new leader after Hu's nine years in power. (Feb. 9, 2010)
United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Hu led his rivals from not only within the KMT but also outside the KMT.</P>
      <P>He is one of the most popular politicians in Taiwan. Why? Is it because of his
tact? But isn't Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng the most tactful figure in the
KMT?</P>
      <P>Is it because he is flexible? But isn't former KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung very
flexible too?</P>
      <P>When asked if he was afraid if his popularity might worry his boss, KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou, Hu said "No, I am not."</P>
      <P>His answer shed light on the secret to his enormous popularity: he is not a
traditional KMT official who toes the party line carefully and holds party
leaders in high regard.</P>
      <P>Hu is a nonconformist in a party that is overwhelmed with traditions, and how he
will fare in it will be a barometer of the party's own future. (Feb. 9, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's volunteer movement a valuable asset: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Taiwan's thriving volunteer movement is
one of its most valuable assets and it has helped light up local society.</P>
      <P>"Volunteerism has emerged as an energetic,  dynamic social movement in Taiwan,
with many of our people generously contributing their time and wealth to
altruistic causes, " Ma said while meeting with winners of the 22nd Golden Camel
Awards.</P>
      <P>Noting that the award has been created to honor outstanding volunteers, Ma said
only those who have given more than 10,000 hours of volunteer service are likely
to receive the award.</P>
      <P>"It is a tall order and requires a loving heart, patience and perseverance, " Ma
said. "You have helped illuminate our society with your selfless actions," he
told his guests.</P>
      <P>The volunteer movement is a special feature of Taiwan, and is linked to the fact
that Taiwan is an open democratic society, he noted.</P>
      <P>"In comparison, volunteerism is not so popular in China as evidenced by the less
enthusiastic contributions by mainland Chinese people in the wake of the
magnitude-8 earthquake that struck Sichuan Province in May 2008, " Ma said.
Because China is not a very open society, volunteerism is not likely to thrive
there, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma recalled that more than 100,000 local people dedicated themselves to
volunteer post-disaster relief work after Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in
southern Taiwan last August.</P>
      <P>Other indicators of the dynamic volunteer movement in Taiwan are World Vision
Taiwan and the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families' sponsorship of 200,000
underprivileged children around the world and the donation of blood by 10
percent of the country's population, Ma added.</P>
      <P>He further said volunteerism epitomizes a philosophy of sharing.</P>
      <P>"Volunteer service requires sharing of time and energy; financial donation is a
form of sharing wealth, blood donors share health, and organ donors share life,"
he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>02/09/10  14:08:50
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The global investment and banking sectors have been fond of using acronyms for
publicity purposes ever since Goldman Sachs called Brazil, Russia, India and
China the "BRICs" and triggered a global trend of investing in emerging markets.</P>
      <P>Most acronyms have positive meanings, but the recently popular "PIGS, "
referring to the European countries Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain that are
at the center of the eurozone's debt crisis, is steeped in sarcasm.</P>
      <P>It may be an acronym that reflects reality, but after careful consideration, in
calling others pigs, people are really criticizing themselves.</P>
      <P>The sarcasm over the four countries' high national deficits and unemployment
rate smacks of the pot calling the kettle black.</P>
      <P>Neither of the world's largest economies -- the United States and Japan -- are
qualified to call other pigs, with Japan suffering from a budget deficit that
was more than 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009 and a public
debt approaching US$10 trillion, nearly double GDP.</P>
      <P>U.S. public debt is approaching the debt ceiling of US$12.4 trillion (about 85
percent to 90 percent of GDP).</P>
      <P>In comparison, although being a small and wealthy country, Taiwan has also been
beset by expanding imbalances between revenues and expenditures in recent years.
Taiwan is lucky that it still can control the situation, but that does not mean
that Taiwan can call other countries "PIGS." (Feb. 9, 2010)</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) renewed its bid Tuesday to
create a task force to strengthen the legislature's supervision of a proposed
trade pact slated to be signed between Taiwan and China later this year.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lee Chun-yee said the proposed legislative task force aimed at
overseeing affairs involving Taiwan and China will not overlap with the
legislature's existing committees.</P>
      <P>"Overlapping is not a problem as the functions of the current committees are
inadequate, " he said at a press conference at the legislature.</P>
      <P>He also argued that the legislature has already set up many special task forces
designed to deal with various issues.</P>
      <P>"Without the task force, it will be difficult for the legislature to oversee the
ECFA, " Lee noted, referring to the proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou believes, however, that it necessary to figure out first
if the body would be redundant, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said
Monday. But Wang added that the Ma government agrees on the need for legislative
supervision.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged the government Tuesday to allow people to initiate a referendum
on the trade pact as it will have an immense impact on conventional industries
and the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>"If the trade pact is a solution to Taiwan's future economy as Ma and Wu
(Premier Wu Den-yih) say, why do they fear the referendum?" he said.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks came hours before Ma holds a press conference to brief the public
on progress in trade pact talks at the Presidential Office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is pushing a new class struggle which is more drastic and
violent than the one between the proletariat and bourgeoisie described by Karl
Marx.</P>
      <P>Ma is dividing Taiwan's society into two groups, one destined to profit by
exploiting China's market, the other refusing to or incapable of using China to
gain a profit.</P>
      <P>His administration is transforming Taiwan society, which consists mainly of a
middle class and rarely sees fierce class conflicts, into one dominated by the
new classes.</P>
      <P>Instead of creating an environment favorable for investment, the government's
job has been reduced to forcing businesses to decide whether to relocate to
China or to stay home and wither.</P>
      <P>At the same time, local laborers are forced to choose between working on the
mainland or staying and competing for dwindling job opportunities at home.</P>
      <P>The policy was originally drawn up by Beijing and applied to Japan and Hong
Kong. Now the Ma administration is colluding with Beijing to push it in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was reported that Ma's close aides are puzzled by their boss' plummeting
popularity and have been trying everything they can to reverse it but to no
avail.</P>
      <P>They really don't have to look outside for the reasons. How can people support a
government which splits them into two groups and plays one against another?

      <P>The Ministry of Education on Tuesday encouraged adults in the country to make a
New Year's resolution to exercise more, learn more and be compassionate toward
others.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-chi urged the Taiwanese public to exercise at least
30 minutes a day, to engage themselves in learning for at least 30 minutes a
day, and to be involved in a good deed each day.</P>
      <P>Coining his campaign as a "331" movement, Wu quoted a 2009 survey conducted by
the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council as finding that only 24.4 percent of
Taiwanese adults exercise regularly, compared to Japan's 33.3 percent for men
and 27.5 percent for women.</P>
      <P>"There still is ample room for us to improve in terms of regular physical
exercise," he said.</P>
      <P>The education minister also quoted another poll conducted in 2008 on adult
learning as indicating that only 31 percent of people aged between 16-64 in the
Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu areas engaged in learning activities for four
hours or more per week.</P>
      <P>The figure was lower to the 42 percent in Germany in 2006, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Education Minister Lin Tsung-ming called for the Taiwanese
public to eat a vegetarian diet for at least one day a week in an effort to
"save Taiwan and the world." He pointed out that some 36 kilograms of carbon
dioxide are emitted from the production of each kilogram of beef.</P>
      <P>Lin said global warming has continued to worsen and Taiwan has been rated as the
seventh most endangered area in the world.</P>

      <P>The captain of a Taiwanese fishing boat, who has been detained in Japan since
Feb. 3, is expected to be released soon once his court case ends and he pays the
required fine, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ke Ching-kuo, captain of the Yilan-registered fishing vessel the Chuansheng No.
36, was taken to Yakohama for questioning after his fishing boat was seized by
the Japanese coast guard for allegedly crossing a temporary marine boundary
between Taiwan and Japan in waters near the Iwo Jiwa islands, 1,200 km south of
Tokyo Feb. 3.</P>
      <P>Ke was indicted by a Japanese court Feb. 2 on several charges that included
evading investigation and fishing illegally. He is facing a likely fine of up to
one million yen (approximately NT$359,000), said Charles Chen, secretary-general
of the Association of East Asian Relations, an agnecy set by Taiwan to handle
exchanges with Japan in the absence pf official relations.</P>
      <P>"Ke has admitted to Japanese prosecutors that his boat illegally entered Japan
waters, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has asked Japan to speed up the court case so that Ke would be able to
return home soon. Immediately after his release, he is expected to join the 10
Indonesia fisherman who were aboard the vessel and are currently being held in
the Bonin Islands.</P>
      <P>The Japanese court is expected to announce its verdict Feb. 12, and if Ke pays
the fine immediately, he should be able to fly to the Bonin Islands via Iwojima
the next day and leave for Taiwan with his crew, Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Kuomintang legislator on Tuesday defended his controversial proposal to
lower corporate income tax rates for the world's biggest companies investing in
Taiwan, which critics contend would be like giving away money to big local
conglomerates.</P>
      <P>In a bill to promote industrial innovation, a clause pushed by lawmaker  Ting
Shou-chung  would give the world's 500 biggest multinational  companies setting
up their Asia-Pacific regional headquarters in Taiwan a preferential corporate
income tax rate of 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The controversial bill is meant to fill the void left by the expired Statute for
Upgrading Industry and pave the way for the country's development over the next
decade.</P>
      <P>Some, including the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , have
characterized Ting's clause as a giveaway to big Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>"I have become the target of attacks recently for allegedly trying to benefit
some local conglomerates," Ting said.</P>
      <P>Ting said he made the proposal because he was told that only a few Taiwanese
high-tech companies,  such as Hon Hai Precision Industry, Quanta Computer,
Asustek Computer and Acer Inc., would make it into the top 500 list.</P>
      <P>But these high-tech companies already enjoy other tax breaks that drive their
real tax rate to between 10-13 percent, even lower than his proposed 15 percent,
meaning that there should be no question of giving conglomerates special
benefits.</P>
      <P>"This is why I have not proposed an exclusion  of local manufacturers from the
draft bill," Ting argued.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's standard corporate income tax rate was recently lowered from 25 percent
to 20 percent and will first be applied to income earned in 2010.</P>
      <P>The critics have also accused Ting's proposal of being too big of a drain on
national coffers, but the lawmaker said a DPP proposal last October to grant the
15 percent corporate tax rate to all foreign companies with headquarters in
Taiwan and annual revenues over NT$1 billion would have cost the government
NT$18.1 billion.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Ting estimates his proposal would cost about NT$500 million.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the numbers, the lawmaker feels something must be done. In his
main constituency of Tianmu in Taipei City, long a center of the international
community, the number of foreign residents has been on the decline as foreign
chambers of commerce leave Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, the exodus was caused by cross-strait confrontation, but more
recently, an uncompetitive tax structure has scared them off, Ting argued.</P>
      <P>Citing data from the Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
he said foreign investment has declined from US$15.3 billion in 1997 to US$4.7
billion in 2009.</P>
      <P>He argued that his proposal directed at the world's top 500 businesses was an
effort to find a way out for Taiwan's economy and truly make it an operational
headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region.</P>

      <P>Unstable financial conditions and marginal profits are top barriers to Taiwan's
small businesses seeking to expand cross-border business, according to the
results of a biannual survey released Tuesday by HSBC Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Volatile financial conditions, including credit, forex rates and banking
interests, as well as small profit margins, are the top factors preventing
Taiwanese small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from further expanding
business with other countries, the results show.</P>
      <P>Other problems that the Taiwanese  SMEs face in expanding international business
include a lack of a deep understanding of overseas markets and a lack of local
windows for development.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between October and November last year among 6,031 SMEs
in 20 markets in Asia, including India and the Middle East.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, 300 SMEs with annual turnovers of less than US$10 million were
interviewed in the survey.</P>
      <P>The results reveal that raw material costs, the U.S. and global economic
prospects, as well as Taiwan currency's fluctuations, are the top three concerns
of Taiwanese SMEs for the coming six months.</P>
      <P>Eighty-seven percent of the local respondents said they would maintain the same
employment scale for the coming six months, while only 9 percent said they have
plans to increase staff levels.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an SME confidence index monitor survey conducted by HSBC found that
most Asian businesses have regained their confidence in trade after the
2008-2009 global economic meltdown.</P>
      <P>SMEs in Vietnam were the most upbeat among the Asian economies, at 160, with 71
percent of the respondents predicting that their business will improve in the
first half of 2010, followed by those in India and China.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese SMEs had the lowest trade confidence index at 97, even lower than the
98 posted in the last survey.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, said Monday that
negotiations between Taiwan and China have gone through the easy phase and have
entered a more difficult new stage.</P>
      <P>He unveiled his New Year wish that consensus can be built up among the people to
back the government's negotiations with Beijing on the thorny issues of
intellectual property rights protection, a tax agreement and an economic
cooperation framework agreement.</P>
      <P>We can imagine the difficulty of these negotiations because of the conflicting
opinions of different groups in Taiwan and the enormous bargaining power of
Beijing that makes it a difficult counterpart to deal with.</P>
      <P>But Chiang's wish for public consensus is unrealistic because differing opinions
are the essence of democracy. Chiang and his Kuomintang (KMT) colleagues,
especially those older than 60, should realize that where there is democracy,
there is no consensus.</P>
      <P>Instead of asking the people to rally behind them in talks with China, Chiang
and the KMT leadership should use the differing local views as bargaining chips
to force their Chinese counterparts to accommodate Taiwan's requests in the
talks.</P>
      <P>Good negotiators should know how to use the various opinions at home for the
country's best interest. (Feb. 9, 2010)</P>

attempt to win the hearts of people in central and southern Taiwan -- he also
said that Vice President Vincent Siew and Premier Wu Den-yih, who speak better
Taiwanese than he does, will visit central and southern Taiwan to communicate
the government's views in Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Ma promised that his government will not allow the import of Chinese workers or
more Chinese agricultural products into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan allows the import of 1,415 Chinese agricultural products, only 479 of
which were approved before 2000, when the current ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lost
power to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), he noted.</P>
      <P>All the rest were approved between 2000 and 2008, when the Democratic
Progressive Party was in power, Ma added.</P>
      <P>"No additional agricultural products have been allowed into Taiwan since I took
office, " he pointed out. "I also will not allow any new imports of (Chinese)
agricultural products in the future."</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will earmark NT$95
billion (US$3 billion) to help those likely to be affected by the pact.</P>
      <P>Ma also said the pact will cover tariff reduction, investment protection and
intellectual property rights protection.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese businessmen in China often need to solve their problems through
unofficial channels, " he said. "Therefore, we hope that the trade pact will
include investment protection measures."</P>
      <P>Ma also dismissed concerns that Taiwan will overly depend on China when trade
between the two sides further increases, as China is already Taiwan's biggest
export market.</P>
      <P>He said it is natural to see a rise in trade, as China has become the world's
factory and market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislation required for Taiwan's NPM to exhibit in Japan</HEADLINE>

      <P>Japan is very much interested in exhibiting some of the collection of Taiwan's
National Palace Museum (NPM), but it must enact a law first to make such an
event possible, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two countries have long discussed the possibility  of exhibiting NPM
artworks in Japan, but before an exhibition takes place, Taiwan hopes Japan will
pass legislation that ensures the return of the precious objects to Taiwan, said
Charles Chen, the secretary-general of the Association of East Asian Relations.</P>
      <P>The association, which is part of the MOFA, is in charge of Japanese affairs.</P>
      <P>Japan's representative to Taipei Tadashi Imai said Japan's parliament is likely
to pass a law in the first half of this year so that Taiwan can begin
preparations to send art objects from its Palace Museum to be shown in that
country.</P>
      <P>Negotiations have been tortuous because of Taiwan's political plight. China has
long claimed ownership of the NPM's assets, which the Kuomintang (KMT) brought
to Taiwan as it was losing the Chinese civil war to the communists in 1949.</P>
      <P>According to NPM spokeswoman Chen Chang-hua, if China were to file an ownership
claim against NPM objects that are being exhibited abroad, the exhibition would
have to be suspended and the artworks could potentially be seized.</P>
      <P>But the risk will not exist if legislation is passed by the host country
guaranteeing that the exhibits will be safely returned to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Such legislation has been required before the NPM arranged any of its overseas
exhibitions, Chen said, noting that France, Germany, and the United States all
passed bills to protect NPM exhibits before they were displayed in those
countries.</P>

      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday that after seeing Costa Rica elect
a female president, she thinks women stand a good chance of success in Taiwan's
2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>With the election last weekend of Laura Chinchilla as president of Costa Rica,
one cannot help but wonder if a woman would be the next president of the United
States, Lu said.</P>
      <P>"I think women also stand a good chance of winning in Taiwan's next presidential

      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) said Tuesday that, in cooperation
with investigators, it is probing a recent attack on its Web site by unknown
hackers.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-hui, an official at the BHNI's information center, confirmed  that the
bureau's  Web site had been attacked  by unidentified hackers on New Year's Day.
The problem showed up as an unusual signal flashing on the page where visitors
are allowed to join or leave the National Health Insurance Program with the use
of their identification numbers.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, some bureau officials on duty that day noticed the strange
signals on the page and immediately shut down the system before the malware
could take over.</P>
      <P>In an initial investigation, the officials found that the problem was caused by
Trojan horse viruses, Wu said. Fortunately, the bureau's system was not damaged
and there were no leaks of patients' information or medical records, thanks to
the fact that system was immediately shut down, she added.</P>
      <P>"We do not know yet who was the attacker," she said.</P>
      <P>The bureau has stepped up its safety measures against cyber attacks  to prevent
any similar  incidents,  and an in-depth cross-agency probe has been launched to
identify the hacker, she added.</P>
      <P>The BNHI incident came on the heels of a Next Magazine report that Chinese cyber
hackers had launched massive attacks on the Web sites of Taiwan government
agencies in a bid to derail their normal operations.</P>

      <P>While the number of influenza A(H1N1) cases has continued to wane, cases of
seasonal influenza B have continued to increase, the Department of Health (DOH)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control,
said the swine flu virus has not been active recently, with only two or three
newly hospitalized H1N1 cases.</P>
      <P>A 28-year-old pregnant woman was affected with H1N1 recently, but both the
mother and child were not in danger, Shih added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that DOH-contracted laboratories have found 88 percent of new flu
cases to be H1N1 type, with the remaining 12 percent tested as being B-type.</P>
      <P>"This shows a trend of increased cases of influenza B, " said Shih.</P>
      <P>The trend is especially obvious in China, with influenza B accounting for around
40 percent of flu cases, Shih added.</P>
      <P>With the waning of H1N1, which has so far claimed 40 lives in Taiwan, the number
of people inoculated has also slipped to between 1,000 and 2,000 daily, he said.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Taiwan's leading technology
research institute, and Israeli company Alvarion Ltd., the world's leading
provider of WiMAX and wireless broadband solutions, announced Tuesday that they
will set up an Interoperability Testing (IOT) lab for WiMAX at the ITRI.</P>
      <P>A memorandum of cooperation was signed by the two sides a day earlier, ITRI
officials said, adding that the establishment of the lab in Hsinchu, northern
Taiwan, will help enhance the integration of Taiwanese  WiMAX device
manufacturers  with core networks  of international WiMAX carriers, as well as
upgrade their technology levels.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese WiMAX product suppliers will no longer need to ship their products
abroad for testing, which can help them save time and money, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In order to enter the global WiMAX market, local WiMAX products are required to
pass tests conducted by labs abroad, which can delay product launch timelines,
they added.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan becoming one of the world's major production and R&amp;D centers for
WiMAX Customer Premise Equipment products, global WiMAX infrastructure
manufacturers such as Motorola and Alcatel-Lucent launched their own IOT labs in
Taiwan in 2008.</P>
      <P>Israel-based Alvarion Ltd, which set up a branch office in Taiwan last
September, has already established business relations with Vmax Telecom, one of
the country's six WiMAX operators, and has cooperated with Chunghwa Telecom to
deploy a mobile WiMAX network in the northeastern county of Yilan.</P>

one of the concert organizers said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Ma and the ensemble will give three concerts in different areas of Taiwan in

through the arts.</P>
      <P>"Ma sees the Silkroad Project as a means of enhancing global communication, much
like the Internet in its early days," according to Niu.</P>
      <P>The Silk Road Ensemble was established  in 2000 with the participation of
internationally renowned performers and composers from more than 20 countries.
The instrumental voices include piano, violin, pipa, erhu and many others.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese drivers will be able to obtain international driving permits (IDPs)
with a fixed term of validity of three years and will no longer need to reapply
for an IDP after the expiry of their domestic driver's  license,  the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to existing regulations, an IDP remains valid for three years from the
date of issue, or until the expiration date of the holder's driver's license,
whichever is earlier.</P>
      <P>The new measure is expected to be implemented from March, after the necessary
legislation has been passed, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>Under the present rules, if a Taiwanese driver has a driver' s license with
remaining validity of two or three months, the driver can only apply for an IDP
with the same remaining validity time, so that such a driver using a vehicle
abroad may need to mail the IDP back to Taiwan for license renewal.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese drivers need to renew their licenses every six years.</P>
      <P>In the case of foreign IDP holders, however, Taiwan applies different rules
depending on how foreign countries or regions reciprocate with Taiwanese IDP
holders, according to the MOTC.</P>
      <P>In general, foreign IDP holders who stay in Taiwan for 30 days or less can drive
without registration.</P>
      <P>However, if they stay in Taiwan over 30 days, they must register their IDP at
the Motor Vehicle Office -- with one year the longest period for IDP
registration.</P>
      <P>If the holder's IDP or Alien Residence Certificate's validity period is less
than one year, they will only be allowed to drive until the expiry date of the
holder's IDP or ARC, whichever comes first.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will pull its weight to fight global warming by restricting carbon
dioxide emissions, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing an international seminar attended by experts from home and abroad,
including Germany and the United States, who discussed innovative strategies for
renewable energy development and carbon reduction, Chu said energy conservation
and carbon reduction are the most important human missions in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>With per capita carbon dioxide emissions reaching three times the world average,
Chu said, Taiwan must step up its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions in
order to fulfill its obligations as a member of the global village.</P>
      <P>To realize this policy goal, Chu said, the government has been promoting the
passage of four laws on better energy management, development  of renewable
energy,  reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the imposition of an energy
tax.</P>
      <P>"To date, two of them -- the statutes on energy management and renewable energy
development -- have cleared the Legislative Yuan and we are now pushing for
enactment of the more sensitive legislation on an energy tax and a statute on
carbon reduction," Chu explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has set a target of bringing the country's carbon
emissions in 2020 down to the level of 2005, Chu said strenuous efforts have to
be made to attain that goal.</P>
      <P>"Even if we manage to achieve our goal, we might still fail to reach the carbon
reduction target set forth in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, " Chu said, adding
that he will push for the government to work even harder in collaboration with
the private sector to contribute to the carbon reduction goals.</P>
      <P>Speaking  on the same  occasion,  Environmental  Protection Administration
Minister  Stephen Shu-hung Shen said Taiwan is determined to learn from Germany
about how to draft renewable energy development strategies.</P>
      <P>Germany originally set a target of having renewable energy account for 12
percent of its overall energy resources by 2010. In fact, the country managed to
achieve 15 percent in 2008, far ahead of its original schedule, Shen said.</P>
      <P>"We admire Germany's achievements in this regard and we hope to learn from its
successful strategy," Shen added.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, the core of Germany's experience lies in the fact that the
German government has not raised debts to expand public invesmtent in renewable
energy development but has instead enhanced the wholesale prices of renewable
energy to stimulate private investment in the sector.</P>
      <P>By so doing, more than 200,000 jobs have been created, which has helped reduce
Germany's unemployment  rate while simultaneously boosting green energy
development.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has not set a deadline for the conclusion of talks on a trade pact with
China, President Ma Ying- jeou said Tuesday,  one day after Taiwan's chief
cross-strait negotiator said that the agreement is expected to be signed in May.</P>
      <P>"There is no fixed schedule for the trade pact negotiations, " Ma said in the
first in a series of press briefings to personally report on the progress of the
negotiations.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that consensus will be achieved on some pressing issues before the
signing of the pact," he said.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Chiang Pin-kung, Taiwan's top negotiator with China, said that the
cross-strait trade agreement is expected to be signed at the end of May, before
the legislature goes into recess in June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said there will be no political language in the trade pact.</P>
      <P>"For example, terms such as 'one country-two systems, ' one China with different
interpretations' and 'peaceful unification' will not appear in the pact," he
said amid concerns that China is using its economic power to promote unification
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that after the agreement is signed, there will be no need for
hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese to seek jobs in China, as Taiwanese
businesses will no longer need to relocate to there, but instead will set up
their bases in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The trade pact will also attract more foreign companies to invest in Taiwan, he
added.</P>
      <P>On the issue of legislative oversight, he said that ministry officials have
given several briefings to lawmakers since Taiwan and China began negotiations
to further liberalize trade between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"This operational model has worked well and is, in effect, a cross-strait task
force," he said.</P>
      <P>Further discussions will be required in order to decide whether there is need
for a special task force to oversee the negotiations and whether its functions
would conflict with those of existing legislative committees, he added.</P>
      <P>Hours earlier, opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus whip Lee
Chun-yee said that the current legislative committees cannot adequately oversee
the trade agreement negotiations. He also noted that the legislature already has
several special task forces to deal with various issues.</P>
      <P>At Ma's press conference, which drew large numbers of local and foreign
reporters, he directed most of his comments to local farmers and workers,
detailing reasons why Taiwan needs to sign a trade pact China.</P>
      <P>Amid fears that farmers and laborers would suffer as result of the agreement,
the president pledged not to import Chinese workers or to open the Taiwan market
to more Chinese agricultural products.</P>

      <P>The Cathay Life women's basketball team, which has won 17 straight women's
titles in Taiwan's domestic league, announced Tuesday that it will pull out of
the 2010 season over a player registration controversy.</P>
      <P>The team decided to miss the 2010 season of the Women's Super Basketball League
(WSBL) over what it claims is a violation by the Chunghwa Telecom team in
signing Chiang Feng-chun, a former Cathay Life star forward who came out of
retirement and signed with Chunghwa Telecom, it said in a press release.</P>
      <P>The WSBL consists of five teams and is Taiwan's top women's basketball league.
The 2010 season is scheduled to begin in March.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a national team regular, returned to basketball one year after a
surprising retirement in February 2009 at the age of 28. Her unexpected return
sparked controversy and highlighted an "unwritten rule" that Taiwanese women
players stay with a single team throughout their careers or face being boycotted
by the other teams if they try to switch teams.</P>
      <P>The teams invest millions of dollars in every player and it is unfair for teams
to lose players to other teams, according to Cathay Life assistant coach Chien
Wei-chuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan researchers find new correlation between tobacco, lung cancer</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese research team's new discovery of a mechanism  by which tobacco
causes lung cancer  and other smoking-related diseases has made the cover of the
February issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, the world's leading
biomedical magazine.</P>
      <P>The study by a National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)-led research team revealed
the process by which tobacco-specific carcinogens cause lung tumors.</P>
      <P>According  to the  study,  the key ingredient  of tobacco carcinogens, nicotine-
derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), induces the accumulation of a protein, DNA
methyltranferase 1 (DNMT1), which in turn inhibits tumor suppressor genes and
leads to lung cancer.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi-ching, an NCKU professor who led the research team, said at a news
conference Monday that lung cancer is associated with long-term exposure to
carcinogenic substances in the environment.</P>
      <P>"NNK was originally considered only to lead to genetic mutation, but our
research further revealed how NNK could induce epigenetic alteration in the
process of cancer formation, inhibiting the tumor suppressor genes and leading
to lung cancer," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The study provided strong scientific evidence for anti-smoking propaganda and
proposed an important goal for lung cancer treatment, namely the development of
DNMT methyltranferase enzyme inhibitors, she said.</P>
      <P>In the future, Wang said, the research team will focus on the treatment of lung
cancer patients and the invention of new drugs, based on its new findings.</P>
      <P>Wang's team also included researchers from the National Health Research
Institute,  Veterans General Hospital,  China Medical University Hospital and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen called
Tuesday for the creation of a legislative oversight body on Taiwan-China
negotiations on a proposed  trade pact after President  Ma Ying-jeou  said more
discussions are needed.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, it is necessary to set up a special task force at the
legislature to monitor the ongoing trade negotiations as legislative committees
are inadequate for the task.</P>
      <P>The task force would allow the real participation of all political parties, she
said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ma said at a press conference that further discussions will
be required in order to decide whether there is need for such a task force and
whether its functions would conflict with those of the existing legislative
committees.</P>
      <P>He said ministry officials have already given several briefings to lawmakers
since Taiwan and China began the negotiations to further liberalize trade
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"This operational model has worked well and is, in effect, a cross-strait task
force," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma has repeatedly called for a meeting with Tsai on the issue and the DPP chief
said her party will send a list of questions to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>If the president  answers  the questions  at future press conferences, it is
likely to pave way for a Ma-Tsai meeting, she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai also questioned Ma's argument that the signing of the trade pact will
minimize the pressure imposed by China to bar Taiwan from signing free trade
agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>She quoted several foreign people she did not identify as saying that Ma's
assertion in this regard "doesn't make sense."</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's claim that there will be no political language in the trade
pact, Tsai, a former Mainland Affairs Council chief, said that "everything has
to do with politics when you are negotiating with China."</P>
      <P>She also urged the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to find out if anyone in the
negotiations team has violated rules on conflict of interests, and said those
who have business interests should leave the team.</P>
      <P>In his first press conference to talk about the trade pact, Ma detailed his
reasons why Taiwan needs the pact and appealed to local farmers and workers by
making various pledges in Taiwanese and Hakka, as well as Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Amid fears that farmers and laborers will suffer as result of the agreement, the
president pledged not to import Chinese workers or to open the Taiwan market to
more Chinese agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Ma said the pact, which has raised widespread concerns among the public that it
will hit the country's traditional and agricultural sectors hard, is aimed at
helping the people of Taiwan do business and enhancing Taiwan's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The pact will cover tariff reduction, investment protection and intellectual
property rights protection, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>He added that there is no fixed timetable for the negotiations, although his
government has been working to conclude the pact at the end of May, before the
legislature goes into recess in June.</P>
      <P>He also said that after the pact is signed, there will be no need for hundreds
of thousands of Taiwanese to seek jobs in China, as Taiwanese businesses will no
longer need to relocate there, but instead will be able to set up their bases in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More foreign companies will also be attracted to invest in Taiwan, he predicted.</P>

      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) said Tuesday that, in cooperation
with investigators, it is probing a recent attack on its Web site by unknown
hackers.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-hui, an official at the BHNI's information center, confirmed  that the
bureau's  Web site had been attacked  by unidentified hackers on New Year's Day.
The problem showed up as an unusual signal flashing on the page where visitors
are allowed to join or leave the National Health Insurance Program with the use
of their identification numbers.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, some bureau officials on duty that day noticed the strange
signals on the page and immediately shut down the system before the malware
could take over.</P>
      <P>In an initial investigation, the officials found that the problem was caused by
Trojan horse viruses, Wu said. Fortunately, the bureau's system was not damaged
and there were no leaks of patients' information or medical records, thanks to
the fact that system was immediately shut down, she added.</P>
      <P>"We do not know yet who was the attacker," she said.</P>
      <P>The bureau has stepped up its safety measures against cyber attacks  to prevent
any similar  incidents,  and an in-depth cross-agency probe has been launched to
identify the hacker, she added.</P>
      <P>The BNHI incident came on the heels of a Next Magazine report that Chinese cyber

      <P>While the number of influenza A(H1N1) cases has continued to wane, cases of
seasonal influenza B have continued to increase, the Department of Health (DOH)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control,
said the swine flu virus has not been active recently, with only two or three
newly hospitalized H1N1 cases.</P>
      <P>A 28-year-old pregnant woman was affected with H1N1 recently, but both the
mother and child were not in danger, Shih added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that DOH-contracted laboratories have found 88 percent of new flu
cases to be H1N1 type, with the remaining 12 percent tested as being B-type.</P>
      <P>"This shows a trend of increased cases of influenza B, " said Shih.</P>
      <P>The trend is especially obvious in China, with influenza B accounting for around
40 percent of flu cases, Shih added.</P>
      <P>With the waning of H1N1, which has so far claimed 40 lives in Taiwan, the number

      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Taiwan's leading technology
research institute, and Israeli company Alvarion Ltd., the world's leading
provider of WiMAX and wireless broadband solutions, announced Tuesday that they
will set up an Interoperability Testing (IOT) lab for WiMAX at the ITRI.</P>
      <P>A memorandum of cooperation was signed by the two sides a day earlier, ITRI
officials said, adding that the establishment of the lab in Hsinchu, northern
Taiwan, will help enhance the integration of Taiwanese  WiMAX device
manufacturers  with core networks  of international WiMAX carriers, as well as
upgrade their technology levels.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese WiMAX product suppliers will no longer need to ship their products
abroad for testing, which can help them save time and money, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In order to enter the global WiMAX market, local WiMAX products are required to
pass tests conducted by labs abroad, which can delay product launch timelines,
they added.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan becoming one of the world's major production and R&amp;D centers for
WiMAX Customer Premise Equipment products, global WiMAX infrastructure
manufacturers such as Motorola and Alcatel-Lucent launched their own IOT labs in
Taiwan in 2008.</P>
      <P>Israel-based Alvarion Ltd, which set up a branch office in Taiwan last
September, has already established business relations with Vmax Telecom, one of
the country's six WiMAX operators, and has cooperated with Chunghwa Telecom to
deploy a mobile WiMAX network in the northeastern county of Yilan.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese drivers will be able to obtain international driving permits (IDPs)
with a fixed term of validity of three years and will no longer need to reapply
for an IDP after the expiry of their domestic driver's  license,  the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to existing regulations, an IDP remains valid for three years from the
date of issue, or until the expiration date of the holder's driver's license,
whichever is earlier.</P>
      <P>The new measure is expected to be implemented from March, after the necessary
legislation has been passed, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>Under the present rules, if a Taiwanese driver has a driver' s license with
remaining validity of two or three months, the driver can only apply for an IDP
with the same remaining validity time, so that such a driver using a vehicle
abroad may need to mail the IDP back to Taiwan for license renewal.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese drivers need to renew their licenses every six years.</P>
      <P>In the case of foreign IDP holders, however, Taiwan applies different rules
depending on how foreign countries or regions reciprocate with Taiwanese IDP
holders, according to the MOTC.</P>
      <P>In general, foreign IDP holders who stay in Taiwan for 30 days or less can drive
without registration.</P>
      <P>However, if they stay in Taiwan over 30 days, they must register their IDP at
the Motor Vehicle Office -- with one year the longest period for IDP
registration.</P>
      <P>If the holder's IDP or Alien Residence Certificate's validity period is less
than one year, they will only be allowed to drive until the expiry date of the
holder's IDP or ARC, whichever comes first.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will pull its weight to fight global warming by restricting carbon
dioxide emissions, Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing an international seminar attended by experts from home and abroad,
including Germany and the United States, who discussed innovative strategies for
renewable energy development and carbon reduction, Chu said energy conservation
and carbon reduction are the most important human missions in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>With per capita carbon dioxide emissions reaching three times the world average,
Chu said, Taiwan must step up its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions in
order to fulfill its obligations as a member of the global village.</P>
      <P>To realize this policy goal, Chu said, the government has been promoting the
passage of four laws on better energy management, development  of renewable
energy,  reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the imposition of an energy
tax.</P>
      <P>"To date, two of them -- the statutes on energy management and renewable energy
development -- have cleared the Legislative Yuan and we are now pushing for
enactment of the more sensitive legislation on an energy tax and a statute on
carbon reduction," Chu explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has set a target of bringing the country's carbon
emissions in 2020 down to the level of 2005, Chu said strenuous efforts have to
be made to attain that goal.</P>
      <P>"Even if we manage to achieve our goal, we might still fail to reach the carbon
reduction target set forth in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, " Chu said, adding
that he will push for the government to work even harder in collaboration with
the private sector to contribute to the carbon reduction goals.</P>
      <P>Speaking  on the same  occasion,  Environmental  Protection Administration
Minister  Stephen Shu-hung Shen said Taiwan is determined to learn from Germany
about how to draft renewable energy development strategies.</P>
      <P>Germany originally set a target of having renewable energy account for 12
percent of its overall energy resources by 2010. In fact, the country managed to
achieve 15 percent in 2008, far ahead of its original schedule, Shen said.</P>
      <P>"We admire Germany's achievements in this regard and we hope to learn from its
successful strategy," Shen added.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, the core of Germany's experience lies in the fact that the
German government has not raised debts to expand public invesmtent in renewable
energy development but has instead enhanced the wholesale prices of renewable
energy to stimulate private investment in the sector.</P>
      <P>By so doing, more than 200,000 jobs have been created, which has helped reduce
Germany's unemployment  rate while simultaneously boosting green energy
development.</P>

titles in Taiwan's domestic league, announced Tuesday that it will pull out of
the 2010 season over a player registration controversy.</P>
      <P>The team decided to miss the 2010 season of the Women's Super Basketball League
(WSBL) over what it claims is a violation by the Chunghwa Telecom team in
signing Chiang Feng-chun, a former Cathay Life star forward who came out of
retirement and signed with Chunghwa Telecom, it said in a press release.</P>
      <P>The WSBL consists of five teams and is Taiwan's top women's basketball league.
The 2010 season is scheduled to begin in March.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a national team regular, returned to basketball one year after a
surprising retirement in February 2009 at the age of 28. Her unexpected return
sparked controversy and highlighted an "unwritten rule" that Taiwanese women
players stay with a single team throughout their careers or face being boycotted
by the other teams if they try to switch teams.</P>
      <P>The teams invest millions of dollars in every player and it is unfair for teams
to lose players to other teams, according to Cathay Life assistant coach Chien
Wei-chuan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) , Taiwan's highest basketball
governing body, changed the rule in 2008 when lawyers said it violated the
Constitution, which rules that people's right to work should be protected.</P>
      <P>All players -- men and women -- are now free agents and free to sign with any
team after their contracts expire or they receive letters of clearance.</P>
      <P>However, Cathay Life still opposed the transfer of Chiang, who retired after a
falling out with the team's head coach, Hung Ling-yao.</P>
      <P>Chiang was quoted by the media as saying she decided to leave Cathay Life
because Hung kept rejecting her wish to play U.S. college basketball or
elsewhere overseas.</P>
      <P>The case was submitted to the CTBA Disciplinary Committee for further review.</P>
      <P>Cathay Life, which established its women's basketball team in 1969, has been one
of the most successful basketball teams in Taiwan. More than half of the Taiwan
national team players are from Cathay Life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan researchers find new correlation between tobacco, lung cancer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 9 (CNA)

(By Chen Li-ting and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese research team's new discovery of a mechanism  by which tobacco
causes lung cancer  and other smoking-related diseases has made the cover of the
February issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation, the world's leading
biomedical magazine.</P>
      <P>The study by a National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)-led research team revealed
the process by which tobacco-specific carcinogens cause lung tumors.</P>
      <P>According  to the  study,  the key ingredient  of tobacco carcinogens, nicotine-
derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), induces the accumulation of a protein, DNA
methyltranferase 1 (DNMT1), which in turn inhibits tumor suppressor genes and
leads to lung cancer.</P>
      <P>Wang Yi-ching, an NCKU professor who led the research team, said at a news
conference Monday that lung cancer is associated with long-term exposure to
carcinogenic substances in the environment.</P>
      <P>"NNK was originally considered only to lead to genetic mutation, but our
research further revealed how NNK could induce epigenetic alteration in the
process of cancer formation, inhibiting the tumor suppressor genes and leading
to lung cancer," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The study provided strong scientific evidence for anti-smoking propaganda and
proposed an important goal for lung cancer treatment, namely the development of
DNMT methyltranferase enzyme inhibitors, she said.</P>
      <P>In the future, Wang said, the research team will focus on the treatment of lung
cancer patients and the invention of new drugs, based on its new findings.</P>
      <P>Wang's team also included researchers from the National Health Research
Institute,  Veterans General Hospital,  China Medical University Hospital and
other academic institutions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP leader urges creation of legislative oversight body</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen called
Tuesday for the creation of a legislative oversight body on Taiwan-China
negotiations on a proposed  trade pact after President  Ma Ying-jeou  said more
discussions are needed.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, it is necessary to set up a special task force at the
legislature to monitor the ongoing trade negotiations as legislative committees
are inadequate for the task.</P>
      <P>The task force would allow the real participation of all political parties, she
said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ma said at a press conference that further discussions will
be required in order to decide whether there is need for such a task force and
whether its functions would conflict with those of the existing legislative
committees.</P>
      <P>He said ministry officials have already given several briefings to lawmakers
since Taiwan and China began the negotiations to further liberalize trade
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"This operational model has worked well and is, in effect, a cross-strait task
force," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma has repeatedly called for a meeting with Tsai on the issue and the DPP chief
said her party will send a list of questions to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>If the president  answers  the questions  at future press conferences, it is
likely to pave way for a Ma-Tsai meeting, she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai also questioned Ma's argument that the signing of the trade pact will
minimize the pressure imposed by China to bar Taiwan from signing free trade
agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>She quoted several foreign people she did not identify as saying that Ma's
assertion in this regard "doesn't make sense."</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's claim that there will be no political language in the trade
pact, Tsai, a former Mainland Affairs Council chief, said that "everything has
to do with politics when you are negotiating with China."</P>
      <P>She also urged the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to find out if anyone in the
negotiations team has violated rules on conflict of interests, and said those
who have business interests should leave the team.</P>
      <P>In his first press conference to talk about the trade pact, Ma detailed his
reasons why Taiwan needs the pact and appealed to local farmers and workers by
making various pledges in Taiwanese and Hakka, as well as Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Amid fears that farmers and laborers will suffer as result of the agreement, the
president pledged not to import Chinese workers or to open the Taiwan market to
more Chinese agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Ma said the pact, which has raised widespread concerns among the public that it
will hit the country's traditional and agricultural sectors hard, is aimed at
helping the people of Taiwan do business and enhancing Taiwan's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The pact will cover tariff reduction, investment protection and intellectual
property rights protection, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>He added that there is no fixed timetable for the negotiations, although his
government has been working to conclude the pact at the end of May, before the
legislature goes into recess in June.</P>
      <P>He also said that after the pact is signed, there will be no need for hundreds
of thousands of Taiwanese to seek jobs in China, as Taiwanese businesses will no
longer need to relocate there, but instead will be able to set up their bases in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More foreign companies will also be attracted to invest in Taiwan, he predicted.</P>

      <P>Field training for the annual Hankuang war games this year will be brought
forward to late April to allow the troops to be deployed to help combat possible

Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced Tuesday at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Lee Yue-chang, assistant deputy chief of the General Staff for Operations and

instead of in the traditional July-October period so that the troops can be
better trained in May and June in preparation for disaster prevention and rescue
missions in the typhoon period from July to October.</P>
      <P>The second-stage computer simulation section of the games will be executed in
mid-July.</P>
      <P>The field exercises will involve no military hardware, while live-fire exercises
will be held separately on specific military bases or coastal locations, Lee
went on.</P>
      <P>Asymmetric operations will also be included in this year's field exercises  to

    <HEADLINE>Government never to profit at consumers' expense: premier</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) should honestly review its gasoline
pricing formula to avoid making unwarranted gains at consumers' expense, Premier
Wu Den-yih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>State-owned oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan, whose gasoline prices are determined
by a formula based on global oil prices, was recently found to have overcharged
motorists for air pollution fees and petroleum management funds over the past
three years, and the premier's comments were his first on the controversy.</P>
      <P>Responding to press inquiries while visiting a wholesale food market in Taipei
City early Wednesday morning, Wu said he has directed Economic Affairs Minister
Shih Yen-shiang and relevant government agencies to honestly and carefully
review CPC's gasoline pricing scheme so that it won't profit at motorists'
expense.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the MOEA already decided more than two weeks ago to deal with
the gasoline pricing issue based on the principle of "not gaining any undue
penny at consumers' expense."</P>
      <P>CPC announced Tuesday it would again cut gasoline and diesel prices by NT$0.4
(US$0.0125) per liter, effective Wednesday. It was the company's second price
cut in two days.</P>
      <P>The decision, which followed a NT$0.1 per liter cut announced Monday, was
reportedly reached Tuesday afternoon at a closed-door meeting chaired by Wu at
the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The new price cut followed public criticism after a newspaper report said CPC
and its rival -- privately run Formosa Petrochemical Corp. -- overcharged
motorists while collecting revenues for air pollution  fees  payable  to  the
Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>According to Wednesday's CPC press statement, the company grossed an extra
NT$5.436 billion in air pollution fees and petroleum management funds intended
for the EPA since it adopted a floating gasoline pricing scheme in Steptember
2006.</P>

      <P>Reports say that over the past two months, Cabinet officials have rushed to the
office before 8 a.m. to read local newspapers before Premier Wu Den-yih arrives
at the office. If there are negative reports related to their work, they then
clarify the reports within two hours.</P>
      <P>It is naturally good to respond to problems,  but simply responding to public
grievances will never translate into good governance.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon only reflects the fact that the executive branch has never paid
attention to public grievances, let alone taken the initiative to clarify them.
The officials only began to pay attention to them because the premier cares
about them.</P>
      <P>We are worried that all policies, small or large, will need the monitoring of
the premier and clarification of Cabinet officials, which means that the
administrative principle of each level being responsible for its own actions has
completely gone awry.</P>
      <P>We should return to the basics of problems. The public grievances could have a
multitude of causes, and the government should analyze their roots and stick to
its guns if it is correct or make adjustments when necessary.</P>
      <P>Taking the initiative  to clarify issues is part of good governance, but it
would be better to return to the source of the problem. (Feb. 10. 2010)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou held a news conference Tuesday to promote the proposed
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, but he has failed to
address some key questions.</P>
      <P>The public has long wondered if local workers or farmers will be victimized if
the agreement is signed and questioned why the government  insists on pushing
the agreement  if it needs to appropriate NT$90 billion to subsidize affected
businesses.</P>
      <P>Since China has repeatedly said the ECFA has nothing to do with Taiwan's signing
of free trade agreements with other countries, people also wonder why the
government still claims that China is not opposed to such deals.</P>
      <P>We question why Ma will not put the issue to a public referendum, since the
agreement will have a crucial impact on Taiwan's economy and because it is in
fact self-denigrating, even though Ma has claimed that the agreement will not
have the political language of one country, two systems attached.</P>
      <P>A free trade agreement is signed between two countries. But China is unwilling
to sign an FTA with Taiwan and has prevented others from signing them with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The signing of the ECFA will only benefit a few pro-China businessmen, while the
majority of Taiwan's people will suffer due to lower salaries and job losses and
most businesses will face unfair competition from China.</P>
      <P>With a great majority of Taiwan's people having realized that the ECFA is a
poison rather than a tonic, they have little interest in buying it no matter how
hard Ma pushes for it. (Feb. 10, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou hosted a news conference Tuesday to discuss the
importance of signing an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China.</P>
      <P>While he managed to give a clear account of the major principles for striking
such a deal with Beijing, he still failed to clarify suspicions on certain
critical political, economic and implementation issues.</P>
      <P>Politically, the public wants to know whether signing the ECFA would mean an
acquiescence to Beijing's "one China" principle or lead to a downgrading of
Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Ma did answer this question frankly and straightforwardly, saying the agreement
will not include any political rhetoric or touch on the sensitive "one China"
issue.</P>
      <P>However, Ma failed to explain why China would no longer stonewall Taiwan's
efforts to negotiate free trade agreements with other countries once the ECFA is
signed, as he claimed. He also did not address questions on how his
administration will negotiate with China to prevent a further market opening to
China-grown agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Equally  disappointing  was his failure to give convincing explanations of his
opposition to the proposal that the Legislative Yuan set up a special task force
to oversee cross-strait engagements, including ECFA negotiations.</P>
      <P>Ma apparently has learned a lesson from the U.S. beef import controversy and
tried to increase transparency on a major policy issue like ECFA. He still
failed, however, to say enough to convince a skeptical public. (Feb. 10, 2010)</P>

diesel prices by NT$0.4 per liter, effective Wednesday. The reduction was the
company's second price cut in two days.</P>
      <P>The cuts have resulted in prices at the pump of NT$30.8 per liter for 98-octane
unleaded, NT$29.3 per liter for 95-octane unleaded, NT$28.6 per liter for
92-octane unleaded, and NT$26.1 per liter for premium diesel.</P>
      <P>The decision, following a NT$0.1 per liter cut announced on Monday, was
reportedly made after Premier Wu Den-yih demanded that public institutions not
"take advantage of consumers."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) discovered recently that since CPC began
implementing a floating pricing mechanism on gasoline and diesel fuel in
September 2006, it has overcharged consumers by more than NT$5.4 billion for air
pollution fees and a crude oil fund.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih praised the MOEA's move to push gasoline prices lower as the
"right move" after the ministry discovered that gasoline vendors had overcharged
for air pollution fees.</P>
      <P>It shows that Wu's Cabinet can quickly respond to public opinions and that the
Cabinet pays attention to public discontent.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan member Cheng Jen-hung revealed that he will launch a probe to see
if there were high-ranking officials who benefited from overcharging for the
fees or neglected their duty in monitoring operations of the state-run oil
refiner.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Wu believes that the MOEA should ask CPC to return to consumers the money it
overcharged once the ministry discovers the difference between air pollution fee
revenues and the amount it must turn over to the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>No consumer should be taken advantage of, he said.</P>
      <P>Appearing more cautious on the issue, EPA Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen said
the issue reflected an accounting problem at CPC and the privately run Formosa
Petrochemical.</P>
      <P>It cannot be called dirty money if the overcharged revenues were spent on
equipment to upgrade gasoline and diesel quality, Shen added.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said they will visit CPC and FPC headquarters Wednesday along with
Bureau of Energy staffers to review the companies' cost structure.</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Since media reports discovered  Feb.  8 that CPC and FPC overcharged motorists
in collecting air pollution fees, the MOEA has been busy resolving the crisis
and trying to "reward" consumers by lowering gasoline and diesel prices.</P>
      <P>The ministry, however, does not appear to believe that the state-run company was
guilty of "operational flaws" in overcharging for air pollution fees.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the MOEA lacks the courage to make an apology.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Criticizing  EPA Minister Stephen Shen for "defending  the businesses, "
Consumers' Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen said he cannot understand why the
administration would protect CPC and FPC even after the MOEA and the two
petroleum companies have admitted to making mistakes in the air pollution fee
dispute.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also blasted CPC and FPC for spending the money, designated for upgrading
pollution prevention equipment, on their own needs in improving the oil refining
process. (Feb. 10, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Impact of China's 'inland fever' on Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/10/10  13:13:31
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>We noticed in China's economic statistics a trend toward a major regional shift
in its economy. Economic growth in inland regions has risen sharply while
remaining flat or slipping in coastal areas.</P>
      <P>We believe such a development will have a structural impact on cross-strait
trade and Taiwanese businessmen's operations in China.</P>
      <P>The economic growth in China's hinterland can be attributed to several factors.
China's economy has become more domestic demand- oriented, adding to development
momentum in inland regions. Also, China has invested heavily in inland regions
to narrow the economic gap with other more prosperous areas. Third, the
resources of coastal areas have spilled inland.</P>
      <P>Such a development will be a new experience for Taiwanese businessmen, and we
have several suggestions for them and Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>First,  Taiwan's investment  should have a focus.  China's hinterland is vast,
and its customs differ from coastal regions. The government  should  coordinate
think  tanks to lead Taiwanese businessmen to trade where they enjoy a
competitive edge and in places that are more accommodating to Taiwan's business
culture.</P>
      <P>Second, Taiwanese businessmen should be able to properly handle local relations,
as their contacts with local officials, enterprises and society will be closer
than when they do business in coastal regions, meaning that the chances for
friction will also be greater.</P>
      <P>Third, Taiwan should nurture a global perspective. Even though inland regions
seem remote geographically, they have actually opened up to the outside world in
the wake of China's economic cooperation with the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen  should thus develop the mind-set of "standing in the
hinterland, but with an eye to the world" to expand their niches. (Feb. 10,

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: How innovation bill should be reshaped</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/10/10  14:18:30
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bill on industrial  innovation  remains  shelved in the Legislative Yuan
because a clause that would offer an especially low 15 percent corporate income
tax rate to certain big conglomerates has drawn strong criticism.</P>
      <P>In response, the Executive Yuan has recently decided to delete the controversial
provision and will instead include a new clause that would offer subsidies to
small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) if they increase their hirings.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet reversed its policy in an apparent effort to stem anger over what
critics call the government's desire to ingratiate itself with large business
groups while discriminating against SMEs.</P>
      <P>Whether this new twist or development  is appropriate  is debatable. But as the
government redrafts or reshapes the innovation bill, we hope it will instill a
new vision or adopt a new way of thinking to better address Taiwan's economic
woes.</P>
      <P>While tax incentives may contribute to certain economic sectors, they have also
become a source of unfairness in our tax system.</P>
      <P>We hope the new bill will no longer offer any tax exemption or tax deduction as
an incentive to attract investment. The government should instead consider the
possibility of lowering the corporate income tax rate to a low of 17.5 percent
to create a neutral taxation environment.</P>
      <P>We believe a "low tax rate, few tax exemptions" system will be equally effective
in stimulating private investment if the government can improve its operational
efficiency and Taiwan's infrastructure, living environment and work conditions.</P>
      <P>As to SME development, the government should focus on assisting them by
providing financing guarantees and offering guidance on manpower cultivation,
technological innovation and market expansion, rather than by offering tax
exemptions or tax cuts. (Feb. 10, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: DPP has no reason to oppose to absentee voting</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/10/10  15:12:08
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party's opposition to absentee voting is both "anti-
democratic" and "anti-progressive."</P>
      <P>Absentee voting will enable those who cannot return home to vote to exercise
their voting rights.</P>
      <P>One thing should be clear. The Ministry of the Interior is not promoting "mail
voting, " meaning Taiwanese businessmen operating in China and emigres will not
be eligible to vote from abroad under the plan. Rather, it targets students,
young workers, policemen and military servicemen, and inmates who study, work or
are deployed in areas outside where their households are registered.</P>
      <P>Even after two transfers of political power in Taiwan, the confrontation between
the "pan-blue" and "pan-green" camps still persists. This is why many have lost
heart, manifested by the low turnout rates in recent elections. Absentee voting
will encourage more people to participate in politics.</P>
      <P>The DPP opposes absentee voting because it thinks that it would make it easier
to manipulate vote counts. But in fact, an effective voting monitoring system
has been established in Taiwan after years of democratic elections.</P>
      <P>The more terrible "manipulation" might have taken place outside polling
stations, such as the 319 shooting of former President Chen Shui-bian on the eve
of the 2004 presidential election. Chen then activated the national security
system to bar military personnel from leaving the barracks to vote.</P>
      <P>The MOI's absentee voting plan would allow eligible voters apply to vote outside
their registered households. Such voters would have to show their IDs and seals
to "transfer" polling stations. These stations are no different from others set
up around the country with monitoring staff, and the DPP's misgivings are
unwarranted. (Feb. 10, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Referendum drive against U.S. beef imports enters second phase</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A campaign launched by the Consumers' Foundation to seek a national referendum
on whether U.S. bone-in beef imports should be allowed entered the second phase
of public endorsement Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen, along with representatives of four other
civil groups campaigning for the drive, visited the Central Election Commission
(CEC) earlier in the day to collect the forms for the second-phase public
endorsement.</P>
      <P>Announcing the beginning of the operation, Hsieh said he hopes they can persuade
1 million eligible voters to sign the petition before an Aug. 10 deadline.</P>
      <P>The proposed referendum will ask voters to "veto the government's decision in
November to open Taiwan's market to U.S. bone-in beef, ground beef and bovine
offal and spines from cattle aged under 30 months" and demand that the
government renegotiate the beef trade protocol with the United States that
opened Taiwan's market to the beef products.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that the dispute on U.S. beef imports has not been resolved and that
Washington has threatened to retaliate against Taiwan for breaking promises in
the U.S.-Taiwan beef protocol signed last October.</P>
      <P>Even though the Legislative Yuan has voted to revise the law to force the
government to reinstate a ban on imports of U.S. ground beef and beef offal,
Washington can still demand that Taipei open its market based on the protocol,
he said.</P>
      <P>Calling for the public to stand up and be counted, Hsieh said the civic groups
hope the people will show the U.S. government their objection to U.S. bone-in
beef out of fear of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Act, a petition is subject to the approval of the Cabinet's
Referendum Screening Committee in the first phase of screening, during which the
initiator must obtain the endorsement of at least 0.5 percent of the eligible
voters in the previous presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation-led initiative passed the first stage last month,
collecting 129,000 signatures and far surpassing the required 86,000 from among
the 17.32 million eligible voters in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In the second phase, the initiators must secure within six months the
endorsement of at least 5 percent, or 860,000, of the eligible voters.</P>
      <P>In response to the referendum drive, Department of Health (DOH) Vice Minister
Hsiao Mei-ling said they will seek to make all the relevant information
transparent to allow consumers to see that the government has never stinted on
its efforts to safeguard public health.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that a successful humanitarian mission
carried out by an Air Force C-130 transport plane delivering relief goods to
earthquake-ravaged Haiti late last month signifies that Taiwan's military
buildup and combat preparedness is sufficient.</P>
      <P>At a Chinese New Year gathering at the Ministry of National Defense (MND), the
president said U.S. congressional Jan. 29 approval of arms sales to Taiwan means
Taiwan is expected to obtain its long coveted self-defense weapons and he
expressed his gratitude to the MND and the National Security Council for their
comprehensive planning of the issue.</P>
      <P>The arms sales also show that Taiwan and the United States have maintained close
cooperation on security issues and in other areas, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>The goal of Taiwan's military buildup and war preparations is to help the
military transform itself into a force that is small but strong, small but elite
and small but skillful, which could help attain peace, avoid war, deter attack
and strengthen national defense, Ma went on.</P>
      <P>He also praised the military's rescue work during the aftermath of Typhoon
Morakot last August, saying that some 560,000 soldiers were mobilized for relief
efforts, winning widespread acclaim for their performance.</P>
      <P>He added that disaster prevention and relief has been listed as one of the
military's priority tasks.</P>

      <P>Chinese New Year is coming, so how do foreign representatives in Taiwan plan to
spend their holidays?</P>
      <P>The Director of the French office is curious about Lunar New Year customs and
foods, while the director of the British Council expects to experience a
different, quiet atmosphere in Taipei City during the holiday.</P>
      <P>"I know Taiwanese people post spring couplets around their doorways, pray to
their ancestors, give each other red envelopes filled with cash and gather with
their families at the New Year, " said Patrick Bonneville, director of the
Institut Francais de Taipei.</P>
      <P>Having been assigned to Taipei for about 18 months, Bonneville is already
familiar with many of the local New Year customs. He said he finds the giving of
red envelopes is one of the most interesting customs, in that parents give them
to their children, but once the children have grown up, the roles are reversed
and the kids give red envelopes to their parents each year.</P>
      <P>The food traditionally eaten at this time of year is also of interest to
Bonneville, such as the so-called "long-life vegetable," otherwise known as
mustard greens, symbolizing long life, as well as steamed sponge cake and rice
cake, which are reputed to bring good luck.</P>
      <P>"The customs of Chinese New Year are related to the concepts of family,
gathering, fortune and longevity," he noted.</P>
      <P>British Council Director Christine Skinner said she expects to go shopping on
Taipei's Dihua Street, where people traditionally flock in their thousands to
buy many New Year products and foods.</P>
      <P>Skinner, who has worked in Taipei for four years, has also added Lungshan
Temple, one of the oldest temples in Taipei, to her New Year travel plans,
although she added that what she is most looking forward to is enjoying the
peace and quiet of Taipei during the holiday period, as many of the residents
will be out of town visiting family further south.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan speaker Wang Jin-pyng expressed support Wednesday for a
proposal to set up a dedicated panel under the legislature to monitor and deal
with cross-Taiwan Strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Wang said such a panel can serve as a communication platform between the
legislative and executive branches, which he said was "very necessary" at a time
when Taiwan and mainland China are working in close interaction to strengthen
their cooperation.</P>
      <P>"The Legislative Yuan should play an essential role that allows it to
participate in and monitor the processes, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after chairing an inter-party consultation held to discuss
the proposal, which was put forth by the opposition Democratic  Progressive
Party  amid  the  Kuomintang  (KMT) administration's efforts to promote the
signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>According to the speaker, legislators agreed in the meeting that the DPP should
present a written outline of the party's proposition, so that the KMT can study
the plan and hold further discussions with the DPP.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue Wednesday, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said the
legislature must set up a special panel to step up its monitoring of the
executive branch's dealings with China, in light of the far-reaching impact of
the proposed trade agreement on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the trade pact will cover a wide range of issues, which
cannot be handled by any single currently existing committees.</P>
      <P>The proposed cross-strait panel should not be restricted by the meeting
procedures of regular committees and should be allowed to convene on a flexible
basis, she suggested, adding that each party should be represented in the panel
to properly reflect public opinion.</P>

      <P>It was the 11th consecutive year that the Taiex ended higher on the last trading

      <P>Chip, IC testing and IC design shares traded heavily on news that the government
would soon allow these sectors to invest in China. Shares of traditional
businesses, such as steel, textiles, chemicals, and construction, as well as
financial shares, also rallied on sound fundamentals and optimistic business

      <P>Two baseball stars and a politician were among the 24 people indicted by the
Banciao District Prosecutors Office Wednesday for fixing professional  baseball
games,  and prosecutors are seeking jail terms ranging from two to nine years
for the suspects.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Tseng Hsin-hung reported that Wu Chien-pao, speaker of the Tainan
County Assembly was indicted on gambling and fraud charges and could face a
nine-year prison term if convicted.</P>
      <P>The two star baseball players indicted, Brother Elephants star outfielder Chen
Chih-yuan and former La New Bears star pitcher Chang Chih-chia, could face two
years in jail, Tseng added.</P>
      <P>Elephants pitcher Tsao Chin-hui, a former player with the Colorado Rockies and
the Los Angeles Dodgers who was also under investigation for his acquaintance
with gambling ring members, was not indicted because there was insufficient
evidence to tie him to the game-fixing incidents.</P>
      <P>However, Tsao, who was the most popular pitcher in Taiwan after he returned from
the United States and joined the Elephants early last year, may find himself out
of job as none of the four professional teams in the Chinese Professional
Baseball League (CPBL) will hire him.</P>
      <P>The 24 people indicted in the case include seven baseball players and alleged
gambling ring members.</P>
      <P>The game-fixing scandal erupted on Oct. 26 last year when investigators raided
the dormitories of Brother Elephants, LaNew Bears,  and Sinon Bulls.  Forty-
three  players from the three professional teams have been under investigation
over the past months.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the indictments, Brother Elephants Baseball Club general
manager Hung Jui-ho said that Chen Chih-yuan, a star player who was once dubbed

      <P>The Chinese authorities pledged Wednesday to speed up the progress of the
proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) ,
which Taiwan hopes can be signed within the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Fan Li-ching, a spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, said in a regular press briefing that Beijing will continue to promote
the trade pact in a steady, step-by-step manner, in which the easy problems will
be taken care of before the more difficult ones are tackled.</P>
      <P>Fan noted that in the first round of formal ECFA talks held Jan. 26, the two
sides only touched upon basic issues and did not enter detailed discussions.</P>
      <P>Among the things that are expected to be dealt with in the next step of
negotiations are the two sides' respective early harvest lists, which are
awaiting confirmation, she said.</P>
      <P>Also, she continued, further discussion is required to decide the date and venue
for the fifth round of talks between the leaders of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , during which the ECFA is expected to be signed.</P>
      <P>On a proposal that the SEF and ARATS should exchange offices on the tow sides of
the Taiwan Strait, Fan said ARATS supports the idea in principle but has not
worked out a substantive plan on the issue.</P>
      <P>She noted that Taiwan and China agreed in June 2008 to exchange tourism offices
and that the Taipei-based Taiwan Strait Tourism Association and the Beijing-
based Cross-Strait Tourism Association have officially filed applications for
the establishment of the offices.</P>
      <P>The two sides have yet to decide when the offices will be inaugurated, she
added.</P>
      <P>Fan predicted that the opening of the offices will provide tourists with better
services that will benefit the development of the tourism industries on both
sides of the strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's oil refinery to review pricing system</HEADLINE>

      <P>State-run petroleum refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan (CPC) will review yearly--
starting this year--its gasoline pricing mechanism to avoid making unwarranted
gains from air pollution fees at consumers' expense, Economic Affairs Minister
Shih Yen-shiang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In 1995, Taiwan began to levy an air pollution control fee on both stationary
sources, such as factories and construction sites, as well as mobile sources,
such as motor vehicles, based on the cost per liter for different grades of
gasoline and diesel fuels.</P>
      <P>The fee is collected on all motorists in accordance with the amount of fuel
consumed or total amount of emisssions by each automobile to discourage them
from driving and to reduce air pollution.  The decision to require the CPC to
review its pricing annually was made after the CPC and the privately run Formosa
Petrochemical Corp. were accused of having overcharged motorists while
collecting revenue on behalf of the government for air pollution fees. The fees
are collected at gas stations and are later paid to the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) by the gasoline companies.</P>
      <P>Shih alleged that the CPC and Formosa had charged prices higher than they should
have by making motorists think the overcharges were the air pollution fee.</P>
      <P>Shih made the announcement after the CPC announced it will cut domestic gasoline
and diesel prices by NT$0.4 per liter, effective Wednesday, following a NT$0.1
per liter cut announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>The price review is expected to be conducted between January and February every
year, according to Shih, who served as chairman of the board at the CPC before
he assumed his current post last September.</P>
      <P>However, Shih did not say whether the CPC will further cut gasoline and diesel
prices in near future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, EPA Director-General of Air Quality Protection and Noise Control
Hsieh Yen-ju said that the overcharged revenues might have been spent by the
company on equipment to upgrade gasoline and diesel quality.</P>
      <P>She said the EPA and the Bureau of Energy will visit the CPC's headquarters to
look into whether the state-run refinery was guilty of "operational flaws" in
overcharging motorists for air pollution fees.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the revenue from mobile pollution source air emissions fees was NT$1.3
billion, far less than the approximately NT$2 billion collected yearly in the
past.</P>
      <P>This was the result of an improvement in the quality of oil products, as the
level of air pollution fees depends on the sulfur content of the oil products
from gasoline vendors, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>She added that the CPC should not take in any of the excess air pollution fees
and should instead return them to consumers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Formosa Petrochemical announced Wednesday it will lower its prices by
NT$0.3, effective 5 p.m..</P>
      <P>Wang Wen-chao, chairman of Formosa Petrochemical, denied the company had
pocketed a huge sum of money in excess air pollution fees, saying that the
company is still fighting to make ends meet because the company has invested
NT$9 billion in reducing the sulfur content of its oil products.</P>
      <P>Wang added that the government is welcome to investigate the fees charged by the
company over past few years.</P>
      <P>Wang also noted that whether the CPC's gasoline pricing formula is reasonable
has nothing to do with Formosa Petrochemical because the private company does
not use the same price calculation system, but instead adopts a market pricing
mechanism.</P>

      <P>A strong desire to grab the gold medal in the upcoming 2010 world tug-of-war
championships in Italy has made 12 teenage girls give up staying slim and eat to
gain weight so they can qualify for the games.</P>
      <P>The girls studying at Taipei Jingmei Girls High School are members of the
school's tug-of-war team, which usually takes part in games in the category
between 480 kg and 520 kg cumulative team athletes' weight, according to school
principal Lin Li-hua.</P>
      <P>The team began seeking to have a cumulated weight of eight persons surge to 540
kg after learning that the Tug of War International Federation has lowered the
age limit to 16 years old for the 2010 world championships, and that they will
only have the government's funding if they join the game in the 450 kg category,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Over the past few months, each member of the team had to swallow down dinner for
2-3 persons. Now, every girl in the team weigh at least 10 kg more than they did
before deciding to join the international competition, their coach Kuo Sheng
said.</P>
      <P>"I am touched and impressed by these girls' determination, " Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The team leader Kuo Ya-ting, who was 157 cm tall and weighed 48 kg, has managed
to gain 12 kg.</P>
      <P>"I have never been so fat" she said. Admitting she was reluctant to look at
herself in the mirror after she had gained weight, Kuo Ya-ting nevertheless
vowed to bring home the gold medal from Italy.</P>
      <P>Nine members of the team will be selected for the 2010 World Indoor
Championships, scheduled to take place on Feb. 25-28 in the Italian city of
Cesenatico.</P>

      <P>Jeffrey Koo, Jr., former vice chairman of the China Trust Financial Holding Co.,
has been restricted from leaving the country, as the presiding judge in a pre-
trial court hearing Wednesday said Koo was considered as a suspect in a severe
crime case who might attempt to escape.</P>
      <P>Koo attended the pre-trial hearing at the Taipei District Court to face
questioning on charges of violating the stock exchange law and banking law when
he gave a directive for the acquisition of Mega Financial Holding Co. through a
Hong Kong branch of the China Trust in 2004.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court prosecutors' office in 2006 twice summoned Koo
regarding suspected irregularities in the deal, but the banker failed to show up
in court and he left Taiwan in September 2006.</P>
      <P>Koo stayed abroad for almost two years after the court put him on a wanted list
in December 2006. He returned to Taipei in November 2008 when prosecutors were
investigating a case of alleged corruption and bribery involving former
President Chen Shui-bian and several bankers.</P>
      <P>At the pre-trial hearing Wednesday afternoon, Koo denied all of the allegations,
insisting that the purchase of Mega Financial shares was purely a matter of
investment.</P>
      <P>When the judge issued the travel ban, Koo pleaded for leniency, saying that he
has a sick wife in the United States, and one of his two children in Japan is
autistic.</P>
      <P>However, the presiding judge pointed out that financial crimes are considered
severe offenses and the penalty could be a jail term of no less than five years.
Koo, with his previous record of dodging a court order, might attempt to run
again and should be restricted from leaving country, the judge said.</P>

      <P>Morgan Stanley Capital International's (MSCI's) anticipated lowering of the
weighting of Taiwan stocks in its indices Thursday will have a limited impact on
the local stock market which concluded its final trading session before the
Chinese New Year break on Wednesday, according to a Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) official.</P>
      <P>Lee Chi-hsien, director-general of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said Wednesday
that MSCI's adjustment downward of Taiwan's stock market's value usually causes
an impact on the local bourse for one day at the most.</P>
      <P>MSCI is scheduled to announce its latest adjustment Thursday when Taiwan's stock
market begins to go into recess for the Lunar New Year, therefore, the
adjustment is expected to have a very small negative impact on the local bourse,
Lee added.</P>
      <P>Touching on the big net sales of Taiwan's stocks by foreign investors recently,
Lee said that inward remittance of foreign capital into Taiwan reached US$2.76
billion in January.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan further relaxed restrictions Wednesday on high-tech investment in China,
in another move to help local  companies  expand  their  global  market  shares
and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Under  the new regulations,  flat panel  makers  will  be conditionally allowed
to invest in facilities more advanced than 6th-generation plants, but the number
of such plants will be capped at three.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the flat panel plants to be set up in China must be less advanced than
the applicant's Taiwan facility by at least one generation, the rules stipulate.</P>
      <P>The investment proposals will be subject to review by a core technology
screening task force to be assembled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
soon.</P>
      <P>The task force, to be composed of officials from all relevant ministries and
agencies as well as industry pundits, will review investment projects based on
technology, investment and finances.</P>
      <P>An MOEA official said the ministry's stance will be that "the companies' top
technologies should be kept at home and their investment priority must also be
at home."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's high-tech companies will be allowed to invest only in plants that are
less advanced than those in Taiwan and the value of their investments in China
should not be more than in Taiwan," the official added.</P>
      <P>AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , Taiwan's largest flat panel maker, hailed the
govenrment's relaxation of restrictions on China-bound investment, saying the
move will help upgrade the local flat panel industry's overall competitiveness.</P>
      <P>An AUO spokesman said the company hopes the government will screen its China-
bound investment project in a speedy manner and with a broad perspective to cope
with the rapidly changing global market situation.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will still prohibit local chip foundries from setting up
12-inch wafer fabs or foundries in China using processes more advanced than 0.13
micrometers, but will allow them to buy stakes in or acquire China-based wafer
foundries.</P>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang admitted that the acquisition aspect
of the regulations is mainly aimed at addressing two  prominent  pending  cases
--  China-based  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.'s offer of a 10
percent stake to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. to settle their
intellectual property  rights  dispute  and United Microelectronics  Corp.'s
controversial investment in China's Hejian Co. before the government lifted a
ban on such investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now allows its chip companies to set up a maximum of three wafer fabs in
China using processes  less advanced than 0.18 micrometers.</P>
      <P>The relaxed investment rules will also apply to low-end IC design and chip set
packaging and testing industries. However, any such China-bound investment
projects in excess of US$50 million will also be subject to review by the core
technology screening task force.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: ECFA publicity strategy</HEADLINE>

(Feb. 11, 2010)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is a good move for President Ma Ying-jeou's administration to try to
strengthen public communication on its policy to promote the signing of an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China. However, the
administration should think carefully and clearly about its publicity strategy.</P>
      <P>In the debate on the ECFA issue, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has obviously taken the offensive, while the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is on
the defensive.</P>
      <P>To put it simply, the DPP is playing on people's fears by emphasizing the
negative consequences of the trade pact. The KMT, on the other hand, is urging
the public "not to be afraid" as the government will take various precautionary
measures. The KMT's assurances amount to an indirect acknowledgment of the
validity of the DPP's claims, and this places the KMT in an unfavorable
position.</P>
      <P>We believe that the government, instead of trying to promote the advantages of
signing an ECFA, should aggressively highlight the disadvantages of not signing
such a pact. The Ma administration should use data to show the people that
without an ECFA, the fears derived from the DPP's closed-door policy during its
eight years in power would only persist.</P>
      <P>President Ma also needs to change his strategy to include the voices of pro-ECFA
industries, businesses and entrepreneurs in the publicity drive. This will help
the DPP to realize that the fight is with Taiwan's overall economy, rather than
the KMT administration.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese Major League Baseball starter Chien-Ming Wang, who became a free agent
in late 2009 after the Yankees failed to offer a new contract, might join the
MLB club Nationals.</P>
      <P>According to an MLB.com report, the Nationals is looking at the two-time 19-game
winner who is now a free agent.</P>
      <P>Wang could make a decision within the next 10 days, the report stated.</P>
      <P>The Washington Nationals, which reportedly has been monitoring Wang's progress,
did not formally responded to the Central News Agency queries in this regard.
Wang is still recovering from arthroscopic shoulder surgery that he had in July
2009.</P>
      <P>According to the MLB.com report, the Nationals could acquire Wang's services but
it was unknown whether the club has extended an offer to Wang, who will turn 30
in March.</P>
      <P>Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said Jan. 31 that the team was looking for
one more veteran starter.</P>
      <P>Wang could be a relatively inexpensive addition to MLB clubs. It is believed
that the Los Angeles Dodgers -- managed by Joe Torre who managed the Yankees
when Wang had his best years -- would have some interest in Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang earned US$5 million last season, becoming the highest paid Taiwanese player
in any U.S. professional sport.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pope Benedict XVI granted a public audience Wednesday to a well-known husband-
and-wife piano duo from Taiwan, Rolf-Peter Wille and Lina Yeh, before the
couple's first-ever performance at the Vatican later that day.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the duo presented Pope Benedict XVI with music recordings
featuring their piano performances. The pontiff said he likes music and will
enjoy listening to the CDs. He also wished them great success at their evening
concert at the Paul VI Hall.</P>
      <P>The couple was accompanied by Larry Yu-yuan Wang, Taiwan's ambassador to the
Vatican, during the audience with the pope.</P>
      <P>The concert was part of the Feb. 9-11 celebrations for the 25th founding
anniversary of the Pontifical Council for Health Care Workers.</P>
      <P>Wille and Yeh, who were invited as guest performers, were the first musicians
from Taiwan to have ever performed in the Holy See. Many audience members,
including expatriates, religious staff, Catholic followers and business
representatives from Taiwan, said they took pride in attending the concert.</P>
      <P>The host of the concert, dressed in an adapted Oriental-style qipao outfit,
said it was a great honor to invite the two internationally acclaimed pianists
to perform at the pontifical council anniversary celebrations.</P>
      <P>The duo played classic pieces by Bach, Brahms, Edvard Grieg and Francis Poulenc
as well as adapted piano versions of pieces by Taiwanese composer Chen Yang.</P>
      <P>Their flawless presentation won resounding applause and many enthusiastic fans
took photographs with them and sought their autographs after the concert.</P>
      <P>The couple said they were flattered to be invited to perform in the Paul VI
Hall.</P>
      <P>Concert organizers said they were moved by the duo's pursuit of excellence. Even
though the couple has worked as a piano duo for a long time, they practiced hard
at their hotel and the Paul VI Hall before the concert in order to give their
best performance, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>Zygmunt Zimowski, chairman of the Pontifical Council for Health Care Workers,
said the remarkable performance by Willie and Yeh was one of the highlights of
the three-day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Yeh, born in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County, was a child prodigy who went on
to study at the Mozart Academy in Salzburg, Austria, and to later learn from
world-class masters such as Hans Leygraf, Kurt Leimer and Jacob Lateiner.</P>
      <P>Wille is a German who came to Taiwan at the age of 23 to teach, soon after he
graduated from Staatlich Hochschule Fur Musik Hannover. He went on to obtain a
doctorate in piano performance at the Manhattan School of Music, New York.</P>
      <P>Over the past three decades, the couple has traveled extensively around the
world on performance tours and has won critical acclaim for their performances.
They recently  celebrated  their 30th anniversary as a duo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: The problem lies with Wall Street</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/11/10  11:43:16
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lately, the 2008 global financial crisis has been attributed to a world trade
imbalance caused by an undervaluing of the Chinese currency. This argument
obviously involves a loss of focus, because the crisis was rooted in greed,
rather than trade imbalance. The problem came from Wall Street, not Beijing.</P>
      <P>Over the past 40 years, during which the United States has had a trade deficit,
the U.S. government has been pointing fingers at other countries for
undervaluing their currencies and has been using trade retaliation methods to
force these countries to raise their currency values.</P>
      <P>However, from the Smithsonian Agreement of 1971 to the Plaza Accord of 1985, it
has been proven that this approach is totally ineffective. The United States,
nonetheless, has never been able to rid itself of this myth.</P>
      <P>The problems with the U.S. financial regulatory and supervisory system were
exposed as early as 2001 in the Enron scandal. Instead of critically examining
the problems, the U.S. government blamed its economic troubles on other
countries, which eventually led to an even bigger financial storm.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Wall Street bankers have not learned from the crisis and are still
paying out high bonuses without any sense of guilt, even after causing such huge
trouble.</P>
      <P>Unless these greedy habits are stopped, there will probably be no way to prevent
other economic crises, even after the value of the Chinese yuan is raised. (Feb.

    <HEADLINE>American stage director Robert Wilson reinterprets Chinese hero</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/11/10  12:02:56</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Avant-garde American stage director Robert Wilson's new work "1433-The Grand
Voyage" reinterprets Chinese hero Zheng He, a famous voyager of the Ming dynasty
in the 15th century, who is widely seen by Chinese people worldwide as a great
explorer.</P>
      <P>The play, which will be performed at the National Theater Hall in Taipei later
this month, is presented in unique poetic beauty and represents an experiment of
mixing East and West, yin and yang, as well as seriousness and humor.</P>
      <P>Wilson's new work has attracted a great deal of attention in the theater world,
largely due to his arrangement of Taiwanese opera and drums, which share the
stage with Western Jazz music.</P>
      <P>"I did not intend to portray the story of Zheng as depicted in historical
accounts in the work, " Wilson said, but instead weave a parable that continues
to this day, embodying a mixture of different cultures.</P>
      <P>Although Wilson only unveiled the prelude of the drama during the rehearsal
Friday, he amazed those in attendance with his mixture of different elements on
the same stage.</P>
      <P>The play was performed in collaboration with the Taiwanese famous group U
Theater, a professional percussion group.</P>
      <P>When the curtain rose, the audience was surprised by seeing a new version of U
Theater. The drummers of the troupe were wearing white makeup; in the past they
wore no makeup.</P>
      <P>There was a new combination featuring the drummers of the theater and jazz
master Richard Landry on the same stage presenting their music, alternately
harmonizing and contrasting with each other.</P>
      <P>Another focus of the performance is Tang Mei-yun, a famous Taiwanese opera diva,
who narrates the piece in a manner unseen before, changing from a young boy into
a serious man, and then to an old man.</P>
      <P>Accustomed to playing a handsome, educated man in traditional Taiwanese drama,
Tang said: "This performance is quite challenging for me, as it is the first
time I could not recognize myself in the mirror; however, I learned a great deal
from the director."</P>
      <P>As for the set and lighting designs, Wilson's exquisite touches of visual
elements enchant the viewers by changing light and contrast to augment the
movement on the stage.</P>
      <P>After the production of "Orlando" in 2009, "1433-The Grand Voyage" is the second
important work on which Wilson has collaborated with the National Theater and
Concert Hall, but this is the first time he has cooperated with U Theatre and
Tang.</P>
      <P>Wilson said in January that he believes Eastern and Western cultures are not
separate, and that he has sought to find a unity of East and West through
collaboration with Taiwanese artists.</P>
      <P>In 2008, Taiwan's U theater was invited to attend a workshop at the Watermill
Center in New York, where Wilson invited artists from around the world to
exchange artistic experiences and collaborate in theater production.</P>
      <P>Wilson said he was impressed by the story of the ancient Chinese explorer Zheng
He by writer Liu Ruo-yu of the U Theatre, and decided to present the seven grand
voyages of the explorer in the early 15th century on stage.</P>
      <P>Between 1405 and 1433, the Ming Dynasty Emperor Yongle put Zheng as the head of
seven naval expeditions designed to establish a Chinese presence in other parts
of the world and to control trade. Zheng's huge fleet and armed forces visited
Arabia, East Africa, India, Indonesia and Thailand. He gave and received gifts
along the way, promoting diplomacy and trade. He also fought pirates plaguing
the seas.  Zheng's voyages, however, were called off by a later emperor. That is
seen by many Chinese to this day as one of the factors that curtailed further
interaction between China and other countries, which might have strengthened its
global outlook at the time.</P>
      <P>The world premiere of the Wilson's play will be presented in four acts without
intermission from Feb. 20-28 at the National Theater Hall in Taipei. By Sunnie

    <TEXT>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou sees public opinion as a ferocious
beast, an attitude that has been demonstrated in the administration's handling
of other issues besides the proposed referendum against U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>The government's fear of public opinion is most evident in its rejection  of
another  referendum  initiative  on the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>It is very strange that even as the Ma administration is presenting to the
people the benefits of the trade agreement, it is not allowing the people to
express their opinions on the issue through referendum.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, we as the bosses of the country can only try to
revese this trend ourselves. One of the weapons we can use is our power to vote,
and the other is referendum.</P>
      <P>The policy to open Taiwan's market to U.S. beef is endangering the people's
health and life, which is forcing the people to use a referendum to try to
protect themselves. Likewise, the ECFA is threatening the people's work and
lifelihood, which requires the people to use a referendum  to say no to the
headstrong Ma administration.</P>
      <P>We need to promote a "self-protection referendum" campaign to reverse Ma's
China-leaning policy -- an adverse current that is locking Taiwan's economy into
the one-China market and entwining Taiwan's politics with the one-China pitfall.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The indictment of 24 people, including well-known players, on charges of game-
fixing in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) dominated local
newspaper reports Thursday.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of their coverage of the issue: The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Banciao District Prosecutors Office indicted 24 people, five of whom were
bookmakers, on charges of fixing CPBL games.</P>
      <P>Wu Chien-pao, speaker of the Tainan County Council, was one of the people
indicted. He was accused of luring players with money and threatening them with
violence to persuade them to throw games.</P>
      <P>Many well-known players, such as Chen Chih-yuan and Chang Chih-chia, were also
indicted, to the chagrin of their fans.</P>
      <P>Another 43 players were also found to have colluded with the gambling rings to
fix games, but were either given suspended indictments or not indicted at all
because they showed remorse during the probe and handed over part of their
illegal gains.</P>
      <P>The indictment stated that three gambling rings bribed the above players to
throw 32 games between 2008 and 2009.</P>
      <P>Although the league has survived four similar scandals in the past, the last one
was the biggest in terms of the number of players involved and it threatened to
bring down the 20-year-old league. United Daily News:</P>
      <P>As if it were not bad enough that they have ruined their careers, the players
involved in the scandal are faced with lawsuits brought against them by their
clubs for more than NT$100 million (US$3.11 million) in damages.</P>
      <P>If they lose the civil suits, they will have to refund their clubs three times
the amount they were paid when they signed their contracts, and return their
salaries.</P>
      <P>La New Bears and Brother Elephants have held these players responsible for the
damage to the league, in an effort to show determination to clean up pro
baseball.</P>
      <P>The players who handed over part of their ill-gotten gains and whose indictments
were suspended were ordered to carry out 40 to 200 hours of community service.</P>
      <P>Based on the amount they had already spent from their illegal takings, their
service will be worth NT$4,000 to NT$20,000 per hour. China Times:</P>
      <P>The prosecutors found that the players involved in the scandal originated mainly
from several high schools that boast good baseball teams.</P>
      <P>The bookmakers were able to gain easy access to these players by first
contacting one alumnus who would then lure the others to take the bait,
according to the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also found that Wang Guanghui, a former manager of Brother
Elephants, was one of the few who turned down the bribes.</P>
      <P>The investigators said the bookmakers tried three times to gain Wang's
cooperation but he rejected their offers each time. (Feb. 11, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-hua said Thursday he hopes people displaced by
Typhoon Morakot can be resettled in permanent houses before the first
anniversary of storm that wreaked havoc in southern Taiwan last August.</P>
      <P>"I am pleased to see land being prepared for the construction of permanent homes
for typhoon survivors in several mountain villages in the southernmost county of
Pingtung and I hope all the new houses can be completed by the end of July, "
Jiang said while inspecting Majia Farm, the site of the resettlement project.</P>
      <P>Majia Farm in Pingtung's Majia township will accommodate about 350 households
from the county's Haucha and Dashe villages, both of which were destroyed by
Morakot-triggered floodwaters and mudslides.</P>
      <P>As some households in Majia township have provided ancestral land for the
construction project, they will also be part of Majia Farm, bringing the total
number of houses to be built on the site to 483, according to Tu Ming-han,
president of World Vision Taiwan, which is sponsoring the Majia resettlement
project.</P>
      <P>Tu told Jiang that the most difficult aspect of the construction project was the
land acquisition.</P>
      <P>"Now that the thorny land issue has been resolved,  land preparation has begun
and construction will start in March... Once it starts, it will proceed swiftly
and smoothly and we believe all 483 new houses will be ready for occupancy by
typhoon victims by the end of July," Tu said.</P>
      <P>Typhoon survivors from Haucha and Dashe villages will be hired to build their
new homes under an "employment replacing relief" program, Tu added.</P>
      <P>"The new houses will all be environmentally friendly buildings, with each unit
expected to help reduce carbon emissions by 40 tons per year," Tu went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, nine churches and one elementary school will also be built on Majia
Farm. Moreover, a specialty industry development center will be established to

    <HEADLINE>Humanitarian aid knows no borders: Red Cross official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>International assistance should not be confined only to the country's diplomatic
allies, and Taiwan should do what it can to extend a helping hand whether the
country in crisis is an ally or not, C.V. Chen, president of the Red Cross
Society of the Republic of China, has suggested.</P>
      <P>In an article contributed to the China Times, Chen discussed the signifance of
President Ma Ying-jeou's recent trip to the Carribeans.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he suggested to President Ma Ying-jeou prior to the president's
recent visit to Honduras and the Dominican Republic that Taiwan should not
donate only money to the impoverished and devastated Caribbean nation, but
should also use its expertise and resources in post-disaster reconstruction to
help the Haitian people get back to normal life.</P>
      <P>Ma then floated this idea during a meeting with Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max
Bellerive and Dominican President Leonel Fernandez in the Dominican Republic,
winning support from both leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that since Ma declared a diplomatic truce with China following his
inauguration in 2008, the president has set great store on foreign policy that
has a legitimate purpose, uses legal means and is implemented efficiently.</P>
      <P>In his article, Chen said this approach creates a situation that is beneficial
in four major aspects.</P>
      <P>First, Taiwan earns respect for such assistance because every penny spent goes
toward the development of its diplomatic allies, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Second, it serves the people of the diplomatic allies rather than simply lining
the pockets of high officials in those countries.</P>
      <P>Third, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait no longer have to engage in checkbook
diplomacy in their tug-of-war for diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Finally, Taiwan contributes more to the international community with less
political interference, Chen said, noting that Taiwan, though having limited
resources in some respects, is rich in terms of the capacity and the will to
carry out humanitarian work.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested to Ma that the government should track and monitor the
progress and results of the reconstruction work in Haiti.</P>
      <P>International assistance should not be confined only to the country's diplomatic
allies either, Chen went on in the article, adding that Taiwan should do what it
can to extend a helping hand whether the country in crisis is an ally or not.</P>
      <P>He said the private sector is the most dynamic sector in Taiwan and that
whenever disaster strikes somewhere in the world, it is Taiwanese private and
religious groups that are most efficient at mobilizing for assistance.</P>
      <P>The government, however, has not used the strengths of the non-government
offices to make the maximum efficient use of the available resources, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed a positive outlook regarding the diplomatic direction of the Ma
administration, but said that its attitude and operations should be more open
and should be further refined.</P>

      <P>Had the state-run petroleum refiner CPC Corp. not been caught overcharging
consumers NT$5.44 billion for air pollution fees and a crude oil fund, would it
have returned the money to the people voluntarily? Had the dual nationality case
of former Legislator Lee Ching-an not been brought to light, would anyone have
demanded that she return the more-than NT$100 million in salary that she
received illegally?</P>
      <P>The answers to these questions are very simple: Definitely not.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers are supposed to watch taxpayers' money on behalf of the people, but
why do these legislators not amend the law to require those whose elections
were annulled to return their campaign subsidies? The answer is because every
legislator is afraid that he or she could be caught involved in an irregularity
one day and be forced to return money.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang used to be chairman of CPC. How
could he possibly be unaware that the company has been overcharging consumers?</P>
      <P>If Shih was aware of the situation but did not step in, he was unfairly favoring

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Mixed reaction to relaxed investment rules</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's latest move to relax restrictions  on China-bound high-tech investment
has drawn mixed reaction from the local business community.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said the latest
liberalization move is not enough to help local chip makers grab larger market
shares in China.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, some foreign securities brokerage analysts said the newly relaxed
investment regulations will help companies in flat panel and wafer fab sectors
save transport costs and improve operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan further relaxed restrictions Wednesday on China-bound investment in the
flat panel, chip foundry, high-end chip packaging and testing, and low-end IC
design sectors, taking another step forward in its efforts to forge closer
economic and trade links with China.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, Taiwanese companies will also be allowed to buy into
or merge with Chinese wafer fabs.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Under the revised rules, Taiwanese TFT-LCD makers will conditionally be allowed
to invest in facilities more advanced than 6th-generation plants, but the number
of such plants will be capped at three.</P>
      <P>In addition, the flat panel plants to be set up in China must be less advanced
than the applicant's Taiwan facility by at least one generation, the rules
stipulate.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, the current system of allowing local companies to
establish no more than three 8-inch wafer foundries will be maintained,  and
restrictions on the establishment of less technologically advanced facilities
will be removed.</P>
      <P>As for 12-inch wafer fabs using processes more advanced than 0.13 micrometers,
Economic Affairs Minister Shih Yen-shiang quoted local wafer processors as
saying that they are in no hurry to head to China to build or acquire plants for
the manufacture of 12-inch wafers.</P>
      <P>"The two prominent pending cases involving Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) should be addressed first, "
Shih said. (Feb. 11, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' relaxation of restrictions on Taiwanese high-
tech investment in China will serve to free TSMC and UMC from their investment
entanglements in China.</P>
      <P>The relaxed regulations pertaining to acquisition will help settle the
intellectual property rights dispute between TSMC and the China-based
Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and help resolve UMC's
controversial investment in China's Hejian Co.</P>
      <P>In turn, the new regulations are also expected to benefit more than 1 million
investors  in these two leading  semiconductor manufacturing companies. (Feb.
11, 2010)</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Some people have argued that Taiwanese makers may not be able to compete with
their South Korean counterparts in China because the Korean government has
allowed its companies to establish up to 8.5-generation plants, while Taiwan
manufacturers are permitted to set up plants only up to 7.5-generation.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs have discounted this view,
saying that Taiwan's cap on this type of investment is set at 7.5-generation at
present, but Taiwanese makers may be allowed to invest in 8.5-generation plants
in China if they continue to upgrade their manufacturing technologies at home.</P>
      <P>Besides, the officials noted, the Chinese authorities have not yet approved
high-end investment  by any South Korean TFT-LCD manufacturer.</P>
      <P>Currently, about half of the flat panels sold throughout China are supplied by
Taiwanese makers, they said. In addition, the TFT-LCD manufacturing industry is
expected to be included on the early harvest list during talks between Taiwan
and China on a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , which
Taiwan hopes can be signed in the first half of this year, the officials added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Tsai not ready for meeting with president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/11/10  15:59:44
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma has said several times that he would like to meet with Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, but each time Tsai has given a
different excuse for not being able to meet with the president.</P>
      <P>However, the real reason is that she would find herself under great pressure in
any meeting with Ma, and she's not ready for that.</P>
      <P>Since the fall of President Chen Shiu-bian and the pro-independence movement in
2008, the DPP has not yet come up with a cohesive position on the country's
status or its future.</P>
      <P>If the DPP cannot formulate a theory on Taiwan's status and develop a China
policy based on that, Tsai's meeting with Ma would be pointless.</P>
      <P>There is some truth to the statement by political pundits that Ma has the upper
hand in terms of policy but is the underdog in public polls.</P>
      <P>Ma insists  that the country  is the Republic  of China, acknowledges the 1992
Consensus that states there is one China but with different interpretations, and
is pushing a policy of reaching out to China without altering the status quo.
But what would be Tsai's stance on these issues? Would she agree with Ma on the
1992 Consensus? Would she agree with Ma's promises to set aside the question of
Taiwan independence or unification with China and to renounce violence?</P>
      <P>If she doesn't, what alternatives she can offer the people?</P>
      <P>If Tsai is opposed to Ma's idea of a trade pact with China, then she has to
offer an alternative that would address the problems Taiwan would face as the
result of a new trading bloc that revolves around ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tsai's alternatives would have to stand up to public scrutiny, not
just offhand snide criticisms by other politicians.</P>
      <P>Tsai is reported to be working on a 10-year manifesto for the DPP, which would
form the basis of the party's policies under her leadership. The title of the
manifesto indicates that it would be a short-lived document.</P>
      <P>We do not expect too much from this manifesto because 10 years is too short a
time to implement any national policy. But we do hope that Tsai will accept Ma's
invitation for a meeting and will give the public new hope.(Feb. 11, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Oversight committee on cross-strait affairs redundant: scholar</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
02/11/10  15:59:48

    <TEXT>
      <P>A scholar on East Asian affairs stated in in a newspaper opinion piece that as
the legislature's Internal Administration  Committee  already  oversees  issues
related to cross-Taiwan strait exchanges, a new legislative committee for this
purpose would be redundant.</P>
      <P>Professor Chiu Kun-Shuan of National Cheng Chi University noted in the United
Daily News article Tuesday that the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislative caucus is demanding the establishment of a legislative
committee to oversee the current cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>"DPP legislators may have forgotten that in 2005 during their party's rule,
their legislative caucus was strongly against the establishment of a cross-
strait committee and they suggested that such a committee would intrude on the
president's jurisdiction, "he stated.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday in a press briefing on the
proposed cross-strait agreement that while the government would not shun
oversight, he would expect that the jurisdiction of the legislature would be
observed, in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of the governmental system, a proper assessment should be
made to see whether the legislature falls short in its performance of such
functions, the scholar suggested.</P>
      <P>Currently, the Mainland Affairs Council reports to the Internal Administration
Committee of the legislature, and arranges informal briefings  on the
government's  cross-strait  policies  to the legislative speaker and executives
of party caucuses, the professor stated.</P>
      <P>"While the legislative committee holds the decision-making power, all motions
must be forwarded to the general assembly," he added.</P>
      <P>"Important policies, such as the signing of an ECFA which involves legal issues
such as tariffs, must be screened by the Internal Administration Committee and
approved by the assembly before they could be implemented," he elaborated.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Executive Yuan has decided to give 10 briefings to the
legislature on the progress of the ECFA negotiations from February to June, he
said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the creation of a new legislative committee would be redundant,  Chiu
said. An oversight mechanism for cross-strait negotiations has always been
there, and it is not possible for the Executive Yuan to unilaterally make
relevant decisions, he added.</P>

seminar in Taiwan on swine flu by an official Chinese delegation led by China's
vice health minister in January as an important milestone in cross-strait
efforts on epidemic disease prevention.</P>
      <P>"We expect cross-strait exchanges to expand beyond business and investment to
other areas such as the biotechnology and medical fields," Ma said at his
office, where he met with winners of the 2009 National Biotechnology and Medical
Quality Awards presented by the National Institute for Biotechnology and
Medicine Industry.</P>
      <P>The institute was founded by Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng  and is
presently  chaired by former National Taiwan University President Chen Wei-chao.</P>
      <P>The president noted that Chen led a Taiwanese delegation to China last year and
that the visit was reciprocated by a visit to Taiwan in January by Chinese Vice
Health Minister Huang Jiefu for the swine flu seminar.</P>
      <P>He said the biotechnology industry is crucial for Taiwan's long-term development
and was listed last February as one of the six emerging  industries  in Taiwan
entitled to special investment incentives.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , which
streamlined four bureaus under the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) into
one and became officially operational Jan. 1, will also help accelerate the
modernization of the country's food and drug management.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Thursday dismissed media reports that
the Indonesian government has prohibited its fishermen from commissioning the
construction of fishing boats in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian government has given the assurance that as the two countries are
World Trade Organization members, Indonesia would not take any discriminatory
action against Taiwan that could breach the WTO's most-favored trading partner
principle, a MOFA official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Forbidding fishing industry operators from buying boats from Taiwan, or
preventing them from placing orders with Taiwanese shipbuilders would amount to
discriminatory behavior, under the terms of the WTO agreement, the Indonesian
government indicated.</P>
      <P>Under the WTO principle, each members should treat the others equally as "most-
favored" trading partners.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports Wednesday, shipbuilders in southern Taiwan
complained to opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Kuan Bi-ling in
January that Indonesia had ordered its fishermen to stop commissioning fishing
trawlers from Taiwan. The directive has resulted in losses of about NT$100
million a year, the shipbuilders reportedly said.</P>
      <P>However, the Indonesian government said that in order to protect its fishery
resources, improve management of fishing boats, and encourage foreign
investment, it has suspended imports of old fishing boats, unless the import
orders are placed by foreign companies or foreign-invested companies that have
fish processing plants in Indonesia, according to the MOFA official.</P>
      <P>The policy applies to all countries in the world, not just one country, the
Indonesian government said, stressing that it has not banned the importation of
newly constructed fishing boats.</P>
      <P>Suhartono, head of the Indonesian Economic and Trade Office in Taipei, has said
that Taiwanese ships are popular among Indonesian fishing operators because of
their competitive price and quality, and are incomparable with those built in
other East Asian countries, the official added.</P>

      <P>500 days after the eruption of the global financial crisis, four EU member
states' financial problems have sent shockwaves through the world again.</P>
      <P>The four countries -- Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain -- are saddled by huge
government debts that have put their sovereign credit in crisis.</P>
      <P>As a result, investors have retreated en masse from their bourses, causing a
plummet of stock prices worldwide, with even Taiwan feeling the pinch.</P>
      <P>The four states were relatively feeble in the EU in terms of financial strength
prior to the crisis.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the global financial crisis, all four followed the lead of
other EU states by raising loans to finance extra spending to stimulate economic
growth.</P>
      <P>However, as states with the euro as their currency, they are subject to EU
limitations on government loans and had to increase taxes to offset the loans.</P>
      <P>They therefore found themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place, as
increasing taxes undid their efforts to stimulate the economy by increasing
government spending.</P>
      <P>In order to defuse their crises, the EU has had to funnel 200 billion euros into
them, or they would be forced to withdraw from the EU in exchange for free scope
to deal with their problems, which would cripple the EU, or else they would have
to retreat from the euro, which would reduce the EU into a free trade zone and

      <P>The U.S. government has adopted an increasingly tougher stance on its dealings
with China, according to ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang, who
had just returned from a visit to the U.S.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Thursday that many of the senators, congressmen and scholars he met
during his visit were of the opinion that there might be "subtle" changes in
Washington's China policy since President Barack Obama's moderate and low-key
approach toward China has received no positive response from Beijing, as
evidenced by such international issues as the value of the Chinese currency and
climate change.</P>
      <P>After being criticized  as being  "too weak, " the Obama administration has
recently turned tougher toward China, Hsieh said, citing Obama's approval late
last month of an arms sales package to Taiwan and the possibility that he might
meet with the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government has notified Congress of its decision on the arms sales
package, which includes 60 UH- 60M Black Hawk helicopters worth US$3.1 billion,
two Osprey Class mine-hunting ships and 12 ATM-84L and RTM-84L Harpoon Block II
Telemetry missiles.</P>
      <P>Also included are 114 Patriot Advanced Capability  (PAC-3) missiles  and
technical  support  worth  US$2.82  billion,  35 multifunctional information
distribution systems low volume terminals (MIDS/LVT-1) and 25 MIDS on ships
terminals. The arms sales will take effect if the U.S. Congress does not voice
objections within 30 days of the notification and the package is expected to
become effective in a week.</P>
      <P>"Subtle changes are taking place among the triangular Taipei- Washington-Beijing
relations, and Taiwan should try to strike a strategic balance in the
relationship so as to pursue its best interests, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh met with U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, House Representative Patrick J.
Kennedy and Walter Lohman, director of the Asian Studies Center of the Heritage
Foundation, as well as several other think thank experts.</P>
      <P>He extended his appreciation for the arms deal, and expressed hope both that a
Taipei-Washington extradition treaty can be signed and that Taiwan can be
included on Washington's list of visa-waiver countries.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih stressed Thursday the need to improve management of state-
owned  businesses  and he instructed a Cabinet task force to ensure greater
transparency in the operations of such enterprises to make them more
competitive.</P>
      <P>Wu issued the directive after being briefed by Ministry of Finance (MOF)
officials on the issue, at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>The premier asked that the task force, led by Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu, to
more closely monitor the government agencies that are in charge of running state
companies.</P>
      <P>He said management transparency and the operational strategies of these
businesses must be improved in order for them to become more efficient and
profitable.</P>
      <P>To that end, a set of national-level management mechanisms must be put in place,
Wu added.</P>
      <P>In the Cabinet briefing, the MOF officials said the central government has total
"direct investments" of NT$37.9 trillion (US$ 1.184 trillion) in 49 businesses.
Some 377 government appointees sit on the boards of these enterprises, the MOF
reported.</P>
      <P>The central government also has NT$74.24 billion worth of "indirect investments"
in 674 businesses, in which there are 2,214 government appointed supervisors and
board members, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>The major problems facing these state-run companies are the lack of a standard
system for evaluating and paying personnel, as well as poor performance and
incompetence, the MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>With some of these state enterprises being operated by different government
agencies, there is often a lack of coordination among the different departments,
they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Players involved in game-fixing banned from teaching</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Sports Affairs Council (SAC) said Thursday that baseball players who face
termination  of their professional baseball careers for game-fixing will also be
forbidden from becoming teachers or coaches.</P>
      <P>The tough move is seen as a fresh show of the SAC's determination to revitalize
baseball in the wake of the indictment of 24 people on charges of game-fixing in
the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Among those indicted were Brother Elephants star outfielder Chen Chih-yuan and
former La New Bears star pitcher Chang Chih-chia. Brother Elephants said
Wednesday that it had decided to fire Chen.</P>
      <P>SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling said that although not being able to play baseball
again is the biggest punishment for a professional baseball player, there is a
consensus between the SAC and the Ministry of Education that the criminals must
also not be allowed to teach or coach.  Tai expressed hope that the prosecutors
will bring all those involved to justice.</P>
      <P>"We will face this crisis even if it means rubbing salt into the wound," she
said.</P>
      <P>She said the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has cooperated with the National Police
Agency to set up an emergency game-fixing reporting system.</P>
      <P>After the CPBL season begins March 20, prosecutors will also visit various
stadiums to monitor the games, she added.</P>
      <P>According to Cabinet spokesman Su Jun-pin, Premier Wu Den-yih has asked the MOJ
to step up its crackdown on game-fixing so as not to disappoint the country's
baseball fans.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Sinon Bulls released a statement announcing its decision to
dismiss outfielder  Hsieh Chia-hsien for receiving inappropriate gains and for
maintaining close interaction with a gambling ring, although Hsieh was not
indicted due to lack of evidence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling Kuomintang's disciplinary committee decided to revoke the
membership of Tainan County Council Speaker Wu Chien-pao, who was indicted on
charges of fraud and gambling for bribing baseball players to manipulate game
results.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Exhaustion has prompted Su Chi to step down as the top national security advisor
to President Ma Ying-jeou, sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"I am actually very exhausted, " the government sources quoted the secretary
general of the National Security Council (NSC) as saying.</P>
      <P>Su expressed to Ma his desire to quit after he returned from a diplomatic tour
to Central America at the end of January with the president, according to the
sources, who requested anonymity.</P>
      <P>Ma approved Su's resignation earlier in the day after holding several
discussions with Su in recent days. Su Announced his resignation at a hastily
called press conference Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su is expected to remain as one of Ma's important advisors on national policies,
the sources said.</P>
      <P>Su is known for coining a term of "1992 consensus, " by which he asserted  that
Taiwan  and China  agreed  to have their  own interpretation of "one China" to
avoid Taiwan's sovereignty issue becoming an obstacle in developing cross-strait
relations with China.</P>
      <P>The sources said Su decided to resign at this time because he believes the NSC
has made several achievements, including restoring the trust of the country's
"important international friends."</P>
      <P>Also, the NSC has helped ease the tense situation between Taiwan and its long-
time political rival China since Ma took office, the sources said.</P>
      <P>"Su hopes to take a break for a while because he never took a day off during his
20-month term in office," the sources said.</P>
      <P>Su had liver cancer in the past and needs to undergo a health checkup every four
months, the sources said, adding that Su has delayed his health exam several
times because of his job.</P>
      <P>The result of Su's last health checkup was okay, they said.</P>
      <P>The sources dismissed allegations that Su resigned to take responsibility for
the U.S. beef import controversy which erupted a few months ago, in which the
U.S. accused Taiwan of violating a protocol after Taiwan's legislature passed a
law amendment to restrict U.S. beef products, overturning an administration
decision to lift a ban on certain U.S. beef products.</P>
      <P>The impact of the controversy has already been minimized and it did not affect
the decision by the United States to allow President Ma to make a recent transit
stop in the U.S. during his diplomatic trip abroad, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>New NSC Secretary General Hu Wei-jen, a career diplomat, will be sworn in on
Feb. 23.</P>

      <P>Following an improvement  in the unemployment situation, 68 percent of
enterprises that responded to a recent survey plan to recruit new employees
after the Chinese New Year holiday, an online job bank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey conducted by the 104 Job Bank among 604
companies Jan. 14-20, of the 68 companies planning to recruit, 49.5 percent have
listed job vacancies before the holiday.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that 77 percent of the respondents said they believe that this
year, Taiwan's economy will revert to how it was before the global financial
crisis, while 53 percent even expressed optimism that the recovery will take
hold in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Finance, investment consulting and insurance providers are the most optimistic
of economic recovery, with 64 percent predicting that the economy will rebound
to the level of before the financial crisis in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Their optimism is based on the hope that the signing of memorandums  of
understanding  (MOUs)  on financial  regulatory cooperation with China and the
opening to Chinese investment in Taiwan will give a boost to teh local economy,
said Fang Guang-wei, public relations manager for 104 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  60.8 percent of companies from the information technology, software
and semiconductor sector, and 60 percent from the construction industry, expect
the economy to recover to the level of before the financial crisis during the
first six months.</P>
      <P>Less than 40 percent of enterprises in the logistics and warehouse sector, as
well as in the tourism, leisure and sports sector had the same opinion.</P>
      <P>Among those with the highest demand for new employees are computer, consumer
electronics and semiconductor manufacturers, the insurance, financial and
banking industry, and the optics and photonics sector.</P>
      <P>In terms of occupation, marketing and sales representatives, finance
professionals, technicians, customer service personnel and R&amp;D specialists
in engineering are in highest demand.</P>
      <P>According to another survey by the same job bank, the number of job-seekers in
February dropped 10.5 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, unemployed people spent an average of 6.42 months
finding a job.</P>
      <P>Of those looking for work, people in the medical and health care sector and the
environmental sanitation sector spent the least time of about 3.6 months before
finding a job, while those in the construction and real estate sector spent 3.6
months and those in financial and insurance companies spent 3.8 months before
finding work.</P>
      <P>It took 5.4 months for service sector workers to find a job and 5.8 months for
those in the manufacturing sector, while it took 8.5 months in the computer-
related industry, 9.8 months in the cultural and education sector and 9.9 months
in the wholesale and direct-sale business.</P>
      <P>People who are still unemployed have been out of work for an average of 8.04

      <P>Taiwan's top envoy to the Philippines urged Manila Thursday to continue
maintaining balance in its dealings with the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
regardless of the outcome of a May 10 presidential election in the Southeast
Asian country.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Donald C.T. Lee called on the next president of
the Philippines  to conduct broader dialogue and exchanges on a wide range of
fronts with Taiwan, saying that the Philippines should not overlook Taiwan's
existence as a developed society.</P>
      <P>He also called for Manila's support of Taiwan's membership of the International
Civil Aviation Organization and urged the signing of a free trade agreement with
Taiwan quickly.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the Manila-based Taipei Economic and Cultural Office,
Taiwan's de-facto embassy in the Philippines, has extended technical assistance
and has made several donations to the country, including  fire engines,

      <P>According  to Lee,  Taiwan is also planning to contribute US$280,000 worth of
weather forecasting facilities to help the Luzon Island authorities set up 15

    <TEXT>
      <P>The resignation of President Ma Ying-jeou's top security aide has come too late
and the political integrity and ability of his replacement remains questionable,
a spokesman for the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu Chien-hsin, deputy head of the DPP's policy research and coordination
department, was referring to the resignation of Su Chi from his post as
secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC) and the Presidential
Office's announcement of Hu Wei-jen, a retired diplomat, as Su's successor.</P>
      <P>"Su should have resigned much earlier because his inept handling of the U.S.
beef import protocol has cost our country dearly, " Liu said.</P>
      <P>Su, one of Ma's most trusted advisers, is believed to have played a key role in
striking a deal with the United States last October that would see Taiwan
lifting import bans on U.S. bone-in beef and bovine offal.</P>
      <P>The deal sparked strong opposition in Taiwan and prompted the Legislative Yuan
to pass legal amendments to bar imports of U.S. ground beef and bovine offal
over mad cow disease concerns. The about-face, however, drew a backlash from the
United States, which has suspended a planned resumption of sub-Cabinet-level
talks under a Taiwan-U.S.  Trade and Investment  Framework Agreement and has
threatened to bring the dispute to the World Trade Organization for arbitration.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chun-yee, the DPP's legislative whip, said Su's resignation was
mainly a gambit by the Ma administration to sacrifice a lower-level functionary
in a bid to protect Ma and halt the continuing downward spiral of his public
approval ratings.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, he doubts the effectiveness of the tactic because the
resignation came too late.</P>
      <P>"Su should have resigned right after the legislature passed amendments to the
Food Sanitation Act," he added.</P>
      <P>On Su's replacement, meanwhile, Liu Chien-hsin noted that Hu was Taiwan's
representative to Germany and then to Singapore when the DPP was  in power.
Before  his resignation  from  the  Singapore representative post in 2007, Hu
criticized then-President Chen Shui-bian's de-sinicization drive and his
branding of the late President Chiang Kai-shek as a dictator.</P>
      <P>"Hu's statement was a show of loyalty to the then-opposition Kuomintang... His
political integrity is something that should be monitored, as he did not voice
his disagreement with the DPP's ideology until after having worked in the DPP
administration for seven years," Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Tsai Hung-liang, Hu is a hardline ideologue and
career diplomat, with little national defense and intelligence training.</P>
      <P>"Hu is a greenhorn in security affairs... He might be even more incompetent than
Su... the personnel change is a bad call, " Tsai claimed.</P>
      <P>While announcing Ma's decison to name Hu as his new top security aide,
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Hu was familiar with diplomatic
and national security affairs as he is a career diplomat and has served as
deputy chief of the National Security Bureau and deputy secretary-general of the
National Security Council.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou wasted no time to appoint his new top national security
advisor as Hu Wei-chen was selected to fill the void left by Su Chi, who
resigned as the Secretary General of the National Security Council Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hu Wei-chen, 63, will assume the post Feb. 23 right after the nine-day lunar New
Year break, replacing Su Chi, who resigned, citing health concerns and family
reasons, the Presidential Office said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Hu is a seasoned veteran on foreign affairs and national security matters and
has a military background.</P>
      <P>His father Hu Tsung-nan was a high-ranking general as well as a close confidant
of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the Kuomintang (KMT) government during World
War II and the Chinese civil war in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>His background and familiarity with military affairs will help Hu in his post at
the NSC, said Justin Chou, a ruling KMT legislator.</P>
      <P>Hu started his career as a diplomat, serving as Director General of the
Department of Protocol in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was posted in
Chicago and other cities in the United States. Later he served as Taiwan's
representative to Germany and Singapore.</P>
      <P>He was also familiar with national security affairs, serving as the deputy chief
of the National Security Bureau under former Presidents Lee Teng-hui and deputy
secretary-general of the National Security  Council  under  former  President
Chen  Shui-bian's administration.</P>
      <P>The timing of Su's resignation is intriguing, said Lo Chih-cheng, a political
scientist at Soochow University. Lo said he believes there have been internal
and external pressures -- from the U.S. or China -- that forced Su to step down.</P>
      <P>Choosing to announce the resignation right before the lunar New Year break, Lo
said, is a tactic to avoid the resignation turning into a hot topic in the media
during the nine-day break.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou said that while it is a pity to see Su go, Hu's appointment is a
correct move. He praised Hu as "a man of integrity and decency" and expected his
"brilliant performance" at the NSC.</P>
      <P>"With his military background and expertise in foreign affairs and national
security, he will do a good job, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's representative to Singapore, he criticized his own government  in
2007  when  then President  Chen attempted  to "de-Sinicize" Taiwan and to play
down the legacy of Chiang. Hu was forced to resign over the ensuing controversy.</P>
      <P>Hu is expected to pick up where Su left off in terms of national security policy
and he alone will not be able to make dramatic changes, which means the policy
of the Ma administration will remain unchanged, Lo said.</P>

      <P>The government will offer 4,000 affordable housing units for sale near the
projected Linkuo station of the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit system in 2013, with
low income families who do not already own property given purchasing preference,
a Ministry of the Interior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shih-wen,  director of the ministry's Construction and Planning Agency, said
the government will use approximately 226 hectares of reserved land and farmland
around the projected MRT station to build the housing, with each unit price kept
as low as NT$150,000 per ping (3.3 square meters).</P>
      <P>While housing prices in Taipei City and some locations in Taipei County have
been skyrocketing over the past few years, a survey report released  by the
Research,  Development  and Evaluation Commission under the Cabinet last
December indicated that high housing prices in the city topped the list of
public complaints.</P>
      <P>To help the payroll class live in their own apartments, the government therefore
decided to build affordable housing units with traffic convenience. The 4,000
units at Linkuo are expected to be completed in 2013, when an extension of the
MRT system to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is completed.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the travel time from Linkuo to the MRT's Taipei Main Station
stop will be around 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>He said more affordable housing units are planned along the line and added that
the government is also planning to build public housing units on the outskirts
of Tamsui township in Taipei County when a light rail system is built to serve
the area.</P>

      <P>The debt crisis in Europe is an aftershock of the global financial crisis and it
will be only a small problem, a local expert said Thursday, urging the public
not to panic.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible not to have aftershocks after the world has experienced such a
huge financial crisis, " Chu Yun-peng, a professor of economics at National
Central University, said at a seminar organized by the Taiwan Competitiveness
Forum.</P>
      <P>"However, these aftershocks often are smaller, " the former minister without
portfolio went on.</P>
      <P>He also said that great attention is being paid to the debt crisis affecting
Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, which will help prevent the problem from
developing into a bigger one, as governments are already taking measures.</P>
      <P>Bert Lim, president of the World Economics Society, predicted at the seminar
that the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar will decrease, as many
countries are selling the European currency from their foreign reserves.</P>
      <P>"A falling euro will make the greenback a strong currency again, " he noted.</P>
      <P>Lim added that international oil and raw material prices will also go up as the
U.S. dollar goes down but he also warned that the government should pay close
attention to the impact of a rising U.S. dollar on Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-fu,  an economics  professor  at National Taiwan University, said
decreasing tax revenues and an increasing financial deficit have taken Taiwan's
debt-to-GDP ratio to nearly 40 percent.</P>
      <P>He warned that Taiwan's debt rating might be downgraded as a result.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lo Shu-lei expressed similar concerns over
Taiwan's debt and urged the government to reconsider whether it is right to
expand public expenditure and cut taxes.</P>
      <P>Nieh Chien-Chung, a professor at Tamkang University's Banking and Finance
Department, pointed out that Greece has had a debt problem for a long time and
said the problem will not grow into another global crisis.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International

      <P>Construction of the trouble-plagued Beitou cable car system might be resumed by
the end of this year after a hiatus of almost four years, the Construction and
Planning Agency (CPA) under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>If the Taipei city government decides to cooperate with the previous winning
bidder of the contract and reports to it on the latest situation, the cable car
construction project could be rekindled by year-end, as long as the National
Parks Planning Committee under the MOI gives its approval, the CPA said.</P>
      <P>Late last year, the CPA demanded that the city government, which is in charge of
the project, report back within three months on whether it will continue
collaborating with the previous winning bidder to carry out the build-operate-
transfer (BOT) project. The deadline will expire in late February.</P>
      <P>The construction license for the project was revoked in 2005 after then-Vice
Minister of the Interior Yen Wan-ching and Cai Bai-lu, then-director of
Yangmingshan National Park, were charged with taking kickbacks from a developer
who sought to get a construction license for the project.</P>
      <P>Yen was sentenced to 15 years in prison after being found guilty on corruption

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a draft statute Thursday on dredging at three major
reservoirs in southern Taiwan in order to stabilize the water supply in the
region.</P>
      <P>According to the draft statute, the government will spend up to NT$50 billion
dredging the Tsengwen, Nanhua and Wushantou reservoirs in Chiayi and Tainan
counties,  one of Taiwan's  agricultural strongholds, over the next six years to
ensure a stable water supply in the area.</P>
      <P>Of the amount, NT$18 billion will come from a special budget to revitalize  the
domestic  economy  and  expand  infrastructure construction, while the remainder
will be financed by central government agencies and special national development
funds, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said at a weekly Cabinet
meeting during which the draft statute was passed.</P>
      <P>The three reservoirs are major sources of water for household, irrigation  and
industrial  use in southern  Taiwan.  Due to environmental degradation and
inadequate conservation efforts, the three reservoirs have become swamped with
silt, which has limited their storage capacities and has led to water shortages
in the region.</P>
      <P>After listening to Shih's report, Premier Wu Den-yih said ensuring a stable
water supply in the south is a government priority.</P>
      <P>As ecological conservation in the catchment areas and reservoir management are
crucial to the functioning of reservoirs, Wu said, the relevant city and county
governments should step up monitoring and cracking down on illegal logging,
farming and construction in the catchment areas to prevent mudslides in upstream
catchment areas.</P>
      <P>According to the special statute, no new access roads can be created in the
three reservoirs' catchment areas and construction of sand dams must meet the
provisions set forth in the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law.</P>
      <P>The new project will also include the improvement of existing access roads in
the regions, but the roads will not be allowed to expand.</P>
      <P>"The whole project will be finished in six years," Shih said at a news
conference after the Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>The statute will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for screening and
approval.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese deep-sea fishing vessel and all its crew were released Thursday
after the boat's owner paid a ransom to Somali pirates, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton longliner Win Far 161, with a crew of 30, was hijacked by Somali
pirates near an island in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean April 6 last year,
a MOFA official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since the incident, the MOFA used every means over the past 10 months to seek
assistance from various international organizations in an effort to rescue the
vessel and crew, the official added.</P>
      <P>After receiving information that the ship was to be released, the MOFA also
helped the owner to contact international maritime and anti-piracy organizations
to ask them to provide humanitarian aid and protection for the ship and its crew
upon the release, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Through their efforts, the crewmen were provided with food, water and fuel and
were given health checks and other support, the official said.</P>
      <P>The government also expressed gratitude for the help provided by the
international organizations.</P>
      <P>The rescue efforts were made even more difficult because of the Somalian interim
provisional government's inability to rule the country and because of the
withdrawal of U.S., British and U.N. bases and other international organizations
from the country due to the political unrest there, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The MOFA warned that Taiwanese fishing vessels should steer clear of waters near
East Africa to avoid the many Somali pirates who operate there with near-
impunity.</P>
      <P>Those that insist on sailing in the area should be registered with the European
Maritime Safety Agency through its Web site: www.mschoa.com. The agency is
responsible for improving maritime safety by providing technical assistance, it
said.</P>

      <P>Former Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey was impeached
Thursday by the Control Yuan for improperly using a government reserve fund to
finance a publicity drive for a referendum bill launched by the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Taiwan's bid for membership in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The referendum, which was initiated in 2007 by the then-ruling DPP to ask voters
whether Taiwan should join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan," was
vetoed March 22, 2008.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the country's top watchdog agency, approved by a 10-2 vote the
motion submitted by yuan members Ma Hsiu-ju and Ma Yi-kung to impeach Hsieh</P>
      <P>Ma Hsiu-ju said Hsieh twice transferred from the Cabinet's reserve fund a total
of NT$45 million to finance a publicity campaign to urge the public to support
the referendum bill.</P>
      <P>During the investigation process, Hsieh agreed that government funds should not
be used in support of any drive launched by a political party, according to Ma
Hsiu-ju.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added, almost all the amount of money was spent before the March
22 voting day, without considering the fact the U.N. General Assembly session
opened in September -- a clear indication that Hsieh simply used the publicity
campaign to boost the DPP's bill rather than to actually promote Taiwan's U.N.
membership.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan also censured the Executive Yuan, the GIO, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Sports Affairs Council in
collaborating with Hsieh in using the funds.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Control Yuan's decision was "unacceptable" but that he would not
decide how to respond until after he had read the official impeachment letter.</P>

      <P>Officials from Canadian transport manufacturer Bombardier wrapped up a two-day
visit to Taiwan Thursday in which they gave demonstrations aimed at promoting
the company's lower-emission and fuel-efficient airliners.</P>
      <P>Bombardier Aerospace arranged two demonstration flights of its Q400 NextGen
turboprop airliner at Taipei's Songshan Airport for representatives from almost
all Taiwan's air carriers, many of which expressed  interest,  said Kelvin
Hung,  a representative  of Bombardier's commercial agent in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The  demo  tour  received  positive  responses  from  the representatives  but
they will conduct  reviews  before making decisions," Hung said.</P>
      <P>The visit to Taiwan, part of an Asia-Pacific tour, presented an opportunity to
showcase one of the world's most technologically advanced turboprops optimized
for the short-haul regional market, said Trung Ngo, the company's Asia Pacific
vice president of sales.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese carriers are looking to replace older airliners in their fleets and,
after the Taiwan High Speed Rail began operating in 2007, have changed their
operating strategies to focus on flights serving outlying islands such as
Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu instead of other domestic flights, Hung said.</P>
      <P>They are expected to use their jet planes for direct flights between Taiwan and
China and to use turboprop airliners with a capacity of between 56 and 80
passengers for flights to the outlying islands, he added.</P>
      <P>The planes could also be used for the "mini three links" that allow for limited
postal, transport, and trade links between China's Fujian Province cities of
Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou, and Taiwan's islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>

      <P>Following an improvement  in the unemployment situation, 68 percent of
enterprises that responded to a recent survey plan to recruit new employees
after the Chinese New Year holiday, an online job bank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey conducted by the 104 Job Bank among 604
companies Jan. 14-20, of the 68 companies planning to recruit, 49.5 percent have

      <P>Finance, investment consulting and insurance providers are the most optimistic
of economic recovery, with 64 percent predicting that the economy will rebound
to the level of before the financial crisis in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Their optimism is based on the hope that the signing of memorandums  of
understanding  (MOUs)  on financial  regulatory cooperation with China and the
opening to Chinese investment in Taiwan will give a boost to teh local economy,
said Fang Guang-wei, public relations manager for 104 Job Bank.</P>

first six months.</P>
      <P>Less than 40 percent of enterprises in the logistics and warehouse sector, as
well as in the tourism, leisure and sports sector had the same opinion.</P>
      <P>Among those with the highest demand for new employees are computer, consumer
electronics and semiconductor manufacturers, the insurance, financial and
banking industry, and the optics and photonics sector.</P>
      <P>In terms of occupation, marketing and sales representatives, finance
professionals, technicians, customer service personnel and R&amp;D specialists
in engineering are in highest demand.</P>
      <P>According to another survey by the same job bank, the number of job-seekers in
February dropped 10.5 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Over the past two months, unemployed people spent an average of 6.42 months
finding a job.</P>
      <P>Of those looking for work, people in the medical and health care sector and the
environmental sanitation sector spent the least time of about 3.6 months before
finding a job, while those in the construction and real estate sector spent 3.6
months and those in financial and insurance companies spent 3.8 months before

      <P>The resignation of President Ma Ying-jeou's top security aide has come too late
and the political integrity and ability of his replacement remains questionable,
a spokesman for the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu Chien-hsin, deputy head of the DPP's policy research and coordination
department, was referring to the resignation of Su Chi from his post as
secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC) and the Presidential
Office's announcement of Hu Wei-jen, a retired diplomat, as Su's successor.</P>
      <P>"Su should have resigned much earlier because his inept handling of the U.S.
beef import protocol has cost our country dearly, " Liu said.</P>
      <P>Su, one of Ma's most trusted advisers, is believed to have played a key role in
striking a deal with the United States last October that would see Taiwan
lifting import bans on U.S. bone-in beef and bovine offal.</P>
      <P>The deal sparked strong opposition in Taiwan and prompted the Legislative Yuan
to pass legal amendments to bar imports of U.S. ground beef and bovine offal
over mad cow disease concerns. The about-face, however, drew a backlash from the
United States, which has suspended a planned resumption of sub-Cabinet-level
talks under a Taiwan-U.S.  Trade and Investment  Framework Agreement and has
threatened to bring the dispute to the World Trade Organization for arbitration.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chun-yee, the DPP's legislative whip, said Su's resignation was
mainly a gambit by the Ma administration to sacrifice a lower-level functionary
in a bid to protect Ma and halt the continuing downward spiral of his public
approval ratings.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, he doubts the effectiveness of the tactic because the
resignation came too late.</P>
      <P>"Su should have resigned right after the legislature passed amendments to the
Food Sanitation Act," he added.</P>
      <P>On Su's replacement, meanwhile, Liu Chien-hsin noted that Hu was Taiwan's
representative to Germany and then to Singapore when the DPP was  in power.
Before  his resignation  from  the  Singapore representative post in 2007, Hu
criticized then-President Chen Shui-bian's de-sinicization drive and his
branding of the late President Chiang Kai-shek as a dictator.</P>
      <P>"Hu's statement was a show of loyalty to the then-opposition Kuomintang... His
political integrity is something that should be monitored, as he did not voice
his disagreement with the DPP's ideology until after having worked in the DPP
administration for seven years," Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Legislator Tsai Hung-liang, Hu is a hardline ideologue and
career diplomat, with little national defense and intelligence training.</P>
      <P>"Hu is a greenhorn in security affairs... He might be even more incompetent than
Su... the personnel change is a bad call, " Tsai claimed.</P>
      <P>While announcing Ma's decison to name Hu as his new top security aide,
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Hu was familiar with diplomatic
and national security affairs as he is a career diplomat and has served as
deputy chief of the National Security Bureau and deputy secretary-general of the
National Security Council.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou wasted no time to appoint his new top national security
advisor as Hu Wei-chen was selected to fill the void left by Su Chi, who
resigned as the Secretary General of the National Security Council Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hu Wei-chen, 63, will assume the post Feb. 23 right after the nine-day lunar New
Year break, replacing Su Chi, who resigned, citing health concerns and family
reasons, the Presidential Office said in a press release.</P>
      <P>Hu is a seasoned veteran on foreign affairs and national security matters and
has a military background.</P>
      <P>His father Hu Tsung-nan was a high-ranking general as well as a close confidant
of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the Kuomintang (KMT) government during World
War II and the Chinese civil war in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>His background and familiarity with military affairs will help Hu in his post at
the NSC, said Justin Chou, a ruling KMT legislator.</P>
      <P>Hu started his career as a diplomat, serving as Director General of the
Department of Protocol in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was posted in
Chicago and other cities in the United States. Later he served as Taiwan's
representative to Germany and Singapore.</P>
      <P>He was also familiar with national security affairs, serving as the deputy chief
of the National Security Bureau under former Presidents Lee Teng-hui and deputy
secretary-general of the National Security  Council  under  former  President
Chen  Shui-bian's administration.</P>
      <P>The timing of Su's resignation is intriguing, said Lo Chih-cheng, a political
scientist at Soochow University. Lo said he believes there have been internal
and external pressures -- from the U.S. or China -- that forced Su to step down.</P>
      <P>Choosing to announce the resignation right before the lunar New Year break, Lo
said, is a tactic to avoid the resignation turning into a hot topic in the media
during the nine-day break.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou said that while it is a pity to see Su go, Hu's appointment is a
correct move. He praised Hu as "a man of integrity and decency" and expected his
"brilliant performance" at the NSC.</P>
      <P>"With his military background and expertise in foreign affairs and national
security, he will do a good job, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's representative to Singapore, he criticized his own government  in
2007  when  then President  Chen attempted  to "de-Sinicize" Taiwan and to play
down the legacy of Chiang. Hu was forced to resign over the ensuing controversy.</P>
      <P>Hu is expected to pick up where Su left off in terms of national security policy
and he alone will not be able to make dramatic changes, which means the policy
of the Ma administration will remain unchanged, Lo said.</P>

      <P>The government will offer 4,000 affordable housing units for sale near the
projected Linkuo station of the Taipei Mass Rapid Transit system in 2013, with
low income families who do not already own property given purchasing preference,
a Ministry of the Interior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shih-wen,  director of the ministry's Construction and Planning Agency, said
the government will use approximately 226 hectares of reserved land and farmland
around the projected MRT station to build the housing, with each unit price kept
as low as NT$150,000 per ping (3.3 square meters).</P>
      <P>While housing prices in Taipei City and some locations in Taipei County have
been skyrocketing over the past few years, a survey report released  by the
Research,  Development  and Evaluation Commission under the Cabinet last
December indicated that high housing prices in the city topped the list of
public complaints.</P>
      <P>To help the payroll class live in their own apartments, the government therefore
decided to build affordable housing units with traffic convenience. The 4,000
units at Linkuo are expected to be completed in 2013, when an extension of the
MRT system to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is completed.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the travel time from Linkuo to the MRT's Taipei Main Station
stop will be around 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>He said more affordable housing units are planned along the line and added that
the government is also planning to build public housing units on the outskirts
of Tamsui township in Taipei County when a light rail system is built to serve
the area.</P>

      <P>The debt crisis in Europe is an aftershock of the global financial crisis and it
will be only a small problem, a local expert said Thursday, urging the public
not to panic.</P>
      <P>"It is impossible not to have aftershocks after the world has experienced such a
huge financial crisis, " Chu Yun-peng, a professor of economics at National
Central University, said at a seminar organized by the Taiwan Competitiveness
Forum.</P>
      <P>"However, these aftershocks often are smaller, " the former minister without
portfolio went on.</P>
      <P>He also said that great attention is being paid to the debt crisis affecting
Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, which will help prevent the problem from
developing into a bigger one, as governments are already taking measures.</P>
      <P>Bert Lim, president of the World Economics Society, predicted at the seminar
that the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar will decrease, as many
countries are selling the European currency from their foreign reserves.</P>
      <P>"A falling euro will make the greenback a strong currency again, " he noted.</P>
      <P>Lim added that international oil and raw material prices will also go up as the
U.S. dollar goes down but he also warned that the government should pay close
attention to the impact of a rising U.S. dollar on Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-fu,  an economics  professor  at National Taiwan University, said
decreasing tax revenues and an increasing financial deficit have taken Taiwan's
debt-to-GDP ratio to nearly 40 percent.</P>
      <P>He warned that Taiwan's debt rating might be downgraded as a result.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lo Shu-lei expressed similar concerns over
Taiwan's debt and urged the government to reconsider whether it is right to
expand public expenditure and cut taxes.</P>
      <P>Nieh Chien-Chung, a professor at Tamkang University's Banking and Finance
Department, pointed out that Greece has had a debt problem for a long time and
said the problem will not grow into another global crisis.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International

      <P>Late last year, the CPA demanded that the city government, which is in charge of
the project, report back within three months on whether it will continue
collaborating with the previous winning bidder to carry out the build-operate-
transfer (BOT) project. The deadline will expire in late February.</P>
      <P>The construction license for the project was revoked in 2005 after then-Vice
Minister of the Interior Yen Wan-ching and Cai Bai-lu, then-director of
Yangmingshan National Park, were charged with taking kickbacks from a developer
who sought to get a construction license for the project.</P>
      <P>Yen was sentenced to 15 years in prison after being found guilty on corruption
charges in four separate cases,  including his acceptance of bribes from the
developer.</P>
      <P>Cai was sentenced to two years and six months for his involvement in the bribery
scandal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$50 billion to be invested to ensure stable water supply</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a draft statute Thursday on dredging at three major
reservoirs in southern Taiwan in order to stabilize the water supply in the
region.</P>
      <P>According to the draft statute, the government will spend up to NT$50 billion
dredging the Tsengwen, Nanhua and Wushantou reservoirs in Chiayi and Tainan
counties,  one of Taiwan's  agricultural strongholds, over the next six years to
ensure a stable water supply in the area.</P>
      <P>Of the amount, NT$18 billion will come from a special budget to revitalize  the
domestic  economy  and  expand  infrastructure construction, while the remainder
will be financed by central government agencies and special national development
funds, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said at a weekly Cabinet
meeting during which the draft statute was passed.</P>
      <P>The three reservoirs are major sources of water for household, irrigation  and
industrial  use in southern  Taiwan.  Due to environmental degradation and
inadequate conservation efforts, the three reservoirs have become swamped with
silt, which has limited their storage capacities and has led to water shortages
in the region.</P>
      <P>After listening to Shih's report, Premier Wu Den-yih said ensuring a stable
water supply in the south is a government priority.</P>
      <P>As ecological conservation in the catchment areas and reservoir management are
crucial to the functioning of reservoirs, Wu said, the relevant city and county
governments should step up monitoring and cracking down on illegal logging,
farming and construction in the catchment areas to prevent mudslides in upstream
catchment areas.</P>
      <P>According to the special statute, no new access roads can be created in the
three reservoirs' catchment areas and construction of sand dams must meet the
provisions set forth in the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law.</P>
      <P>The new project will also include the improvement of existing access roads in
the regions, but the roads will not be allowed to expand.</P>
      <P>"The whole project will be finished in six years," Shih said at a news
conference after the Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>The statute will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for screening and
approval.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese deep-sea fishing vessel and all its crew were released Thursday
after the boat's owner paid a ransom to Somali pirates, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton longliner Win Far 161, with a crew of 30, was hijacked by Somali
pirates near an island in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean April 6 last year,
a MOFA official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since the incident, the MOFA used every means over the past 10 months to seek
assistance from various international organizations in an effort to rescue the
vessel and crew, the official added.</P>
      <P>After receiving information that the ship was to be released, the MOFA also
helped the owner to contact international maritime and anti-piracy organizations
to ask them to provide humanitarian aid and protection for the ship and its crew
upon the release, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Through their efforts, the crewmen were provided with food, water and fuel and
were given health checks and other support, the official said.</P>
      <P>The government also expressed gratitude for the help provided by the
international organizations.</P>
      <P>The rescue efforts were made even more difficult because of the Somalian interim
provisional government's inability to rule the country and because of the
withdrawal of U.S., British and U.N. bases and other international organizations
from the country due to the political unrest there, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The MOFA warned that Taiwanese fishing vessels should steer clear of waters near
East Africa to avoid the many Somali pirates who operate there with near-
impunity.</P>
      <P>Those that insist on sailing in the area should be registered with the European
Maritime Safety Agency through its Web site: www.mschoa.com. The agency is
responsible for improving maritime safety by providing technical assistance, it
said.</P>

      <P>Former Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey was impeached
Thursday by the Control Yuan for improperly using a government reserve fund to
finance a publicity drive for a referendum bill launched by the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Taiwan's bid for membership in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The referendum, which was initiated in 2007 by the then-ruling DPP to ask voters
whether Taiwan should join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan," was
vetoed March 22, 2008.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the country's top watchdog agency, approved by a 10-2 vote the
motion submitted by yuan members Ma Hsiu-ju and Ma Yi-kung to impeach Hsieh</P>
      <P>Ma Hsiu-ju said Hsieh twice transferred from the Cabinet's reserve fund a total
of NT$45 million to finance a publicity campaign to urge the public to support
the referendum bill.</P>
      <P>During the investigation process, Hsieh agreed that government funds should not
be used in support of any drive launched by a political party, according to Ma
Hsiu-ju.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added, almost all the amount of money was spent before the March
22 voting day, without considering the fact the U.N. General Assembly session
opened in September -- a clear indication that Hsieh simply used the publicity
campaign to boost the DPP's bill rather than to actually promote Taiwan's U.N.
membership.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan also censured the Executive Yuan, the GIO, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Sports Affairs Council in
collaborating with Hsieh in using the funds.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Control Yuan's decision was "unacceptable" but that he would not
decide how to respond until after he had read the official impeachment letter.</P>

      <P>Officials from Canadian transport manufacturer Bombardier wrapped up a two-day
visit to Taiwan Thursday in which they gave demonstrations aimed at promoting
the company's lower-emission and fuel-efficient airliners.</P>
      <P>Bombardier Aerospace arranged two demonstration flights of its Q400 NextGen
turboprop airliner at Taipei's Songshan Airport for representatives from almost
all Taiwan's air carriers, many of which expressed  interest,  said Kelvin
Hung,  a representative  of Bombardier's commercial agent in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The  demo  tour  received  positive  responses  from  the representatives  but
they will conduct  reviews  before making decisions," Hung said.</P>
      <P>The visit to Taiwan, part of an Asia-Pacific tour, presented an opportunity to
showcase one of the world's most technologically advanced turboprops optimized
for the short-haul regional market, said Trung Ngo, the company's Asia Pacific
vice president of sales.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese carriers are looking to replace older airliners in their fleets and,
after the Taiwan High Speed Rail began operating in 2007, have changed their
operating strategies to focus on flights serving outlying islands such as
Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu instead of other domestic flights, Hung said.</P>
      <P>They are expected to use their jet planes for direct flights between Taiwan and
China and to use turboprop airliners with a capacity of between 56 and 80
passengers for flights to the outlying islands, he added.</P>
      <P>The planes could also be used for the "mini three links" that allow for limited
postal, transport, and trade links between China's Fujian Province cities of
Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou, and Taiwan's islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: The emergence of `Hu Su phenomenon'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/12/10  10:45:57
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and former Premier Su Tseng-chang -- two politicians
known for their baldness -- have recently become the most sought-after men
within the blue and green camps, respectively. While all five special
municipalities that are set to hold mayoral elections this year want Hu to run
in their regions, Su is in a dilemma of whether to run in the special
municipality elections or skip the elections and concentrate on the 2012
presidency.</P>
      <P>This phenomenon can be linked to President Ma Ying-jeou. Had Ma's approval
rating not fallen to such low levels, Hu would not have had such a sudden
emergence. Had Ma's governance ability not been called into question, Su would
not have had the idea of running straight for the 2012 presidency.</P>
      <P>Hu, Su and Ma have one thing in common. Throughout their political careers,
their integrity has never been doubted. However, Hu and Su differ from Ma in
that, unlike the president, they are both very good at communicating.</P>
      <P>Su is one of the few green camp leaders who does not speak in radical political
language, while Hu has been recognized as a skilled communicator since he was
first appointed to head the Government Information Office in 1991. None of his
successors have been able to surpass him in this regard.</P>
      <P>Up until now, Ma probably still has not figured out why Hu and Su are considered
good communicators. Communication does not mean playing hypocrisy but putting
oneself in other people's shoes.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is desperate to boost his plummeting popularity, should take the "Hu Su
phenomenon" seriously. Whether Ma will face the pair as his rivals or learn from
their strong points humbly is key to whether he can stop the downswing of his
reputation. (Feb. 12, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>College students empower tiny village</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/12/10  11:42:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of a small village in Houbi urban township in southern Taiwan's
Tainan County, with the help of students from the Tainan National University of
The Arts, have succeeded in transforming their community into one that combines
traditional lifestyle and art.</P>
      <P>Tugou is one of 21 villages in Houbi. Although its size accounts for 10 percent
of the township, the village has only 460 households and 1,700 people.</P>
      <P>Nearly all of the village's land is given over to farming and the residents,
mainly farmers, are conservative and live life at a slow pace. Like most of the
farming villages in Taiwan, it suffers from a drain of youth who move away for
school or work, leaving only the old folks at home.</P>
      <P>However, the situation changed in 2000 when Chang Chia-hui was elected village
chief and began trying to improve the lives of the people by improving the
environment.</P>
      <P>He formed a community empowerment society with some of the more active villagers
in Tugou, trying to grace the village by planting flowers and refurbishing
unused land into a public square where the villagers can sit and chat while
their grandchildren play.</P>
      <P>"The people will support community empowerment once they begin to enjoy the
benefits of it," he said.</P>
      <P>Community empowerment is about people and government working together to bring
about improvements. It allows more people the chance to influence decisions
about their communities and take responsibility for tackling local problems,
rather than expecting others to do it for them.</P>
      <P>The idea is that government cannot solve everything by itself and nor can the
community, so it's better for them work together.</P>
      <P>Chang's efforts came to the attention of Tseng Shu-Cheng, a professor at the
Tainan National University of the Arts (TNNUA), who used to serve as deputy
magistrate of Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Tseng believed that his students at the university's Graduate Institute of
Architecture could help the villagers and told them they could learn by applying
the expertise they study in classroom to Tugou and writing theses on their
experiences.</P>
      <P>Shortly after that, the first group of students moved into Tugou.</P>
      <P>"This is more than just study or homework. In order to find plans most suited to
the needs of the villagers, you have to be a part of them and to think like
them," Tseng cautioned the students.</P>
      <P>The first project worked out by the students in their 20s and the local
residents, many in their 80s, was converting a disused pig pen owned by Chang
Chia-hui into a public living room decorated with graceful artworks that would
impress even big city-dwellers.</P>
      <P>The second project drawn up together by the students and local people involved
the renovation of a public space in an even smaller settlement with only 29
households called Chuzichiao.</P>
      <P>The students asked painter Yin Chia-hui to paint the outer walls of the houses
and sculptor Ho Chia-fu to carve stone snails for the space to symbolize peace.</P>
      <P>Bao A-mo, an old lady living in the settlement, said that after the renovation,
the square has attracted local people to gather there to chew the fat.</P>
      <P>"It is a more pleasant place now, and has strengthened the association between
neighbors," she said.</P>
      <P>The students  who live in the settlement  have also been assimilated and have
become residents themselves.</P>
      <P>"The local people are upfront with their feeling. If they don't like my ideas
they will reject them outright, " said Yang Han-ya, one of the students.</P>
      <P>"I got so frustrated that I often burst into tears in discussions at the
beginning. I couldn't understand why they insisted on their own feelings and
didn't trust my expertise."</P>
      <P>However, after living among them for more than a year, Yang now counts herself
as one of the villagers. Local residents yell greetings at her when she rides
her scooter through Chuzichiao and stop her for a chat when she walks around
Tugou.</P>
      <P>Lu Yao-chung was one of the first group of students to move into Tugou. He
graduated from the Graduate Institute of Architecture after living there for two
years, only to return to the village to open his own design firm after finishing
his military service.</P>
      <P>He was glad to see the program had entered its sixth year, carried on by a sixth
group of students.</P>
      <P>Lu said Tugou is a beautiful place that inspires him to turn out work that is
different from that of his competitors.</P>
      <P>"Of course, the cheap cost of opening a firm here is another reason why I chose
here over a big city to set up my studio, " he added.</P>
      <P>Lu is not alone. Ho Chia-fu, the sculptor who produced many of the works for
Tugou, has built a studio there, based on the design of the students, and has
become the 30th household in Chuzichiao.</P>
      <P>"Before, when asked `where do you live, ' local people used to reply with `near
the city of Hsinyin,' or `alongside Baihe township,' because few outsiders would
know where Tugou is, but now they simply say `Tugou,'" Chang said with pride.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day -- Security aide's resignation sparks speculation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a surprise move, National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi announced
Thursday that he will resign from his post after just 20 months and 20 days in
office.</P>
      <P>His unexpected resignation ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday immediately
sparked speculation about a possible follow-up personnel reshuffle in the
President Ma Ying-jeou administration.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi told a news conference shortly after
Su's announcement that Ma has reluctantly accepted Su's resignation and will
appoint Hu Wei-jen, a career diplomat with 35 years of diplomatic and
intelligence experience, as his new top national security adviser.</P>
      <P>The transfer of office will take place Feb. 23, Wang added.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the event: United Daily
News:</P>
      <P>National Security Council Secretary-General Su Chi, who has recently faced harsh
criticism over his inept handling of the U.S. beef import controversy, bowed out
Thursday, citing family and health reasons.</P>
      <P>At a hastily called press conference, Su, who President Ma lauded as having
helped bolster relations with the United States, China and Japan over the past
20 months since he took office, said that a new era has dawned across the Taiwan
Strait, as the two sides have increasingly reciprocated economically while a
political win-win situation is taking shape.</P>
      <P>Ma's "modus vivendi" diplomatic tactic has also worked to win the greatest
possible dignity and international maneuvering space Taiwan has ever had, he
said.</P>
      <P>"I believe my mission has been completed," Su said.</P>
      <P>Hu Wei-jen, Taiwan's former representative to Singapore and to Germany, will
pick up where Su left off in terms of national security policy immediately after
the Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Su's wife Grace Chen, formerly a local TV anchorwoman and later a health food
guru, welcomed the top national security aide's resignation.</P>
      <P>Noting that Su has "not taken a single day off" since he joined Ma's campaign
team as a former Kuomintang legislator, Chen said that "now he can relax."</P>
      <P>Chen rebutted allegations that Su might return to the Ma administration soon
after the U.S. beef and arms sales controversy calms down, saying that "Su is a
determined man who does not waver easily."</P>
      <P>Chen, known for having cured Su's liver cancer with organic drinks she
developed, said her husband had shown apparent fatigue when he last time
accompanied Ma on a trip to the U.S. and Central America in January.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) criticized Su for having
wasted too much time before stepping down.</P>
      <P>Su should have resigned earlier, given his ineptitude in handling the U.S. beef
import controversy and other crucial issues, the DPP blasted.</P>
      <P>The DPP also questioned  the political integrity  of Su's successor, as Hu "had
publicly criticized his own government" when he served as Taiwan's envoy to
Singapore during the Chen Shui-bian era.</P>
      <P>Hu is a seasoned veteran on foreign affairs and national security matters. His
father Hu Tsung-nan was a high-ranking general and a close confidant of
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the Kuomintang (KMT) government during World
War II and the Chinese civil war in the 1950s.</P>
      <P>Hu has a long political pedigree and he is a "politically correct" choice for

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lighting-up ceremony for the first lantern fair co-sponsored by the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait was held in Nanjing, China Thursday, attended by both
Taiwanese and Chinese officials.</P>
      <P>The Qinhuai Lantern Fair is an annual celebration of the Lantern Festival in the
Nanjing area, but this year marks the first time Taiwan has taken part in the
event amid improved cross-strait relations and growing engagement.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chen Wei-jen, Taiwan's vice minister of transportation
and communications, said he is very pleased to see increased cross-strait
exchanges in various fields, including the Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>He congratulated Nanjing City on its successful bid to host the second Summer
Youth Olympic Games in 2014 and expressed gratitude for a promise by Jiangsu
Province to allow up to 100,000 tourists from the region to visit Taiwan this
year.</P>
      <P>Liang Baohua, the top Jiangsu Province official, who attended in his capacity as
secretary of the Communist Party of China's Jiangsu chapter, and Nanjing Mayor
Ji Jianyeh, as well as Janice Lai, director-general of Taiwan's Tourism Bureau,
also spoke at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Ji said the Nanjing city government will send specially designed lanterns to be
displayed in the 2010 Taiwan Lantern Festival to be held in Chiayi City in
southern Taiwan Feb. 28-March 7.</P>
      <P>The lighting-up ceremony took place along the banks of the Qinhuai River in
light snow. Huge dragon-shaped lanterns prepared by the Jiangsu provincial
government and a pair of phoenix-style lanterns presented by Taiwan's Grand
Hotel were installed on the two sides of the river to symbolize good fortune and
good luck in the new year.</P>
      <P>When Liang pushed the button to light up the dragon lantern, dazzling fireworks
exploded like a waterfall drifting down from the lantern, drawing exclamations
and applause from the spectators.</P>
      <P>In addition to fireworks, the ceremony also featured music and dance
presentations, with many Taiwanese folk and pop songs performed by singers
dressed in Taiwanese indigenous outfits.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As local people are ushering in the Chinese New Year, President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration gave them a red envelope by announcing an easing of restrictions
on flat-panel display makers' investments in China.</P>
      <P>According to the new regulations, the makers may invest in plants in China to
produce panels of sixth generation and below, while producing panels beyond
sixth generation will remain subject to certain restrictions.</P>
      <P>Although the sixth generation panels are not the most advanced products, its
plants employ the biggest workforce in this field, and the easing of the
restrictions will encourage them to leave for China just as the country's
personal computer makers did several years ago.</P>
      <P>As for wafer foundries, the restrictions on their relocation to China remain,
but they have been allowed to invest in or take over Chinese foundries through
mergers.</P>
      <P>Anyway, it is all bad news for local laborers, who should brace themselves for
the results of the decision.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that his administration will address the general public's grief as
its own grief, but what he has done is to pour gasoline on the fire and make the
grief even more bitter.</P>
      <P>Under Ma's "excellent leadership" in the last one year, Taiwan's industries have
moved rapidly outward, and the unemployment rate has hit a high of 6 percent,
while the average income of local households has declined to the level of 13
years ago.</P>
      <P>As if this were not bad enough, Ma's negotiation of a trade pact with China will
eventually open the island to Chinese agricultural produce and laborers, to the
cost of local farmers and workers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic development is the result of the efforts of the local people
over the last several decades, but Ma is letting it go down the drain by doing
nothing to help small- and medium-sized enterprises while encouraging the giant
ones to relocate to China.</P>
      <P>Now the question facing the people is not a political one but an economic one:
Whether they can keep their jobs or not. All of those who do not want to see
their offspring working as laborers for the Chinese should rise up and punish Ma
with action. (Feb. 12, 2010)</P>

02/12/10  12:39:08
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Secretary-General Su Chi resigned Thursday for what he claimed were health
reasons. However, due to the sensitivity of the position, it is difficult not to
speculate about the political reasons behind his decision.</P>
      <P>During Su's term as a legislator, what impressed the public the most was his
obstinate obstruction of plans by the administration of former President Chen
Shui-bian to purchase weapons from the United States.</P>
      <P>Under the leadership of President Ma Ying-jeou, the tough Su made himself the
most domineering NSC secretary-general since Taiwan's democratization. This led
to conflicts with some related agencies, especially the Ministry of National
Defense. His opposition to arms procurement also made him very unpopular among
the military top brass.</P>
      <P>Ma's and Su's negligence of Taiwan's relations with the United States has
resulted in Taiwan's leaning toward China.</P>
      <P>China has thus taken advantage of the chance to spend big money buying the
support of the U.S. Congress, think tanks and scholars. As a consequence, an
increasingly larger number of articles published in important periodicals are
advocating that the United States should not clash with China for the sake of
Taiwan, and some have even proposed abolishing or amending the Taiwan Relations
Act.</P>
      <P>This trend is endangering Taiwan's security. Should the NSC secretary-general
not be held responsible? Should the president not be held responsible?</P>
      <P>We hope the government will pay attention to U.S. relations and strengthen its
diplomacy with Washington. Only if we attach ourselves closely to the United
States will we be able to engage peacefully with China on a secure basis. (Feb.

      <P>All 30 crew members of a Taiwanese deep-sea fishing vessel are safe and on their
way back to Taiwan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reiterated Friday,
rebutting media reports that three of its crew had died.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton longliner Win Far 161 and its crew of 30 were released the previous
day by Somali pirates who hijacked the vessel near an island in the Seychelles
in the Indian Ocean April 6, 2009 and held them for 10 months.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's most recent contact with the boat's owner, the crew
of 30, including 17 Filipinos, six Indonesians, five Chinese and two Taiwanese,
are safe, a MOFA official said, adding that military vessels in adjacent waters
will escort the boat and its crew, as well as provide food, water and health
services during its return voyage to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Reports of the death of two Indonesians and a Chinese are false and groundless,
" the official said.</P>
      <P>The official also rebutted reports that the hostages' respective authorities did
not provide any assistance in attempts to facilitate humanitarian relief, saying
that the rescue was a coordinated international effort that involved many
international organizations.</P>
      <P>The MOFA helped the owner to contact various international maritime and anti-
piracy organizations to seek humanitarian aid and protection for the ship and
its crew upon release, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The ministry had also been in contact with United Kingdom's Maritime Trade
Operations, the office of the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet in Bahrain, the United
Nations' International Maritime Organization, as well as government agencies in
Somalia and the Seychelles for assistance over the past 10 months, the official
went on.</P>
      <P>The rescue efforts were fraught with difficulty because of the Somalian interim
provisional government's inability to rule the country and because of the
withdrawal of U.S., British and U.N. bases and other international organizations
from the country due to the political unrest there, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>According to the maritime watchdog Ecoterra International, the Win Far 161 had
been poaching in Somali waters when it was hijacked in the longest-running case
of Somali piracy.</P>

      <P>Two government spokesmen declined to comment Friday on media speculation that
the Cabinet will undergo a minor reshuffle after the Feb. 13-21 Lunar New Year
holiday.</P>
      <P>The rumors about government  personnel changes arose after National Security
Council (NSC) Secretary-General Su Chi unexpectedly announced his resignation a
day earlier.</P>
      <P>In a pre-emptive action to stem speculation and ensure that there would be no
break in NSC operations, President Ma Ying-jeou had already named Hu Wei-jen, a
career diplomat with 35 years of diplomatic and intelligence experience, to
succeed Su as his top national security adviser. The transfer of office is
scheduled for Feb. 23.</P>
      <P>However, the speculation now focuses on a possible Cabinet reshuffle in the wake

Yuan spokesmen.</P>
      <P>According to a China Times report, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi

      <P>Responding to press inquiries Friday while accompanying Ma on a shopping trip

      <P>"For me, the most important thing is to fulfill my present mission to the best

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has offered a defense in person of his proposal to strike
an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, but he is not so
naive as to think his briefing will dispel all the questions surrounding the
deal.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, his briefing has raised more questions about the pact and has
betrayed the government's bungled efforts to tout it.</P>
      <P>Ma summarized his proposal by saying that it was aimed at helping Taiwanese to
do business and enhancing the country's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>During his briefing, Ma showed his confidence in the proposal and his eagerness
to get his message across, but the answers to the questions are no less vague
after his briefing.</P>
      <P>The first question is that the president said there is no timetable for the
pact, which is contrary to repeated announcements by the Mainland Affairs
Council, the Executive Yuan and even Ma's close aides that the deal is expected
to be clinched in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Is Ma putting the brakes on its progress, or is there something else? Taiwan's
top negotiator with China, Chiang Pin-kung, has hinted that negotiations with
China have passed through the easy part and are moving into a phase bristling
with difficulties.</P>
      <P>If these are indications that the conclusion of the pact is to be delayed
because of difficulties, then the next question is: What are these difficulties?
and how is Ma's administration going to deal with them?</P>
      <P>The  administration  perhaps  would  rather  not air these difficulties to avoid
complicating the issues, but that would confirm critics' claims that the talks
are back room politics and lack transparency.</P>
      <P>A survey carried out by the Common Wealth monthly found that half of the CEOs of
the country's top 1,000 companies are concerned about the government's ability
to defend Taiwan's core interests, although 90 percent of them support the ECFA
negotiations.</P>
      <P>The third and the last question concerns the Ma administration's failure to
specify the content of the proposed agreement. This is probably because of the
government's uncertainty about the results of the talks and its reluctance to
reveal its bottom line in the talks.</P>
      <P>All these questions show that the government has underestimated the general
public's ability to debate the issue sensitively from the beginning and that it
has been trying to convince them with simplistic, brief and vague answers that
only further stoke the people's anxiety.</P>
      <P>Ma should come down from his cloud and get down to earth in his efforts to
defend ECFA. (Feb. 12, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed industrial innovation statute, which has been listed by the Cabinet
as a priority bill for the next legislative session, is aimed at encouraging
industry to "innovate." However, the measures adopted by the government to
achieve the purpose are totally lacking in "creativity."</P>
      <P>The bill is intended to continue some of the tax breaks stipulated in the
Statute for Upgrading Industries that were repealed at the end of 2009. The
controversy surrounding the new bill lies mainly in Article 30, which offers a
preferential 15 percent corporate income tax rate to multinational companies
with their headquarters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This controversy would not have existed had the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou allowed all tax breaks to come to a complete stop. Had the
administration opted to break the myth of tax breaks that has prevailed in the
country for 50 years and rebuild a fair tax environment of "low tax rates, broad
tax base, " it would have written a new chapter in the country's tax history.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the administration, having failed to adapt to circumstances,
is sticking to the rigid canon of turning Ma's "campaign promises" into
"policies."  A great opportunity  for innovative reforms has been missed as a
result.</P>
      <P>We can now only urge the administration to remove Article 30 of the industrial
innovation bill. (Feb. 12, 2010)</P>

      <P>With the prices of some commodities rising ahead of the Chinese New Year
holiday, the Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission said Friday that it will
monitor the situation to prevent price gouging.</P>
      <P>The prices of some commodities are higher this year than last year amid a
recovering economy, and the FTC said it has started to collect information on
vendors' cost of goods or import declarations to determine if the higher prices
can be justified or if they are being manipulated.</P>
      <P>FTC Vice Chairwoman Shih Hui-fen said that according to the commission's initial
investigation, the price hikes of dried foods are mostly due to an imbalance in
supply and demand and climate change in areas where the foods were grown or
produced.</P>
      <P>Shih vowed, however, to continue the commission's investigation into pricing
issues.</P>
      <P>Shops found manipulating prices in the run-up to the Chinese New Year could be
fined up to NT$25 million (US$781,000), the FTC warned.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the commission said that there are currently plentiful supplies of
agricultural, livestock, and fishery products, as most product marketing

      <P>Taiwan implemented a series of measures in the 1950s and 1960s to boost the
development of labor intensive industries and exports, which led to average
annual growth of 24 percent in exports, 16 percent in domestic investment, and
7.5 percent in manufacturing jobs between 1961 and 1972.</P>
      <P>However, the consumer price index rose by only 3.3 percent annually during that
period of time, similar to the 3 percent of the developed countries.</P>
      <P>The secret to maintaining stable commodity prices amid rising wages was
enhancing labor productivity, which increased by 10 percent during the period,
enough to offset rising wages and even drive down labor costs per unit of
production by 2 percent.</P>
      <P>China is now facing the same situation Taiwan experienced between 1960 and 1970,
and the Beijing authorities should send some people here to learn the lessons of
Taiwan's success. (Feb. 12, 2010)</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih confirmed Friday that Government Information Office (GIO)
Minister Su Jun-pin will soon quit to take up a position in the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>"Although I am not happy to see him leave the Cabinet, it is a done deal, " Wu
said while reviewing operations at Songshan Airport ahead of the Feb. 13-21
Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Su will step down from his current GIO post to serve
as the KMT's new spokesman.</P>
      <P>Wu did not mention Su's future role within the party, saying only that he was
searching for Su's replacement.</P>
      <P>"Su's successor will be determined after the Lunar New Year holiday, " Wu said,

job that includes serving as the party's spokesman.</P>
      <P>Lee,  a  journalist-turned-politician,  will  move  to  the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), King said, because he is familiar with cross-
Taiwan Strait affairs as he has covered many major  cross-strait  high-level
meetings  and legislative deliberation of related statutes. King further said
the handover ceremony will take place Feb. 24.</P>
      <P>The confirmation of GIO and KMT personnel changes came a day after National
Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General Su Chi unexpectedly announced his

      <P>In an effort to prevent speculation and ensure that there would be no break in

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Dongguan-based school has become a highly popular educational oasis for
children of Taiwanese businessmen working in China's Pearl River Delta by
following Taiwan's academic and teaching norms.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Businessmen's Dongguan School (TBDS) , currently the largest school
in China established for children of Taiwanese expats there, provides a welcome
alternative to international schools or local Chinese schools that the children
would otherwise have to attend.</P>
      <P>In implementing Taiwan's academic curricula for students aged between 3-18, it
has carved out a real niche and even surpassed services offered by some schools
in Taiwan, boasts the school's principal Wen Ming-cheng.</P>
      <P>"The school has done more for the children  of Taiwanese businessmen than day
schools in Taiwan because TBDS is a boarding school," Wen said in an interview
with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, TBDS offers 34 classes per week for its elementary
students, 11 more than offered by regular elementary schools in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of the 34 classes, six are for English learning, two for computer training and
four for music and the arts, Wen added.</P>
      <P>The philosophy and academic norms in the Dongguan, Guangdong province school,
also clearly differ from those found in Chinese schools, Wen observed.</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese schools generally steer clear of politics, Chinese schools are
operated "under the guidance of the Communist Party of China."</P>
      <P>At the same time, Chinese teachers are disciplinarians and their students are
afraid to ask questions, while Taiwanese students are more independent, lively
and creative and are better at absorbing knowledge, Wen observed.</P>
      <P>The Dongguan school, set up in September 2000 and was the first of three schools
for Taiwanese children in China, currently has some 1,700 students, nearly half
of the 3,500 children of Taiwanese businessmen working in the Pearl River Delta
area.</P>
      <P>In order to provide them with an at-home feeling, Wen said, the school divides
its more than 700 elementary students into 40 families, with the teachers as
"parents," the voluntary workers there as "uncles and aunts, " and the sixth
graders as "big brothers and sisters."</P>
      <P>Although the school costs more than 10,000 Chinese yuan for each student per
semester, 180 children who previously attended Chinese schools in Guangdong
transferred to TBDS in 2009, and 35 more will transfer there during the winter
break, Wen said, the latest indicator of how important it is to Taiwan's expat
community there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese researchers find enzyme structure of mint scent</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12. (CNA)
02/12/10  17:43:00
(By Fanny Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top research institute Academia Sinica said Friday that researchers
have detailed the structure of an enzyme involved in the production of the scent
given off by the mint plant, and added that the research was published in
American journal "The Plant Cell" in its Feb. 5 issue.</P>
      <P>In an effort to better understand the process by which the mint plant produces
scent, Academia Sinica Vice President Andrew H.J. Wang and his team from the
Institute of Biological Chemistry (IBC) used x-ray crystallography, as well as
biochemical and genetic studies, to solve the structure of an enzyme that
catalyzes the first critical step in the biosynthesis pathway of the mint scent
formation.</P>
      <P>The volatiles that evaporate from plants to produce scent are very important in
nature to attract pollinators and herbivorous predators and emit signals that
ward off pathogens. They are also of interest to humans as medicines; however,
very little is known about them.</P>
      <P>The group discovered that the enzyme is composed of two different proteins -- a
catalytic protein and a regulatory protein. Through protein-protein
interactions, the regulatory protein can remodel the active-site cavity of the
catalytic protein for synthesizing the precursor of menthol, which is released
from the plant as mint scent.</P>
      <P>The research was conducted and financed by Academia Sinica and the provision of
the protein crystallography synchrotron facility was supported by the National
Genomic Medicine Research Program, a project funded by the National Science
Council.</P>
      <P>The article, titled "Structure of a Heterotetrameric Geranyl Pyrophosphate
Synthase  from  Mint (Mentha  piperita)  Reveals Intersubunit Regulation" is

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese journalist said Friday that reporters should have put themselves in
the shoes of survivors of the devastating Haiti earthquake when covering rescue
and relief efforts there and better communicated the reality on the ground.</P>
      <P>"When rescue teams were about to conduct their mission, they were warned of
widespread rioting and were told they had to be careful, " said China Times
Group reporter Liu Ping when commenting on the difference between Haiti as it
was reported and the actual situation.</P>
      <P>"But other reporters and I figured out that if these teams encountered victims,
were the victims going to rob the teams of their shovels or life saving devices?
" he told a workshop organized by Taiwan's national Central News Agency (CNA)
and Awakening News Networks.</P>
      <P>"Everyone was trying to survive, because they were looking for food and water, "
the Washington-based correspondent said. "If there was more empathy in news
reporting, the perspective would be different."</P>
      <P>Liu also lashed out at peacekeeping troops in Haiti. He said the troops told
Taiwan's second rescue team not to go outside because it was not safe, but what
the reporter saw were people who were staring over airport walls at the relief
goods they hoped to receive as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Lin Shen-hsu, a CNA reporter who volunteered to cover the aftermath in Haiti,
said some media outlets distorted the truth by reporting that local people in
Haiti were too poor and were eating mud cakes as a result.</P>
      <P>"Reporters should have used common sense and figured out that these people could
have just eaten dirt instead of buying mud cakes, especially when they had no
money," he said.</P>
      <P>"After a looking into it, we realized that mud cakes were a kind of local
specialty that helps pregnant women get mineral nutrients, " the reporter
explained.</P>
      <P>Lin, who had never traveled abroad before visiting Haiti, said there were
widespread reports of serious disorder and robberies, but he did not feel that
the situation was that bad.</P>
      <P>"When supermarket buildings collapsed, a lot of food and goods were inside. Were
you going to wait until the food went rotten? " he said.</P>
      <P>Many people "robbed" the supermarkets because they had nothing to eat. "I don't
consider it a crime," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Huang Kwang-chun, CNA's former correspondent based in Panama who rushed to Haiti
after the disaster,  said that Haitians were particularly friendly toward people
from Taiwan as Taiwan has provided much aid to its diplomatic ally for years.</P>
      <P>He also observed that bridges and buildings in Haiti constructed by Taiwan's
Overseas Engineering and Construction Co. sustained no damage.</P>
      <P>"I believe that this has left a good impression on the people of Haiti," he said
at the workshop.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Absentee voting proposal still in the works</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposal to introduce absentee voting is still in the works, and no final
decision has been made, a senior Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>"The proposal is still in the works. It's not a done deal, " said MOI Vice
Minister Chien Tai-lang.</P>
      <P>"Absentee voting is designed to protect average citizens' voting rights. We will
extensively solicit opinions on the issue before implementing it, including
consulting with the opposition parties," he added.</P>
      <P>Chien was responding to a newspaper report claiming that the MOI has decided to
introduce absentee voting in the 2012 presidential election, which drew a strong
reaction from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>According to the United Daily News (UDN) report, the MOI called a cross-agency
meeting Thursday, during which a consensus was reached on the scope and form of
absentee voting to be introduced in the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Under the reported plan, Taiwanese businessmen in China and other emigrees would
be excluded from voting by mail.</P>
      <P>It was also decided that Taiwan's absentee voting system would be a "transfer
ballot" system, meaning eligible voters would be allowed to cast ballots in
constituencies in which they work rather than where their households are
registered, the UDN report said.</P>
      <P>It added that the MOI will send a draft statute on the system in June to the
Legislative Yuan for consideration and approval.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, the DPP called a news conference Friday to question
the propriety of introducing such a system at this moment.</P>
      <P>"At present, many people are out of work and badly need emergency relief, " said
DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang. "We see no urgency to introduce an absentee voting
system."</P>
      <P>The spokesman contended that if the MOI insists on steamrolling through a new
voting system before a social consensus is reached, local society could be
plagued by conflicts and mistrust.</P>
      <P>In light of Taiwan's political reality, Lin said, promoting absentee voting
would definitely ignite doubts and misgivings, particularly by allowing military
service members, policemen and prison inmates to vote outside constituencies
where their households are registered.</P>
      <P>Claiming that polling stations inside military barracks and prisons are in a
"closed" and "autocratic" environment, Lin said soldiers and prison inmates
would feel pressure and could not vote their consciences in such surroundings.</P>
      <P>"We hope the interior ministry will re-evaluate the feasibility of introducing a
transfer ballot system as it is planning," Lin said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yee said the MOI has never communicated with the
opposition party on the introduction of the so-called transfer ballot system.</P>
      <P>"Such a working style will hinder the development of a healthy inter-party
interaction, which might eventually lead to disaster, " Lee warned.</P>
      <P>Noting that candidates tend to be barred from campaigning in military barracks
and near police offices, Lee said ruling party candidates may gain unfair
advantages if polling stations are set up inside military barracks and police
bureaus.</P>
      <P>But KMT legislative whip Lin Hung-chih said such worries were not justified.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is already an open democratic society. The public sector can no longer
rig or manipulate any election. The DPP should have confidence in our democratic
system, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the KMT legislative caucus supported the MOI's plan to
introduce a well-devised transfer ballot system to protect the voting rights of
a large number of eligible voters who work or study outside the area where their
household is registered.</P>

      <P>The Hon Hai Group, the world's largest contract maker of electronics, will focus
on the domestic market after the Chinese New Year by launching several major
investment projects, the group's chairman Terry Gou said Friday.</P>
      <P>At a party hosted by the group for its employees ahead of the Chinese New Year,
Gou said that if the group could increase its 2009 turnover of NT$2.4 trillion
by 10 percent, it would represent a big gain.</P>
      <P>In the coming year, the group will shift its focus on exports to expanding the
local market, and it intends to recall senior Taiwanese executives stationed in
China back home to lead the next phase of high-tech development, Gou said.</P>
      <P>Their return, however, does not signal an intent to abandon the Chinese market,
Gou said, but will instead give the company's Chinese employees more development
opportunities.</P>
      <P>The Hon Hai chairman, who announced recently that he would continue to lead the
company for the next 10 years, described the coming decade as a crucial period
because the global industrial structure would change rapidly.</P>
      <P>He said he felt responsible to lead his colleagues in facing those challenges
and create a new era for the group.</P>
      <P>Comparing the 35-year-old group to a 35-year-old man who should be full of
vitality, vigor and drive, Gou said his priority over the next 10 years would be
to pass on his experience and cultivate people capable of taking over the
business group.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that Hon Hai will not be a family-run group and that his children
will not take over its operations. Any Hon Hai employee would have the chance to
take over the group, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as a coach, Gou said a good coach should be able to devise
good strategies and select good athletes.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that he could help the group in maintaining its status as
the world's largest contract electronics maker and opening a wider lead over its
rivals.</P>

      <P>Ching-He Huang, a vivacious Taiwan-born food entrepreneur in Britain, won high
acclaim Thursday when she spoke on her culinary art and gave a live
demonstration at an Asian food fair being held in London.</P>
      <P>The young self-taught cook was the first culinary guru to be invited to speak at
the Asian Food Festival organized by Asia House, a group aimed at promoting
business,  cultural and diplomatic interaction between Asia and Britain.</P>
      <P>Sumi Ghose, Asia House's director of public programs, told the Central News
Agency that Huang was the keynote speaker in the festival's first event mainly
because she has emerged as the leading spokeswoman in Britain for modern Chinese
cuisine.</P>
      <P>Ghose, himself a Chinese food aficionado, said Huang's popularity lies in her
ability to infuse new life and taste into Chinese dishes by extensively
exploring traditional Taiwanese and Chinese food ingredients and cooking them in
creative and tasteful styles.</P>
      <P>Ghose also said it was very meaningful to invite her to speak and prepare
Chinese dishes ahead of the new lunar year, which begins on Feb. 14.</P>
      <P>Huang said she was honored to be invited to give a demonstration in the Asian
Food Festival's first presentation program.</P>
      <P>Huang introduced the origin and history of Lunar New Year celebrations in
ancient China and Taiwan and also prepared two New Year's dishes -- deep-fried
glutinous rice cakes and salty rice dumpling soup.</P>
      <P>She told a packed house that the rice cake symbolizes good fortune and that the
salty rice dumpling represents the reuniting of families for the holiday.</P>
      <P>The pleasing aroma and flavors inspired curiosity and whet people's appetites,
compelling spectators to rush to get a taste of Huang's creations and ask about
her cooking secrets.</P>
      <P>Among  those  in attendance  was Chang Siao-yue,  Taiwan's representative to the
U.K., who said Huang enjoys high popularity in Britain through her cooking
programs on TV and cookbooks.</P>
      <P>"Through her introductions, many British citizens have become more interested in
Chinese cuisine. Huang is truly a Chinese food ambassador," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Accoding to the diplomat, Huang has stood out because of her ability to
articulate convincingly the complex methods of cooking Chinese dishes. "Her
explanations have helped enhance her fans' self-confidence in preparing tasty
Chinese dishes," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The 32-year-old Huang moved to South Africa along with her parents at the age of

    <HEADLINE>Absentee voting proposal still in the works</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
02/12/10  20:15:55

    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposal to introduce absentee voting is still in the works, and no final
decision has been made, a senior Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>"The proposal is still in the works. It's not a done deal, " said MOI Vice
Minister Chien Tai-lang.</P>
      <P>"Absentee voting is designed to protect average citizens' voting rights. We will
extensively solicit opinions on the issue before implementing it, including
consulting with the opposition parties," he added.</P>
      <P>Chien was responding to a newspaper report claiming that the MOI has decided to
introduce absentee voting in the 2012 presidential election, which drew a strong
reaction from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>According to the United Daily News (UDN) report, the MOI called a cross-agency
meeting Thursday, during which a consensus was reached on the scope and form of
absentee voting to be introduced in the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Under the reported plan, Taiwanese businessmen in China and other emigrees would
be excluded from voting by mail.</P>
      <P>It was also decided that Taiwan's absentee voting system would be a "transfer
ballot" system, meaning eligible voters would be allowed to cast ballots in
constituencies in which they work rather than where their households are
registered, the UDN report said.</P>
      <P>It added that the MOI will send a draft statute on the system in June to the
Legislative Yuan for consideration and approval.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, the DPP called a news conference Friday to question
the propriety of introducing such a system at this moment.</P>
      <P>"At present, many people are out of work and badly need emergency relief, " said
DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang. "We see no urgency to introduce an absentee voting
system."</P>
      <P>The spokesman contended that if the MOI insists on steamrolling through a new
voting system before a social consensus is reached, local society could be
plagued by conflicts and mistrust.</P>
      <P>In light of Taiwan's political reality, Lin said, promoting absentee voting
would definitely ignite doubts and misgivings, particularly by allowing military
service members, policemen and prison inmates to vote outside constituencies
where their households are registered.</P>
      <P>Claiming that polling stations inside military barracks and prisons are in a
"closed" and "autocratic" environment, Lin said soldiers and prison inmates
would feel pressure and could not vote their consciences in such surroundings.</P>
      <P>"We hope the interior ministry will re-evaluate the feasibility of introducing a
transfer ballot system as it is planning," Lin said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yee said the MOI has never communicated with the
opposition party on the introduction of the so-called transfer ballot system.</P>
      <P>"Such a working style will hinder the development of a healthy inter-party
interaction, which might eventually lead to disaster, " Lee warned.</P>
      <P>Noting that candidates tend to be barred from campaigning in military barracks
and near police offices, Lee said ruling party candidates may gain unfair
advantages if polling stations are set up inside military barracks and police
bureaus.</P>
      <P>But KMT legislative whip Lin Hung-chih said such worries were not justified.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is already an open democratic society. The public sector can no longer
rig or manipulate any election. The DPP should have confidence in our democratic
system, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the KMT legislative caucus supported the MOI's plan to
introduce a well-devised transfer ballot system to protect the voting rights of
a large number of eligible voters who work or study outside the area where their
household is registered.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hon Hai Group, the world's largest contract maker of electronics, will focus
on the domestic market after the Chinese New Year by launching several major
investment projects, the group's chairman Terry Gou said Friday.</P>
      <P>At a party hosted by the group for its employees ahead of the Chinese New Year,
Gou said that if the group could increase its 2009 turnover of NT$2.4 trillion
by 10 percent, it would represent a big gain.</P>
      <P>In the coming year, the group will shift its focus on exports to expanding the
local market, and it intends to recall senior Taiwanese executives stationed in
China back home to lead the next phase of high-tech development, Gou said.</P>
      <P>Their return, however, does not signal an intent to abandon the Chinese market,
Gou said, but will instead give the company's Chinese employees more development
opportunities.</P>
      <P>The Hon Hai chairman, who announced recently that he would continue to lead the
company for the next 10 years, described the coming decade as a crucial period
because the global industrial structure would change rapidly.</P>
      <P>He said he felt responsible to lead his colleagues in facing those challenges
and create a new era for the group.</P>
      <P>Comparing the 35-year-old group to a 35-year-old man who should be full of
vitality, vigor and drive, Gou said his priority over the next 10 years would be
to pass on his experience and cultivate people capable of taking over the
business group.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that Hon Hai will not be a family-run group and that his children
will not take over its operations. Any Hon Hai employee would have the chance to
take over the group, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as a coach, Gou said a good coach should be able to devise
good strategies and select good athletes.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that he could help the group in maintaining its status as
the world's largest contract electronics maker and opening a wider lead over its
rivals.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's nonprofit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) received 397
U.S. patents last year, the most of any research institute in the world,
according to an annual corporate ranking released by IFI Patent Intelligence.</P>
      <P>ITRI has received a steadily growing number of U.S. patents in recent years,
going from 229 in 2007 to 286 in 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ching-He Huang, a vivacious Taiwan-born food entrepreneur in Britain, won high
acclaim Thursday when she spoke on her culinary art and gave a live
demonstration at an Asian food fair being held in London.</P>
      <P>The young self-taught cook was the first culinary guru to be invited to speak at
the Asian Food Festival organized by Asia House, a group aimed at promoting
business,  cultural and diplomatic interaction between Asia and Britain.</P>
      <P>Sumi Ghose, Asia House's director of public programs, told the Central News
Agency that Huang was the keynote speaker in the festival's first event mainly
because she has emerged as the leading spokeswoman in Britain for modern Chinese
cuisine.</P>
      <P>Ghose, himself a Chinese food aficionado, said Huang's popularity lies in her
ability to infuse new life and taste into Chinese dishes by extensively
exploring traditional Taiwanese and Chinese food ingredients and cooking them in
creative and tasteful styles.</P>
      <P>Ghose also said it was very meaningful to invite her to speak and prepare
Chinese dishes ahead of the new lunar year, which begins on Feb. 14.</P>
      <P>Huang said she was honored to be invited to give a demonstration in the Asian
Food Festival's first presentation program.</P>
      <P>Huang introduced the origin and history of Lunar New Year celebrations in
ancient China and Taiwan and also prepared two New Year's dishes -- deep-fried
glutinous rice cakes and salty rice dumpling soup.</P>
      <P>She told a packed house that the rice cake symbolizes good fortune and that the
salty rice dumpling represents the reuniting of families for the holiday.</P>
      <P>The pleasing aroma and flavors inspired curiosity and whet people's appetites,
compelling spectators to rush to get a taste of Huang's creations and ask about
her cooking secrets.</P>
      <P>Among  those  in attendance  was Chang Siao-yue,  Taiwan's representative to the
U.K., who said Huang enjoys high popularity in Britain through her cooking
programs on TV and cookbooks.</P>
      <P>"Through her introductions, many British citizens have become more interested in
Chinese cuisine. Huang is truly a Chinese food ambassador," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Accoding to the diplomat, Huang has stood out because of her ability to
articulate convincingly the complex methods of cooking Chinese dishes. "Her
explanations have helped enhance her fans' self-confidence in preparing tasty
Chinese dishes," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The 32-year-old Huang moved to South Africa along with her parents at the age of
5 and relocated to London six years later.</P>
      <P>She opened  a food company  after graduating  from London University, selling
health drinks and adapted Chinese dishes that made inroads into upscale

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's percussion maestro has great ambitions for music scene</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/13/10  11:53:24
(enditem/cs)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As one of the most successful and internationally  famous musicians from Taiwan,
percussionist Ju Tzong-Ching hopes to take Taiwan's music scene to a whole new
level.</P>
      <P>As president of the Taipei National University of the Arts as well as the
founder of Ju Percussion Group, Ju has been synonymous with the development of
percussion in Taiwan for more than 20 years.</P>
      <P>He was the first Taiwanese musician to be honored with the lifetime award from
the Percussive Arts Society (PAS) , which is considered the highest honor in the
worldwide percussion community. The PAS is the largest percussion music
organization in the world.</P>
      <P>"I feel honored to receive this award, and will continue to promote percussion
across all age groups in Taiwan, hoping people will love it and play a role in
its development," said Ju.</P>
      <P>Percussion has not been a popular form of music in Taiwan, but it has come a
long way, according to Ju.</P>
      <P>"It has been a long road to promote percussion on the island since I return to
Taiwan, " Ju said. "It had been considered to be a career without a future, but
now, it is accepted and loved by the audience."</P>
      <P>Ju studied in Vienna under Walter Veigl and Richard Hochrainer. He received his
Diploma of Music Performer in Percussion from the Vienna Academy of Music in
Austria in 1982, the first musician from Taiwan to receive such a diploma.</P>
      <P>After returning to Taiwan, he started a percussion performance and education
career. During that period, he was not only teaching at school, but also setting
up theJu Percussion Groupin the year of 1986, the first percussion ensemble
established in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ju Group has staged over 2,000 performances in Europe, the U.S., Asia and
Australia.</P>
      <P>In the field of education, Ju's first innovation was to include percussion as a
required course in the music programs at some universities where it was
originally offered only as an elective course.</P>
      <P>From the campus scene to professional performances, Ju has promoted percussion
development here in order to show the world the quality of Taiwan percussion.</P>
      <P>One of the most famous achievements he promotes is the Taipei International
Percussion Convention(TIPC), which is held every three years.</P>
      <P>He said that next year's TIPC will be the seventh such convention to be held in
Taiwan; its preliminary concept is to bring new music from all over the world to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Next year's TIPC will feature a great deal of new percussion music, as well as
cross-boundary creativity which will capture the attention of audiences," he
mentioned.</P>
      <P>Through the event, he expects to bring many new music trends to Taiwan, which
will elevate the level here to keep pace with percussion development in the rest
of the world. He even has an ambitious idea to expand the event and hold it
annually.</P>
      <P>"If this turns out to be the case, the development of Taiwan percussion could
keep pace with the rest of the world, moreover, it could propel our music in the
percussion field ahead of the rest of the world," he said.</P>
      <P>He expects he can help expand percussion's influence in Taiwan and promote more
exchange with percussion musicians all over the world. By Sunnie Chen CNA staff

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Wishing for a prosperous Year of the Tiger</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/13/10  15:06:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Year of the Ox comes to an end, people here in Taiwan are sincerely wishing
their friends and family "a lucky and prosperous Year of the Tiger." What are
the changes that the Taiwanese people hope to see with the arrival of the Lunar
New Year?</P>
      <P>After a troubled and tumultuous Year of the Ox, the people are tired of
uncertainty and economic hardship. They would like an uneventful Year of the
Tiger with more employment opportunities and less societal injustice and
unfairness.</P>
      <P>After President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008, cross-straits relations
improved tremendously. Taiwan has already began to reap the "peace dividend".
Thanks to improved relations, Taiwan has been able to benefit from China's
economic stimulus measures during the global financial crisis. Orders from China
helped tide many Taiwanese businesses over during the worst of the slump.</P>
      <P>Now Taiwan and China are poised to sign the proposed Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA) . Signing the ECFA will be critical  to keeping
Taiwanese  businesses  competitive  in an increasingly globalized world. It's up
to the government to reach consensus with the public and ink the pact as quickly
as possible.</P>
      <P>The government should also do more about job creation. Taiwan's unemployment
rate hit a high of six percent at one point last year, with 600,000 people
jobless. It's not enough for the government to create temporary jobs and
subsidies. The real solution is boosting private sector investment, which has
plunged since 2008.</P>
      <P>Six promising new sectors such as bio tech, green energy and tourism  have been
selected  by the government  for intensive development and NT $200 billion has
been earmarked from the budget to support those emerging industries. However, we
have not seen any concrete initiatives from the relevant governmental
departments. The sooner those government subsidies can be allocated, the sooner
we can grow those new sectors and create real jobs.</P>
      <P>Lastly, the government also has to pay more attention to the "hidden worries" of
society. Although crime in Taiwan is not as high as it once was, cases such as
the audacious robbery that took place in the Taipei 101 building are troubling
signs. Other "hidden worries" includes what seems to be a real-estate bubble and
the increasingly wide gap between the rich and the poor. ( By Bear Lee)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>During a Chinese New Year party Friday for employees of the world's largest
contract chipmaker the Hon Hai Group, its chairman Terry Gou expressed his views
on the economic outlook for 2010.</P>
      <P>He said the ongoing economic recovery is like the first thawing of icy weather.
While the outlook is good for the first half of the year, it might still be "a
bit chilly, " he warned. Hard work and confidence would be required to overcome
these conditions, he added.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Gou said his group, which posted revenue of NT$2.4 trillion in 2009 despite the
global financial storm, will continue to aim for the challenging revenue growth
target of 30 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>With the group's revenue in January having reached its target and the prospects
in March, April and May looking good, chances are high that it will reach its
goal for 2010, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Gou, the greatest concern in the first half of 2010 could be labor
shortage. To cope with that situation, Hon Hai will set up some unmanned
factories in Taiwan this year, he said. (Feb. 13, 2010)</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Gou also commented on the controversial draft law on industrial innovation,
which would offer a preferential 15 percent corporate income tax rate to
multinational companies headquartered in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He expressed strong displeasure at lawmakers' plan to exclude Taiwanese
businesses from the preferential treatment and threatened to move Hon Hai's
headquarters out of Taiwan if the exclusive clause is passed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Gou mentioned a letter he received from Central Bank of the Republic
of China Governor Perng Fai-nan, in which Perng urged him to continue to
contribute to Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Asked about the matter, Perng said he had also written to other business owners
besides Gou, mainly to encourage them to create more jobs so as to give greater
momentum to the economic recovery. (Feb. 13, 2010)</P>

      <P>A proposed tax break for businesses setting up headquarters in Taiwan "will be
fair," promised Premier Wu Den-yih Saturday. The controversial draft industrial
innovation bill has been drawing complaints from a number of quarters, including
from local tycoon Terry Guo.</P>
      <P>The bill offers a 15 percent reduction in the corporate income tax for the
world's top 500 companies if they set up headquarters in Taiwan. However, there
has been controversy over whether or not the four Taiwanese companies in the top
500 list should be excluded from the tax incentive.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai group Chairman Terry Guo has threatened to move the company's
headquarters out of Taiwan if the bill passes and his company does not benefit.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu told reporters that Guo should not be worried, and that if the
government decides to give tax breaks to businesses for setting up headquarters
in Taiwan, "the rewards will be fairly allocated."</P>
      <P>Wu added that all businesses, large or small, will be rewarded for being

      <P>Supporters of Taiwanese star pitcher Wang Chien-ming got some good news earlier
when the Washington Nationals reportedly decided to recruit Wang. The Washington
Nationals has the poorest record among all Major League Baseball (MLB) teams in
the United States, and Wang is coming off a disastrous season and recovering
from shoulder surgery. However, there is hope for both the team and the player
to stage a comeback with hard work and perseverance. There will be no such
comeback for the Taiwanese baseball players recently busted in a game-fixing
scandal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan prosecutors indicted 24 players in the latest scandal of Taiwan's Chinese
Professional Baseball League (CPBL) , with two others, including Elephants star
pitcher Tsao Chin-hui, escaping indictment only because their improper behavior
(including accepting free sex services) has not been directly linked to game-
fixing. Together, these 26 players can probably make up the strongest baseball
team in Taiwan. However, none of them will ever play, coach or teach baseball
professionally in Taiwan ever again.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, these harsh punishments for individual players may not be enough
to revitalize the CPBL. There were similar scandals in 1996 and 2005. The same
problems occur again and again even though the players involved are thrown out
because there are deeper structural issues within the league that remain
unresolved.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problem for Taiwan's professional baseball lies in the
insufficient population base for supporting so many teams. On average, there is
about one professional baseball team for every 10 million people in the U.S. and
Japan. Currently Taiwan, with 23 million people, has four professional baseball
teams.</P>
      <P>Now is the time for Taiwan's professional baseball teams to consider joining the
leagues of other countries. Japan would be an ideal choice. If Taiwan's baseball
teams decide to join Japan's professional baseball league, everybody would
benefit. Fans would be able to watch games played at a higher level, and the
Japanese league will gain several million additional Taiwanese fans. (By Bear

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese New Year Eve -- Feb. 13 this year -- is a time when families come
together. This year, the Taiwan people are also celebrating the fact that the
global financial storm is almost past and national development is on the move,
though at a slow pace.</P>
      <P>Economically, people can feel the gradual effects of the improved relations
across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's economy grew by 6.98 percent in the fourth
quarter in 2009, compared with negative growth of 8. 76 percent in the same
period the previous year.</P>
      <P>However, politically, the country seems to be stagnated under President Ma Ying-
jeou's "gentle leadership."</P>
      <P>After experiencing several election setbacks, Ma, who is the leader of both the
government and the ruling party,  appears nonetheless to be stuck in a
leadership crisis.</P>
      <P>His approach of trying to let the political wounds in the society heal naturally
has proved to be a failure due to relentless attacks by the opposition camp.</P>
      <P>In addition, his administration's slow response to the public's needs has led to
disappointment with the charismatic president.</P>
      <P>However, it would be immature to put all the responsibility on the shoulders of
the president. Although the public's anxiety has been stirred by politicians who
make showy and inflammatory speeches, the people must try to think more deeply.</P>
      <P>For example, some of the debates on controversial issues like U.S. beef imports
and the H1N1 national vaccination program have been meaningful and have prompted
the government to correct its mistakes, but some are geared more toward ideology
and populism.</P>
      <P>On the more complicated issue of a proposed economic cooperation framework
agreement with China, the public debate should have moved long ago from whether
or not Taiwan should sign the pact to the question of how it should be signed.</P>
      <P>The country has been in a quandary for the past year over whether or not to sign
the trade agreement.</P>
      <P>It is not just Ma who's in a political predicament, but also the whole country.

      <P>It seems that the outlook is not good for Taiwan to regain peace and prosperity
in the Year of the Tiger that begins on Feb. 14, after the many disasters in the
Year of the Ox.</P>
      <P>As long as President Ma Ying-jeou remains in power, hard times can be expected
to continue in the Year of Tiger because of Ma's incompetence, arrogance, and
pro-China policies.</P>
      <P>Under Ma's administration, the country suffered in the Year of the Ox the worst
economic recession ever, a record high unemployment rate, a wage drop that saw
the incomes of workers shrink to the level of 13 years ago, and an expansion of
national deficits.</P>
      <P>Although the Ma government is touting economic recovery and an expected economic
cooperation framework agreement with China as signs that the bad luck has gone
for good, Taiwan is not likely to take a turn for the better in the coming year
as long as its leader remains on his own political course.</P>
      <P>The people must force the Ma government to change its policies in the new year,

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, in a Lunar New Year holiday greeting to the people, said
that he wished people in Taiwan would maintain their vigor, using a well-known
expression to describe the power of the tiger, the zodiac animal of the new
year.</P>
      <P>As Chinese around the world celebrate the coming of Tiger Year -- the third
earth branch year in the Chinese Zodiac's 12-year cycle of animals -- tiger
motifs can be seen everywhere, in paintings, decorations, toy designs, clothing
and accessories, on posters, and at festive banquets.</P>
      <P>Rather  than fierceness,  the Tiger zodiac sign symbolizes toughness, generosity
and wealth earned through hard work.</P>
      <P>Each of the Chinese Zodiac's 12 animals -- rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon,
snake, horse, ram, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig -- has its own characteristics
which in Chinese legends are associated with people's personalities, fortune,
and abilities.</P>
      <P>In these legends, mighty generals in battle are dubbed "Tiger Generals, " and a
person's speedy and energetic actions are compared to the tiger's powerful
movements. In Chinese legend, tigers command the wind, while dragons empower the
clouds.</P>
      <P>As the Mandarin pronunciation of tiger (hu) is similar to that of luck (fu) ,
the Year of the Tiger is believed to be one of economic prosperity. One of the
most popular spring scrolls this year is "Lucky Tiger."</P>

      <P>A series of tests are being conducted in Europe  in preparation  for the launch
of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) , the first large acceptance particle
detector designed to operate in space.</P>
      <P>Many people, however, may not know that scientists from Taiwan have taken part
in the project.</P>
      <P>According to the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), 15 countries
have participated in the AMS experiment, which was designed and developed by an
international team of physicists led by American Nobel laureate Sam Ting.</P>
      <P>Manufacture of the AMS components was a joint effort, with France, Germany,
Italy, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, China, the United States and Taiwan making
significant contributions, the CERN said.</P>
      <P>The participating institutes from Taiwan are the Academia Sinica, the Chung Shan
Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST), National Central University (NCU) ,
National Cheng Kung University, National Chiao Tung University, and the National
Space Program Office (NSPO).</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-hsun, an associate research scientist from the Academia Sinica's
Institute of Physics, told the CNA that Taiwan's role in the project mainly
covers three areas.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, most of the detector's electronic equipment was manufactured
at the CSIST, and its main computer and trigger system were jointly designed,
manufactured and tested by Academia Sinica, NCU, CSIST and the U.S.-based
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>The CSIST and NSPO were responsible for thermal modeling and analysis, and the
Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. produced the AMS ground support equipment
and cooling panels.</P>
      <P>The main scientific purpose of AMS is to search for dark matter and antimatter.</P>
      <P>The CERN said the AMS will be transported from the European Space Research and
Technology Center towards the end of May aboard a special U.S. Air Force flight
to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</P>
      <P>Lift-off aboard the space shuttle Discovery is scheduled for July, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The locally produced film Monga set a record Feb. 5 for the highest box office
sales on premiere night in Taiwan in the last decade, beating out the Hollywood
blockbuster Avatar.</P>
      <P>Monga's take on opening night in Taiwan was NT$18 million, far bigger than
Avatar which had a start at the Taiwan box office of NT$6.97 million, and the
hugely successful local film Cape No.7 which opened last year with NT$460,000.</P>
      <P>Because of the huge spike in tourism in Hengchun, the filming location of Cape
No.  7,  local governments have become more accommodating and supportive of
filmmakers, with an eye on promotion of their cities and towns.</P>
      <P>This is why Monga had the Taipei City government's full support.</P>
      <P>Set in the oldest district in Taipei, Monga is a violent and bloody film that
deals with themes of youth, loneliness, intimacy, friendship, and self-
identification.</P>
      <P>The story of the dark side of the Monga district, which is now called Wanhua and
is home to several ancient temples, could prove to be risky for the city
government that provided financial and administrative support in the hope that

Asian Women's Football Championship 2010 in Japan.</P>
      <P>The loss, which followed two others to South Korea and Japan, put Taiwan at the
bottom of the rankings in the competition.</P>
      <P>Chou Tai-ying, head coach of the Taiwan team, said that despite the losses, all
the players performed well in light of the fact that the team is quite new.</P>
      <P>She said at present, Taiwan has only about 200 female football players and it
has recently begun to select elementary students for training in an effort to
expand its football talent pool.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the overall competition, Chou said the Chinese team had the
advantage because of its high quality of play, and the South Korean team's
pugnacious spirit was impressive.</P>
      <P>The Japanese team was not the best in terms of overall quality, physical fitness

    <TEXT>
      <P>China reached its target of 8 percent economic growth in 2009 and that figure is
expected to rise to 10 percent this year. Many top economic  analysts agree,
based on the United States' strong performance in the last quarter, that its
economic prospects for 2010 are promising.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to benefit from the global economic recovery that is being
led by the two major economies. But in the meantime, Taiwan also faces severe
challenges as a result of increasingly sharp global competition, especially with
the formation the "ASEAN plus one (China)" free trade area.</P>
      <P>The most important issues for Taiwan in the Year of the Tiger are economic and
political. The two major questions are whether the proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China could be signed as scheduled and produce
the desired positive effect, and whether the year-end elections in the five
special municipalities could be held smoothly.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's popularity has been declining over the past year or so
due to the economic meltdown and high unemployment. But the president's poor
leadership with regards to communication, judgment and execution is also a
contributing factor.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Taiwan's economic future may rest on whether the administration
could convince the general public of the need to sign the cross-strait trade
pact.</P>
      <P>However, the "hot political season" will start soon in Taiwan, with the
legislative by-elections in four constituencies at end of February and
preparations for the more important year-end special municipality elections. The
government therefore has to gear up to deal with the ECFA issue, otherwise,
Taiwan's competitiveness would suffer greatly.</P>
      <P>Success in all these areas depends on President Ma and his administration's
determination and perseverance. (Feb. 16, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said recently that he has instructed the Council for
Cultural Affairs (CCA) to implement as soon as possible a plan to set up Taiwan
Academies around the world to promote traditional Chinese language and culture.</P>
      <P>The "Taiwan Academy" project is one of President Ma's campaign promises. He said
such academies are necessary in view of the fact that the Confucius Institutes
set up by China in many countries around the globe have somehow dominated the
teaching of Chinese language and culture in non-Chinese speaking populations.</P>
      <P>Admitting that his proposal has not gotten off the ground as expected, the
president said that the CCA and the Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission
(OCAC) should work out concrete measures to implement the plan.</P>
      <P>Currently, the CCA has cultural centers in some foreign capitals and the OCAC
runs quite a few Chinese-language schools on all continents.</P>
      <P>President  Ma suggested  that the Taiwan academies  should incorporate  the
functions of language institutes and cultural centers, because many of the
OCAC's language schools, although they have a long tradition, do not have
sufficient resources, and the CCA's cultural centers are focused on the
promotion of culture and Taiwan's contemporary arts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The global economy is definitely on a path to recovery, but there are still many
hidden crises and risks lurking ahead.</P>
      <P>Taiwan took a beating during the global economic crisis, with its economy
contracting 9.6 percent in the first quarter of last year, which was the worst
stage for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, with the massive economic stimulus measures taken by the governments of
the leading economies, global financial markets rebounded and the economic slide
halted in the second quarter of 2009. Since then, the good news has included a
5.7 percent economic growth posted by the United States in the last quarter of
2009 -- its highest since 2003 -- and the 8.5 percent growth in China last year.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, the economy has bottomed out for sure, as the stock market has
rebounded from its decline since early last year and a 6.89 percent GDP growth
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>In addition, many local enterprises, which had forced their employees to take
unpaid leave during the crisis, have begun to recruit new staff and make new
investments.</P>
      <P>However, all this good news does not necessarily mean guaranteed recovery and
growth, as many hidden crises and risks are brewing despite the recent economic
stability.</P>
      <P>The first such uncertainty is whether the private sector would be able to fill
the void that would be left when the world governments withdraw their economic
stimulus measures.</P>
      <P>Secondly, world governments are facing the dilema of how to sustain economic
growth without causing inflation.</P>
      <P>Besides, unemployment, which is around 10 percent in the U.S. and most of the
European Union and just under 6 percent in Taiwan, could become a nightmare for
countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in the Year of the Tiger, there are many unpredictable and
uncontrollable factors what require the government to take good care of in order
to ensure a promising economy. (Feb. 16, 2010)</P>

      <P>China Times: When you are stuck in a traffic on a freeway, can you wind down
your window and chat with people in the vehicles near you? That was Premier Wu
Den-yih's suggestion to drivers in holiday traffic jams.</P>
      <P>Wu said that congestion on the freeways cannot be avoided during the Lunar New
Year holiday because there are usually 100,000 to 200,000 vehicles on roads that
were built to accommodate a maximum of 10,000 vehicles. It is therefore not
possible to drive at speeds of 90 to 100 kilometers per hour, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: The traffic usually peaks on the second day of the Lunar New Year

million automobiles would be on the freeways that day, and recurrent traffic jam
on several sections could be expected, especially on the North-South Freeway No.
1.</P>
      <P>Railway travel was also intensive on Feb. 15, with between 470,000 and 480,000
passengers recorded, according to the Taiwan Railway Administration.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: The Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau planned to impose
traffic flow control on sections of freeways No. 1, No. 3 and No. 5 on the
second day of the Lunar New Year, Feb. 15, as many families were expected to be

married daughters visiting their parents on the second day of the lunar year.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: As Lunar New Year's Day fell on Feb. 14, Valentine's Day,

(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The global economy is definitely on a path to recovery, but there are still many
hidden crises and risks lurking ahead.</P>
      <P>Taiwan took a beating during the global economic crisis, with its economy
contracting 9.6 percent in the first quarter of last year, which was the worst
stage for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, with the massive economic stimulus measures taken by the governments of
the leading economies, global financial markets rebounded and the economic slide
halted in the second quarter of 2009. Since then, the good news has included a
5.7 percent economic growth posted by the United States in the last quarter of
2009 -- its highest since 2003 -- and the 8.5 percent growth in China last year.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, the economy has bottomed out for sure, as the stock market has
rebounded from its decline since early last year and a 6.89 percent GDP growth
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>In addition, many local enterprises, which had forced their employees to take
unpaid leave during the crisis, have begun to recruit new staff and make new
investments.</P>
      <P>However, all this good news does not necessarily mean guaranteed recovery and
growth, as many hidden crises and risks are brewing despite the recent economic
stability.</P>
      <P>The first such uncertainty is whether the private sector would be able to fill
the void that would be left when the world governments withdraw their economic
stimulus measures.</P>
      <P>Secondly, world governments are facing the dilema of how to sustain economic
growth without causing inflation.</P>
      <P>Besides, unemployment, which is around 10 percent in the U.S. and most of the
European Union and just under 6 percent in Taiwan, could become a nightmare for
countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in the Year of the Tiger, there are many unpredictable and
uncontrollable factors what require the government to take good care of in order
to ensure a promising economy. (Feb. 16, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: New thinking amid cross-strait exchanges</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/17/10  15:38:20
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When the Year of the Tiger was celebrated Feb. 14 by Chinese people around the
world, it again provided clear proof that Chinese culture is an asset enjoyed
and owned by all of us.</P>
      <P>Whether in Taichung, Kaohsiung, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Beijing, the Chinese New
Year is the most important holiday for all ethnic Chinese. People on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait follow the same traditions to embrace the arrival of
another new year, making us profoundly realize that it is thousands of years of
Chinese history and the same language and culture that has bonded us together.</P>
      <P>Increased cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges have helped people on the two sides
deepen mutual understanding  and strengthen  two-way integration. Although a
recent U.S. decision to sell some defensive weapons  to Taiwan  cast a shadow on
the generally  positive cross-strait atmosphere, Taiwan-China relations continue
to move in the direction  of fostering  peace  and cooperation,  lowering
hostilities and seeking common ground amid differences.</P>
      <P>It is true that China has not yet abandoned its threat of use of force against
Taiwan, but both sides are fully aware that it would be a huge tragedy for all
Chinese people if the two sides went to war.</P>
      <P>To Taiwan, peace, development and dignity are the three major pursuits in cross-
strait interactions, and the government should respond to the people's
aspirations. Peace in the Taiwan Strait is a blessing for the people in both
Taiwan and China and will benefit development in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Improved cross-strait ties have made Taiwan and China both realize that they are
not necessarily enemies as long as they are willing to compromise. A peaceful
environment will push us to think in new ways and create new opportunities to
build new models to resolve our disputes. (Feb. 17, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day--- Politicians gather at legislative speaker's party</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative  Speaker Wang Jin-pyng  threw a party for his relatives, friends and
supporters in his hometown of Lujhu, Kaohsiung County, Feb. 16 in celebration of
the Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>As usual, the annual event brought together political bigwigs in southern Taiwan
and was closely watched by political pundits as a barometer of Taiwan's
political climate.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of leading local newspapers' coverage of the event:
The United Daily News:</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 supporters and politicians from across Taiwan's political
spectrum gathered at Wang's party.</P>
      <P>Notable among them were Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu and Kaohsiung County
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Yang have announced their intention to run on the ticket of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the mayoral election of the
Kaohsiung special municipality, which will be formed by the merger of Kaohsiung
City and Kaohsiung County later this year.</P>
      <P>The party was scheduled for the evening, but Chen visited Wang at noon because
it was the only opening in her tight schedule that day, and she was treated to
lunch by the legislative speaker.</P>
      <P>Chen said she called on Wang to offer her New Year's greetings and to thank him
for supporting Kaohsiung City's public projects even though Wang is a leading
figure of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>As to the year-end mayoral election, Chen said she would of course like to have
Wang's endorsement, but she knew it would be difficult. (Feb. 17, 2010) China
Times:</P>
      <P>Wang was urged by his supporters at the lunch to run for Kaohsiung mayor, but
the speaker said he was not interested.</P>
      <P>In response to the push for Wang's candidacy, Chen said tongue in cheek that
Kaohsiung would be too small a pond for a big fish like Wang.</P>
      <P>"He is a national figure and should play at the national stage, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>As leader of the legislature, Chen said Wang doesn't treat lawmakers differently
because of their political affiliation and is therefore indispensable to the
lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>Chen's rival for the DPP nomination, Yang Chiu-hsing, arrived at Wang's party
Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>He stopped short, however, of asking Wang for endorsement of his candidacy,
saying the New Year's party is a social gathering and one that he has attended
regularly over the last few years.</P>
      <P>"Wang is a well-known national politician from Kaohsiung. There are many issues
on which I have to seek his opinion after the merger of Kaohsiung County and
Kaohsiung City," Yang said. (Feb. 17, 2010) The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Chao-shun, who is hoping to run as the KMT's candidate in the
Kaohsiung special municipality race, said "it is good, " when asked about the
possibility of Wang running on the KMT ticket. She said Wang is a well-known
political leader at the national level and urged KMT authorities not to look
down upon him.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said in an interview a couple of days ago
that Wang would be a wonderful candidate but that the party should respect his
willingness to run.</P>
      <P>Lujhu Council Speaker Huang Sung-cheng, a political confidant of Wang, ruled out
the possibility that Wang would run in the Kaohsiung race, saying it was out of
the question.</P>
      <P>"I asked him in person last week and the answer was 'no.'" (Feb. 17, 2010)</P>

      <P>At the turn of year, many people make "new wishes" for the coming year. The new
wish for people today should be to "save the Earth" because of predictable
catastrophes: pollution, global warming and species extinction.</P>
      <P>Do not believe that these possible tragedies are remote. Just look at Taiwan.
Over the past 100 years, the average temperature on this island has increased by
0.8 degrees Celsius, higher than the world's 0.7 degrees. Torrential rainfall,
extreme temperatures, typhoons, and floods may all arrive more frequently the
more rapid mutations of viruses and bacteria threaten the Earth.</P>
      <P>Despite the signing of the Kyoto Protocol 13 years ago and the holding of the
Copenhagen summit late last year, nothing concrete has been done by governments
across the globe to improve the situation. Ordinary people should face up to
this reality and take action on their own in their daily lives.</P>
      <P>First, use car pooling when going out in groups. Second, turn out the lights
when possible at home and in the office. Switch off the air conditioning and use
power-saving strategies on the roof, such as painting it white. Third, do not
use plastic bags and instead use shopping bags as much as possible. Fourth,
separate kitchen leftovers and trash. Fifth, use your own cup when drinking
coffee outside and do not buy products that are overpackaged, to help save trees
that are essential to maintaining normal temperatures and rainfall.</P>
      <P>These are trivial things, but they are extremely important to our environment.
Any great task starts from the beginning. Now is the time for all of us to get
involved. (Feb. 17, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local students who were eager to find a part-time job during their 32-day winter
vacation should not have had a hard time finding one as many local businesses
are trying to profit from the New Year's holiday shopping season as the economy
recovers.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by local manpower agency 104 Job Bank, the
number of available part-time jobs rose to 21,168 in January, up 9.6 percent
from the previous month.</P>
      <P>This figures corresponded to the 9.89 percent increase reported by another
employment agency, the 1111 Job Bank, compared with the same period a year
earlier.</P>
      <P>Fang Guang-wei, a public relations manager for the 104 Job Bank, attributed the
increase to local restaurants' booming business in meeting demand for year-end
dinners, which accounted for 21.9 percent of the increase.</P>
      <P>Marketing personnel, such as sales promoters in department stores and point-of-
purchase salespeople in supermarkets, made up 19.6 percent of the increase.</P>
      <P>Education accounted for another 15.4 percent of the rise, thanks to more parents
enrolling their children in special classes during the winter vacation.</P>
      <P>These job opportunities likely met the demands of many students who were looking
for part-time jobs during the vacation.</P>
      <P>A survey by 1111 Job Bank showed that 95 percent of students it interviewed said
they intended to work part-time during the vacation and expected to earn an
average of NT$12,306 (US$383) over that time.</P>
      <P>1111 Job Bank spokesman Chang Hsiu-lan said the number of students who intended
to work part-time is 10 percent more than in 2008, before the global financial
crisis battered Taiwan's economy, and their income expectations were NT$2,000
lower than two years ago.</P>
      <P>Eateries, which offered the most job opportunities, were these students'
favorite workplaces, followed by supermarkets and jobs as computer input
operators.</P>
      <P>Theme parks, which are often packed with visitors during the New Year holiday,
and manufacturers of video games catering to students also needed many extra
hands this winter.</P>
      <P>Yuan Hsiang-chieh, the public relations manager for the Leofoo Village Theme
Park in Guansi, Hsinchu County, said the park needed 300 student workers in
February, 100 more than during the same period last year.</P>
      <P>These part-time workers were needed to man the park's shops, restaurants, snack
bars and hotels.</P>
      <P>On-line games operators who enjoyed a prosperous year in 2009 also needed part-
time workers to help them design, test, promote and maintain their new online
games, according to the 104 Job Bank.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City government has launched a "Taipei Technology Corridor" project
that it hopes will turn Taiwan's capital city into a knowledge-based high-tech
hub and create a favorable international investment environment.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-hsiung, director of the city's Department of Economic Development, said
the goal is to develop Taipei City into a global high-tech, R&amp;D and business
operations stronghold by capitalizing on its ideal location within Asia,
business friendly environment, strong human and capital resources, and sound
Internet infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The 893.3-hectare corridor will stretch from the Neihu Technology Park to the
Kuandu Industrial Zone, connecting the Nankang Software Park and the planned
Shihlin-Beitou Technology Park, according to the city government.</P>
      <P>With the corridor increasingly taking shape, more information, biotechnology,
communications and cultural innovation companies have set up shops in these
parks, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Citing the 150-hectare Neihu Technology Park as an example of the corridor's
potential, Chen said it has now become a cluster for high-tech businesses, an
operations center for the global electronics industry, and the hub of Taiwan's
telecommunications industry.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,446 enterprises, (including 26 business headquarters and 12
research centers) operate in the park, with a production value of NT$2.7
trillion (US$83.85 billion) per year.</P>
      <P>The Nankang Software Park is designed to attract biotechnology, IC design and
digital content firms. In addition, the Taipei City government is planning to
position it as an Asian Software Park and an Asian R&amp;D center.</P>
      <P>Currently, 275 companies, (including four business headquarters and six R&amp;D
centers) have moved into the park, racking up NT$182.6 billion in revenues in
2007.</P>
      <P>To strengthen the park's cluster effect, a third-stage expansion project was
completed in September 2008 and is expected to generate an annual production of
US$1.86 billion in the future.</P>
      <P>The planned Shihlin-Beitou Technology Park, the third high-tech compound in
Taipei City after the Neihu and Nankang technology parks, will be located on a
195-hectare plot.</P>
      <P>It will comprise knowledge-based companies in the biotechnology, media and
telecommunications sectors and create an estimated 35,000 jobs after its
completion, which is projected for 2015.</P>

      <P>Northbound lanes of the island's freeways began to swarm with cars Tuesday as

      <P>A total of 2.83 million cars hit Taiwan's freeways Tuesday, 84 percent more than
last year's daily average, according to the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Though traffic was heavy on northbound  lanes and average traveling speeds
reducing, no major snarls were reported.</P>
      <P>Speeds slowed to between 40-60 kilometers per hour in stretches between Neili
and Pingjhen in Taoyuan County and near the Yuanlin Toll Station in Changhua
County on National Freeway No. 1, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The volume of cars was expected to dip slightly to 2.7 million Wednesday, the
bureau said in a statement, adding that 420,000 cars, or 2.8 times more than
usual, passed through the freeways' various toll stations between midnight
Tuesday and 7 a.m. Wednesday when no toll was charged.</P>
      <P>In order to more efficiently utilize the freeways, the bureau said it will allow
only cars with three or more passengers to use northbound lanes on the island's
two major north-south arteries -- National Freeway No. 1 and No. 3 -- between 9
a.m. and 3 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday.</P>

      <P>Many people in Taiwan may be enjoying their Lunar New Year break, but candidates
participating in legislative by-elections in four counties on Feb. 27 have
stepped up their campaign efforts over the holiday.</P>
      <P>King Pu-tsung, secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), was reluctant
Tuesday to predict the outcome of the four races, to be held in Taoyuan,
Hualien, Chiayi, and Hsinchu counties.</P>
      <P>With only 10 days to go before election day, he stumped for KMT candidate Lin
Teh-jui in Chiayi County and accompanied him as they canvassed for support on
county streets.</P>
      <P>Lin is seen as a heavy underdog against former Chiayi County Magistrate Chen
Ming-wen, a heavyweight of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in
the race in the southern Taiwan county, a traditional DPP stronghold.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Chiayi County Magistrate Chang Hwa-kuan, Chen handed out Year of
the Tiger red envelopes to the public when visiting the Tsu Yun Temple on the
same day.</P>
      <P>Earlier Tuesday, King campaigned for the KMT's Wang Ting-sheng in eastern
Hualien County. Wang will run against Hsiao Bi-khim, a strong DPP contender, and
independent candidate Shih Sheng-lang, who has the backing of Hualien County
Magistrate Fu Kun-chi.</P>
      <P>Polls indicate that it will be a tight two-way race, with Shih possibly acting
as a spoiler.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who stumped for Hsiao in Hualien, said Hsiao stands
a good chance of winning the contest even though the KMT traditionally enjoys
greater support there.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan, KMT hopeful Apollo Chen will challenge the
DPP's Huang Jen-shu and two other independent candidates. Signs over the past 20
days indicate that it will be a tight contest between Chen and Huang.</P>
      <P>In neighboring Hsinchu County, Cheng Yung-tang of the KMT will battle Perng
Shaw-jiin of the DPP. Perng is believed to have the upper hand at present in a
battle between veteran members of their respective parties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Market for part-time jobs prosperous during winter break</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local students who were eager to find a part-time job during their 32-day winter
vacation should not have had a hard time finding one as many local businesses
are trying to profit from the New Year's holiday shopping season as the economy
recovers.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by local manpower agency 104 Job Bank, the
number of available part-time jobs rose to 21,168 in January, up 9.6 percent
from the previous month.</P>
      <P>This figures corresponded to the 9.89 percent increase reported by another
employment agency, the 1111 Job Bank, compared with the same period a year
earlier.</P>
      <P>Fang Guang-wei, a public relations manager for the 104 Job Bank, attributed the
increase to local restaurants' booming business in meeting demand for year-end
dinners, which accounted for 21.9 percent of the increase.</P>
      <P>Marketing personnel, such as sales promoters in department stores and point-of-
purchase salespeople in supermarkets, made up 19.6 percent of the increase.</P>
      <P>Education accounted for another 15.4 percent of the rise, thanks to more parents
enrolling their children in special classes during the winter vacation.</P>
      <P>These job opportunities likely met the demands of many students who were looking
for part-time jobs during the vacation.</P>
      <P>A survey by 1111 Job Bank showed that 95 percent of students it interviewed said
they intended to work part-time during the vacation and expected to earn an
average of NT$12,306 (US$383) over that time.</P>
      <P>1111 Job Bank spokesman Chang Hsiu-lan said the number of students who intended
to work part-time is 10 percent more than in 2008, before the global financial
crisis battered Taiwan's economy, and their income expectations were NT$2,000
lower than two years ago.</P>
      <P>Eateries, which offered the most job opportunities, were these students'
favorite workplaces, followed by supermarkets and jobs as computer input
operators.</P>
      <P>Theme parks, which are often packed with visitors during the New Year holiday,
and manufacturers of video games catering to students also needed many extra
hands this winter.</P>
      <P>Yuan Hsiang-chieh, the public relations manager for the Leofoo Village Theme
Park in Guansi, Hsinchu County, said the park needed 300 student workers in
February, 100 more than during the same period last year.</P>
      <P>These part-time workers were needed to man the park's shops, restaurants, snack
bars and hotels.</P>
      <P>On-line games operators who enjoyed a prosperous year in 2009 also needed part-
time workers to help them design, test, promote and maintain their new online
games, according to the 104 Job Bank.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government has launched a "Taipei Technology Corridor" project
that it hopes will turn Taiwan's capital city into a knowledge-based high-tech
hub and create a favorable international investment environment.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-hsiung, director of the city's Department of Economic Development, said
the goal is to develop Taipei City into a global high-tech, R&amp;D and business
operations stronghold by capitalizing on its ideal location within Asia,
business friendly environment, strong human and capital resources, and sound
Internet infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The 893.3-hectare corridor will stretch from the Neihu Technology Park to the
Kuandu Industrial Zone, connecting the Nankang Software Park and the planned
Shihlin-Beitou Technology Park, according to the city government.</P>
      <P>With the corridor increasingly taking shape, more information, biotechnology,
communications and cultural innovation companies have set up shops in these
parks, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Citing the 150-hectare Neihu Technology Park as an example of the corridor's
potential, Chen said it has now become a cluster for high-tech businesses, an
operations center for the global electronics industry, and the hub of Taiwan's
telecommunications industry.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,446 enterprises, (including 26 business headquarters and 12
research centers) operate in the park, with a production value of NT$2.7
trillion (US$83.85 billion) per year.</P>
      <P>The Nankang Software Park is designed to attract biotechnology, IC design and
digital content firms. In addition, the Taipei City government is planning to
position it as an Asian Software Park and an Asian R&amp;D center.</P>
      <P>Currently, 275 companies, (including four business headquarters and six R&amp;D
centers) have moved into the park, racking up NT$182.6 billion in revenues in
2007.</P>
      <P>To strengthen the park's cluster effect, a third-stage expansion project was
completed in September 2008 and is expected to generate an annual production of
US$1.86 billion in the future.</P>
      <P>The planned Shihlin-Beitou Technology Park, the third high-tech compound in
Taipei City after the Neihu and Nankang technology parks, will be located on a
195-hectare plot.</P>
      <P>It will comprise knowledge-based companies in the biotechnology, media and
telecommunications sectors and create an estimated 35,000 jobs after its
completion, which is projected for 2015.</P>

      <P>Northbound lanes of the island's freeways began to swarm with cars Tuesday as
the nine-day Chinese New Year holiday entered its fourth day.</P>
      <P>A total of 2.83 million cars hit Taiwan's freeways Tuesday, 84 percent more than
last year's daily average, according to the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Though traffic was heavy on northbound  lanes and average traveling speeds
reducing, no major snarls were reported.</P>
      <P>Speeds slowed to between 40-60 kilometers per hour in stretches between Neili
and Pingjhen in Taoyuan County and near the Yuanlin Toll Station in Changhua
County on National Freeway No. 1, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The volume of cars was expected to dip slightly to 2.7 million Wednesday, the
bureau said in a statement, adding that 420,000 cars, or 2.8 times more than
usual, passed through the freeways' various toll stations between midnight
Tuesday and 7 a.m. Wednesday when no toll was charged.</P>
      <P>In order to more efficiently utilize the freeways, the bureau said it will allow
only cars with three or more passengers to use northbound lanes on the island's
two major north-south arteries -- National Freeway No. 1 and No. 3 -- between 9
a.m. and 3 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday.</P>

      <P>Many people in Taiwan may be enjoying their Lunar New Year break, but candidates
participating in legislative by-elections in four counties on Feb. 27 have
stepped up their campaign efforts over the holiday.</P>
      <P>King Pu-tsung, secretary-general of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), was reluctant
Tuesday to predict the outcome of the four races, to be held in Taoyuan,
Hualien, Chiayi, and Hsinchu counties.</P>
      <P>With only 10 days to go before election day, he stumped for KMT candidate Lin
Teh-jui in Chiayi County and accompanied him as they canvassed for support on
county streets.</P>
      <P>Lin is seen as a heavy underdog against former Chiayi County Magistrate Chen
Ming-wen, a heavyweight of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in
the race in the southern Taiwan county, a traditional DPP stronghold.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Chiayi County Magistrate Chang Hwa-kuan, Chen handed out Year of
the Tiger red envelopes to the public when visiting the Tsu Yun Temple on the
same day.</P>
      <P>Earlier Tuesday, King campaigned for the KMT's Wang Ting-sheng in eastern
Hualien County. Wang will run against Hsiao Bi-khim, a strong DPP contender, and
independent candidate Shih Sheng-lang, who has the backing of Hualien County
Magistrate Fu Kun-chi.</P>
      <P>Polls indicate that it will be a tight two-way race, with Shih possibly acting
as a spoiler.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who stumped for Hsiao in Hualien, said Hsiao stands
a good chance of winning the contest even though the KMT traditionally enjoys
greater support there.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan, KMT hopeful Apollo Chen will challenge the
DPP's Huang Jen-shu and two other independent candidates. Signs over the past 20
days indicate that it will be a tight contest between Chen and Huang.</P>
      <P>In neighboring Hsinchu County, Cheng Yung-tang of the KMT will battle Perng
Shaw-jiin of the DPP. Perng is believed to have the upper hand at present in a

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 646,000 Chinese nationals made sightseeing trips to Taiwan in the 18
months since the country opened its doors wider to Chinese tourists in July
2008, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Though Chinese tourist arrival numbers have risen steadily during that time,
they are expected to grow even further in years to come after Taiwan and China
swap offices governing tourism and travel affairs, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>"Once established, the tourism offices will offer faster, more convenient and
more efficient services to cross-strait tourists, " a MAC official said.</P>
      <P>Between July 2008 and Dec. 31, 2009, 26,488 Chinese tour groups comprising
646,783 individuals took trips to Taiwan, mostly on eight-day, seven-night tour
packages.</P>
      <P>With daily individual spending estimated at US$250, the Chinese tourists have
contributed roughly US$1.13 billion to Taiwan's economy over the past 18 months,
the MAC said.</P>
      <P>Despite the steady growth, however, the number of inbound Chinese tourists has
not reached the average quota of 3,000 per day.</P>
      <P>Such a number was not significant in the beginning, MAC officials contend, but
following closer communications and coordination efforts between tourism
officials and travel agencies on the two sides, tourist arrivals rose to about
3,000 daily in April and May last year.</P>
      <P>The number declined slightly after August 2009 because of Typhoon Morakot, one
of the worst natural disasters in Taiwan in decades, and the impact of the
influenza A (H1N1) epidemic, before picking up again in November, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>"Now the average number of inbound Chinese tourists stands about 2,000 daily,"
the official said.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, only 20 Chinese nationals from among the 646,783 tourist
arrivals went unaccounted for, far lower than figures posted in Taiwan before
2008, when on average 36 out of every 100,000 Chinese entering the country
absconded.</P>
      <P>The ratio is even higher in Japan, where 140 out of every 100,000 Chinese
disappear after entering, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>Of the 20 who have fled in Taiwan over the past 18 months, two have been nabbed
while the remaining 18 have yet to be found, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>In 2009 alone, Chinese nationals were the second largest group of foreign
visitors to Taiwan, behind only the Japanese, with 972,213 arrivals, including
606,174 traveling as tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Economy flexes muscle in Year of Tiger</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/18/10  15:07:48
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This day on the Chinese calendar is the time to welcome the God of Wealth and
also a good day for stores to open after Lunar New Year celebrations.</P>
      <P>At the start of the Year of the Tiger, we wish our readers happiness, wealth and
good fortune. We also hope our government and people will work in concert to
make our economy as vibrant as a tiger.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Year of the Ox that started amid a global financial meltdown, the
Year of the Tiger opens in an upbeat mood over an increasingly evident economic
recovery. Both external and domestic markets provide momentum favorable for
economic growth.</P>
      <P>Externally, a major consensus reached at the just-concluded World Economic Forum
in Davos is that this year's GDP growth rates for the world's major economies --
and emerging economies such as China and India in particular -- will be higher
than those forecast a half year ago. This implies a surge in global demand that
will give Taiwan's economic development a badly needed shot in the arm.</P>
      <P>Internally, private consumption and corporate investment -- the two pillars of
domestic demand -- are both bottoming out of a year-long recession. Private-
sector investment is expected to be exceptionally robust this year as many
industries undergo structural adjustments in the wake of the devastating global
financial storm.</P>
      <P>Investment  in energy  conservation,  carbon reduction  and production capacity
expansion to cope with global competition will further fuel growth.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  the  government's  four-year  NT$500  billion infrastructure
construction project will shift into high gear this year,  which will serve as
yet another engine of sustainable expansion.</P>
      <P>With the "four legs" of economic development -- external trade, private
consumption, private investment and government investment -- ready to advance
simultaneously, we are confident that our economy will no longer be crippled
this year.</P>
      <P>Steadily improving relations across the Taiwan Strait will offer additional
growth  momentum  as three  measures  to normalize cross-strait economic
relations -- relaxing ceilings on China-bound investment, easing curbs on
industries eligible to invest in China, and allowing Chinese investment in
Taiwan -- will come to fruition during the year.</P>
      <P>The already signed cross-strait memorandum of understanding on financial
supervisory  cooperation  and the proposed  economic cooperation framework
agreement will help further remove barriers to Taiwan's economic links with the
global market and infuse new vigor and vitality into the local economy.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  downside variables still lurk on the global economic horizon,
including the winding down of emergency stimulus packages adopted by various
countries during the financial crisis, the risk of a hard economic landing in
China, and sovereign debt crises in certain countries. The government should not
ignore those possibilities and should heighten its vigilance and prepare
response strategies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou would not refer to Taiwan and China as "the two
countries, " a Presidential Office spokesman said Thursday in clarifying a press
release that used the term a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times reported that according to a Presidential Office press release
issued Wednesday, the president referred to Taiwan and China as "two countries"
when he talked with a visiting U.S. congressman earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Wang Yu-chi said, however, that the president has not and would never
refer to cross-strait relations as relations between two countries.</P>
      <P>Wang explained  that according  to the Republic  of China Constitution, the ROC
on Taiwan is a sovereign state and the Chinese mainland is an ROC "area."</P>
      <P>Under this constitutional framework, he said, the ROC does not recognize China
as a sovereign nation but "does not deny that in fact mainland authorities are
the effective ruling authority in the mainland Chinese area."</P>
      <P>Such a constitutional framework has been observed in Taiwan since former
President Lee Teng-hui promulgated it 19 years ago, Wang said, and the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party did not try to make any changes to the
framework during its eight-year rule between 2000 and 2008 either.</P>
      <P>"Following such a framework not only is not a sign of weakness, it helps
underline the ROC's sovereignty and subjectivity, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>The topic is sensitive, however, because Ma's predecessors -- Lee Teng-hui and
Chen Shui-bian -- both referred to relations with China as "state-to-state"
relations.</P>
      <P>But in his effort to improve relations with Taiwan's long-time rival, Ma has
backed away from that formula, instead referring consistently to Taiwan and
China as the "two sides" of the Taiwan Strait within the context of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>According to the newspaper report, the Presidential Office press release wrote
that Ma described Taiwan and China as the "two countries" when discussing a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China with
visiting U.S. Representative James Sensenbrenner on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The words "two countries" were later removed from the press release posted on
the Presidential Office Web site and changed to "the two sides," according to
the newspaper.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The agency representing Taiwanese pitcher Chien-ming Wang has confirmed that the
29-year-old right-hander has signed an incentive laden one-year deal to play for
the Washington Nationals.</P>
      <P>In a move described as more of a gamble than a purchase by a Washington
newspaper, the Nationals will pay Wang a guaranteed US$2 million and up to
US$3.2 million in incentives for the 2010 season, according to the agency that
represents him, Octagon Baseball.</P>
      <P>Among the incentives, Wang will receive US$250,000 if he remains on the
Nationals Major League roster for more than 60 consecutive days and another
US$200,000 if he wins the Comeback Player of the Year Award.</P>
      <P>The former New York Yankee will also earn incentives of various magnitudes for
starting between 10 and 27 games in 2010, a tall order considering that Wang is
not expected to start pitching until May.</P>
      <P>The Yankees non-tendered Wang in December after his up-and-down five-year stint
with the club. He won more games than any other big league pitcher (38) between
2006 and 2007, but injuries limited him to 27 appearances over the past two
years.</P>
      <P>In 2009, when he earned US$5 million, Wang was 1-6 with an atrocious 9.64 ERA
before being shut down for the season with a shoulder injury.</P>
      <P>Even prior to the injury, however, Wang's sinker was clearly not as effective as
in the past, tailing sideways rather than darting downward, making it much
easier for batters to hit.</P>
      <P>The Nationals are hoping that his woes were simply the result of Wang not being
in top shape. He suffered a Lisfranc injury to his right foot in July 2008 and
had trouble regaining his fitness level in early 2009 after being told by the
Yankees not to do his typical offseason leg exercises.</P>
      <P>For the Nationals to cash in on their bet, Wang will have to regain his
signature sinker, the one batters have described as like trying to hit a bowling
ball, because without it, the Tainan native has little else in his arsenal that
can trouble Major League hitters.</P>
      <P>Few pitchers in the Nationals organization can match Wang's track record -- a
lifetime record of 55-26 with a 4.16 ERA. But the Taiwanese right-hander will
have to show that he can regain his pitching touch and revive his career after
last year's shoulder surgery if he wants to live up to his advanced billing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Lunar New Year holiday is the most important festival for Chinese across the
world to be reunited with their families. With holiday meals and travel losing
their lure for most of Taiwan's people, the holiday provides a good time for
children to listen to the elder members of their families.</P>
      <P>Many of them went through hard times in their youth, and their experience
offers precious lessons.  The lives of parents or grandparents are mirrors
reflecting the path of their family, their clan and even society as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile for older people to educate younger generations by sharing
their life experiences with them, which will enable younger family members to
learn how to respect the elderly and preserve family traditions. Only a society
in which venerable senior citizens are well respected by the younger generation
can create greater value by handing down its traditions.</P>
      <P>As the life span of Taiwanese men and women reached an average of 75.9 and 82.5,
respectively, in 2009, Taiwan has effectively evolved into an aging society. To
raise the public's awareness of respecting the elderly, the Ministry of
Education has proposed to create a "grandparents day" to serve that end.</P>
      <P>The 19th century poet Lord Alfred Tennyson compared life to an oak tree that
weathers persistent challenges through the four seasons. We should treat our
older family members with the same respect because they are our treasures. (Feb.

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan International Festival's outdoor opening to be postponed</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Friday's outdoor opening show of the 2010 Taiwan International Festival (TIF), a
dance presented by a renowned Spanish contemporary troupe, has been rescheduled
due to the threat of heavy rain.</P>
      <P>The National Theater and Concert Hall (NTCH) announced Thursday that the Sol
Pico Dance Company will present the Asian premiere of "Sirena a la plancha" at 6
p.m. on Feb. 21 rather than on Feb. 19 as was originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>The dance company, a professional contemporary dance group founded in 1994 by
dancer and choreographer Sol Pico, was invited to Taipei by the NTCH for the
Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The show's postponement due to heavy rain in Taipei is rather ironic considering
that it presents the issue of a dwindling water supply in the format of a fable.</P>
      <P>The show is about a woman who transforms herself into a mermaid to save the
world from drought, but is caught by fishermen, sold and lost.</P>
      <P>A giant, representing earth, seduces her, creating a story of impossible love,
according to a description of the show released by NTCH.</P>
      <P>"The focus of the show will be a 9-meter mobile mermaid, a gigantic puppet, and
a stage composed of five mobile platforms, " the NTCH said in its synopsis of
the performance.</P>
      <P>The production made its debut in the summer of 2008 at the ExpoZaragoza 2008,
for which it was commissioned.</P>
      <P>Local audiences will now be able to see the outdoor performance in the main

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day -- Taiwan-U.S.-China relations remain top concern</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/18/10  18:38:40
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Triangular Taiwan-U.S.-China relations will remain a focus of concern in the
Year of the Tiger.</P>
      <P>While receiving visiting James Sensenbrenner, Jr., a member of the U.S. House of
Representatives, Wednesday, President Ma Ying-jeou said progress in cross-Taiwan
Strait relations is closely related to the development of U.S.-Taiwan relations,
citing the significance of U.S. military sales to Taiwan's security and talks
with China.</P>
      <P>Although U.S.-China relations have recently been strained over a U.S. arms sale
to Taiwan and a planned meeting between U.S. President</P>
      <P>Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama, five American warships docked for</P>
      <P>a port call in Hong Kong Wednesday. Beijing's approval of the port</P>
      <P>call may indicate that the Chinese government will not let its</P>
      <P>relations with Washington deteriorate further.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of leading local newspapers' coverage related to the
issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>President Ma told Sensenbrenner during their Wednesday meeting that his
government's efforts to improve relations with China over the past 20 months
have eliminated the possibility of war in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  Ma said,  his government  has employed  similar conciliatory
approaches in other diplomatic arenas, hoping to boost mutual trust and
cooperation with Taiwan's major trading partners, including the United States,
Japan, the European Union and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Stressing that solid Taiwan-U.S. security relations are crucial to cross-strait
reconciliation and engagement, Ma said continued U.S. sale of defnesive weapons
to Taiwan has helped enhance the confidence and sense of security among Taiwan's
government and people in seeking peaceful solutions to cross-strait disputes.
(Feb. 18, 2010)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with the Dalai Lama Feb. 18, despite
China's warning that such a meeting would hurt ties already strained by U.S.
weapons sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama's chief envoy said Tuesday that Obama probably will not make a
public appearance this week with the Tibetan spiritual  leader during a White
House visit that is already infuriating China.</P>
      <P>Briefing reporters Tuesday on the eve of the Dalai Lama's arrival, Lodi Gyari
said Thursday's meeting in the White House between the Nobel Peace laureates,
even if out of the public eye, would be an important boost for Tibet and for the
broader U.S. commitment to human rights.</P>
      <P>A joint appearance by Obama and the Dalai Lama before reporters could make tense
U.S.-China ties even worse and further complicate U.S. efforts to secure Chinese
help in settling North Korean and Iranian nuclear standoffs  and crucial
economic,  military and environmental problems.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, who has met with every U.S. president over the past two decades,
is a recurring needle in U.S.-Chinese ties. China accuses the monk of pushing
for Tibetan independence, which he has denied repeatedly. Any meeting between
the Dalai Lama and a foreign leader is considered by China to be an infringement
of its sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, political analysts said Beijing's approval of the port call by the
USS Nimitz battle group in Hong Kong is an indication that the Chinese
government does not want to let Sino-U.S. relations deteriorate further, which
would hamper cooperation on the global economy and other issues. (Feb. 18, 2010)</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The latest statistics released by the U.S. Treasury Department showed that China
trimmed its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds by US$34.2 billion in December 2009.</P>
      <P>The big drop in China's holdings meant that it was no longer the largest foreign
holder of U.S. government debt, ceding the top spot to Japan.</P>
      <P>Japan increased its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds in December by US$11.5
billion to US$768.8 billion, exceeding China's total of US$755.5 billion.</P>
      <P>China's reductions in holdings, if they continue, could force the U.S.
government to make higher interest payments at a time when it is running record
federal budget deficits.</P>
      <P>Analysts speculated that China's reduction may be a strategy to counter U.S.
pressure on it to raise the value of its currency to reflect its rising economic
might. (Feb. 18, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has a good chance in the Year of the Tiger to take a long leap into a new
era if the government and the people work in concert to make the country's
economy as vibrant as a tiger.</P>
      <P>The much debated economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China is
one of the issues that will have a crucial impact on Taiwan's economy this year.</P>
      <P>We urge the administration to intensify its communications with the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and urge the DPP to take Taiwan's overall
interests into account so that the ECFA can be signed this year as expected.</P>
      <P>After saying goodbye to the Year of the Ox, which was scarred by a global
economic crunch, the world ushers in a much more upbeat Year of the Tiger, with
evident signs of economic recovery around the world, although some hidden risks
still exist.</P>
      <P>One of the risks is the heavy injection of financial assistance from major
economies to countries in need. The cash flows may have helped those countries
tide over their financial difficulties, but they may also lead to the formation
of a new capital bubble that could explode any minute.</P>
      <P>This trend, combined with rising demand for commodities in emerging economies
driving prices higher, could lead countries to wind down economic stimulus
packages and increase uncertainty, putting the world at risk of a second
recession.</P>
      <P>The ASEAN Plus China free trade agreement, which took effect Jan. 1, is also
having an adverse impact on Taiwan's export trade and economic growth.</P>
      <P>But we noticed in the days leading up to the Chinese New Year a different
atmosphere in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>First, the Ministry of National Defense for the first time allowed military
transports to ferry Taiwanese stuck on the outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu
back to Taiwan proper for the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Second, Perng Fai-nan, the governor of Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC)
wrote letters to leading entrepreneurs in the country before the holiday,
promising that the central bank will continue to adopt stimulus measures to help
the private sector.</P>
      <P>These two events underlined  that President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has
become more "active, " giving it a chance to win back the confidence of the
people.</P>
      <P>Third, the government issued NT$304.5 billion worth of new bills in the 10 days
prior to the Chinese New Year's eve, bringing the cumulative amount of currency
in circulation to more than NT$1.5 trillion, a new record high.</P>
      <P>The record issuance of currency signifies that people are willing to spend and
that consumer confidence is recovering.</P>
      <P>Fourth, Taiwan's exports surged in January, with particularly strong growth in
exports to China, indicating that Taiwan's foreign trade will definitely benefit
from China's economic growth, which is forecast to hit 10 percent this year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has emerged from poverty and authoritarian rule with soft power,
Taiwan's former Vice President Annette Lu said here Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing an international leadership conference organized by the Universal
Peace Federation, Lu said Taiwan's soft power lies in its development
experience, human rights, peace, true love, and scientific and technological
development.</P>
      <P>"The ongoing conference is aimed at exploring strategies to promote world peace,
a theme that is closely associated with my longtime conviction of pursuing
growth and development with soft power, " Lu told an audience composed of
politicians, scholars and experts from 67 countries.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan's experience provides a convincing example that soft power as

even more remarkable economic record than Taiwan's in recent years.</P>
      <P>Noting that 2010 is the Year of the Tiger, Lu said she looked forward to seeing

    <TEXT>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan suffered its deepest recession in over 50 years because of the
global financial crunch, with as many as 1.4 million people affected by the
downturn. Despite those economic difficulties, we deeply hope that good luck and
fortune will grace the country in the new year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan posted many historical  lows in 2009.  The economy contracted by 2.53
percent and exports plunged 20.3 percent. Many people were forced to take unpaid
leave and close to 700,000 people were out of work -- a situation far more
serious than the two oil crises in the 1970s and 1980s and the bursting of the
dot.com bubble in 2000.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Taiwan's economy began showing signs of recovery in the fourth
quarter last year, on a par with the global trend. The benchmark weighted index
of the local bourse rose from 4,475 in January to 7,837 by the end of December.</P>
      <P>However, worldwide hopes for a sound recovery have been dampened by the recent
sovereign debt defaults in the euro zone, sending international stock markets,
including Taiwan's, plummeting. Economic uncertainty has again cast a shadow on
the global economy.</P>
      <P>Looking back at world history, we know that economic ups and downs are normal
and that the global economy always seeks to crawl back after hitting bottom.
There is no shortcut for the world economy to return to its peak this time
around. As the Year of Tiger arrives, we wholeheartedly pray that Taiwan's
economy will swiftly regain its momentum, just as we hope for the arrival of
spring that will bring a warm breeze to our humble homes. (Feb. 18, 2010)</P>

      <P>Projects to dredge sediment and silt from Tsengwen Reservoir in Tainan County
and the Gaoping River in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area were launched Thursday in
an effort to complete them before this year's rainy or typhoon season.</P>
      <P>In light of the urgency of reservoir and river cleanup, the Water Resources
Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs launched the dredging projects in
southern Taiwan ahead of the end of the Lunar New Year holiday next Monday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang presided over the launch ceremony
for the Tsengwen Reservoir cleanup project amid chilly winds and a drizzle.</P>
      <P>"We launched the urgent project on this auspicius day in hopes of completing it
smoothly before the arrival of rainy season, " Shih said, referring to the fifth
day of the Lunar New Year when the God of Wealth is welcomed and businesses re-
open.</P>
      <P>Shih said the project aims to remove 600,000 tons of silt and sediment from the
reservoir,  a major source of drinking and irrigation water in the Tainan-Chiayi
area,  one of Taiwan's agricultural strongholds.</P>
      <P>Tsengwen Reservoir can store up to 630 million cubic meters of water, but its
effective storage capacity is now about 490 million cubic meters because of the
massive buildup of silt and mud.</P>
      <P>Since Typhoon Morakot devastated southern Taiwan last August, the region has
been hit by a dry spell. The Tsengwen Reservoir's water level is now at only
201.3 meters, with yellow silt covering its spillways.</P>
      <P>"This provides a good opportunity to get rid of silt and sediment," Shih said.</P>
      <P>According to WRA officials, 65 million cubic meters of silt and sediment will be
dredged from reservoirs and rivers around Taiwan before the typhoon season this
year.</P>
      <P>On Thursday afternoon, Shih traveled to Pingtung County to show concern for
those working there to clean up the Gaoping River. A total of 14.9 million cubic
meters of silt and sediment will be removed from the river before the end of
June. About 8 million cubic meters of silt have so far been cleaned up,
officials said.</P>

global financial crunch, with as many as 1.4 million people affected by the
downturn. Despite those economic difficulties, we deeply hope that good luck and
fortune will grace the country in the new year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan posted many historical  lows in 2009.  The economy contracted by 2.53
percent and exports plunged 20.3 percent. Many people were forced to take unpaid
leave and close to 700,000 people were out of work -- a situation far more
serious than the two oil crises in the 1970s and 1980s and the bursting of the
dot.com bubble in 2000.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Taiwan's economy began showing signs of recovery in the fourth
quarter last year, on a par with the global trend. The benchmark weighted index
of the local bourse rose from 4,475 in January to 7,837 by the end of December.</P>
      <P>However, worldwide hopes for a sound recovery have been dampened by the recent
sovereign debt defaults in the euro zone, sending international stock markets,
including Taiwan's, plummeting. Economic uncertainty has again cast a shadow on
the global economy.</P>
      <P>Looking back at world history, we know that economic ups and downs are normal
and that the global economy always seeks to crawl back after hitting bottom.
There is no shortcut for the world economy to return to its peak this time
around. As the Year of Tiger arrives, we wholeheartedly pray that Taiwan's
economy will swiftly regain its momentum, just as we hope for the arrival of
spring that will bring a warm breeze to our humble homes. (Feb. 18, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Reservoir, river dredging projects launched</HEADLINE>

      <P>Projects to dredge sediment and silt from Tsengwen Reservoir in Tainan County
and the Gaoping River in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area were launched Thursday in
an effort to complete them before this year's rainy or typhoon season.</P>
      <P>In light of the urgency of reservoir and river cleanup, the Water Resources
Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs launched the dredging projects in
southern Taiwan ahead of the end of the Lunar New Year holiday next Monday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang presided over the launch ceremony
for the Tsengwen Reservoir cleanup project amid chilly winds and a drizzle.</P>
      <P>"We launched the urgent project on this auspicius day in hopes of completing it
smoothly before the arrival of rainy season, " Shih said, referring to the fifth
day of the Lunar New Year when the God of Wealth is welcomed and businesses re-
open.</P>
      <P>Shih said the project aims to remove 600,000 tons of silt and sediment from the
reservoir,  a major source of drinking and irrigation water in the Tainan-Chiayi
area,  one of Taiwan's agricultural strongholds.</P>
      <P>Tsengwen Reservoir can store up to 630 million cubic meters of water, but its
effective storage capacity is now about 490 million cubic meters because of the
massive buildup of silt and mud.</P>
      <P>Since Typhoon Morakot devastated southern Taiwan last August, the region has
been hit by a dry spell. The Tsengwen Reservoir's water level is now at only
201.3 meters, with yellow silt covering its spillways.</P>
      <P>"This provides a good opportunity to get rid of silt and sediment," Shih said.</P>
      <P>According to WRA officials, 65 million cubic meters of silt and sediment will be
dredged from reservoirs and rivers around Taiwan before the typhoon season this
year.</P>
      <P>On Thursday afternoon, Shih traveled to Pingtung County to show concern for
those working there to clean up the Gaoping River. A total of 14.9 million cubic
meters of silt and sediment will be removed from the river before the end of
June. About 8 million cubic meters of silt have so far been cleaned up,
officials said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan donated US$280,000 to the Philippine Weather Bureau Thursday to build 15
automatic weather stations on Luzon Island and install relevant facilities as
part of its efforts to expand bilateral meteorological cooperation.</P>
      <P>C.T. Lee, Taiwan's representative to the Philippines, handed over the fund to

the position after Taipei County is upgraded to a special municipality, while
incumbent Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei might be offered a Cabinet position.</P>
      <P>The premier declined to comment, saying he had no relevant information on the

legislator and as magistrate of Taoyuan County, and has contributed greatly to
the Cabinet in his present post.</P>
      <P>Wu also said he believes that both Chu and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will
carefully consider whether to field him as the party's candidate for the mayoral

    <TEXT>
      <P>It will not be a smooth year for the global economy in 2010. With the world's
third-largest free trade zone formed between China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) taking effect Jan. 1, Taiwan's economy will
gradually feel the impact, as the new free trade area accounts for almost 60
percent of Taiwan's export market.</P>
      <P>As an export-oriented country -- in which over 70 percent of the economic growth
comes from trade surplus with China, Taiwan should not ignore its increasing
impact on its economy.</P>
      <P>After implementing some policies that hurt its export processing industries in
2008, the Chinese government has been trying hard to expand its domestic demand
to support its economic growth.</P>
      <P>Its "appliances to the countryside, " "automobiles to the countryside" and
"building materials to the countryside" policies, which were designed to boost
Chinese rural consumption,  have effectively boosted China's consumption and
production.</P>
      <P>The growing orders from China have not only become a magic pill Taiwanese
companies have been seeking, but have also led the whole country to expect more
Chinese purchasing groups to bring more money to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese academic experts recently suggested that the government should
consider distributing another round of shopping coupons to lift the economy.
However, they fail to realize that handing out shopping coupons are much less
effective than the Chinese government's "appliances to the countryside" policy.</P>
      <P>In fact, the government does need to boost its domestic demand to compensate for
its decreasing external demand and it should also be inspired by the Chinese
government's policy.</P>
      <P>We suggest that the government should use around NT$20 billion (US$621 million)
-- about 20 percent of the total budget for distributing shopping coupons -- to
subsidize 20 percent of the cost of providing green energy products such as
smart electrical meters, solar concentrators, and solar heaters in central and
southern Taiwan. This would help generate billions of dollars-worth of
consumption, as well as billions of dollars-worth of production value for small-
and medium-sized enterprises and hundreds of thousands of job opportunities.</P>
      <P>We believe this would definitely boost Taiwan's economy this year and become the
most precious Lunar New Year present from the government to the public.  (Feb.

      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Thursday that he plans to place an advertising
billboard again to "seek his wife's support" and then communicate with the
ruling Kuomintang on his bid to run in the Taichung special municipality mayoral
election to be held later this year.</P>
      <P>Hu disclosed his plan after addressing an audience of some 200 people to share
his experience of governing the city at St. Anthony's College, one of the
constituent colleges of Oxford University.</P>
      <P>Hu did not reply to a question on whether his wife Shao Hsiao-ling has agreed to
support his decision to run for the mayorship, but said he will spend money on
an advertising billboard asking for his wife's consent to run for the post.</P>
      <P>In 2005 when Hu sought re-election, he carried out a similar publicity stunt, a
move that "proved successful."</P>
      <P>According to Hu, his wife is very concerned about his health and does not want
him to become overworked, so he needs to convince her on whether he should run.</P>
      <P>Hu suffered a mild stroke in 2003 while visiting the United States.</P>
      <P>He is the leading KMT candidate for the year-end Taichung special municipality
election and because the five special municipality elections are deemed crucial
for the KMT, he plans to communicate with the party headquarters after he
returns to Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>Asked about KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung's goal of taking at least three
out of five in the special municipality elections, Hu said the KMT stands a good
chance of winning.</P>
      <P>Hu said that if he wins the Taichung race, he will strive to push for the
development of the new municipality that will comprise the financially sound
Taichung City and the debt-strapped Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The mayor  also touted  what he described  as the city's achievements in the

"Miao Miao" by Cheng Hsiao-tse.</P>
      <P>Chen also explained to Kosslick about the Taiwanese government's support for
international film companies seeking to shoot movies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government will not only help films shot in local scenic spots but

      <P>The Washington Nationals of the U.S. Major League Baseball (MLB) is scheduled to
introduce Taiwanese pitcher Chien-ming Wang Saturday in Viera, Florida, the
team's latest addition, according to the MLB Web site.</P>
      <P>A news conference to announce Wang's signing is scheduled to take place at the
Space Coast Stadium, the Nationals announced on its official Web site.</P>
      <P>Octagon Baseball, the agency that represents Wang, confirmed Thursday that the
former New York Yankee agreed to terms with Washington on a one-year, US$2
million contract with an incentive of up to US$3.2 million.</P>
      <P>Nationals pitchers Brian Bruney, Tyler Clippard and Ron Villone, who all played
with Wang in New York, are elated to learn about Wang being a teammate again,
according to the MLB.</P>
      <P>Wang will not be ready for opening day because he is recovering from
arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder. He will not be able to pitch in the
MLB until sometime in May.</P>
      <P>However, his "new ex-teammates" are still confident in Wang, who is known for
his hard sinker and who had a combined 38-13 record with a 3.67 ERA for the
Yankees in 2006 and 2007.</P>
      <P>"I saw him in 2007 at his best. He was contending for a Cy Young Award that
year. He won 19 games in a couple of years. He is a great pitcher... and I am
excited that we signed him, " Clippard was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Bruney, a relief pitcher, said that anyone affiliated with the Nationals or a
fan of the Nationals will be happy about Wang's performance, adding that "I
would like to come in and get the win for him."</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old's signing with Washington has been one of the biggest items of
sports news in Taiwan during the nine-day Lunar New Year break.</P>
      <P>Fans are looking forward to Wang duplicating his peak performance before injury.</P>
      <P>Wang has been plagued by injury in the past two seasons, during which he only
pitched in a combined 27 games. In 2008, he did not pitch after the All-Star
break because of foot problems. This past season, Wang had a shoulder injury and
missed the Yankees' World Series run in October.</P>

      <P>Chinese pro-democracy activist Wang Dan and 20 others have jointly launched a
declaration pushing for an Internet revolution aimed at breaking down barriers
set by the Beijing authorities to restrict online freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>Wang told CNA Friday that he does not encourage the idea of hacking into
government Web sites, but urged people to share technology to bypass
restrictions imposed on Internet access in China.</P>
      <P>He also said that he had yet to see any attack on his Facebook page on account
of the declaration.</P>
      <P>His Facebook page shows a list of supporting signatures from students, media
workers, writers and citizens from Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore, the
United Kingdom, France, Canada and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Wang said he hopes to solicit more support for the revolution and to unite
Chinese online users, who are estimated to exceed 400 million in 2010, according
to the declaration.</P>
      <P>The declaration, posted on Wang's Facebook page Feb. 12, urges people all over
the world to help topple China's "Berlin Wall" that limits access to the
Internet.</P>
      <P>"Blogs, forums or chatrooms... everywhere can be a battlefield, " the

      <P>"The revolution will not succeed overnight, but with persistence over time, it
will shake China's ruling basis, " according to the declaration.</P>
      <P>The activists also blasted the Chinese government for handing down an 11-year
prison term to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.</P>
      <P>"Such a heavy sentence... is calling for a revolution, " the declaration reads.</P>
      <P>"If the blockade of the Internet is stopped, freedom of the press is no longer
restricted, and judicial independence is no longer tampered with, then a
democratic China will be born naturally, " the declaration says.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: The shattered Toyota myth</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The world's largest automaker, Toyota, has recently been plagued by a string of
complaints about the power steering and braking systems of various of their
vehicle models. Denying the problems at first, the company eventually admitted
to the deficiencies and recalled more than 8.5 million vehicles. Besides over
US$2 billion in preliminary  financial  losses,  the incident  has cost Toyota
immeasurable damage to its corporate reputation.</P>
      <P>The way Toyota has dealt with this crisis has exposed a long-standing problem
with Japanese corporate culture: desperation to save face and reluctance to
admit errors. Such an attitude can instead cause problems to snowball,
eventually doing serious harm to corporate images.</P>
      <P>Many businesses in Taiwan also share the same problems. The state-owned
petroleum refiner CPC Corp. and the privately run Formosa Petrochemical were
recently discovered to have overcharged consumers billions of New Taiwan dollars
for air pollution fees and a crude oil fund. The companies have so far not
provided consumers with a clear explanation. It is necessary for the authorities
to get to the bottom of the matter and investigate the responsibilities of
relevant officials.</P>
      <P>Toyota's performance in dealing with its latest crisis has completely shattered
the Toyota myth. Nevertheless, a government that is slow in response can face
even larger crises, because minor problems that are left unhandled can develop
into bigger problems.</P>
      <P>Both the business and government sectors should learn a lesson so as to prevent
repeating the same mistakes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: What else besides a vigorous Year of the Tiger</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/19/10  17:08:38
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When it comes to this year, the Year of the Tiger, the third in a series of 12
Chinese zodiac signs, many people associate it with vigor, strength and power --
the major character traits of tiger -- and hope they will act speedily and
energetically and enjoy booming business throughout the whole year.</P>
      <P>It is common to make wishes at the beginning of the lunar year, so we hereby
wish for world peace, a global economic recovery, peaceful and stable relations
between Taiwan and China to create a win-win situation for both sides, and for
everyone's dreams to come true.</P>
      <P>However, in addition to wishing everyone is as vibrant as a tiger, we also hope
everybody will act like a rabbit, which is considered to be soft and tender,
because if people can make good use of the characteristics of the two animals,
they will be able to grab business opportunities and know how to avoid risks at
the same time.</P>
      <P>The Tiger and the rabbit, the fourth animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese
zodiac, were designed as a pair because they are compatible. The tiger
represents bravery, while the rabbit represents prudence and calmness.</P>
      <P>The compatibility theory of the tiger and rabbit can be applied to relations
between Taiwan and China. For example, China's economy of scale is big but
Taiwan's is small. While Taiwan's advantage lies in its soft power, China's is
in its hard power. If the two sides can complement each other to boost economic
development, it will create a multiplier effect on their economic growth and
benefit the people of both sides.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Taiwan and China have launched direct flights across the
Taiwan Strait and are negotiating on the signing of a proposed cross-strait
comprehensive economic cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>Based on this foundation, if the two sides can enhance their relations further,
they are expected to achieve greater economic performance and to contribute more
to the world in environmental protection,  energy  conservation,  public  health
and epidemic prevention, economic reciprocity, cultural exchanges and disaster
relief efforts.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan and China should also solve their own problems. For instance,
Taiwan should boost local investment, improve the unemployment situation and
strengthen research and development to maintain a competitive edge, while China
should cultivate its soft power to accelerate economic growth. (Feb. 19, 2010)</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will hold a sale in March
offering cultural and creative artifacts, agricultural products and local
delicacies to raise campaign funds for the five special municipality mayoral
elections to be held later this year.</P>
      <P>A DPP campaign vehicle called "Kitty Hawk, " as well as lunch boxes referring to
the name of DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen will be auctioned off during the event,
DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, March is a special month for Taiwanese democracy, as the Wild
Lily student movement of 1990, the 1996 Taiwan missile crisis and the first
direct election of the country's president in 1996, as well as Taiwan's first
political power shift in 2000, all took place during the month.</P>
      <P>The party plans to collaborate with non-government organizations (NGOs) to
organize the market in Taipei City with the aim of promoting local culture and
raising campaign money for the candidates for mayors and councilors in the five
special municipalities, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Kitty Hawk, which travels around the island during election campaigns, will be
decorated as a stage and will be surrounded by tables when the market takes
place, he went on.</P>
      <P>The market place will be divided into several zones, including a cultural and
creative area for selling dough figurines and other handicrafts, and an NGO zone
for books, souvenirs and albums.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese agricultural products zone will feature farm produce from DPP-ruled
cities and counties, including smoked duck from Yilan County, oranges from
Yunlin County and tomatoes from Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a "Made in Taiwan" area will be dedicated to selling clothes, bags,
bedding, towels and other locally made products.</P>
      <P>There will be also an interactive game zone offering various arcade games, as
well as a fund-raising area where the Hsiao Ing lunch boxes will be auctioned.</P>
      <P>Kitty Hawk bicycles, which helped the DPP to score wins in a recent Yunlin
County legislative  by-election  and in Jan.  9 legislative by-elections in
Taichung, Taoyuan, and Taitung counties, will also be auctioned during the sale,

      <P>The number of members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is
expected to sharply decrease by half to 150,000 after the party begins requiring
its members to pay their own membership dues starting from this year, a party
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The party's Central Executive Committee passed a regulation late last year that
prohibits party members paying membership fees on behalf of others, a decision
designed to address the problem of so-called "nominal" party members.</P>
      <P>This creates a situation in which a DPP member pays membership dues for people
who would otherwise not bother joining the party, in order to take control of
their votes and thereby boost his or her influence in party polls.</P>
      <P>The DPP membership fee is NT$300 per person per year, so the party is expected
to lose total membership fee income of about NT$45 million per year.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, head of the DPP's Finance Committee, said that the party is
reviewing several options to make up for the losses, such as increasing the
amount of donation to the party from members selected as government officials,
or raising the portion of subsidies that candidates receive from the government
to be paid to the party.</P>
      <P>In the selection of DPP candidates  running in government elections, party
members' votes account for 30 percent of the total, with public opinion polls
accounting for 70 percent. In the past, however, potential candidates had to
seek support from the nominal party members, which is seen as a distortion of

      <P>For months, the public has been guessing who will represent the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) in the year-end municipality election in New Taipei City, the
name of the soon-to-be upgraded Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Reports have now emerged that Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu will be the KMT's
standard bearer in a fight expected to be against heavyweights from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The reports also say the party will arrange another post for Chou Hsi-wei, the
incumbent Taipei magistrate who has several times expressed his interest in
continuing to head the upgraded county, even though his approval ratings have
often been in the lowest ranks of past surveys.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from leading local newspapers' coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The KMT has decided to ask Chu to run in New Taipei City after Chu led all other
aspirants in several opinion polls conducted by the party.</P>
      <P>Chou, after coordinating with the top brass of the party, has agreed to go along
with the party's mechanism of using opinion polls to decide the party's
candidate. If the polls still show that Chu is ahead, he could be invited to
serve in the Presidential Office or in the Cabinet, according to reports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, because the KMT has had difficulty fielding a strong candidate in
Kaohsiung municipality election, which is a stronghold of the DPP, the ruling
party is not ruling out the possibility of asking Lai Feng-wei, deputy
secretary-general to President Ma Ying-jeou and atwo-term Penghu magistrate
(1997-2005), to represent the party in Kaohsiung, with Chou taking up the post
left by Lai.</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The year-end municipality elections are widely seen as a forerunner of the
presidential election scheduled for 2012, and New Taipei City is expected to be
a major battlefield between the KMT and the DPP.</P>
      <P>If Chu joins the race, it will not only mean an adjustment of the Cabinet lineup
but will also cast uncertainty over the Cabinet's financial policy, which is
currently helmed by Chu.</P>
      <P>United Evening News:</P>
      <P>Ma said Friday that the party's candidate for New Taipei City will be made clear
after the Chinese New Year holiday, which ends on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih was also tight-lipped on the reports Friday, saying only that
Chu has performed excellently in whatever jobs he has been given, whether in the
Legislative Yuan or as Taoyuan magistrate.</P>
      <P>But the DPP's Su Tseng-chang, a former premier and a possible aspirant for New
Taipei City mayor, said that if the KMT wants to give up on Chou, who is an
incumbent and who has the intention of running, then it would be an admittance
that Chou has not performed well.</P>
      <P>If the KMT wants to get someone outside Taipei City and who has expressed no
intention to run, everyone will know that the KMT has only election victory in
mind without considering the interests of New Taipei City. (Feb. 19, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
said Friday that the party's nominee for the year-end New Taipei City mayoral
election will be decided in a couple of months.</P>
      <P>The KMT will field the best candidate to run for the position, Ma told reporters
during a trip to Hsinchu County, amid media reports that Vice Premier Eric
Liluan Chu might be nominated.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the trip was to campaign for Cheng Yung-tang, the KMT's
candidate for the Feb. 27 legislative by-election in the county. Ma also visited
Tienhou Temple in the city of Jhubei and Yungning Temple in Hsinfeng township,
where he gave away red envelopes to visitors to wish them a happy Chinese New
Year.</P>
      <P>At Cheng's campaign rally, Ma told supporters that unity is essential if the
blue camp is to win the by-election.</P>
      <P>He urged voters to cast their votes for Cheng, whom he described as a down-to-
earth, sincere man.</P>
      <P>In response, Cheng's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opponent, Peng Shao-
chin, said he will solidify the people to win the election with his policies and
professionalism.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen visited Taoyuan County to campaign for
Huang Jen-chu, the party's candidate for the Taoyuan legislative by-election,
which is also slated for Feb. 27.</P>
      <P>Besides the polls in Hsinchu and Taoyuan counties, two other legislative by-
elections will also be held that same day in the counties of Hualien and Chiayi.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the by-elections, Tsai said the DPP candidates are fighting a hard
battle because three out of the four regions have support bases that are
predominantly made up of the pro-KMT "pan-blue camp" rather than the DPP's "pan-
green camp."</P>
      <P>Tsai said, however, that she has very high confidence in her party's candidates,
because each of them is very hard-working and has performed excellently in terms
of heeding public opinion and keeping track of current issues.</P>
      <P>She also expressed strong protest at what she described as Ma's use of
government resources to campaign for the KMT's candidates, referring to Ma's
distribution of red envelopes to the public in his capacity as president and
taking advantage of the opportunity to rally support for his party's candidates.</P>
      <P>She noted that Ma has on many occasions insinuated that the DPP candidates have
been involved in irregularities or money politics, and she urged Ma to stop
using such smear tactics to try to manipulate the election outcome.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that the construction of a new highway
connecting Suao in the northeast with Hualien in the east will start by the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>Ma made the promise while stumping in Hualien County in his capacity as ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) chairman for Wang Ting-sheng, the KMT's candidate in the Feb.
27 legislative by-election there.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the government's resolution to improve transport infrastructure in
the county and said the construction will begin later this year if the project
passes an environmental impact assessment. The highway would combine upgrades of
the existing Suao- Hualien highway, with new roads and tunnels circumventing its
most dangerous sections.</P>
      <P>On measures to increase the number of trains operating between Hualien County
and other areas of the country to meet increasing demand during the Chinese New
Year break, Ma gave the credit to Wang, saying that he had suggested increasing
the number of trains serving the county not only during the New Year holiday but
also on ordinary days.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he had noticed the inadequacy of rail transport between Hualien and
the rest of the island since 2008 and added that the problem was significantly
eased after he directed Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-
kuo to come up with a solution.</P>
      <P>Ma also noted that fruit and vegetables from Hualien County should be
transported as quickly as possible to the consumer market in northern Taiwan,
which is why Wang suggested that the government should provide  special  trains
to transport  fresh fruit and vegetables, an issue being studied by the MOTC.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's central bank said Friday that the U.S. Federal Reserve's raising of
discount rates to banks for direct loans the previous day does not represent a
change of its stance on monetary policy but that the central bank will closely
monitor changes to financial markets.</P>
      <P>In a statement on the Fed's move, the central bank quoted the Fed as saying that
the rate hike does not signal any change in the outlook for the economy or
monetary policy and is not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for
households and businesses.</P>
      <P>The dollar leapt and the euro hit a nine-month low Friday after the Fed move,
which came after the U.S. stock market closed. European and Asian shares, as
well as U.S. stock futures, also fell.</P>
      <P>Local fund managers and analysts said the unexpected Fed move might have some
impact on Taiwan's stock market when it resumes trading next Monday after the
Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Jacky Lu, a fund manager of Allianz Global Investors Taiwan Technology Fund,
said that the Fed's rate hike could lead other countries, including Taiwan, to
follow suit.</P>
      <P>However, with the Dow Jones index rising about 300 points and the Nasdaq
advancing 90 points during the holiday period, the impact felt by Taiwanese
shares should be smaller than that felt by U.S. shares, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Dah Chang Securities manager Chang Shih-dun said that as the Fed's move came
during the Chinese New Year holiday and the Taiwan share market's weighted index
experienced a major correction prior to the holiday period, the impact from the
Fed's move might be diluted when the Taiwanese bourse reopens.</P>

      <P>Right after the legislative by-elections slated for Feb. 27, the year-end
elections for the five special municipalities will become the main show that
will last until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The five municipalities to be formed will push changes in the internal power
structure within the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) as well as in the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The future heads of the municipalities will naturally become heavyweights within
their respective parties, but whether this increased number of top brass will be
good for the parties' integration or will cause further factionalism has yet to
be seen.</P>
      <P>One thing is sure, however: The power struggle within the parties will be
fiercer and the changes in Taiwan's political scene will become more
unpredictable.</P>
      <P>With each party fielding  its best and brightest  in the municipality elections,
it also underscores the fact that there is a dearth of talent within both the
major parties.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu is reported to be the KMT's candidate of choice in

DPP, possibly ex-Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu is the KMT's best bet among the five municipality
elections, but if he agrees to run, he will lose an opportunity to serve a more
suitable or more important job.</P>
      <P>There will be new sights and sounds throughout 2010 due to the elections and
with 2011 ushering in the beginning of the 2012 presidential  election,  we are

      <P>United Evening News:</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih was also tight-lipped on the reports Friday, saying only that
Chu has performed excellently in whatever jobs he has been given, whether in the
Legislative Yuan or as Taoyuan magistrate.</P>
      <P>But the DPP's Su Tseng-chang, a former premier and a possible aspirant for New
Taipei City mayor, said that if the KMT wants to give up on Chou, who is an
incumbent and who has the intention of running, then it would be an admittance
that Chou has not performed well.</P>
      <P>If the KMT wants to get someone outside Taipei City and who has expressed no

    <HEADLINE>KMT's nominee for New Taipei City mayoral race to be decided soon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
said Friday that the party's nominee for the year-end New Taipei City mayoral
election will be decided in a couple of months.</P>
      <P>The KMT will field the best candidate to run for the position, Ma told reporters
during a trip to Hsinchu County, amid media reports that Vice Premier Eric
Liluan Chu might be nominated.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the trip was to campaign for Cheng Yung-tang, the KMT's
candidate for the Feb. 27 legislative by-election in the county. Ma also visited
Tienhou Temple in the city of Jhubei and Yungning Temple in Hsinfeng township,
where he gave away red envelopes to visitors to wish them a happy Chinese New
Year.</P>
      <P>At Cheng's campaign rally, Ma told supporters that unity is essential if the
blue camp is to win the by-election.</P>
      <P>He urged voters to cast their votes for Cheng, whom he described as a down-to-
earth, sincere man.</P>
      <P>In response, Cheng's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opponent, Peng Shao-
chin, said he will solidify the people to win the election with his policies and
professionalism.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen visited Taoyuan County to campaign for
Huang Jen-chu, the party's candidate for the Taoyuan legislative by-election,
which is also slated for Feb. 27.</P>
      <P>Besides the polls in Hsinchu and Taoyuan counties, two other legislative by-
elections will also be held that same day in the counties of Hualien and Chiayi.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the by-elections, Tsai said the DPP candidates are fighting a hard
battle because three out of the four regions have support bases that are
predominantly made up of the pro-KMT "pan-blue camp" rather than the DPP's "pan-
green camp."</P>
      <P>Tsai said, however, that she has very high confidence in her party's candidates,
because each of them is very hard-working and has performed excellently in terms
of heeding public opinion and keeping track of current issues.</P>
      <P>She also expressed strong protest at what she described as Ma's use of
government resources to campaign for the KMT's candidates, referring to Ma's
distribution of red envelopes to the public in his capacity as president and
taking advantage of the opportunity to rally support for his party's candidates.</P>
      <P>She noted that Ma has on many occasions insinuated that the DPP candidates have
been involved in irregularities or money politics, and she urged Ma to stop
using such smear tactics to try to manipulate the election outcome.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that the construction of a new highway
connecting Suao in the northeast with Hualien in the east will start by the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>Ma made the promise while stumping in Hualien County in his capacity as ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) chairman for Wang Ting-sheng, the KMT's candidate in the Feb.
27 legislative by-election there.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the government's resolution to improve transport infrastructure in
the county and said the construction will begin later this year if the project
passes an environmental impact assessment. The highway would combine upgrades of
the existing Suao- Hualien highway, with new roads and tunnels circumventing its
most dangerous sections.</P>
      <P>On measures to increase the number of trains operating between Hualien County
and other areas of the country to meet increasing demand during the Chinese New
Year break, Ma gave the credit to Wang, saying that he had suggested increasing
the number of trains serving the county not only during the New Year holiday but
also on ordinary days.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he had noticed the inadequacy of rail transport between Hualien and
the rest of the island since 2008 and added that the problem was significantly
eased after he directed Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-
kuo to come up with a solution.</P>
      <P>Ma also noted that fruit and vegetables from Hualien County should be
transported as quickly as possible to the consumer market in northern Taiwan,
which is why Wang suggested that the government should provide  special  trains
to transport  fresh fruit and vegetables, an issue being studied by the MOTC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank said Friday that the U.S. Federal Reserve's raising of
discount rates to banks for direct loans the previous day does not represent a
change of its stance on monetary policy but that the central bank will closely
monitor changes to financial markets.</P>
      <P>In a statement on the Fed's move, the central bank quoted the Fed as saying that
the rate hike does not signal any change in the outlook for the economy or
monetary policy and is not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for
households and businesses.</P>
      <P>The dollar leapt and the euro hit a nine-month low Friday after the Fed move,
which came after the U.S. stock market closed. European and Asian shares, as
well as U.S. stock futures, also fell.</P>
      <P>Local fund managers and analysts said the unexpected Fed move might have some
impact on Taiwan's stock market when it resumes trading next Monday after the
Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Jacky Lu, a fund manager of Allianz Global Investors Taiwan Technology Fund,
said that the Fed's rate hike could lead other countries, including Taiwan, to
follow suit.</P>
      <P>However, with the Dow Jones index rising about 300 points and the Nasdaq
advancing 90 points during the holiday period, the impact felt by Taiwanese
shares should be smaller than that felt by U.S. shares, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Dah Chang Securities manager Chang Shih-dun said that as the Fed's move came
during the Chinese New Year holiday and the Taiwan share market's weighted index
experienced a major correction prior to the holiday period, the impact from the
Fed's move might be diluted when the Taiwanese bourse reopens.</P>

      <P>Right after the legislative by-elections slated for Feb. 27, the year-end
elections for the five special municipalities will become the main show that
will last until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The five municipalities to be formed will push changes in the internal power
structure within the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) as well as in the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The future heads of the municipalities will naturally become heavyweights within
their respective parties, but whether this increased number of top brass will be
good for the parties' integration or will cause further factionalism has yet to
be seen.</P>
      <P>One thing is sure, however: The power struggle within the parties will be
fiercer and the changes in Taiwan's political scene will become more
unpredictable.</P>
      <P>With each party fielding  its best and brightest  in the municipality elections,
it also underscores the fact that there is a dearth of talent within both the
major parties.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu is reported to be the KMT's candidate of choice in
the New Taipei City election, where he will face a strong candidate from the
DPP, possibly ex-Premier Su Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu is the KMT's best bet among the five municipality
elections, but if he agrees to run, he will lose an opportunity to serve a more
suitable or more important job.</P>
      <P>There will be new sights and sounds throughout 2010 due to the elections and
with 2011 ushering in the beginning of the 2012 presidential  election,  we are
worried  that chaos might  be unavoidable.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has held elections every year in recent years, and chaos has persisted.
We need to think deeply about this for the future of the country.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih hinted at a moderate reshuffle to his Cabinet some time after
the New Year, or in February. We are still waiting to see a change in the
administration team.</P>
      <P>Whether or not the Presidential Office and Executive Yuan can put together an

to improving the government's image and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Wu took over the premiership amid chaos last August when Typhoon Morakot
devastated southern Taiwan and the previous premier was forced to step down. The
team he hastily cobbled together have not stood the test of time. We now have a
Cabinet full of ministers so lacking in initiative. Many people do not even know
the names of many ministers after months they have been in office.</P>
      <P>Being a man of high intelligence, Wu must have noticed that there are problems
within  his cabinet.  The heads of governmental departments should be out in
front defending government policies and explaining them to the people. Instead,
there are those in the Cabinet who still have no idea of their role.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial Times: Urban regeneration needs fresh ideas</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/20/10  15:37:17
(Feb. 20, 2010)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It's been almost twelve years since Taiwan implemented its urban regeneration
policies. In that time, the policies have done little to help regenerate cities
or improve urban living environment. Instead, they have inadvertently  caused
real estate  price inflation, especially in older, low-rise buildings in the
cities. This is an unreasonable state of affairs that the government must work
to resolve.</P>
      <P>The Urban Redevelopment Act passed in 1998. In Taipei City, 322 projects have
been submitted for approval, but only 76 have been approved. In Taipei County,
only 96 projects out of 330 submitted have been approved. Each approved project
took an average of 7.7 years to complete.</P>
      <P>Why has the Urban Redevelopment Act been so ineffective?</P>
      <P>The first hurdle is the difficulty in reaching consensus among property owners.
According to the act, the minimum area required for urban regeneration is 1,000
square meters. Since property is owned in such small parcels in the cities,
dozens of owners might have to give their approval for a redevelopment project
to go ahead.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there are frequently conflicts of interest between the property owners
and the developers. Owners usually expect to get larger and better units after
the project, putting them against developers who want to enjoy higher profits.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the urban renewal incentives do not meet the existing owners' needs.
Under current urban redevelopment laws, the owners might actually get smaller
housing units after the conversion.</P>
      <P>Fourth, the appraisal process is unfair to property owners. Under current
regulation, the developers gets to decide the appraisal date, which is used for
determining the value of the property. Developers also have the right to select
which property appraisers to use. With housing prices changing so fast and the
review period for the project so long, this is often a cause of dispute between
owners and developers.</P>
      <P>To resolve these issues, it is necessary to revise the Urban Redevelopment Act
and related regulation. The government should raise the incentive for land
owners, correct the bias towards developers, and most importantly, raise the
legal floor area ratio. This will increase the amount of housing available and
drive down the overheated real estate market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu seems set to represent the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
in the upcoming New Taipei City mayoral elections. "New Taipei City" will be the
new name of Taipei County when it is upgraded to a special municipality directly
under the central government.</P>
      <P>In his capacity as KMT Chairman, President Ma Ying-jeou promised Friday that
"the KMT will nominate the best candidate and will not let the public wait for
too long." Ma said he will decide the party's nominee for New Taipei City a
month or two after the Lunar New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>The New Taipei City is the key battlefield for the KMT and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the five special municipality elections.
Both parties are expected to field their strongest candidates because the
outcome of the elections is seen as a bellwether to the 2012 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the coverage of leading local newspapers on this
issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Chu, who is currently vacationing overseas, is expected to announce his
intention to run in the New Taipei City elections after he resumes work Monday.</P>
      <P>A source said that after the KMT's lackluster performance in the Dec. 5 local
elections, Chu told President Ma Ying-jeou that he had no intention to run in
the municipal elections. However, since that time the two have met and talked on
numerous occasions. "Although they never touched upon the topic of the election,
" said the source, "Chu has probably read between the lines."</P>
      <P>The source said that Chu has not entirely ruled out the possibility of running.
"He knows well that if Ma asks him to run, he has no room for rejection."</P>
      <P>Chu has been leading in the opinion polls conducted by the KMT. However, since
Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei is seeking re-election, Chu cannot
announce his intentions until Ma has paved the way by negotiating with Chou.</P>
      <P>The source said Chou has been sporting and unselfish in agreeing to go along
with the party's decision to use polls to decide the candidate, thus avoiding a
primary. Both Chou and Chu know that the KMT can only prevail in the five
municipalities elections through solidarity. (Feb. 20, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ex-premier Su Tseng-chang,  widely seen as the likely DPP candidate in the 2012
presidential elections, was asked Friday if he will join the upcoming municipal
elections.</P>
      <P>Su said that he is still "in the stage of listening to the public will, " and
that it is not yet time to decide "whether and where to run."</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local TV station, Su thanked his supporters for
encouraging him to run, describing himself as a "public property."</P>
      <P>"When the country and our society needs me, I will devote myself to the task,"
said Su, adding "I have no right to choose if I want to run."</P>
      <P>Su refrained from saying whether he will run for the 2012 presidential election
or join the municipal elections first, saying that he will listen to the public
for their opinions first.</P>
      <P>But he added that most within the DPP believe in taking on one challenge at a
time, and that the party should focus on the Feb. 27 legislative by-elections
and then the year-end municipality elections before thinking about the
presidential election in 2012. (Feb. 19, 2012)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:  Former Premier and two-term  Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-
chang said if the KMT nominates Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu for the New Taipei
City mayoral election, then it is "giving up" on the incumbent Taipei County
Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei.</P>
      <P>This is tantamount, argues Su, to admitting that Chou is doing so badly that the
KMT has to find another candidate, even someone from outside Taipei County and
has no intention of joining the race.</P>
      <P>Su said the decision is driven purely by political consideration rather than in
the interest of Taipei County. enditem/ao</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) is under investigation for possible
improprieties in a number of its projects, including one that has been blamed
for the landslides that buried a village in Kaohsiung County during Typhoon
Morakot, a source in the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme
Prosecutors' Office said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Almost 500 Siaolin residents were buried by massive mudslides triggered by the
typhoon, which dumped more than 1,800 millimeters of rain on the area over three
days.</P>
      <P>Some survivors have suggested that explosions set off to excavate a tunnel for
the Tsengwen Reservoir water diversion project weakened the stability of the
terrain around the village, contributing to the severity of the mudslides.</P>
      <P>However, a report released on Feb. 1 by the Cabinet-level Public Construction
Commission (PCC) ruled out that possibility and instead attributed the tragedy
to the massive rainfall,  a conclusion survivors have been unwilling to accept.</P>
      <P>Investigators have now decided to look into the process of how public water
resource projects have been commissioned to private contractors over the past
decade, prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, the former director-general of the WRA, resigned last September
amid reports accusing him of having improper relations with contractors,
especially in his role as the decision- maker of the Tsengwen Reservoir water
diversion project, allegations he has denied.</P>
      <P>Investigators have asked the WRA, PCC, and city and county governments for
documents related to water project tenders going back as far as 10 years,
including for projects worth NT$360 billion tendered out over the six years that
Chen led the agency.</P>
      <P>According to the source in the Special Investigation Division, investigators may
summon ranking WRA officials and former Director- General Chen for questioning
after the Lunar New Year holiday. (by Lin Chang-shun and Lillian Lin)/ls</P>

      <P>This is the first Chinese New Year after direct cross-Strait flight links were
re-established and Chinese tourists are allowed to visit Taiwan. A few days
before the New Year, the rumor was that the number of Chinese tourists  fell
short of expectations.  Some politicians took the opportunity to complain that
expectations raised by lifting the ban on Chinese tourists have not been
fulfilled.</P>
      <P>A few days later, the Tourism Bureau unexpectedly warned travel agencies not to
book more Chinese tour groups unless they have confirmed hotel and bus
reservations already. That means there were actually so many Chinese traveling
to Taiwan that they were stretching capacity.</P>
      <P>The same politicians who were mocking Beijing for not delivering enough Chinese
tourists to Taiwan are now complaining that Beijing is seeking to bribe the
people of Taiwan with tourism dollars. It seems some people will never be happy
on this issue one way or another.</P>
      <P>Even worse, it looks like most people assume that the number of Chinese tourist
in Taiwan is solely dependent on political factors. But instead of looking to
Beijing to bring more Chinese tourists, Taiwan should put more effort into
raising the quality of the travel industry so that Chinese tourists would
actually want to visit Taiwan.</P>

agreement (ECFA) or dealing with Chinese buyers, Taiwan should be working hard
to provide competitive deals to the Chinese. Relying on Beijing to take care of
us in return for political gains will only lead to horrible outcomes.</P>
      <P>We can use roses as a metaphor for cross-strait relations. If we count on
political maneuvers in dealing with the Chinese, we will inevitably  be hurt  by
the thorns.  If we improve  our own competitiveness and deal with the Chinese on
the basis of our talents, then cross-strait relation would smell like roses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cold fronts and big waves have kept fishermen on the Penghu archipelago ashore
during the Lunar New Year holiday, but the time off has not been a complete
loss, as some fishermen in the island county have had strong harvests of
seaweed.</P>
      <P>According to islanders, seaweed grows bigger and better in cold weather.</P>
      <P>Penghu laver, an edible seaweed, is quite popular and sold at relatively high
prices in Taiwan's retail markets, because it is harvested from the unpolluted
waters surrounding the islands, the county's fishermen said.</P>
      <P>However, making money from laver may not be as easy as many people think because
the seaweed requires a number of processing steps, from cleaning and drying to
packaging, before it can be brought to market, the fishermen said.</P>
      <P>Aside from shipping the seaweed to Taiwan, the fishermen have also done a brisk
business at home on Kupo Island in the northern part of the archipelago.</P>
      <P>The island, which is abundant in the high-value laver, is open to the public
during the Lunar New Year holiday, and over the past few days, hundreds of
islanders and vacationers have made trips to Kupo to pick the prized seaweed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Employment prospects in 2010</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou wished the people of Taiwan a prosperous Year of the
Tiger in his Lunar New Year greeting. In particular, he said he hoped that
"everyone in the country has a job" in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Fighting unemployment is obviously the government's top priority this year.
632,000 people in this country are officially unemployed. An additional  694,000
are jobless but not actively  seeking employment. There are fewer and fewer
employment opportunities. What's more, many of those without jobs do not have
the right skills for today's employment marketplace.</P>
      <P>Using 2007 numbers as a baseline, the number of jobs in Taiwan actually
increased by 3,000 by the end of 2009. However, this includes a net growth of
53,000 workers in the administrative services sector, thanks in part to the
government's employment incentive program.</P>
      <P>However, in that time, the manufacturing sector lost 87,000 jobs, the
construction sector lost 70,000 jobs and the wholesale and retail sector lost
30,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>The number of people working for the hospitality and food service sector
increased by 38,000 from 2007 to 2009. The medical and healthcare sector grew by
30,000 workers. The financial insurance sector grew by 19,000 workers.</P>
      <P>After the global financial crisis, it seems different industries now have
different personnel needs. The fact that Taiwan's wholesale and retail sector
lost ground both on sales and the number of workers signals that the sector has
come to a turning point.</P>
      <P>Uni-President, the conglomerate that operates 7-11 stores in Taiwan, changed its
strategy from opening as many new stores as possible to trying to maximize the
value of each individual store. This is a part of the general trend in Taiwan's
wholesale and retail sector to focus on adding value rather than expansion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the productivity  of the electronic  parts and components
manufacturing sector has been growing after the global financial storm even as
the sector shed workers.</P>
      <P>It looks like Taiwan needs a bold and creative employment policy going forward
in order to create new jobs in this new economy. The medical, health care and
social services sector is probably the best place for the government to start
creating jobs.</P>

      <P>The National Pension Fund could reach NT$100 billion by 2011 according to the
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Saturday that as of the end of the 2009, the fund reached
NT$65.8 billion and its scale is expected to expand to NT$87.6 billion by the
end of this year.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that since the national pension system was put into effect on
Oct. 1, 2008, the system covered an estimated 4.1 million people, including the
jobless, street vendors, housekeepers, naturalized foreign spouses and students
older than 25. 1.03 million people have claimed a total of NT$ 40.1 billion from
the fund thus far, the ministry added.</P>
      <P>The ministry said about 60 percent of those eligible for the National Pension
Fund pays their premiums. This is on par with Japan and South Korea. The
ministry said they are hoping to convince more people to join the system in
order to consolidate Taiwan's social security network.</P>
      <P>The national pension system is open to anyone with household registration in
Taiwan aged between 25 and 65 who is not covered by other social welfare
insurance such as farmer's health insurance, government employee insurance,
insurance for military personnel and labor insurance.</P>
      <P>Those insured must pay 60 percent of the premium, while the government will pay
the remaining 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, an insured person who pays a monthly premium of NT$674
for 40 years will receive NT$8,986 every month from the age of 65 -- the
standard retirement threshold -- until death.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>To Peter Morehead, cooking a meal does not require the use of natural gas.
Sunlight is good enough.</P>
      <P>Morehead, who first came to Taiwan in 1990 from Wisconsin as an exchange
student, has been teaching local residents how to cook with what he calls a
"solar cooker."</P>
      <P>The solar cooker can be as simple as a small paper box covered in aluminum foil.
One can put a black pot in the middle of the box, and the sunlight's reflection
off the aluminum foil will create enough heat to cook the food in the pot.</P>
      <P>"People should make good use of energy," he told the Central News Agency during
a recent interview. "Never waste energy."</P>
      <P>On cloudy days, Morehead uses what he calls his "rocket broiler" instead. Made
of iron cans, the broiler relies on the burning of small branches and twigs that
can generate high heat in a short time, and the contraption does not release
smoke if handled properly.</P>
      <P>In addition to passing on tips on how to use natural energy, Morehead has also
been promoting the concept of being an urban farmer.</P>
      <P>On Earth Day in 2008, he taught people how to grow corn or pumpkins in the
square outside the National Taiwan Museum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Growing edible plants can both beautify the environment and reduce pollution
caused by the transporting of food, according to the environmentalist.</P>
      <P>Morehead,  a space-planning expert, believes that vegetable gardens can be set
up between city buildings or on rooftops in Taiwan's densely populated urban
areas.</P>
      <P>"There must be space that can be used, " he said in fluent Mandarin.</P>
      <P>Morehead began raising the public's awareness on conserving energy in 2000. Five
years ago, he and his wife established a dedicated  studio  to educate  the
public  about  leading  an environmentally friendly life.</P>
      <P>They named the studio "Earth Passengers" to convey the idea that Earth is like a
spacecraft circling the sun, with humans mere travelers along for the ride.</P>
      <P>"Humans are not the controllers of the Earth. Instead, they should live in
harmony with other living creatures, " Morehead said.</P>

      <P>With the domestic online game market becoming increasingly saturated, Taiwan's
online game companies are starting to focus on expanding to China and seeking

      <P>Chinese Gamer International, a leading online game developer and the first game

      <P>The application fee for the ePassports will be increased to NT$1,600 starting
March 1, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.</P>
      <P>It currently costs NT$1,200 to apply for an ePassport. It was scheduled to be
increased by NT$400 to reflect higher production costs on Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>But due to the rising number of applications at the end of last year, the

      <P>According to the ministry, the number of applications for the ePassport has

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling and main opposition parties wasted no time during the nine-day
Lunar New Year break to make a final push for the four legislative by-elections
that will take place next Saturday, races that both parties see as must-wins.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
spent his holiday campaigning for KMT candidates in the four electoral districts
at stake, desperate to reverse a slump that has seen the party lose all three
legislative by-elections on Jan. 9 and perform poorly in county and city
government elections on Dec. 5, 2009.</P>
      <P>The latest polls suggest it will not be an easy task because opposition
Democratic Progressive Party candidates are running strong in the four electoral
districts, in Taoyuan, Chiayi, Hsinchu, and Hualien counties, and the KMT is
split in two of them.</P>
      <P>Yet DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who was also on the campaign trail in the four
areas during the New Year's break, said the elections will be "a tough battle"
because three of the four districts have been traditional KMT strongholds.</P>
      <P>But the DPP has momentum on its side, fueled by the government's low approval
ratings.</P>
      <P>The DPP won the three seats contested in Taoyuan, Taichung and Taitung counties
last month to boost its seat total in the Legislative Yuan to 30, more than the
one-quarter of the body's 113 seats needed to be able to launch motions to amend
the Constitution or recall the president.</P>
      <P>Another sweep Feb. 27 would further boost its status after it suffered
humiliating defeats in the 2008 legislative and presidential elections and would
put it in prime position for the five special municipality elections to be
contested late this year.</P>
      <P>Ma and  his  right-hand  man  King  Pu-tsung,  the  KMT's secretary-general,
have stressed in rallies how critical  the by-elections are for the party.
Regardless of the outcome, the KMT will still control a healthy majority in the
legislature, but it clearly wants some electoral success to boost its flagging
confidence ahead of the end-of-year mayoral races.</P>
      <P>They have also stressed the importance of "consolidation, " especially needed in
Taoyuan and Hualien counties, where several KMT members have entered the
contests as independent candidates and could draw support away from the party's
official nominees.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan, KMT candidate Apollo Chen faces DPP rival Huan Jen-shu and two
former KMT memebers, Lin Siang-mei and Wu Yu-tung.</P>
      <P>In Hualien, KMT candidate Wang Ting-sheng not only has to face the DPP's Hsiao
Bi-khim, who has no connection to the eastern county but has made great strides
since the campaign began.</P>
      <P>He also must deal with the challenge from Shih Sheng-lan, a former KMT member
entered as an independent who has the backing of incumbent Hualien County
Magistrate Fu Kun-chi.</P>
      <P>Fu, also a former KMT member, won the race for county magistrate in December
with 56 percent of the vote as an independent against two other candidates, one
of them the KMTzs official nominee.  In the Chiayi County race, DPP candidate
Chen Ming-wen enjoys an advantage as the southern county's previous magistrate
and its traditional status as a DPP stronghold. But the KMT said last week its
candidate Lin Teh-jui has pulled even.</P>
      <P>According to the National Cheng Chi University's Swarchy market prediction Web
site (http: //nccu.swarchy.org) , which uses a stock market mechanism for
members to predict results of future events and has enjoyed relative success in
predicting Taiwan's election outcomes in the past, the DPP is ahead in three of
four races being contested.</P>

legislative by-elections on Jan. 9 and perform poorly in county and city
government elections on Dec. 5, 2009.</P>
      <P>The latest polls suggest it will not be an easy task because opposition
Democratic Progressive Party candidates are running strong in the four electoral
districts, in Taoyuan, Chiayi, Hsinchu, and Hualien counties, and the KMT is
split in two of them.</P>
      <P>Yet DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who was also on the campaign trail in the four
areas during the New Year's break, said the elections will be "a tough battle"
because three of the four districts have been traditional KMT strongholds.</P>
      <P>But the DPP has momentum on its side, fueled by the government's low approval
ratings.</P>
      <P>The DPP won the three seats contested in Taoyuan, Taichung and Taitung counties
last month to boost its seat total in the Legislative Yuan to 30, more than the
one-quarter of the body's 113 seats needed to be able to launch motions to amend
the Constitution or recall the president.</P>
      <P>Another sweep Feb. 27 would further boost its status after it suffered
humiliating defeats in the 2008 legislative and presidential elections and would
put it in prime position for the five special municipality elections to be
contested late this year.</P>
      <P>Ma and  his  right-hand  man  King  Pu-tsung,  the  KMT's secretary-general,
have stressed in rallies how critical  the by-elections are for the party.
Regardless of the outcome, the KMT will still control a healthy majority in the
legislature, but it clearly wants some electoral success to boost its flagging
confidence ahead of the end-of-year mayoral races.</P>
      <P>They have also stressed the importance of "consolidation, " especially needed in
Taoyuan and Hualien counties, where several KMT members have entered the
contests as independent candidates and could draw support away from the party's
official nominees.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan, KMT candidate Apollo Chen faces DPP rival Huan Jen-shu and two
former KMT memebers, Lin Siang-mei and Wu Yu-tung.</P>
      <P>In Hualien, KMT candidate Wang Ting-sheng not only has to face the DPP's Hsiao
Bi-khim, who has no connection to the eastern county but has made great strides
since the campaign began.</P>
      <P>He also must deal with the challenge from Shih Sheng-lan, a former KMT member
entered as an independent who has the backing of incumbent Hualien County
Magistrate Fu Kun-chi.</P>
      <P>Fu, also a former KMT member, won the race for county magistrate in December
with 56 percent of the vote as an independent against two other candidates, one
of them the KMTzs official nominee.  In the Chiayi County race, DPP candidate
Chen Ming-wen enjoys an advantage as the southern county's previous magistrate
and its traditional status as a DPP stronghold. But the KMT said last week its
candidate Lin Teh-jui has pulled even.</P>
      <P>According to the National Cheng Chi University's Swarchy market prediction Web
site (http: //nccu.swarchy.org) , which uses a stock market mechanism for
members to predict results of future events and has enjoyed relative success in
predicting Taiwan's election outcomes in the past, the DPP is ahead in three of
four races being contested.</P>

Bureau set the target of 1.2 million visits from Chinese nationals this year,
higher than the target of 1.1 million for Japanese visitors.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the Japanese remains the largest group of foreign visitors. But the
number of Japanese visitors fell 7.92 percent in 2009 to 1,000,661. Japanese
tourist numbers, however, were down by only 1.76 percent.</P>

      <P>"Au Revoir, Taipei, " a romantic comedy featuring Taipei City, won the Network
for the Promotion of Asian Cinema (NETPAC) Prize at the Berlin International
Film Festival 2010 Saturday, beating 11 other Asian entries.</P>
      <P>The love story, which takes place over the course of one evening in Taipei City,
was produced by German director/producer Wim Wenders and directed by budding
Asian-American director Arvin Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen is no stranger to the Berlin film festival. He won a Silver Berlin Bear-
Jury Grand Prix for Short Films for a short he made titled "May" in 2007.</P>
      <P>"Au Revoir, Taipei," stars talented actors including singer Amber Kuo,  Jack
Yao,  Joseph  Chang  and Lawrence  Ko,  and is a laughter-provoking film that
screened to a full audience and won loud applause in Berlin.</P>
      <P>Yao received the NETPAC prize on behalf of the film. "Je t'aime Berlin! " he
exclaimed on the podium, his use of French accentuating the movie's title.</P>
      <P>Frank J.K.  Chen,  director of the Motion Picture Affairs Department under the
Cabinet-level Government Information Office (GIO) , conveyed the government's
congratulations to Arvin Chen Saturday over the honor.</P>
      <P>By winning the top award of NETPAC, which is an alliance of the Berlin film
festival organizers, "Au Revoir, Taipei" now has the opportunity of winning a
prize of NT$1.5 million awarded by the GIO.</P>
      <P>Another Taiwanese movie, "Monga, " which has enjoyed huge box office success in

      <P>Various Taipei features, including the MRT system, the night markets and the

    <HEADLINE>E-toll collection saved NT$600 million last year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
02/21/10  15:52:44

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than NT$600 million (US$18.75 million) was saved in energy conservation and
carbon emissions reductions in 2009 thanks to the use of an electronic toll
collection (ETC) system on the country's freeways, the Taiwan Area National
Freeway Bureau announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>Under the existing manual toll collection system, vehicles are required to stop
or slow down to pay tolls before speeding up again, which results in a waste of
time and energy, as well as an increase in vehicle operating expenses, the
bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said.</P>
      <P>The bureau plans to implement a total ETC system on freeways by the end of 2012,
as the system allows motorists to pay toll charges electronically without having
to slow down to pass through a toll booth, therefore helping to save energy.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by the bureau, the number of small cars and large
vehicles using the ETC system reached 175,674,173 last year,  which means around
3.294 million hours were saved for motorists, along with around 3.45 million
liters in fuel consumption.</P>
      <P>The use of the system also contributed to a cut of 8,525 metric tons in carbon
dioxide emissions last year, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>As the biggest source of carbon emissions in Taiwan is the road transport
sector, the higher the number of ETC users, the higher the volume of emission
reductions can be expected, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>The system can also save the paper and printing costs of toll ticket books. Last
year, about NT$23.79 million was saved in this area.</P>
      <P>In addition, the system also contributed to total time savings worth NT$487.36
million,  savings of NT$86.84 million in fuel consumption and NT$8.98 million in
carbon emission reductions, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>However, the ETC usage rate is still low in Taiwan at only 36 percent of freeway
users since the system was introduced four years ago, because users have to buy
on-board ETC units at their own expense. At present, the price for the
installation of an ETC unit is NT$1,199.</P>
      <P>To reach the government's goal of boosting the usage rate to 65 percent by 2012,
Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collection Co., which was commissioned to set up the
ETC service, suggested that the government should offer a 20 percent toll
discount for ETC users.</P>

      <P>Chinese leaders usually do not spend the Lunar New Year holiday at home and
traditionally travel elsewhere in the country to celebrate the festival along
with local communist party cadres and the public.</P>
      <P>The selection of the places where top Chinese leaders spend their New Year
holiday tend to carry policy implications or epitomize China's new work
direction.</P>
      <P>Judging from Chinese President Hu Jintao's choice of three Fujian Province
cities adjacent to Taiwan -- Lungyen, Zhangzhou and Xiamen, the Beijing
government's intention to further promote cross-Taiwan Strait relations during
the Year of the Tiger is unmistakably evident.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy is that Hu said while visiting a special park designated for
Taiwanese agricultural investors to operate farms or ranches that the Chinese
government will do "whatever will benefit the vast majority of the Taiwanese
people" and will never back off from this promise.</P>
      <P>Hu further said China will keep in mind the interests of the people of Taiwan,
particularly farmers, in its negotiations with Taiwan on the proposed cross-
strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Hu's remarks were clearly targeting ordinary Taiwanese people. To show his
concern for Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, Hu also inspected a wharf
in Xiamen where some Taiwanese people embarked on direct sailings to Taiwan via
Kinmen or Matzu. He also attended a fireworks display co-sponsored for the first
time by Kinmen and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The moves were aimed at getting into closer contact with grassroots Taiwanese
people, and Hu's main appeal focused on "economy and livelihood."</P>
      <P>Hu's goal is actually in compliance with Taiwan's current emphasis on "main
street economy, " with people's feelings the main criteria for measuring the
country's economic health.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, we suggest that the two sides sincerely discuss the
substantive content of "things that will benefit a vast majority of Taiwanese
people," as mentioned by Hu.</P>
      <P>Such things should not just be those already in place, such as helping China-
based Taiwanese businesses or the procurement of Taiwanese products, but should
also include support for Taiwan's bid to joint the "ASEAN Plus One" and the
further liberalization of Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If talks on these issues can get started through concerted efforts by the
governments on both sides of the strait, China's goodwill in taking care of
Taiwan's "main street economy" will really impress ordinary Taiwanese  people
and contribute  to Taiwan's development.</P>

    <DATELINE>02/21/10  16:20:54
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nine-day Chinese New Year holiday 2010 has finally ended. The record-length
New Year break, spoiled by cold and wet weather, was not appreciated by many in
Taiwan, who have complained that it was a waste of time and boring, because they
did not want to go out in the inclement weather.</P>
      <P>This reminds us that holidays are good and welcome, but it is not always true
that "the longer, the better."</P>
      <P>Holidays are costly. Both society and the people have to bear the full cost of
them. The government should therefore elaborate on the cost and cost efficiency,
as well as the potential risks of a holiday, before determining how long it
should be.</P>
      <P>The main cost of a holiday is the decline in work and production. At the same
time, the marginal benefit of a holiday break might decrease progressively with
the length of it.</P>
      <P>A holiday that is too long might incur risks. For example, a company might lose
an order because it has not maintained contact with the buyer. Long holidays
provide the people with the possibility of planning trips overseas, but overseas
trips steal economic advantages away from the local tourism sector.</P>
      <P>Long holidays of course have their merit. They help relieve the pressure on the
government in terms of transport and traffic, as motorists have more travel
schedule options.</P>
      <P>Longer holidays also provide officials with longer periods to ponder their
policy development.</P>
      <P>A holiday is not just a day or several days off. It involves various costs and
benefits. Thus, we urge the administration to make a wide-ranging study and
survey all sectors involved before deciding on the length of a holiday. (Feb.

      <P>From playing a young man in traditional Chinese operas to portraying a clown in
a modern drama to acting the role of a teenager in a TV series, young Taiwanese
actor Sheng Zhian's  performances  have amazed  both local  audiences  and
international directors.</P>
      <P>Sheng Zhian, a guest actor with the Guoguang Opera Company, has been active in
the traditional art and theatrical fields for several years. He has been in the
spotlight recently due to his unique vocal styling, innovative acting skills and
compelling stage presence.</P>
      <P>Local drama critics have labeled him the "successor of Wu Hsing-kuo, " an actor
who started his career in Chinese opera but later extended his field to modern
drama and became a movie star.</P>
      <P>Sheng also received more than 20 years of traditional Peking opera training
before branching out into other types of performance. He graduated from the
Guoguang Art School and the National Taiwan University of Arts, and also became
a pupil of Peking opera master Pei Yan Ling.</P>
      <P>"Last year, I went back to the Guoguang Opera Company as a guest actor, and also
participated in a TV series, as well as trying my hand at appearing in
commercials," he told CNA.</P>
      <P>In the new year, he will make a cameo appearance in Guoguang's new opera titled
"Meng Xiaodong, " the story of an actress who specialized in playing male roles
in Chinese opera.</P>
      <P>"I started to receive serious training at a Chinese traditional opera school
when I was 10 years old. There is no doubt that it is my favorite thing to do,"
he said.</P>
      <P>While he used to focus only on this traditional art, he has since changed his
view. "I have studied both Western and Chinese performing styles, such as the
theories of Chinese opera maestro Mei Lanfan, German theatrical director Bertolt
Brecht, and also Russian director Constantin  Stanislavski.  Those have enriched
my performances greatly," he said.</P>
      <P>Sheng now views performing as a "profound calling" that should not be limited to
any specific field. "My concept of performance has greatly broadened; I can
pursue many other aspects of performing without betraying my passion for Chinese
opera," he said.</P>
      <P>He revealed that his plan for this year will be to participate in as many
different experiences as possible. He expects to complete the script of a new
drama by the middle of the year and to then set up a new theatrical group to
perform it. He is also contemplating a film career.</P>
      <P>"After so many years, I feel that we need an actor-centered theatrical group to
provide stimulation and opportunities for good actors," he went on. CNA staff

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) denied media reports Sunday that some
Cabinet members will be reassigned or will resign.</P>
      <P>"The reports are mostly speculative, not factual, " the GIO said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>According to a Liberty Times report, the President Ma Ying-jeou administration
will undergo a larger-than-expected reshuffle after the Lunar New Year holiday
in an effort to rescue its low public approval rating and win back public trust
ahead of the year-end mayoral elections for five municipalities.</P>
      <P>The report said Ma's national security team will recruit many new faces after Hu
Wei-jen replaces Su Chi as secretary-general of the National Security Council in
a formal changeover ceremony scheduled for Feb. 23.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the report said, Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy Yang might also
be replaced by a new diplomat.</P>
      <P>Other media reports also said that the finance, economics and transport
ministers might be reassigned.</P>
      <P>However, the GIO statement rebutted the reports as "not true, " saying Premier
Wu Den-yih recognized the performance and hard work of all the officials
mentioned in the media reports and have asked them to work even harder in the
future.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Executive Yuan will inform the public in detail if it has any

      <P>Speculation has been mounting on what the government is going to put on for
celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China
in 2011 at a time when the opposition Democratic  Progressive  Party is
apparently lukewarm over the celebrations and China is planning to expand its
celebrations for the centenary of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911.</P>
      <P>According to the Council for Cultural Affairs, the main organizer of the
celebrations, centennial activities based on the theme of "Republic for a
Century -- Democratic New Taiwan" will involve three main segments: the past
(Let Academia Interpret History), the present (Let the World See Taiwan) and the
future (Let Taiwan Behold the Future).</P>
      <P>The centenary serves as not only a good chance to publicize Taiwan around the
world, it is also a major event for the people of the country.  People in Taiwan
and overseas  businessmen  and expatriates are all concerned about the event.</P>
      <P>Although it will be impossible to garner the participation of all the people of
Taiwan in the celebrations, the government, while devising the activities,
should take into consideration the needs of all these people and try to serve
them.</P>
      <P>It is also very important to try to allow the people to recall things they have
done and the times they have shared in common through the activities, and to try
to create things that will touch their hearts.</P>
      <P>We suggest setting out a theme of gratitude for the celebrations. People in
Taiwan, regardless of ethnic groups, generations, political affiliation,
occupation and social status are all worthy of gratitude because all have done
their parts and have paid their dues for the country. By celebrating National
Day, we should recount the numerous good things that have happened in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>We also hope that the activities  will help foster  warm compatriotism and
kindred feelings among the people of the country.</P>

      <P>"Au Revoir, Taipei, " a late 2009 production that won a special prize at the
Berlin International Film Festival 2010 Saturday, gives global audiences a
glimpse of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The romantic comedy, made thanks to great support from the Taipei city
government during shooting, brought various Taipei features to the big screen,
including the MRT system, the night markets and the round-the-clock Eslite
bookstore.</P>
      <P>Just like its predecessors -- "Cape No. 7, " "Can't Live Without You, " and
"Monga," which have all enjoyed huge box office success in Taiwan -- "Au Revoir,
Taipei" proves once again that motion pictures make good channels for selling
cities.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the coverage by leading local newspapers of this
issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>After "Au Revoir, Taipei" beat more than 30 competitors to win the Network for
the Promotion of Asian Cinema (NETPAC) Prize at the Berlin film festival,
director Arvin Chen said he wrote the screenplay and directed the film with the
purpose of underscoring the beauty of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Chen, who won a Silver Berlin Bear-Jury Grand Prix for Short Films for a short
he made titled "May" in 2007, said he intentionally brought into the film
Taipei's various attractions, as he did not understand why so many people in
Taiwan want to go abroad to live or study while ignoring the good parts of their
own environment.</P>
      <P>Art film giant Wim Wenders, who helped create "Au Revoir, Taipei" as a producer,
said he found Chen to be very talented after watching "May." Wenders even
traveled to Taipei to help scout locations for Chen's latest work. (Feb. 21,
2010)</P>
      <P>United Evening News:</P>
      <P>The NETPAC jury commented that the director had successfully captured the
vitality of Taipei, a tireless city, as well as combining a group of figures who
seem out of tune with their surroundings and therefore creating a laughter-
provoking film.</P>
      <P>Thrilled over the victory of "Au Revoir, Taipei, " Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin
said the film is another example  of the city government's cooperation with film
producers to sell Taipei. He said the city government will help the local motion
picture industry more generously in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taipei Mayor Lee Yung-ping, who doubles as head of the Taipei Film
Commission, flew to Berlin to cheer on the crew of "Au Revoir, Taipei, "
although she did not stay long enough to see the film winning this year's NETPAC
prize.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. even unprecedentedly closed a stop one evening
last year for the shooting of several scenes, where over 500 people were
recruited as extras.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>One of the NETPAC jury commented that "Au Revoir, Taipei" features a unique
sense of humor that is rare in most Asian movies. The movie is charming and very
impressive, the judge said.</P>
      <P>Director Arvin Chen, a Chinese American who came to Taiwan some eight years ago
to work, did not stay in Berlin for the announcement of the winners, learning
the good news in Paris the next day.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed appreciation to the Taipei city government and to Wenders for
their assistance. (Feb. 21, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Air marshals trained for anti-terrorism work</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau has completed the training of 25 air marshals to
serve on U.S.-bound flights operated by Taiwanese carriers under a Taiwan-U.S.
anti-terrorism cooperation program, government sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"All the air marshals have completed their training and can take up their duties
at any time, " said an Aviation Police Bureau official.</P>
      <P>The training of air marshals is part of a U.S.-led global anti-terrorism
cooperation project, the official went on, adding that Taiwan has been very
compliant in carrying out the program.</P>
      <P>"The United States has been cooperating with countries around the world to
counter terrorism since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, and we
have been very cooperative in taking steps to improve maritime and airborne
traffic security, " the official explained.</P>
      <P>On the maritime security front, a new monitoring system was inaugurated at
Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan last November, he continued.</P>
      <P>"With the United States providing funds and Taiwan providing manpower, all
container shipping centers at the harbor have been outfitted with radioactive
substance-detecting instruments to filter all U.S.-bound containers for counter-
terrorism purposes," he said.</P>
      <P>For aviation security, the official went on, the Aviation Police Bureau was
charged with training the 25 air marshals.</P>
      <P>"All of them are elite members of our police force, " the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition to receiving rigorous training in identifying and detecting
explosives, hostage negotiations, shooting, arrest skills, combat in formation,
handcuffing, unarmed combat, police baton work and taekwondo, they also had to
pass family background checks, loyalty checks and emotional management tests.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a high-risk area for terrorist attacks and has consistently
imposed stringent security inspections at its airports, the official said, the
United States has not yet asked Taiwan to assign air marshals on Taiwanese
carriers' U.S.-bound flights.</P>
      <P>Even without a U.S. request, though, the official said, Taiwan's civil aviation
authorities can dispatch air marshals to execute duties on either international
or domestic flights based on their own intelligence and judgment.</P>
      <P>Japan and China have deployed plainclothes air marshals on their commercial
flights for several years, the official pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau plans to send several of the air marshals to the
United States to receive additional training in the latest airborne counter-
terrorism skills, the official said, adding that they will serve as instructors
after their return from the U.S.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's stocks are likely to rebound Monday, the first trading day after the
Chinese New Year holiday, based on strong showings in global stock markets last
week and the present domestic and international economic and political
situations, analysts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>There is a good chance the local stock market will rise Monday, given that the
rate of the local bourse closing higher on the first transaction day after the
holiday has been more than 70 percent over the past 10 years, according to
Capital Investment Trust Corp.</P>
      <P>As the market's weighted index experienced a major correction prior to the
Chinese New Year holiday period, the Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) is likely to
see a technical rebound and the 8,000 point mark tested after the holiday when
foreign investors are expected to reverse their previous position and buy
shares, according to an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co.</P>
      <P>The Taiex gained more than 200 points over the final two trading days before the
Feb. 14-21 holiday to close at 7,441.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors registered 15 consecutive trading sessions for net sales of
shares worth NT$150 billion (US$6.52 billion) between Jan. 22 and Feb. 10, and
the selling pressure is expected to be considerably eased after the holiday
break, according to the analyst.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the analyst went on, the U.S. Federal Reserve's raising of discount
rates by 0.25 percent to banks for direct loans Feb. 18 will have only a small
negative impact on Taiwanese shares following a rally in world stock markets
during the holiday period.</P>
      <P>Chang Tao-lang,  a senior executive at Jih Sun Securities Investment Trust Co.
predicted that the Taiex will hover between 7,500 and 8,000 in the first half of
this year.</P>
      <P>Several factors are expected to contribute to a bullish market in the  near
term  after  the  market  opens  again,  including better-than-expected
financial reports to be issued later in the year by Taiwanese and American
corporations.</P>
      <P>In addition, optimism over the signing of a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement, favorable government policies for allowing flat panel
makers to invest in China, strong exports, improved industrial production
figures and corporate profits, and the warming  relations  between Taiwan and
China will add to the bullishness of the market, according to analysts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2nd round of ECFA talks expected to take place in March</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Sunday that the second round
of official negotiations on a proposed cross-strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) will probably take place in Taipei in early March.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's and China's plans to strike the deal in May remain unchanged, Shih
confirmed during a Chinese New Year lunch with local reporters.</P>
      <P>The signing of the ECFA, which is expected to have a crucial impact on Taiwan's
economy, is one of the major policy goals for the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) this year, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, among the issues that are expected to be dealt with
in the second round of cross-strait ECFA talks will be the "early harvest" lists
of each side, naming items that could be first to benefit from the agreement.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, chief of the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade, and Tang Wei,
director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department under China's
Ministry of Commerce, who chaired the first round of talks Jan. 26 in Beijing,
will also chair the second round.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the administration is fully aware of the stance of the opposition
Democratic Progress Party on the issue and that his ministry will intensify its
communication with the party until the agreement is signed.</P>
      <P>The minister also said that trying to persuade the opposition parties and the
public that the ECFA is crucial to Taiwan is a tremendously difficult task.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, signing an ECFA will not necessarily cause local industries
to relocate abroad, but not signing it will definitely result in a fast exodus
abroad of local industries, an opinion that is not shared by critics of the
ECFA.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi denied a newspaper report Sunday that Minister of Foreign
Affairs Timothy Yang will be replaced in an imminent Cabinet reshuffle,
reaffirming that Yang will retain his position.</P>
      <P>"Yang has been working very hard since he took up his current post six months
ago and he has won great acclaim  for his performance... Media reports about his
replacement are baseless and purely speculative," Wu said in response to press
inquiries about the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle during a community
outreach trip to his home county of Nantou.</P>
      <P>He further  said  there  might  be minor  adjustments  of ministers-without-
portfolio and management executives of state-owned enterprises in late February
or early March.</P>
      <P>"But such adjustments  should  not be characterized  as a reshuffle, " Wu
argued, pointing out that the Cabinet was reshuffled just last September and
will not be subject to a major change anytime soon.</P>
      <P>As some management positions at state-owned enterprises have been left vacant
for some time, Wu said, those positions should be filled with no further delay.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu will be nominated by the ruling
Kuomintang to run for the mayoral post of the upgraded Taipei County, soon to be
known as New Taipei City, Wu said he "has so far not been informed that Chu will
run for mayorship of any municipalities."</P>
      <P>Wu said Chu has had outstanding credentials in all his previous posts as a
lawmaker and as Taoyuan county magistrate.</P>
      <P>"During his six months as my deputy since last September, he has also done a
very remarkable job, helping me dealing with many issues," the premier added.</P>
      <P>Speculation has been rife about the possibility of Chu replacing incumbent
Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei to represent the KMT in the year-end New Taipei
City mayoral election.</P>

      <P>Riding on the success of the youth gang film "Monga, " Taipei's venerable Wanhua
district has emerged as a new tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, large crowds of moviegoers have swarmed to Bopiliao -- a block
of stores in Wanhua -- for a nostalgic tour after viewing the box-office hit
before feasting on local snack foods in its nearby night market.</P>
      <P>The indie film set in Wanhua is yet another success story of city promotion
through filmmaking.</P>
      <P>The appeal of the film partly lies in its vivid portrayal of the mundane daily
grind of everyday people -- their joys and sorrows -- that reflects the
aesthetics of their lives.</P>
      <P>Since Premier Wu Den-yi took office last September, he has spared no effort to
advocate the value of "main street economy" and has constantly weighed the
average person's feelings when formulating his policies.</P>
      <P>The three rounds of domestic fuel price cuts and the cancellation of a plan to
raise the admission fee to a state-run recreational park in central Taiwan are
revealing examples of the Cabinet's heeding of the feelings and lives of
everyday people.</P>
      <P>We hope the government will draw inspiration from "Monga" and support even more
creative efforts to explore fun and interest in local grassroots people's daily
lives. We believe artistic works based on empathetic understanding of the life
of the common man will be moving and will win commercial success and critical
acclaim. (Feb. 21, 2010)</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang will not come up with nomination rules for the year-end
mayoral elections for five special municipalities until after the Feb. 27
legislative by-elections, asenior party executive said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with Sanlih Entertainment Television, KMT Secretary-
General King Pu-tsung said the KMT attaches great importance to the special
municipality elections because their outcome could be a bellwether to the 2012
presidential election.</P>
      <P>"We have yet to come to a conclusion on whether to hold a primary to choose our
candidates for the mayoral elections or to draft dream candidates for races in
certain municipalities, " King said, adding that the party's preparations for
the year-end elections will shift into high gear immediately after the curtains
fall on the four legislative by-elections this coming weekend.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu is likely to represent the party in
the mayoral election in the upgraded Taipei County to be named New Taipei City,
King said no final decision has been reached in this regard.</P>
      <P>Among the five special municipalities, the KMT commands greater support bases in
Taipei City, Taichung City and New Taipei City, while Kaohsiung and Tainan
municipalities are traditional strongholds of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>King said the KMT will field the best possible candidates in Tainan and
Kaohsiung in order to win the hearts and minds of voters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who has been widely
speculated as a possible KMT candidate for the greater Kaohsiung municipality
mayoral election, reiterated Sunday he does not have any intention to run in
such an election at all.</P>
      <P>"I hope my remarks can put an end to all relevant speculation. It is meaningless
to continue toying with this idea any more," Wang said categorically after
meeting with visiting U.S. Representative James Sensenbrenner, Jr.</P>
      <P>On the upcoming legislative by-elections, KMT sources said optimistically that
President Ma Ying-jeou's all-out campaign efforts during the nine-day Lunar New
Year holiday have paid off as prospects for the party's candidates to win the
races have improved greatly.</P>
      <P>The sources predicted that the party will be able to win at least two of the
four seats up for grabs in Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Chiayi and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>"We may even win three or all of the four seats up for grabs, " a KTM official
said, adding that Ma will continue to stump for KMT candidates in the coming
week in his capacity as KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, DPP officials admitted that the party's candidates face
uphill battles in three of the four constituencies where the by-elections will
take place.</P>
      <P>Only Chen Ming-wen, the DPP candidate for the Chiayi District II legislative by-
election, stands a good chance to win, while all the three other DPP candidates
face tough battles because the regions are the KMT's traditional power bastions,
DPP officials said.</P>

      <P>Chinese leaders usually do not spend the Lunar New Year holiday at home and
traditionally travel elsewhere in the country to celebrate the festival along
with local communist party cadres and the public.</P>
      <P>The selection of the places where top Chinese leaders spend their New Year
holiday tend to carry policy implications or epitomize China's new work
direction.</P>
      <P>Judging from Chinese President Hu Jintao's choice of three Fujian Province
cities adjacent to Taiwan -- Lungyen, Zhangzhou and Xiamen, the Beijing
government's intention to further promote cross-Taiwan Strait relations during
the Year of the Tiger is unmistakably evident.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy is that Hu said while visiting a special park designated for
Taiwanese agricultural investors to operate farms or ranches that the Chinese
government will do "whatever will benefit the vast majority of the Taiwanese
people" and will never back off from this promise.</P>
      <P>Hu further said China will keep in mind the interests of the people of Taiwan,
particularly farmers, in its negotiations with Taiwan on the proposed cross-
strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Hu's remarks were clearly targeting ordinary Taiwanese people. To show his
concern for Taiwanese businessmen operating in China, Hu also inspected a wharf
in Xiamen where some Taiwanese people embarked on direct sailings to Taiwan via
Kinmen or Matzu. He also attended a fireworks display co-sponsored for the first
time by Kinmen and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The moves were aimed at getting into closer contact with grassroots Taiwanese
people, and Hu's main appeal focused on "economy and livelihood."</P>
      <P>Hu's goal is actually in compliance with Taiwan's current emphasis on "main
street economy, " with people's feelings the main criteria for measuring the
country's economic health.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, we suggest that the two sides sincerely discuss the
substantive content of "things that will benefit a vast majority of Taiwanese
people," as mentioned by Hu.</P>
      <P>Such things should not just be those already in place, such as helping China-
based Taiwanese businesses or the procurement of Taiwanese products, but should
also include support for Taiwan's bid to joint the "ASEAN Plus One" and the
further liberalization of Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If talks on these issues can get started through concerted efforts by the
governments on both sides of the strait, China's goodwill in taking care of
Taiwan's "main street economy" will really impress ordinary Taiwanese  people
and contribute  to Taiwan's development.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nine-day Chinese New Year holiday 2010 has finally ended. The record-length
New Year break, spoiled by cold and wet weather, was not appreciated by many in
Taiwan, who have complained that it was a waste of time and boring, because they
did not want to go out in the inclement weather.</P>
      <P>This reminds us that holidays are good and welcome, but it is not always true
that "the longer, the better."</P>
      <P>Holidays are costly. Both society and the people have to bear the full cost of
them. The government should therefore elaborate on the cost and cost efficiency,
as well as the potential risks of a holiday, before determining how long it
should be.</P>
      <P>The main cost of a holiday is the decline in work and production. At the same
time, the marginal benefit of a holiday break might decrease progressively with
the length of it.</P>
      <P>A holiday that is too long might incur risks. For example, a company might lose
an order because it has not maintained contact with the buyer. Long holidays
provide the people with the possibility of planning trips overseas, but overseas
trips steal economic advantages away from the local tourism sector.</P>
      <P>Long holidays of course have their merit. They help relieve the pressure on the
government in terms of transport and traffic, as motorists have more travel
schedule options.</P>
      <P>Longer holidays also provide officials with longer periods to ponder their
policy development.</P>
      <P>A holiday is not just a day or several days off. It involves various costs and
benefits. Thus, we urge the administration to make a wide-ranging study and
survey all sectors involved before deciding on the length of a holiday. (Feb.

      <P>From playing a young man in traditional Chinese operas to portraying a clown in
a modern drama to acting the role of a teenager in a TV series, young Taiwanese
actor Sheng Zhian's  performances  have amazed  both local  audiences  and
international directors.</P>
      <P>Sheng Zhian, a guest actor with the Guoguang Opera Company, has been active in
the traditional art and theatrical fields for several years. He has been in the
spotlight recently due to his unique vocal styling, innovative acting skills and
compelling stage presence.</P>
      <P>Local drama critics have labeled him the "successor of Wu Hsing-kuo, " an actor
who started his career in Chinese opera but later extended his field to modern
drama and became a movie star.</P>
      <P>Sheng also received more than 20 years of traditional Peking opera training
before branching out into other types of performance. He graduated from the
Guoguang Art School and the National Taiwan University of Arts, and also became
a pupil of Peking opera master Pei Yan Ling.</P>
      <P>"Last year, I went back to the Guoguang Opera Company as a guest actor, and also
participated in a TV series, as well as trying my hand at appearing in
commercials," he told CNA.</P>
      <P>In the new year, he will make a cameo appearance in Guoguang's new opera titled
"Meng Xiaodong, " the story of an actress who specialized in playing male roles
in Chinese opera.</P>
      <P>"I started to receive serious training at a Chinese traditional opera school
when I was 10 years old. There is no doubt that it is my favorite thing to do,"
he said.</P>
      <P>While he used to focus only on this traditional art, he has since changed his
view. "I have studied both Western and Chinese performing styles, such as the
theories of Chinese opera maestro Mei Lanfan, German theatrical director Bertolt
Brecht, and also Russian director Constantin  Stanislavski.  Those have enriched
my performances greatly," he said.</P>
      <P>Sheng now views performing as a "profound calling" that should not be limited to
any specific field. "My concept of performance has greatly broadened; I can
pursue many other aspects of performing without betraying my passion for Chinese
opera," he said.</P>
      <P>He revealed that his plan for this year will be to participate in as many
different experiences as possible. He expects to complete the script of a new
drama by the middle of the year and to then set up a new theatrical group to
perform it. He is also contemplating a film career.</P>
      <P>"After so many years, I feel that we need an actor-centered theatrical group to
provide stimulation and opportunities for good actors," he went on. CNA staff

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) denied media reports Sunday that some
Cabinet members will be reassigned or will resign.</P>
      <P>"The reports are mostly speculative, not factual, " the GIO said in a press
statement.</P>
      <P>According to a Liberty Times report, the President Ma Ying-jeou administration
will undergo a larger-than-expected reshuffle after the Lunar New Year holiday
in an effort to rescue its low public approval rating and win back public trust
ahead of the year-end mayoral elections for five municipalities.</P>
      <P>The report said Ma's national security team will recruit many new faces after Hu
Wei-jen replaces Su Chi as secretary-general of the National Security Council in
a formal changeover ceremony scheduled for Feb. 23.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the report said, Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy Yang might also
be replaced by a new diplomat.</P>
      <P>Other media reports also said that the finance, economics and transport
ministers might be reassigned.</P>
      <P>However, the GIO statement rebutted the reports as "not true, " saying Premier
Wu Den-yih recognized the performance and hard work of all the officials
mentioned in the media reports and have asked them to work even harder in the
future.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Executive Yuan will inform the public in detail if it has any
plans for a personnel reshuffle, the GIO urged the media to stop its unfounded
speculation and spurious reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Suggestions on plans for ROC centenary activities</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Speculation has been mounting on what the government is going to put on for
celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China
in 2011 at a time when the opposition Democratic  Progressive  Party is
apparently lukewarm over the celebrations and China is planning to expand its
celebrations for the centenary of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911.</P>
      <P>According to the Council for Cultural Affairs, the main organizer of the
celebrations, centennial activities based on the theme of "Republic for a
Century -- Democratic New Taiwan" will involve three main segments: the past
(Let Academia Interpret History), the present (Let the World See Taiwan) and the
future (Let Taiwan Behold the Future).</P>
      <P>The centenary serves as not only a good chance to publicize Taiwan around the
world, it is also a major event for the people of the country.  People in Taiwan
and overseas  businessmen  and expatriates are all concerned about the event.</P>
      <P>Although it will be impossible to garner the participation of all the people of
Taiwan in the celebrations, the government, while devising the activities,
should take into consideration the needs of all these people and try to serve
them.</P>
      <P>It is also very important to try to allow the people to recall things they have
done and the times they have shared in common through the activities, and to try
to create things that will touch their hearts.</P>
      <P>We suggest setting out a theme of gratitude for the celebrations. People in
Taiwan, regardless of ethnic groups, generations, political affiliation,
occupation and social status are all worthy of gratitude because all have done
their parts and have paid their dues for the country. By celebrating National
Day, we should recount the numerous good things that have happened in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>We also hope that the activities  will help foster  warm compatriotism and
kindred feelings among the people of the country.</P>

      <P>"Au Revoir, Taipei, " a late 2009 production that won a special prize at the
Berlin International Film Festival 2010 Saturday, gives global audiences a
glimpse of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The romantic comedy, made thanks to great support from the Taipei city
government during shooting, brought various Taipei features to the big screen,
including the MRT system, the night markets and the round-the-clock Eslite
bookstore.</P>
      <P>Just like its predecessors -- "Cape No. 7, " "Can't Live Without You, " and
"Monga," which have all enjoyed huge box office success in Taiwan -- "Au Revoir,
Taipei" proves once again that motion pictures make good channels for selling
cities.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the coverage by leading local newspapers of this
issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>After "Au Revoir, Taipei" beat more than 30 competitors to win the Network for
the Promotion of Asian Cinema (NETPAC) Prize at the Berlin film festival,
director Arvin Chen said he wrote the screenplay and directed the film with the
purpose of underscoring the beauty of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Chen, who won a Silver Berlin Bear-Jury Grand Prix for Short Films for a short
he made titled "May" in 2007, said he intentionally brought into the film
Taipei's various attractions, as he did not understand why so many people in
Taiwan want to go abroad to live or study while ignoring the good parts of their
own environment.</P>
      <P>Art film giant Wim Wenders, who helped create "Au Revoir, Taipei" as a producer,
said he found Chen to be very talented after watching "May." Wenders even
traveled to Taipei to help scout locations for Chen's latest work. (Feb. 21,
2010)</P>
      <P>United Evening News:</P>
      <P>The NETPAC jury commented that the director had successfully captured the
vitality of Taipei, a tireless city, as well as combining a group of figures who
seem out of tune with their surroundings and therefore creating a laughter-
provoking film.</P>
      <P>Thrilled over the victory of "Au Revoir, Taipei, " Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin
said the film is another example  of the city government's cooperation with film
producers to sell Taipei. He said the city government will help the local motion
picture industry more generously in the future.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taipei Mayor Lee Yung-ping, who doubles as head of the Taipei Film
Commission, flew to Berlin to cheer on the crew of "Au Revoir, Taipei, "
although she did not stay long enough to see the film winning this year's NETPAC
prize.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. even unprecedentedly closed a stop one evening
last year for the shooting of several scenes, where over 500 people were
recruited as extras.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>One of the NETPAC jury commented that "Au Revoir, Taipei" features a unique
sense of humor that is rare in most Asian movies. The movie is charming and very
impressive, the judge said.</P>
      <P>Director Arvin Chen, a Chinese American who came to Taiwan some eight years ago
to work, did not stay in Berlin for the announcement of the winners, learning
the good news in Paris the next day.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed appreciation to the Taipei city government and to Wenders for
their assistance. (Feb. 21, 2010)</P>

      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau has completed the training of 25 air marshals to
serve on U.S.-bound flights operated by Taiwanese carriers under a Taiwan-U.S.
anti-terrorism cooperation program, government sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"All the air marshals have completed their training and can take up their duties
at any time, " said an Aviation Police Bureau official.</P>
      <P>The training of air marshals is part of a U.S.-led global anti-terrorism
cooperation project, the official went on, adding that Taiwan has been very
compliant in carrying out the program.</P>
      <P>"The United States has been cooperating with countries around the world to
counter terrorism since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, and we
have been very cooperative in taking steps to improve maritime and airborne
traffic security, " the official explained.</P>
      <P>On the maritime security front, a new monitoring system was inaugurated at
Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan last November, he continued.</P>
      <P>"With the United States providing funds and Taiwan providing manpower, all
container shipping centers at the harbor have been outfitted with radioactive
substance-detecting instruments to filter all U.S.-bound containers for counter-
terrorism purposes," he said.</P>
      <P>For aviation security, the official went on, the Aviation Police Bureau was
charged with training the 25 air marshals.</P>
      <P>"All of them are elite members of our police force, " the official said.</P>
      <P>In addition to receiving rigorous training in identifying and detecting
explosives, hostage negotiations, shooting, arrest skills, combat in formation,
handcuffing, unarmed combat, police baton work and taekwondo, they also had to
pass family background checks, loyalty checks and emotional management tests.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a high-risk area for terrorist attacks and has consistently
imposed stringent security inspections at its airports, the official said, the
United States has not yet asked Taiwan to assign air marshals on Taiwanese
carriers' U.S.-bound flights.</P>
      <P>Even without a U.S. request, though, the official said, Taiwan's civil aviation
authorities can dispatch air marshals to execute duties on either international
or domestic flights based on their own intelligence and judgment.</P>
      <P>Japan and China have deployed plainclothes air marshals on their commercial
flights for several years, the official pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Aviation Police Bureau plans to send several of the air marshals to the
United States to receive additional training in the latest airborne counter-
terrorism skills, the official said, adding that they will serve as instructors
after their return from the U.S.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's stocks are likely to rebound Monday, the first trading day after the
Chinese New Year holiday, based on strong showings in global stock markets last
week and the present domestic and international economic and political
situations, analysts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>There is a good chance the local stock market will rise Monday, given that the
rate of the local bourse closing higher on the first transaction day after the
holiday has been more than 70 percent over the past 10 years, according to
Capital Investment Trust Corp.</P>
      <P>As the market's weighted index experienced a major correction prior to the
Chinese New Year holiday period, the Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) is likely to
see a technical rebound and the 8,000 point mark tested after the holiday when
foreign investors are expected to reverse their previous position and buy
shares, according to an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co.</P>
      <P>The Taiex gained more than 200 points over the final two trading days before the
Feb. 14-21 holiday to close at 7,441.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors registered 15 consecutive trading sessions for net sales of
shares worth NT$150 billion (US$6.52 billion) between Jan. 22 and Feb. 10, and
the selling pressure is expected to be considerably eased after the holiday
break, according to the analyst.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the analyst went on, the U.S. Federal Reserve's raising of discount
rates by 0.25 percent to banks for direct loans Feb. 18 will have only a small
negative impact on Taiwanese shares following a rally in world stock markets
during the holiday period.</P>
      <P>Chang Tao-lang,  a senior executive at Jih Sun Securities Investment Trust Co.
predicted that the Taiex will hover between 7,500 and 8,000 in the first half of
this year.</P>
      <P>Several factors are expected to contribute to a bullish market in the  near
term  after  the  market  opens  again,  including better-than-expected
financial reports to be issued later in the year by Taiwanese and American
corporations.</P>
      <P>In addition, optimism over the signing of a proposed economic cooperation
framework agreement, favorable government policies for allowing flat panel
makers to invest in China, strong exports, improved industrial production
figures and corporate profits, and the warming  relations  between Taiwan and
China will add to the bullishness of the market, according to analysts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2nd round of ECFA talks expected to take place in March</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Sunday that the second round
of official negotiations on a proposed cross-strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) will probably take place in Taipei in early March.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's and China's plans to strike the deal in May remain unchanged, Shih
confirmed during a Chinese New Year lunch with local reporters.</P>
      <P>The signing of the ECFA, which is expected to have a crucial impact on Taiwan's
economy, is one of the major policy goals for the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) this year, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA officials, among the issues that are expected to be dealt with
in the second round of cross-strait ECFA talks will be the "early harvest" lists
of each side, naming items that could be first to benefit from the agreement.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, chief of the MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade, and Tang Wei,
director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department under China's
Ministry of Commerce, who chaired the first round of talks Jan. 26 in Beijing,
will also chair the second round.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the administration is fully aware of the stance of the opposition
Democratic Progress Party on the issue and that his ministry will intensify its
communication with the party until the agreement is signed.</P>
      <P>The minister also said that trying to persuade the opposition parties and the
public that the ECFA is crucial to Taiwan is a tremendously difficult task.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, signing an ECFA will not necessarily cause local industries
to relocate abroad, but not signing it will definitely result in a fast exodus
abroad of local industries, an opinion that is not shared by critics of the
ECFA.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi denied a newspaper report Sunday that Minister of Foreign
Affairs Timothy Yang will be replaced in an imminent Cabinet reshuffle,
reaffirming that Yang will retain his position.</P>
      <P>"Yang has been working very hard since he took up his current post six months
ago and he has won great acclaim  for his performance... Media reports about his
replacement are baseless and purely speculative," Wu said in response to press
inquiries about the possibility of a Cabinet reshuffle during a community
outreach trip to his home county of Nantou.</P>
      <P>He further  said  there  might  be minor  adjustments  of ministers-without-
portfolio and management executives of state-owned enterprises in late February
or early March.</P>
      <P>"But such adjustments  should  not be characterized  as a reshuffle, " Wu
argued, pointing out that the Cabinet was reshuffled just last September and
will not be subject to a major change anytime soon.</P>
      <P>As some management positions at state-owned enterprises have been left vacant
for some time, Wu said, those positions should be filled with no further delay.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu will be nominated by the ruling
Kuomintang to run for the mayoral post of the upgraded Taipei County, soon to be
known as New Taipei City, Wu said he "has so far not been informed that Chu will
run for mayorship of any municipalities."</P>
      <P>Wu said Chu has had outstanding credentials in all his previous posts as a
lawmaker and as Taoyuan county magistrate.</P>
      <P>"During his six months as my deputy since last September, he has also done a
very remarkable job, helping me dealing with many issues," the premier added.</P>
      <P>Speculation has been rife about the possibility of Chu replacing incumbent
Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei to represent the KMT in the year-end New Taipei
City mayoral election.</P>

      <P>Riding on the success of the youth gang film "Monga, " Taipei's venerable Wanhua
district has emerged as a new tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, large crowds of moviegoers have swarmed to Bopiliao -- a block
of stores in Wanhua -- for a nostalgic tour after viewing the box-office hit
before feasting on local snack foods in its nearby night market.</P>
      <P>The indie film set in Wanhua is yet another success story of city promotion
through filmmaking.</P>
      <P>The appeal of the film partly lies in its vivid portrayal of the mundane daily
grind of everyday people -- their joys and sorrows -- that reflects the
aesthetics of their lives.</P>
      <P>Since Premier Wu Den-yi took office last September, he has spared no effort to
advocate the value of "main street economy" and has constantly weighed the
average person's feelings when formulating his policies.</P>
      <P>The three rounds of domestic fuel price cuts and the cancellation of a plan to
raise the admission fee to a state-run recreational park in central Taiwan are
revealing examples of the Cabinet's heeding of the feelings and lives of
everyday people.</P>
      <P>We hope the government will draw inspiration from "Monga" and support even more
creative efforts to explore fun and interest in local grassroots people's daily
lives. We believe artistic works based on empathetic understanding of the life
of the common man will be moving and will win commercial success and critical
acclaim. (Feb. 21, 2010)</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang will not come up with nomination rules for the year-end
mayoral elections for five special municipalities until after the Feb. 27
legislative by-elections, asenior party executive said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with Sanlih Entertainment Television, KMT Secretary-
General King Pu-tsung said the KMT attaches great importance to the special
municipality elections because their outcome could be a bellwether to the 2012
presidential election.</P>
      <P>"We have yet to come to a conclusion on whether to hold a primary to choose our
candidates for the mayoral elections or to draft dream candidates for races in
certain municipalities, " King said, adding that the party's preparations for
the year-end elections will shift into high gear immediately after the curtains
fall on the four legislative by-elections this coming weekend.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu is likely to represent the party in
the mayoral election in the upgraded Taipei County to be named New Taipei City,
King said no final decision has been reached in this regard.</P>
      <P>Among the five special municipalities, the KMT commands greater support bases in
Taipei City, Taichung City and New Taipei City, while Kaohsiung and Tainan
municipalities are traditional strongholds of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>King said the KMT will field the best possible candidates in Tainan and
Kaohsiung in order to win the hearts and minds of voters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who has been widely
speculated as a possible KMT candidate for the greater Kaohsiung municipality
mayoral election, reiterated Sunday he does not have any intention to run in
such an election at all.</P>
      <P>"I hope my remarks can put an end to all relevant speculation. It is meaningless
to continue toying with this idea any more," Wang said categorically after
meeting with visiting U.S. Representative James Sensenbrenner, Jr.</P>
      <P>On the upcoming legislative by-elections, KMT sources said optimistically that
President Ma Ying-jeou's all-out campaign efforts during the nine-day Lunar New
Year holiday have paid off as prospects for the party's candidates to win the
races have improved greatly.</P>
      <P>The sources predicted that the party will be able to win at least two of the
four seats up for grabs in Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Chiayi and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>"We may even win three or all of the four seats up for grabs, " a KTM official
said, adding that Ma will continue to stump for KMT candidates in the coming
week in his capacity as KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, DPP officials admitted that the party's candidates face
uphill battles in three of the four constituencies where the by-elections will
take place.</P>
      <P>Only Chen Ming-wen, the DPP candidate for the Chiayi District II legislative by-
election, stands a good chance to win, while all the three other DPP candidates
face tough battles because the regions are the KMT's traditional power bastions,
DPP officials said.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin is heading to Seoul, South Korea, Monday for the 2010
World Design Cities Summit, at which he will give a presentation on Taipei's
efforts to promote cultural innovation.</P>
      <P>Hau will be grouped with the mayors of Bangkok, Thailand; Beijing, China;
Eindhoven, Holland; and Istanbul, Turkey during the summit which is scheduled to
open on Tuesday. His presentation, titled "Taipei: A City of Innovation and
Creativity, " will be delivered in English.</P>
      <P>Three  other  Taipei  City government  officials,  Research Development and
Evaluation Commission Director Yang Hsiao-tung, Department of Environmental
Protection Director Ni Shih-piao, and Commission of Administrative Appeals
Director Chen Ye-hsin, are accompanying Hau on his visit to Seoul from Feb.
22-25.</P>
      <P>The delegation is expected to call on Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon and to observe
infrastructure reform and construction in Seoul, which is a sister city of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The World Design Cities Summit is an international  event organized by the
International Council of Societies of Industrial Design in 2005 to promote the
idea of city design.</P>
      <P>Every two years, a city is appointed "World Design Capital" (WDC) -- a
designation that provides a distinctive opportunity for cities to feature their
accomplishments  in innovative design and to highlight their success in urban
revitalization strategies.</P>
      <P>Torino, Italy was the World Design Capital in 2008, and this year it's Seoul.</P>
      <P>More than 500 Korean and international design industrial experts are expected to

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Loosen grip on China-bound investment</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/22/10  11:14:51
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's latest move to relax restrictions on China-bound high-tech
investment has been welcomed as a generous Chinese New Year gift to the
industrial sector, but we think that it does not go far enough.</P>
      <P>In response to the argument by some people that the decision was "tailor-made"
to benefit semiconductor manufacturing giants TSMC and UMC, we ask, why not, if
it would help such companies to expand their global reach and influence.</P>
      <P>However, for flat panel makers, the new regulations are not attractive enough.
Under the revised rules, Taiwanese TFT-LCD makers will conditionally be allowed
to invest in facilities more advanced than 6th-generation plants but less
advanced than the applicant's Taiwan facility by at least one generation.</P>
      <P>Under this rule, only AU Optronics Corp. (AUO), Taiwan's largest flat panel
maker, will qualify.</P>
      <P>China's flat panel market is the world's largest, absorbing over 16 percent of
global production, and Taiwanese TFT-LCD manufacturers enjoy first-choice
privilege in terms of investment.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, China no longer wants low-level or old-generation flat panel
plants.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan remains hesitant in this regard, the South Korean government at the
end of 2009 lifted restrictions to allow its companies to establish up to
8.0-generation flat panel plants in China in a bid to give Korean manufacturers
an edge over their Taiwanese competitors.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan government has relaxed its restrictions on semiconductor
investment in China, local chip foundries are still prohibited from setting up
12-inch wafer fabs or foundries there using processes more advanced than 0.13
micrometers.</P>
      <P>This is tantamount to doing a good deed but not going all the way, or hitting
way off the mark.</P>
      <P>According to a TSMC spokesman, the latest liberalization move is not enough to
help local chip makers expand their market share in China.</P>
      <P>We urge the Ministry of Economic Affairs to come up with measures that are more
liberal and progressive in order to help Taiwanese makers become more
competitive in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan government is expected to raise its economic growth forecast for 2010
after an international market research organization last week adjusted its
forecast for Taiwan upward, analysts said Monday.</P>
      <P>Last week, Global Insight raised its forecast for Taiwan's 2010 GDP growth to
4.9 percent from the 4.4 percent it predicted in January.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) will release Monday its initial statistics for the country's 2009
economic performance and its economic outlook for this year.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, an Academia Sinica academician and a former chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said he believes the DGBAS
will moderately raise its economic growth forecast for this year as the local
economy is indeed showing signs of recovery.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS forecast late last year that Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP)
will post a positive growth of 4.39 percent in 2010 following a 2.53 percent
contraction in 2009.</P>
      <P>Forecasts by other economic think tanks put Taiwan's GDP growth rate for 2010 at
between 4.45 percent and 4.81 percent, while the CEPD has set the 2010 growth
target at 4.8 percent.</P>
      <P>However, Hu said, Taiwan should remain cautious because there are still several
possible risks that could arise amid the current global economic recovery, such
as an asset bubble in China and weak recovery of private consumption in high-
income European countries and the United States.</P>
      <P>Other  uncertainties  include  whether  local manufacturers' high-tech orders
will remain brisk and how well major countries around the world will deal with
the aftermath of emergency measures adopted during the 2009 economic recession,
Hu added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>On the first business day after the Chinese New Year, leading local newspapers
gave prominent space Monday to the legislative by-elections which will be held
Feb. 27.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of their reports:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: With one week to go before the legislative by-elections in the
counties of Hualien, Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Chiayi, both the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are gearing up to
full-steam in their campaigns.</P>
      <P>The KMT is projecting that it will score two sure wins and might take a third or
even fourth seat because of the heavy campaigning by the party's Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou during the nine-day Chinese New Year.</P>
      <P>China Times: In a campaign swing during the Chinese New Year holidays, Ma made
whistle stops in Jhongli, Taoyuan County and Minsyon, Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>In Jhongli, Ma accompanied KMT candidate Apollo Chen on a three-kilometer walk
to seek voter support.</P>
      <P>It was Ma's third visit to the small city during the 9-day holiday to stump for
Chen.</P>
      <P>In Minsyong, Ma and KMT candidate Lin Teh-rui led a campaign parade, but they
encountered a group of DPP followers who waved placards in protest against Ma's
proposal for a trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen also visited Minsyong Sunday evening to stump for
DPP candidate Chen Min-wen, who is considered a front runner in that election.</P>
      <P>Tsai urged voters to not only support Chen but give him a resounding victory.
(Feb. 22, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News: In Hualien, a verbal fight between KMT Secretary-General King
Pu-tsung and Hualien Mayor Fu Kun-chi stole the show.</P>
      <P>While stumping in Hualien City for the KMT candidate Wang Ting-sheng, King
accused Fu, a self-claimed die-hard KMT supporter, of trying to divide the KMT
vote by throwing his weight behind independent candidate Shih Sheng-lang.</P>
      <P>Fu, who won the Hualien mayoral election Dec. 5, 2009 against KMT candidate Tu
Li-hua, denied the charge, saying that he would support which ever candidate
would push for the construction of a freeway to link Hualien and Yilan. (Feb.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei announced his decision Monday not to enter the
race for the mayoral post after the county is upgraded to a special municipality
to be known as New Taipei City, a move that had been expected.</P>
      <P>Addressing a festive gathering on the first day of work after the nine-day Lunar
New Year break, Chou also said he will definitely not take up any position in
the Presidential Office or the Executive Yuan, contrary to media speculation.</P>
      <P>Chou further said he is also unlikely to take up any post in any state-run
enterprise as a "political reward service."</P>
      <P>"I will remain at my current post until the last day of my term," he reiterated.</P>
      <P>Chou said speculation has been rife over the last two years that he would be
recruited into President Ma Ying-jeou's administration in exchange for his
promise to not seek a second term.</P>
      <P>"Such speculation is meaningless. I assure all of you that there will not be any
trade in political posts... I will stick to my post until my term of office
expires late this year, " Chou told the staff of the Taipei county government.</P>
      <P>Chou's announcement is expected to pave the way for the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
to nominate Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu to run in the year-end New Taipei City
mayoral election. Chu is widely believed to stand a better chance of winning the
critical race than Chou, who has suffered from consistently poor approval
ratings.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said Sunday that the party attaches great
importance to the New Taipei City mayoral race because the outcome of the
election will be seen as a bellwether for the KMT's chances in the 2012
presidential election.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou confirmed Monday that outgoing Government Information
Office Minister Su Jun-pin will be succeeded by Johnny Chiang, a Soochow
University associate professor.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who is also an acting director of the Department of International
Affairs under the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) , a local think
tank, had been tapped before the Chinese New Year holiday to be the replacement
for the position left vacant by Su, who is expected to take over as ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman and to begin preparing  for the year-end special
municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Su worked closely with KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung during the party's
successful 2008 presidential election campaign.</P>
      <P>Ma made the confirmation during a party hosted by the KMT to mark the first
office day after the long Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as KMT chairman, exhorted all party members to strive to make
the KMT a party that stands by the people.</P>
      <P>"The KMT should be a party that knows the suffering of the people, is able to
deliver on the people's expectations and to fulfill the goals set by our
founding father, Sun Yat-sen," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He disclosed that from this year, the defunct Sun Yat-sen Scholarships will be
reinstated to continue helping nurture more talent for the KMT.</P>
      <P>He said many government officials, including himself, King, KMT Vice Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung, Examination Yuan President John Kuan and Taichung Mayor Jason
Hu, were recipients of the Sun Yat-sen Scholarships, allowing them to pursue
advanced studies overseas.</P>
      <P>Johnny Chiang, 38, was also a recipient of the prestigious scholarship, Ma
noted.</P>
      <P>"We would not have had the opportunity to pursue advanced studies abroad if
there had been no such state scholarship," he went on.</P>
      <P>Chiang  is the son-in-law  of KMT Legislator-at-large  Liu Shen-liang and his
paternal uncle is Antonio Chiang, former deputy secretary-general of the
National Security Council under the previous Democratic Progressive Party

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Eric Lilun Chu decides to run for mayor of New Taipei City, also knowned as
Xinbei City, Su Tseng-chang will have no choice but to run against him. If Chu
doesn't run, Su may choose to contest the election in either Taipei City or
Xinbei City.</P>
      <P>Any decision by Chu to run in Xinbei City would be made on the assumption that
he would be up against Su, therefore, Su would have to take up the challenge if
he doesn't want to hand the KMT an easy victory and sink his political career in
the process.</P>
      <P>There would be no need for Chu to enter the race in Xinbei City, let alone
replace the incumbent mayor Chou Hsi-wei as the KMT candidate, if Su rules out
the possibility of competing in either Taipei or Xinbei.</P>
      <P>But once Su reveals that he is flirting with the idea of throwing his hat into
the ring, Chu would not be able to turn down the KMT's request for him to
compete.</P>
      <P>As he is being forced to make the decision because of Su, Chu should announce
his candidacy before Su does and thus force Su to show his hand.</P>
      <P>Su has said he would rather not to run at all, but if he has to, he would prefer
to do so in Taipei City and that New Taipei City would be his last choice.</P>
      <P>Su's preference for Taipei is understandable because he could use the old pro-
China versus pro-independence issue in his campaign against incumbent Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin. In addition, a win against Hau would be considered a
political feat and a defeat would not necessarily ruin Su's chances of making a
bid for the presidency in 2012.</P>
      <P>However, in a race against Chu, the DPP's traditional strategy of playing the
Taiwan versus China card won't work. Furthermore, unlike incumbent Taipei
Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei whose public approval rating is low, Chu is unlikely to
be the underdog in a competition against Su.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su certainly cannot afford to lose a race against Chu, but a victory
in Xinbei City could trap Su in city hall for four years and cost him his chance
at the presidency in 2012.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, if Su wins the mayoral election in Xinbei City this year but
later chooses to give up the seat to pursue the presidency in 2012, Chu may win
the mayor's seat in the resulting by-election, and Su may lose the bid for the
presidency. (Feb. 22, 2010)</P>

      <P>Two important external events occurred during the Chinese New Year holiday that
deserve attention. First, The People's Bank of China, China's central bank,
announced that it will raise the deposit reserve requirement ratio for Chinese
financial institutions by 0.5 percentage points to 16.5 percent from Feb. 25
this year.</P>
      <P>It was the second time this year the reserve ratio has been raised, following a
similar 0.5 percent hike on Jan. 18, 2010. The central bank was compelled to hit
the brakes harder after seeing new lending rise by 1.4 trillion Chinese yuan in
January, more than in the entire previous quarter.</P>
      <P>The other major news item was the U.S. Federal Reserve's raising of its discount
rate to 0.75 percent.</P>
      <P>The combined economic scale of the United States and China is nearly US$20
trillion, or around 30 percent of the world economy. The moves by both have sent
clear messages to the public -- that easy monetary policy is on its way out and
that the way to move on is through cautious finetuning rather than a
comprehensive hike in interest rates.</P>
      <P>Many believe that only when the Fed starts to raise the federal funds rate will
a period of credit tightening truly begin.</P>
      <P>But it is undeniable that the exit of easy monetary policy has formally begun,
and the frequency and scale of future money tightening moves could grow larger.</P>
      <P>The U.S. and China are reminding all investors and businesses that as liquidity
drops, funds will not be as easily accessible as in 2009, and they therefore
should make the necessary adjustments to their operations and strategies. (Feb.

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that Taiwan's economy has been recovering,
that the outlook for this year is upbeat and that Taiwan can grab the
opportunity to achieve a full and strong recovery.</P>
      <P>Addressing an annual Chinese New Year party for Taiwanese businessmen operating
in China, Ma said that the same time last year was the worst period for the
economy, so the government decided to distribute shopping coupons in an effort
to boost the economy.</P>
      <P>This year, however, the government no longer needs to do so because most
department stores, discount stores, restaurants, movie theaters and amusement
parks have been enjoying brisk business, which signals that Taiwan's economy has
been recovering, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"I believe our economic performance this year will be very good," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he hopes to see an economic recovery "featuring Taiwanese
characteristics." The recovery should be nationwide -- not just benefiting only
one industry or department, and it also needs to increase job opportunities, he
went on.</P>
      <P>It should also be innovative and the structure of the economy needs to change,
Ma continued.</P>
      <P>The president said the government will soon implement a new industrial
innovation law,  in which small-  and medium-sized enterprises in traditional
industries will be eligible for government subsidies of NT$10,000 per month for
six months for every additional worker they employ.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the innovation should not be limited only to the hi-tech field
but should also apply to agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Touching on energy saving and carbon emissions reduction, he said that in the
past two years Taiwan has made great achievements in this field and will keep
following the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen Accord on reducing emissions.</P>
      <P>Ma further said that Taiwan needs to participate in regional economic
integration.</P>
      <P>"It is definitely  necessary  for us to sign an economic cooperation agreement
with China, and we need to do it quick, " he said.</P>
      <P>"Without signing a trade pact with China, other countries might not be willing
to sign free trade pacts with us, " said Ma.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to become more flexible and open, he continued, adding that he must
create opportunities to let Taiwanese people feel respected in international
society, "otherwise, I do not deserve to be president."</P>
      <P>Ma said government officials need to let the public know that the government is
eyeing 10 or 20 years ahead, not just the next one or two years.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan can achieve all this, the economic outlook will be very strong and
optimistic, the president concluded.</P>

      <P>Reflecting a rally in world stock markets, the stock market opened at the day's
high of 7,619.87 before dropping to a low of 7,553.29.</P>
      <P>The strong showing came after U.S. stocks finished higher Friday for a second
consecutive week despite the Federal Reserve's raising of discount rates to
banks for direct loans by 0.25 percent and a lessening of market fears over
sovereign defaults in the euro zone.</P>
      <P>An easing in selling pressure prior to the holiday also helped give a boost to
the local bourse, analysts said.</P>
      <P>A total of 3.19 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$94.44
billion (US$2.95 billion).</P>
      <P>All eight major stock categories gained ground, with banking and financial
stocks the biggest gainers with a rise of 3.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Foodstuff issues gained 2.3 percent, while construction issues and cement
shares, as well as plastic and chemical stocks, were all up 1.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Paper and pulp shares gained 1.4 percent, electronics and machinery issues rose
by 0.9 percent and textile stocks increased 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Gainers outnumbered losers 1,534 to 1,411, with 241 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors and Chinese QDIIs were net buyers of NT$3.43 billion-worth of
shares.</P>
      <P>The Taiex had gained more than 200 points over the final two trading days before
the Feb. 14-21 holiday to close at 7,441.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors registered 15 consecutive trading sessions for net sales of
shares worth NT$150 billion (US$6.52 billion) between Jan. 22 and Feb. 10.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nine-day Lunar New Year holiday, which ended Feb. 21, should have been a
time for people to rest completely from their work over the past year and for
individuals, enterprises, politicians and parties to engage in self-reflection
and planning for the new year.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the world experienced the worst recession in years, which was brought
about by a financial crisis. We think it is time for a reversal of misfortune.
However, that depends on not just on opportunities but also on wisdom and hard
work.</P>
      <P>From that perspective, we do not expect the Ma Ying-jeou government to achieve a
reversal of misfortune, judging from its failed performance last year. It is
worrisome that the government failed to boost industrial development or to lower
the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>We see Taiwan as trapped in a crisis of "pseudo recovery, " with people being
misled into thinking that the recession has bottomed out. In fact, the country
is facing an even bigger crisis -- that of the ruling party masking the pseudo
recovery with its theory of a "V-type" economic recovery, in an attempt to cover
its incompetence.</P>
      <P>We think President Ma Ying-joeu is the first person who should have stayed home
during the Lunar New Year holiday to review his mistakes. The president has
failed completely to deliver on any aspect of his "633" plan to achieve an
annual economic growth of 6 percent, per capital income of US$30,000, and an
unemployment rate of less than 3 percent by 2012.</P>
      <P>It was sad to see Ma busy campaigning for Kuomintang (KMT) legislative by-
election candidates during the new year holiday, rather than staying at home to
engage in self-reflection.</P>
      <P>Since he took office in 2008, his public approval rating has plunged from over
70 percent to some 20 percent, reflecting public discontent with his China-
tilting policies and incompetence.</P>
      <P>However, Ma seems to think it's all a problem of poor public relations on the
part of his administration. He's convinced that he can win public support for
his policies, including the controversial economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, once his administration holds as many press
conferences as possible to explain the details.</P>
      <P>However, we do not think the government can force people to accept whatever they
are being offered. If the Ma administration cannot give the people what they
want, it should at least let them decide their own future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Good performance of duty is best commitment: vice premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu declined to answer a reporter's question Monday on
whether he is ready to represent the ruling Kuomintang and run for the mayoral
post of Xinbei City, saying only that "good performance of duty is the best
commitment."</P>
      <P>Chu expressed admiration for Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei for his
demonstration of grace and magnanimity when he declared at a function earlier in
the day that he will not enter the race for the mayoral post of Xinbei City, as
the upgraded Taipei County will be known, and promised to throw his support
behind Chu.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, Chou's performance as Taipei magistrate over the past several
years is obvious and laudable, and he urged society and the media to give him
"fair appraisal." Chou has suffered consistently poor approval ratings for his
performance.</P>
      <P>On the question of when will he formally throw his hat into the ring for the
Xinbei City mayoral election, Chu said the KMT, just like any other political
party, runs a nomination mechanism, so it would be inappropriate for him to
speculate in this regard.</P>
      <P>"What I should do at present is my duty as vice premier, including tackling the
unemployment issue and reviving the domestic economy," Chu said.</P>
      <P>Chou announced his decision not to enter the Xinbei City mayoral election at a
festive gathering on the first day of work after the long Chinese New Year
break.</P>
      <P>He also said he will definitely not take up any position in the Presidential
Office or the Executive Yuan,  contrary to media speculation. He further
elaborated that he will remain at his current post until the last day of his
term.</P>
      <P>Chou's announcement was expected to pave the way for the ruling KMT to nominate
Chu, who is widely believed to stand a better chance of winning the critical
race than Chou.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung said the previous day that the party
attaches great importance to the Xinbei City mayoral race because the outcome of
the election will be seen as a bellwether for the KMT's chances in the 2012
presidential election.</P>

      <P>Eslite bookstore will hold its annual "Vinyl Underground" exhibition and sale
from March 5-14 to encourage people to discover the beauty of vintage music
albums, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>The Dunhua branch of the bookstore will showcase more than 10,000 vinyl albums,
with sale prices ranging from NT$99 to NT$30,000.</P>
      <P>The exhibits will include Michael Jackson's "Black or White" and "Remember the
Time, " Madonna's colored vinyl records, and the baseball music album "Baseball
and Me" that was released in the first year of the local Chinese Professional
Baseball League.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being supported by nine companies, including London Vintage
International, Goodiscs and Joy Audio, and some individuals have offered to add
their personal collections, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>Vinyl records were the primary medium used for commercial music reproduction for
most of the 20th century, but they are no longer in the mainstream. However,
many fans and collectors still love the vintage sound they produce.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The public has responded positively to seasoned diplomat Hu Wei-jen's
appointment as secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC).</P>
      <P>The NSC is the top strategic reference agency for the president, but its role
should not be confined to that of national security and should be expanded to
one with a broader vision and a wider strategic perspective.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is facing the three biggest economies in the world -- the United States,
Japan, and China -- and the relationships among the three are sensitive and
complex.</P>
      <P>To ensure national security and enhance the nation's wellbeing, it is in
Taiwan's best interests  to maintain  balanced  and complementary relations with
each of the three. The Chinese classic "Sun Tzu on the Art of War" says strategy
is the top approach to victory,  and  this  is what  we hope  for in the  new
NSC secretary-general.</P>
      <P>In reality,  although  the three countries  are "strategic cooperation partners,
" they are also enemies when their interests -- especially their economic
interests -- clash, and it is for this reason that the NSC should not confine
itself only to national security.</P>
      <P>In terms of strategic planning, the economy should be further liberalized so
that Taiwan can become a bridgehead for other countries making inroads into the
Chinese market and other countries will  be persuaded  to set up their  Asia-
Pacific  operations headquarters here.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  should also use all its available  resources  and non-conventional
strategies,  including networks,  international publicity campaigns, lobbying
and even humanitarian assistance to upgrade the nation's image internationally
and solicit international support.</P>
      <P>Adopting  such an approach  would be the best policy for consolidating Taiwan's
security. (Feb. 22, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of relations with China urged Taiwanese people
with business operations in China -- known in Taiwan as "Taishang" -- to help
publicize a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan urged the "Taishang" not
only to support Taiwan's signing of the ECFA with China, but also to step
forward to help publicize and promote the plan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a festive gathering to mark the first day of work after the Lunar
New Year holiday, Lai called on the "Taishang" to expound to the public on the
advantages that are expected to be created for all Taiwanese people by the
signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>The  gathering  was  sponsored  by Taiwan's  quasi-official intermediary body
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), the MAC, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries and the
General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>More than 200 "Taishang" representatives from all over China attended the
function.</P>
      <P>Addressing the gathering, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said the fifth round of
talks with his Chinese counterpart -- Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin -- will be held in the first half
of 2010 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Major issues expected to be tackled at that meeting will include the signing of
the ECFA, protection of intellectual property rights and avoidance of double
taxation, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>In related news, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that same day that
a legislative mechanism should be established to allow the Legislative Yuan to
supervise Taiwan's signing of any trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Since there is no law to serve as a legal basis for the legislature to oversee
or screen agreements signed during talks between the SEF and ARATS, Wang urged
all lawmakers to offer their opinions and suggestions to help build such a
supervisory mechanism.</P>

      <P>Heavyweights of the ruling and opposition parties expressed mixed reactions
Monday to Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei's announcement that he would not
seek reelection in December after the county has been upgraded to a special
municipality called Xinbei City.</P>
      <P>Chou made the announcement following news reports that he had agreed to let Vice
Premier Eric Lilun Chu stand as the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate in light of the
incumbent's low approval ratings in various opinion polls.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the KMT thinks Chu has a better chance of winning the
election.</P>
      <P>Chou said he reached the decision on his own and that there had been no pressure
from KMT authorities. KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was given no advance notice of
the decision before it was announced publicly, Chou added.</P>
      <P>There is no law that requires an elected official to seek two consecutive terms,
Chou noted, adding that he would perfer to be known as an exemplary single-term
magistrate.</P>
      <P>He pledged that when his term expires at the end of this year, he would leave
his successor adequate funds and a well-developed infrastructure, in keeping
with his promise when he assumed office four years ago.</P>
      <P>The magistrate denied that he was offered some other government post in return
for stepping aside, and he promised to support Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu in
his bid for the Xinbei City seat.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chou's announcement, KMT lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu said she felt
sorry for him because he was treated unfairly in the opinion polls but admires
him for putting the party's interests ahead of his own by stepping aside for
Chu.</P>
      <P>However, Wu Bing-rui head of the DPP's Taipei County Chapter, said Chou's
decision confirmed the DPP's long-held view that he was doing a poor job and
should be replaced.</P>
      <P>The KMT should apologize for Chou's performance, Wu added.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ying-wen said it is regrettable that Chou has become a lame
duck one year before the end of his term.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Su Chia-chuan declined to comment on Chou's decision,
saying only that his party will stick to its own process of choosing its
candidates regardless the KMT's decisions. (By Sophia Yeh, Chen Ching-ping, Wang

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should make climate change one of the national security issues as island
nations will be the first to suffer the impact of climate change, a noted
political commentator and TV presenter said Monday.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the climate change issue will be elevated to the national security
level, " Sisy Chen told reporters ahead of a preview of her new documentary
titled "Plus or Minus 2 Degrees Celsius" at a local movie theater.</P>
      <P>"If I were president, I would definitely spend national defense funds on
environmental protection and not the other way around, " said the producer of
Taiwan's first documentary on the impact of climate change on the country.</P>
      <P>Chen said that defense funds should be mainly used to buy rescue- related
equipment such as helicopters.</P>
      <P>"And I would make sure our troops were trained in disaster rescue operations,"
she went on.</P>
      <P>Chen said she has watched many foreign films on climate change, none of which
have covered the situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I thought this meant Taiwan would be lucky enough to avoid much damage from
climate change," she added.</P>
      <P>After talking with experts, however, she said she realized that Taiwan would be
among the first group of climate change victims.</P>
      <P>She explained that by the time low-lying countries like the Maldives and
Kiribati are inundated by rising sea levels, many parts of Taiwan would also be
underwater.</P>
      <P>They will include the port of Tungshih in the southern county of Chiayi,
Tungkang and Linbian townships in the southern county of Pingtung, and Mailiao
township in the southern county of Yunlin, where Taiwan's largest petrochemical
industry is located.</P>
      <P>She also said Taiwan's biggest environmental problem is its thermal power
plants. Chen added that encouraging people to adopt a vegetarian diet would also
a good way to help reduce global warming, as the livestock industry has been
blamed for creating much of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>She also said Taiwan should invest in green energy technologies. "The smart
grid, for example, could help households save up to 70 percent in electricity
costs."</P>
      <P>Chen urged the public to use their votes to tell politicians at all levels that
they will not receive support in elections if they fail to take action.</P>
      <P>The documentary also calls on viewers to send e-mails to President Ma Ying-jeou
to urge him to help save the planet.</P>
      <P>Millions of people in Taiwan are expected to watch the world's devastating
climate changes that have occurred in the past six months, as well as footage of
Typhoon Morakot-ravaged southern Taiwan during the 70-minute film, which will be
broadcast on TV and screened at special events around the country in the coming
months.</P>
      <P>It took less than five months to complete the shooting of the film, which had
funding of NT$8 million from several business tycoons. The film's title reflects
the widely held belief that the Earth's temperatures should be controlled within
2 degrees Celsius.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Deh-yih argued Monday that a proposed bill to stimulate industrial
innovation is not a giveaway to high-tech industries or conglomerates, as
critics charge, and he said he hopes the bill can be passed in the new
legislative session.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng promised that the bill will be listed as the
top priority in the next legislative session, which is scheduled to start
Tuesday and end on June 15.</P>
      <P>Rebutting the legislation's critics, Wu said the bill is not intended to benefit
any particular  industry but will provide incentives to any industry or company
that focuses on innovation, R&amp;D, talent cultivation, and job creation.</P>
      <P>To make the bill more palatable to critics, however, the Cabinet decided to
withdraw the controversial Article 30, which would have offered a preferential
15 percent corporate income tax rate to any of the world's 500 biggest companies
that locate their headquarters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Those opposing the clause argued that the special rate would have unfairly
benefited Taiwan's handful of companies in the top 500.</P>
      <P>But the chairman of one of those companies, Terry Gou of the Hon Hai Group, has
threatened to move the company's headquarters out of Taiwan if the bill passes
and his company does not benefit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to boost employment, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Monday
that a provision will be added to the bill that would grant small- and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) in conventional industries a subsidy of NT$10,000 per
month for six months for every additional worker they employ.</P>
      <P>If the SMEs hire older workers, the subsidies could be extended to one year.</P>
      <P>According to ministry officials, the average cost of subsidizing an additional
worker would be NT$100,000, so the plan's NT$3 billion budget could create about
30,000 job opportunities, they estimated.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that it is imperative to adopt an absentee
voting system to protect the constitutional and human rights of Taiwan's
electorate.</P>
      <P>Ma said absentee voting is a necessity in a democratic country, though he
suggested that it would be implemented gradually and that the extent of the
measure would be open to discussion.</P>
      <P>"It is something that must be done, " to protect the human rights of the
country's citizens enshrined in the Constitution,  the president said at a
seminar held by the governing Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The idea should not be ignored simply because there is a lack of consensus,
insisted Ma, who doubles as the KMT's chairman.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said the ministry has adopted a "more stable,
fair" approach on absentee voting and intends to implement it gradually.</P>
      <P>The government's plan would allow "transfer voting, " enabling election workers,
military personnel, students and inmates to cast ballots in constituencies in
which they are working, studying or serving sentences instead of in the
electoral districts where their households are registered.</P>
      <P>The ministry hopes to implement the proposal for the 2012 presidential election,
Jiang said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's voters must cast ballots in areas where their households
are registered, but because many of them do not work or reside in the electoral
districts where they are registered, they have to return to their registered
addresses to vote.</P>
      <P>Jiang stressed, however, that absentee voting by mail will not be allowed,
meaning Taiwanese businessmen in China and other citizens living abroad would
still be required to return home to cast their ballots.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government raises 2010 GDP growth forecast to 4.72%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
02/22/10  20:46:55
(By Erin Ho and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government statistics bureau has revised upwards its forecast for the
country's economic growth in 2010 on the strength of a sustained global economic
recovery, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih Su-mei, the head of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) , said the agency expects Taiwan's gross domestic product
(GDP) to grow 4.72 percent this year, up from an earlier forecast of 4.39
percent.</P>
      <P>Increased global demand for a number of new high-tech products, including
e-readers, LED televisions, and touch screen and cloud computing products will
bring enormous business opportunities to local industries, Shih said, leading
the agency to adjust its forecast higher.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's GDP is expected to reach NT$13.43 trillion (US$419.69 billion) this
year and per capita gross national product (GNP) will hit US$18,175, both
historical highs for the country, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's U.S. dollar-denominated merchandise exports are expected to post 20.91
percent annual growth this year, Shih said, regaining much of the strength lost
in 2009 when exports plummeted by more than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>With the domestic economy regaining momentum, she also forecast private
consumption to grow at a moderate 1.81 percent clip in 2010 and private
investment to rise by 14.81 percent for the year.</P>
      <P>If it pans out, the estimated private investment growth rate would be the
highest since 2003, when domestic investment plunged amid the SARS outbreak,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DGBAS forecast this year's GDP quarterly growth rates at 9.24
percent for Q1, 6.05 percent for Q2, 3.95 percent for Q3, and 0.66 percent for
Q4.</P>
      <P>The estimated growth rates for the first three quarters were all higher than
forecasts made late last year, but the fourth quarter projection was adjusted
downward because the baseline set in the fourth quarter of 2009 was higher than
anticipated, Shih explained.</P>
      <P>According to preliminary DGBAS estimates, Taiwan's GDP grew at a 9.22 percent
rate in Q4 because of stronger-than-expected private consumption and robust
growth in triangular trade and other service exports.</P>
      <P>The GDP figure was 2.33 percentage points higher than the previous forecast and
represented the highest quarterly growth rate since Q3 2004, said a DGBAS
department chief.</P>
      <P>"It also marked the first time that Taiwan posted positive year-on-year
quarterly growth since Q3 2008, " said Tsai Hung-kun, head of the DGBAS' Third
Bureau.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai said, Taiwan's economy still contracted by 1.87 percent for
the whole of 2009 because of the global economic slump.</P>
      <P>"Although the rate of negative growth rate was lower than the previous forecast
of 2.53 percent, it was still the highest rate of contraction in our history,"
Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>The better-than-expected 2009 Q4 economic numbers were the result of 6.27
percent growth in private consumption during the quarter, far higher than the
3.86 percent growth originally projected, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"Increased  auto sales due to the imminent expiration  of preferential
automobile excise taxes contributed 1.8 percent in private consumption growth
for the quarter, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The stock market's rally during the period also helped boost private spending,
as mutual fund trading service charges posted 154 percent growth for the
quarter.</P>
      <P>Service exports, and triangular trade in particular, also helped fuel Q4 growth,
with triangular trade services (receiving orders in Taiwan while delivering
goods from overseas destinations) amounting to US$4.5 billion, far exceeding the
US$2.6 billion in revenues registered in Q4 2008.</P>
      <P>A 22 percent increase in Chinese visitor numbers also contributed to the strong
quarter, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>As for inflation, Tsai said the agency projected the consumer price index to
rise 1.27 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>"Although the figure is 0.92 percent higher than the previous forecast, the
expected inflation rate is moderate, " said Tsai, who added that no inflationary
pressures were expected during the year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Los Angeles Dodgers could add an extra game to the two-game exhibition
series they plan to play in Taiwan in mid-March, the event's promoter said
Monday.</P>
      <P>BROS Sports Marketing Co.  said it asked Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball
League (CPBL) if it were willing to play another game, and the league has given
its consent in principle.</P>
      <P>The request for the extra game has also been relayed to the U.S. side, and an
answer will be received on Tuesday at the earliest.</P>
      <P>"If the Dodgers agree to play one more game, we will start selling tickets next
week, " a BROS Sports Marketing executive said Monday, with the game to played
in Taipei on March 12.</P>
      <P>The Dodgers are currently scheduled to play two games in Taiwan in mid-March
against a CPBL All-Star team, on March 13 in Taipei and on March 14 in
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The executive said Taipei's Tienmu Baseball Stadium can only accommodate a crowd
of 8,500 after seats with bad viewing angles are eliminated, prompting many fans
to complain about the lack of tickets and leaving them hoping that the Dodgers
could play one more game.</P>
      <P>BROS revealed that several Dodgers felt it would be fine to play an extra game
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>This will be the Dodgers' second trip to Taiwan, and the third time since 2008
that a Major League team from the United States has traveled to Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: End tax exemption for servicemen, teachers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/22/10  21:10:09
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>During its last session, the Legislative Yuan shelved a draft amendment to the
Income Tax Act aimed at revoking the income tax exemption for military
servicemen and public school teachers.</P>
      <P>At  President  Ma  Ying-jeou's  insistence,  the  ruling Kuomintang-controlled
legislature has agreed to list the package as a priority bill to be passed
during its new session.</P>
      <P>The bill has become a test of Ma's moral integrity and his commitment to uphold
fairness and justice in tax policy, as he promised on the presidential campaign
trail. If the bill clears the legislative floor, we believe Ma will receive
support and praise from independent voters.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons the bill should be passed is because military and teaching
jobs are no longer low-paying, as they were in the past. The incomes of teachers
and military servicemen are actually much higher than the national average.
Moreover, they enjoy lifelong pensions and many other fringe benefits. It is
extremely unfair for them to be exempted from income tax payments.</P>
      <P>A fair tax system is an important gauge of social progress. No other advanced
country in the world offers tax exemptions for soldiers or officers.</P>
      <P>Some senior military officers have reportedly threatened Ma not to reinstate
income taxes on service members. They said the ruling Kuomintang's embarrassing
defeat in January's legislative by-election was the result of a boycott of
family members of many military servicemen due to their discontent with Ma's
income tax reinstatement plan.</P>
      <P>If such reports were true, we feel ashamed by the selfishness of our soldiers,
and we hope Ma will never yield to their threat. (Feb. 22, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local climate change film launched to raise awareness</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A locally produced documentary designed to warn people of the threats climate
change poses to Taiwan and the world made its debut Monday in Taipei after
hundreds of audience members shouted, "Save the Earth."</P>
      <P>To mark the film's opening, Premier Wu Den-yih and Legislative Speaker  Wang
Jin-pyng  joined other administration  officials, lawmakers, business tycoons,
entertainers, celebrities and volunteers in shouting, "Save the Earth. Save
Taiwan. Save children."</P>
      <P>The documentary titled "Plus or Minus 2 Degrees Celsius, " which reflects the
widely held belief that the Earth's temperatures should be controlled within 2
degrees Celsius, was screened at a hall considered to be Taiwan's first public
facility using green building technology.</P>
      <P>The 70-minute film, which receiving NT$8 million in funding from Hon Hai Group
Chairman Terry Gou, Quanta Computer Chairman Barry Lam and several other local
businessmen, was completed less than five months after Typhoon Morakot ravaged
southern Taiwan in August last year.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen, the main producer of what is being described as Taiwan's first
documentary on the impact of climate change on the country, said she had watched
many foreign films on climate change, but none had covered Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I thought this meant Taiwan would be lucky enough to avoid serious damage from
climate change, " the noted political commentator and TV presenter said at a
preview earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>After talking with experts, however, she said she came to realize that Taiwan
would be among the first group of climate change victims.</P>
      <P>She explained that by the time low-lying countries such as Maldives and Kiribati
are submerged by rising sea levels, several parts of Taiwan would also be under
water.</P>
      <P>They include the port of Dongshih in the southern county of Chiayi, Donggang and
Linbian townships in the southern county of Pingtung, and Mailiao Township in
the central-southern county of Yunlin, where Taiwan's largest petrochemical
complex is located.</P>
      <P>Chen therefore urged the government to elevate the climate change issue to the
national security level.</P>
      <P>The film features devastating climate changes that have occurred in the past six
months, scientific graphics and footage of the Typhoon Morakot disaster.</P>
      <P>The documentary will be broadcast on TV and screened at special events around
the country, free of charge, in the coming months, with the number of viewers
expected to be in the millions.</P>

      <P>The number of companies applying to list on Taiwan's over-the-counter (OTC)
market is expected to double to 40 in 2010, the GreTai Securities Market (GTSM)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>GTSM Chairman Gordon Chen said that during last year's economic slump, only 20
companies applied to be listed, and he expected the number to increase to 40, or
even 50, this year.</P>
      <P>Among the potential applicants, 10 companies operating abroad are eyeing primary
listings in Taiwan, including enterprises from China, Southeast Asia, and
Silicon Valley in the United States, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A company applying to engage in OTC trading must have paid-in capital of at
least NT$50 million (US$1.56 million) . At present, there are 548 companies
listed on the OTC.</P>
      <P>Chen also expected that another 50 companies would apply to list on GreTai's
emerging stock market in 2010, with 15 to 20 of them companies operated by
Taiwanese businessmen abroad.</P>
      <P>There are 235 companies currently listed on the emerging stock market.</P>
      <P>Emerging stocks are common stocks traded on the GreTai Securities Market by
means of negotiation. The companies listed have no revenue, capital, years of
operation or shareholder number requirements, but they have registered their
supervision agreement with recommending securities firms with GTSM.</P>

      <P>Fascinating lanterns and special events celebrating the Lantern Festival, which
falls on Feb. 28 this year, will attract millions of visitors from home and
abroad and boost business in the tourism sector, the Tourism Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, the Tourism Bureau has pulled together the resources of local
governments and the private sector to actively promote one of Taiwan's most
celebrated and colorful traditional festivals.</P>
      <P>It has staged the official Taiwan Lantern Festival celebration in a different
city every year, and this year's host, Chiayi City in central Taiwan, is
expecting the week-long festivities to draw 420,000 visitors and pump NT$1.68
billion into the local economy.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, festivities at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall plaza will open on Feb.
26 and last until March 7, with student groups performing folk dances in the
afternoons and professional dance troupes, bands and singers performing in the
evenings.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City opened its celebration of the Tiger Lamp Festival along the Love
River on Feb. 20. The festivities will last until March 7 and feature shows
showcasing performing artists from the United States, Japan, and Korea in
addition to local music, dance and drama groups.</P>
      <P>While lantern exhibitions around the island will highlight the traditional
festival -- marking the 15th day of the first moon in the lunar calendar -- many
practices related to folk beliefs are also big attractions for domestic and
international tourists.</P>
      <P>The most prominent include the "Fengpao"  ceremony,  where thousands of
firecrackers hung on a tall wooden stand are set off in Yanshuei, Tainan County,
and the spectacle of hundreds of lanterns being launched into the sky in Taipei
County's Pingsi.</P>
      <P>Also, on Feb. 27, large crowds will jump into the ocean near the scenic Yehliu
Geopark on Taiwan's northern coast in a ritual bath in observance of local
deities' visit to the area.</P>

      <P>The public has responded positively to seasoned diplomat Hu Wei-jen's
appointment as secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC).</P>
      <P>The NSC is the top strategic reference agency for the president, but its role
should not be confined to that of national security and should be expanded to
one with a broader vision and a wider strategic perspective.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is facing the three biggest economies in the world -- the United States,
Japan, and China -- and the relationships among the three are sensitive and
complex.</P>
      <P>To ensure national security and enhance the nation's wellbeing, it is in
Taiwan's best interests  to maintain  balanced  and complementary relations with
each of the three. The Chinese classic "Sun Tzu on the Art of War" says strategy
is the top approach to victory,  and  this  is what  we hope  for in the  new
NSC secretary-general.</P>
      <P>In reality,  although  the three countries  are "strategic cooperation partners,
" they are also enemies when their interests -- especially their economic
interests -- clash, and it is for this reason that the NSC should not confine
itself only to national security.</P>
      <P>In terms of strategic planning, the economy should be further liberalized so
that Taiwan can become a bridgehead for other countries making inroads into the
Chinese market and other countries will  be persuaded  to set up their  Asia-
Pacific  operations headquarters here.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  should also use all its available  resources  and non-conventional
strategies,  including networks,  international publicity campaigns, lobbying
and even humanitarian assistance to upgrade the nation's image internationally
and solicit international support.</P>
      <P>Adopting  such an approach  would be the best policy for consolidating Taiwan's
security. (Feb. 22, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of relations with China urged Taiwanese people
with business operations in China -- known in Taiwan as "Taishang" -- to help
publicize a proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan urged the "Taishang" not
only to support Taiwan's signing of the ECFA with China, but also to step
forward to help publicize and promote the plan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a festive gathering to mark the first day of work after the Lunar
New Year holiday, Lai called on the "Taishang" to expound to the public on the
advantages that are expected to be created for all Taiwanese people by the
signing of the ECFA.</P>
      <P>The  gathering  was  sponsored  by Taiwan's  quasi-official intermediary body
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), the MAC, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries and the
General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>More than 200 "Taishang" representatives from all over China attended the
function.</P>
      <P>Addressing the gathering, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said the fifth round of
talks with his Chinese counterpart -- Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin -- will be held in the first half
of 2010 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Major issues expected to be tackled at that meeting will include the signing of
the ECFA, protection of intellectual property rights and avoidance of double
taxation, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>In related news, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that same day that
a legislative mechanism should be established to allow the Legislative Yuan to
supervise Taiwan's signing of any trade pact with China.</P>
      <P>Since there is no law to serve as a legal basis for the legislature to oversee
or screen agreements signed during talks between the SEF and ARATS, Wang urged
all lawmakers to offer their opinions and suggestions to help build such a
supervisory mechanism.</P>

      <P>Heavyweights of the ruling and opposition parties expressed mixed reactions
Monday to Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei's announcement that he would not
seek reelection in December after the county has been upgraded to a special
municipality called Xinbei City.</P>
      <P>Chou made the announcement following news reports that he had agreed to let Vice
Premier Eric Lilun Chu stand as the Kuomintang (KMT) candidate in light of the
incumbent's low approval ratings in various opinion polls.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the KMT thinks Chu has a better chance of winning the
election.</P>
      <P>Chou said he reached the decision on his own and that there had been no pressure
from KMT authorities. KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was given no advance notice of
the decision before it was announced publicly, Chou added.</P>
      <P>There is no law that requires an elected official to seek two consecutive terms,
Chou noted, adding that he would perfer to be known as an exemplary single-term
magistrate.</P>
      <P>He pledged that when his term expires at the end of this year, he would leave
his successor adequate funds and a well-developed infrastructure, in keeping
with his promise when he assumed office four years ago.</P>
      <P>The magistrate denied that he was offered some other government post in return
for stepping aside, and he promised to support Vice Premier Eric Lilun Chu in
his bid for the Xinbei City seat.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chou's announcement, KMT lawmaker Hung Hsiu-chu said she felt
sorry for him because he was treated unfairly in the opinion polls but admires
him for putting the party's interests ahead of his own by stepping aside for
Chu.</P>
      <P>However, Wu Bing-rui head of the DPP's Taipei County Chapter, said Chou's
decision confirmed the DPP's long-held view that he was doing a poor job and
should be replaced.</P>
      <P>The KMT should apologize for Chou's performance, Wu added.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ying-wen said it is regrettable that Chou has become a lame
duck one year before the end of his term.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Su Chia-chuan declined to comment on Chou's decision,
saying only that his party will stick to its own process of choosing its
candidates regardless the KMT's decisions. (By Sophia Yeh, Chen Ching-ping, Wang

environmental protection and not the other way around, " said the producer of
Taiwan's first documentary on the impact of climate change on the country.</P>
      <P>Chen said that defense funds should be mainly used to buy rescue- related
equipment such as helicopters.</P>
      <P>"And I would make sure our troops were trained in disaster rescue operations,"
she went on.</P>
      <P>Chen said she has watched many foreign films on climate change, none of which
have covered the situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I thought this meant Taiwan would be lucky enough to avoid much damage from
climate change," she added.</P>
      <P>After talking with experts, however, she said she realized that Taiwan would be
among the first group of climate change victims.</P>
      <P>She explained that by the time low-lying countries like the Maldives and
Kiribati are inundated by rising sea levels, many parts of Taiwan would also be
underwater.</P>
      <P>They will include the port of Tungshih in the southern county of Chiayi,
Tungkang and Linbian townships in the southern county of Pingtung, and Mailiao
township in the southern county of Yunlin, where Taiwan's largest petrochemical
industry is located.</P>
      <P>She also said Taiwan's biggest environmental problem is its thermal power
plants. Chen added that encouraging people to adopt a vegetarian diet would also
a good way to help reduce global warming, as the livestock industry has been
blamed for creating much of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>She also said Taiwan should invest in green energy technologies. "The smart
grid, for example, could help households save up to 70 percent in electricity
costs."</P>
      <P>Chen urged the public to use their votes to tell politicians at all levels that
they will not receive support in elections if they fail to take action.</P>
      <P>The documentary also calls on viewers to send e-mails to President Ma Ying-jeou
to urge him to help save the planet.</P>
      <P>Millions of people in Taiwan are expected to watch the world's devastating
climate changes that have occurred in the past six months, as well as footage of
Typhoon Morakot-ravaged southern Taiwan during the 70-minute film, which will be
broadcast on TV and screened at special events around the country in the coming
months.</P>
      <P>It took less than five months to complete the shooting of the film, which had
funding of NT$8 million from several business tycoons. The film's title reflects
the widely held belief that the Earth's temperatures should be controlled within
2 degrees Celsius.</P>

last year, according to National Youth Commission (NYC) tallies published
Monday.</P>
      <P>"The increased number of foreign travelers in the 15-30 age bracket shows the

      <P>According to NYC statistics, more than half of the visitors came to Taiwan for
the purpose of sightseeing.</P>
      <P>The tallies also show that tourists from Hong Kong and Macau comprised the
largest group, with a 15.44 percent increase from last year to 241,923. Tourists
from Japan, however, decreased 0.72 percent to 189,766, while the number from
South Korea dropped 25.85 percent to 36,715.</P>
      <P>Comparing tourist numbers from the West with those from Asia, the statistics

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Deh-yih argued Monday that a proposed bill to stimulate industrial
innovation is not a giveaway to high-tech industries or conglomerates, as
critics charge, and he said he hopes the bill can be passed in the new
legislative session.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng promised that the bill will be listed as the
top priority in the next legislative session, which is scheduled to start
Tuesday and end on June 15.</P>
      <P>Rebutting the legislation's critics, Wu said the bill is not intended to benefit
any particular  industry but will provide incentives to any industry or company
that focuses on innovation, R&amp;D, talent cultivation, and job creation.</P>
      <P>To make the bill more palatable to critics, however, the Cabinet decided to
withdraw the controversial Article 30, which would have offered a preferential
15 percent corporate income tax rate to any of the world's 500 biggest companies
that locate their headquarters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Those opposing the clause argued that the special rate would have unfairly
benefited Taiwan's handful of companies in the top 500.</P>
      <P>But the chairman of one of those companies, Terry Gou of the Hon Hai Group, has
threatened to move the company's headquarters out of Taiwan if the bill passes
and his company does not benefit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to boost employment, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Monday
that a provision will be added to the bill that would grant small- and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) in conventional industries a subsidy of NT$10,000 per
month for six months for every additional worker they employ.</P>
      <P>If the SMEs hire older workers, the subsidies could be extended to one year.</P>
      <P>According to ministry officials, the average cost of subsidizing an additional
worker would be NT$100,000, so the plan's NT$3 billion budget could create about
30,000 job opportunities, they estimated.</P>

      <P>The unemployment rate slid to 5.68 percent in January, with 626,000 people out
of work, marking the lowest figure in the past year, according to statistics
released Monday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The figure represents a drop of 0.06 percentage points from the previous month
and marked the fifth consecutive month in which the jobless rate decreased.</P>
      <P>However, the number of jobless people aged between 45 and 64 grew to 142,000 in
the same month, an increase of 1,000 people from the previous month. It marked
the highest-ever January level and the largest growth scale among the various
age groups, according to Liu Tien-tzu, deputy director of the DGBAS' fourth

      <P>Liu pointed out that most of the middle-aged jobless were elbowed out of their
positions, which he described as a worrying phenomenon.</P>

increase of 4,000 from last December, Liu went on.</P>
      <P>The number of workers in the industrial and service sectors had risen to 6.41

24,000 and marking the highest figure for nearly 12 months, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Even wages recorded growth, with the average monthly wage standing at NT$43,140

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that it is imperative to adopt an absentee
voting system to protect the constitutional and human rights of Taiwan's
electorate.</P>
      <P>Ma said absentee voting is a necessity in a democratic country, though he
suggested that it would be implemented gradually and that the extent of the
measure would be open to discussion.</P>
      <P>"It is something that must be done, " to protect the human rights of the
country's citizens enshrined in the Constitution,  the president said at a
seminar held by the governing Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The idea should not be ignored simply because there is a lack of consensus,
insisted Ma, who doubles as the KMT's chairman.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said the ministry has adopted a "more stable,
fair" approach on absentee voting and intends to implement it gradually.</P>
      <P>The government's plan would allow "transfer voting, " enabling election workers,
military personnel, students and inmates to cast ballots in constituencies in
which they are working, studying or serving sentences instead of in the
electoral districts where their households are registered.</P>
      <P>The ministry hopes to implement the proposal for the 2012 presidential election,
Jiang said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's voters must cast ballots in areas where their households
are registered, but because many of them do not work or reside in the electoral
districts where they are registered, they have to return to their registered
addresses to vote.</P>
      <P>Jiang stressed, however, that absentee voting by mail will not be allowed,
meaning Taiwanese businessmen in China and other citizens living abroad would
still be required to return home to cast their ballots.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government raises 2010 GDP growth forecast to 4.72%</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government statistics bureau has revised upwards its forecast for the
country's economic growth in 2010 on the strength of a sustained global economic
recovery, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih Su-mei, the head of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) , said the agency expects Taiwan's gross domestic product
(GDP) to grow 4.72 percent this year, up from an earlier forecast of 4.39
percent.</P>
      <P>Increased global demand for a number of new high-tech products, including
e-readers, LED televisions, and touch screen and cloud computing products will
bring enormous business opportunities to local industries, Shih said, leading
the agency to adjust its forecast higher.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's GDP is expected to reach NT$13.43 trillion (US$419.69 billion) this
year and per capita gross national product (GNP) will hit US$18,175, both
historical highs for the country, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's U.S. dollar-denominated merchandise exports are expected to post 20.91
percent annual growth this year, Shih said, regaining much of the strength lost
in 2009 when exports plummeted by more than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>With the domestic economy regaining momentum, she also forecast private
consumption to grow at a moderate 1.81 percent clip in 2010 and private
investment to rise by 14.81 percent for the year.</P>
      <P>If it pans out, the estimated private investment growth rate would be the
highest since 2003, when domestic investment plunged amid the SARS outbreak,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DGBAS forecast this year's GDP quarterly growth rates at 9.24
percent for Q1, 6.05 percent for Q2, 3.95 percent for Q3, and 0.66 percent for
Q4.</P>
      <P>The estimated growth rates for the first three quarters were all higher than
forecasts made late last year, but the fourth quarter projection was adjusted
downward because the baseline set in the fourth quarter of 2009 was higher than
anticipated, Shih explained.</P>
      <P>According to preliminary DGBAS estimates, Taiwan's GDP grew at a 9.22 percent
rate in Q4 because of stronger-than-expected private consumption and robust
growth in triangular trade and other service exports.</P>
      <P>The GDP figure was 2.33 percentage points higher than the previous forecast and
represented the highest quarterly growth rate since Q3 2004, said a DGBAS
department chief.</P>
      <P>"It also marked the first time that Taiwan posted positive year-on-year
quarterly growth since Q3 2008, " said Tsai Hung-kun, head of the DGBAS' Third
Bureau.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai said, Taiwan's economy still contracted by 1.87 percent for
the whole of 2009 because of the global economic slump.</P>
      <P>"Although the rate of negative growth rate was lower than the previous forecast
of 2.53 percent, it was still the highest rate of contraction in our history,"
Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>The better-than-expected 2009 Q4 economic numbers were the result of 6.27
percent growth in private consumption during the quarter, far higher than the
3.86 percent growth originally projected, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"Increased  auto sales due to the imminent expiration  of preferential
automobile excise taxes contributed 1.8 percent in private consumption growth
for the quarter, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The stock market's rally during the period also helped boost private spending,
as mutual fund trading service charges posted 154 percent growth for the
quarter.</P>
      <P>Service exports, and triangular trade in particular, also helped fuel Q4 growth,
with triangular trade services (receiving orders in Taiwan while delivering
goods from overseas destinations) amounting to US$4.5 billion, far exceeding the
US$2.6 billion in revenues registered in Q4 2008.</P>
      <P>A 22 percent increase in Chinese visitor numbers also contributed to the strong
quarter, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>As for inflation, Tsai said the agency projected the consumer price index to
rise 1.27 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>"Although the figure is 0.92 percent higher than the previous forecast, the
expected inflation rate is moderate, " said Tsai, who added that no inflationary
pressures were expected during the year.</P>

      <P>The Los Angeles Dodgers could add an extra game to the two-game exhibition
series they plan to play in Taiwan in mid-March, the event's promoter said
Monday.</P>
      <P>BROS Sports Marketing Co.  said it asked Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball
League (CPBL) if it were willing to play another game, and the league has given
its consent in principle.</P>
      <P>The request for the extra game has also been relayed to the U.S. side, and an
answer will be received on Tuesday at the earliest.</P>
      <P>"If the Dodgers agree to play one more game, we will start selling tickets next
week, " a BROS Sports Marketing executive said Monday, with the game to played
in Taipei on March 12.</P>
      <P>The Dodgers are currently scheduled to play two games in Taiwan in mid-March
against a CPBL All-Star team, on March 13 in Taipei and on March 14 in
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The executive said Taipei's Tienmu Baseball Stadium can only accommodate a crowd
of 8,500 after seats with bad viewing angles are eliminated, prompting many fans
to complain about the lack of tickets and leaving them hoping that the Dodgers
could play one more game.</P>
      <P>BROS revealed that several Dodgers felt it would be fine to play an extra game
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>This will be the Dodgers' second trip to Taiwan, and the third time since 2008
that a Major League team from the United States has traveled to Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: End tax exemption for servicemen, teachers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/22/10  21:10:09
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>During its last session, the Legislative Yuan shelved a draft amendment to the
Income Tax Act aimed at revoking the income tax exemption for military
servicemen and public school teachers.</P>
      <P>At  President  Ma  Ying-jeou's  insistence,  the  ruling Kuomintang-controlled
legislature has agreed to list the package as a priority bill to be passed
during its new session.</P>
      <P>The bill has become a test of Ma's moral integrity and his commitment to uphold
fairness and justice in tax policy, as he promised on the presidential campaign
trail. If the bill clears the legislative floor, we believe Ma will receive
support and praise from independent voters.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons the bill should be passed is because military and teaching
jobs are no longer low-paying, as they were in the past. The incomes of teachers
and military servicemen are actually much higher than the national average.
Moreover, they enjoy lifelong pensions and many other fringe benefits. It is
extremely unfair for them to be exempted from income tax payments.</P>
      <P>A fair tax system is an important gauge of social progress. No other advanced
country in the world offers tax exemptions for soldiers or officers.</P>
      <P>Some senior military officers have reportedly threatened Ma not to reinstate
income taxes on service members. They said the ruling Kuomintang's embarrassing
defeat in January's legislative by-election was the result of a boycott of
family members of many military servicemen due to their discontent with Ma's
income tax reinstatement plan.</P>
      <P>If such reports were true, we feel ashamed by the selfishness of our soldiers,
and we hope Ma will never yield to their threat. (Feb. 22, 2010)</P>

      <P>A locally produced documentary designed to warn people of the threats climate

hundreds of audience members shouted, "Save the Earth."</P>

entertainers, celebrities and volunteers in shouting, "Save the Earth. Save

      <P>The documentary titled "Plus or Minus 2 Degrees Celsius, " which reflects the
widely held belief that the Earth's temperatures should be controlled within 2

      <P>The 70-minute film, which receiving NT$8 million in funding from Hon Hai Group
Chairman Terry Gou, Quanta Computer Chairman Barry Lam and several other local
businessmen, was completed less than five months after Typhoon Morakot ravaged
southern Taiwan in August last year.</P>
      <P>Sisy Chen, the main producer of what is being described as Taiwan's first

Linbian townships in the southern county of Pingtung, and Mailiao Township in
the central-southern county of Yunlin, where Taiwan's largest petrochemical
complex is located.</P>
      <P>Chen therefore urged the government to elevate the climate change issue to the

said Monday.</P>
      <P>GTSM Chairman Gordon Chen said that during last year's economic slump, only 20
companies applied to be listed, and he expected the number to increase to 40, or
even 50, this year.</P>
      <P>Among the potential applicants, 10 companies operating abroad are eyeing primary
listings in Taiwan, including enterprises from China, Southeast Asia, and
Silicon Valley in the United States, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A company applying to engage in OTC trading must have paid-in capital of at
least NT$50 million (US$1.56 million) . At present, there are 548 companies
listed on the OTC.</P>
      <P>Chen also expected that another 50 companies would apply to list on GreTai's
emerging stock market in 2010, with 15 to 20 of them companies operated by
Taiwanese businessmen abroad.</P>
      <P>There are 235 companies currently listed on the emerging stock market.</P>
      <P>Emerging stocks are common stocks traded on the GreTai Securities Market by

      <P>Fascinating lanterns and special events celebrating the Lantern Festival, which
falls on Feb. 28 this year, will attract millions of visitors from home and
abroad and boost business in the tourism sector, the Tourism Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, the Tourism Bureau has pulled together the resources of local
governments and the private sector to actively promote one of Taiwan's most
celebrated and colorful traditional festivals.</P>
      <P>It has staged the official Taiwan Lantern Festival celebration in a different
city every year, and this year's host, Chiayi City in central Taiwan, is
expecting the week-long festivities to draw 420,000 visitors and pump NT$1.68
billion into the local economy.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, festivities at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall plaza will open on Feb.
26 and last until March 7, with student groups performing folk dances in the
afternoons and professional dance troupes, bands and singers performing in the
evenings.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City opened its celebration of the Tiger Lamp Festival along the Love
River on Feb. 20. The festivities will last until March 7 and feature shows
showcasing performing artists from the United States, Japan, and Korea in
addition to local music, dance and drama groups.</P>
      <P>While lantern exhibitions around the island will highlight the traditional
festival -- marking the 15th day of the first moon in the lunar calendar -- many
practices related to folk beliefs are also big attractions for domestic and
international tourists.</P>
      <P>The most prominent include the "Fengpao"  ceremony,  where thousands of
firecrackers hung on a tall wooden stand are set off in Yanshuei, Tainan County,
and the spectacle of hundreds of lanterns being launched into the sky in Taipei
County's Pingsi.</P>
      <P>Also, on Feb. 27, large crowds will jump into the ocean near the scenic Yehliu
Geopark on Taiwan's northern coast in a ritual bath in observance of local
deities' visit to the area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH mulls financing artificial births</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  23  (CNA)
02/23/10  12:18:59
(By Chen Ching-fang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) is considering financing artificial births as a
last resort to boost Taiwan's declining birth rate, after a spate of measures to
reverse the trend have not produced the desired results.</P>
      <P>The DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion is expected to propose the idea at a
meeting called by the Ministry of the Interior that will discuss policy
incentives to increase Taiwan's birth rate.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsiu-ying, deputy director-general of the bureau, said Taiwan can emulate its
Asian neighbors, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea, to financially
support artificial reproduction.</P>
      <P>In South Korea, Wu said, married women under the age of 45 who are unable to
have babies are allowed to apply up to two times for a grant of NT$50,000
(US$1,563) to participate in the artificial reproduction plan.</P>
      <P>Professionals  with the Taiwanese  Society for Reproductive Medicine welcomed
the idea.</P>
      <P>Wu Kuo-chang, director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tri-
Service General Hospital, said that about 8,000 to 10,000 child-seeking
Taiwanese couples try to have babies through artificial reproduction each year
at an average cost of NT$100,000 per attempt.</P>
      <P>"If the government subsidizes half of the cost, equal to about NT$400 million to
NT$500 million a year, it would help those who want to have children but can't,
contribute to the birth rate," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsin-fu, a doctor with National Taiwan University Hospital's Reproductive
Endocrinology and Infertility Division, said the number of couples seeking to
reproduce artificially increased by over one-third in South Korea after its
government implemented its financial assistance plan.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan follows suit, based on an average test tube baby success rate of 25-35
percent, an additional 1,000 new babies could be born in the country each year,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Lee Mao-sheng, a board member of the Taiwanese Society for Reproductive
Medicine, said Taiwan has among the lowest birth rates of any country in the
world at 8.3 births per 1,000 people, comparable to Germany and even lower than
Austria and Japan, countries with traditionally low birth rates.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Ministry of the Interior, Lee said that in
2009, there were 191,310 babies born in Taiwan, a decrease of 3.7 percent from
the previous year.</P>
      <P>With roughly about one in seven married couples finding it difficult to have a
child, the financial assistance idea could help stem the decline, Lee contended.</P>
      <P>"If the funding incentive is implemented, child-seeking Taiwanese couples,
financially-disadvantaged ones in particular, will directly benefit," Lee said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Taoyuan airport needs a new vision</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/23/10  12:24:54
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, the nation's gateway to the world, has not
performed satisfactorily despite the nation's progress in developing its
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Airports Council International (ACI) recently announced the top performing
airports in its annual airport service quality passenger survey, with Asia
Pacific airports sweeping the top spots. The top honors went to the airports in
Seoul, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing and Hyderabad.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan airport's ranking, on the other hand, plunged to 27th place in 2009
from 14th in 2007. We have to reflect upon the big drop.</P>
      <P>Those who have visited the five top airports will immediately notice the
difference. The first would be the flow of passengers of every race, color and
dress, as well as the airports' fully packed restaurants and boutiques.</P>
      <P>In comparison, restaurants at the Taoyuan airport are poor in quality and
quantity, and charge prohibitively high prices even though they do not showcase
Taiwan's many gourmet cuisines.</P>
      <P>The shops have no cultural features and the design of the airport has no style.
It seems that there is no overall concept to its management, and it is not well
connected to mass rapid transportation systems.</P>
      <P>The government should strengthen its facilities and management and aim at making
the airport an important  hub in Asia by strengthening links with local tourism,
promoting cultural marketing, soliciting more passengers and building a
convenient transportation network.</P>
      <P>We know that the airport's many woes result from low passenger numbers, making
operational costs higher. We therefore believe the government needs to give it
more support, at least in the initial stage. But in the longer term, it will
need a visionary national marketing plan. (Feb. 23, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan reports fastest economic growth in years</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Gross domestic product (GDP)
02/23/10  13:01:53
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>in Taiwan surged 9.22 percent in the fourth quarter on a year-on-year basis,
2.33 percentage points higher than previously forecast.</P>
      <P>The government statistics bureau attributed the rebound to robust exports,
strong private consumption and increasing visits by tourists from China.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) also
revised upwards its forecast for Taiwan's economic growth in 2010, predicting
GDP will grow 4.72 percent rather than the previously forecast 4.39 percent.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local newspaper coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>According to preliminary DGBAS estimates, Taiwan's GDP grew 9.22 percent in Q4
because of stronger-than-expected private consumption, robust growth in
triangular trade (receiving orders in Taiwan and shipping the goods from
overseas destinations) , and an increase in Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>The figure represented the highest quarterly growth rate since Q3 2004.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also forecast that Taiwan's per capita gross national product (GNP)
will hit a historical high of over US$18,000 this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first posted per-capita GNP of US$10,000 in 1992, which grew to US$17,000
in 2007, before the onset of the global financial storm.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Most scholars remain cautious over the perception that rising GDP growth will
benefit the labor market. National Dong Hwa University's College of Management
Dean Wu Chung-shu believes the economic outlook will continue to get better.</P>
      <P>However, although the DGBAS forecast a 4.72 percent GDP growth rate for this
year, such a performance can only be seen as a "gradual recovery " instead of a
"robust recovery, " Wu said, casting doubt that the recovery will greatly help
improve unemployment.</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Although the DGBAS predicted the country will enjoy an economic growth rate of
4.72 percent this year, the recovery still faces four potential problems --
credit issues, appreciation of the Chinese yuan, currency policy and the ending
of easy monetary policies.</P>
      <P>Scholars and Council for Economic Planning and Development officials suggested
extra attention should be paid to the possible impact of the signing of an
economic cooperation framework agreement between the two sides across Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bert J. Lim, head of the World Economics Society, asked the
government to ponder the possible challenges facing Taiwan's economic growth,
including doubts that growth in "triangular trade" can promote the expansion of
the domestic manufacturing and commercial services sectors.</P>
      <P>Lim also appeared cautious about a solid recovery in Taiwan this year, citing
the DGBAS' forecast of a gradual quarterly decline in the real GDP growth rate.</P>
      <P>It is also debatable whether increasing investment -- mostly from high-tech
industries -- can greatly help strengthen domestic income, employment and tax
revenues, he added.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih would not speculate Tuesday on who will succeed Vice Premier

the nomination process for a candidate in the race, Wu said the issue of Chu's
successor will be discussed at a later date.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu declined to comment on a poll conducted by The China Times, which
says that former Premier Su Tseng-chang of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party would beat Chu by 11 percentage points in the Xinbei City mayoral
election. The election is widely seen as a bellwether of the KMT's chances in
the 2012 presidential race.</P>
      <P>Chu asserted that he remained focused on his duties as vice premier, which he
defined as tackling unemployment and bringing the jobless rate to under 5
percent, reviving domestic economic growth to at least 4.8 percent, and
stabilizing commodity prices.</P>

    <DATELINE>02/23/10  14:12:34
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei's decision not to run for re-election in
year-end elections dominated local newspaper headlines Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of the leading newspaper's report about it:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Although Chou decided to step aside to make way for Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu
to run for the top spot in Xinbei City, as the upgraded Taipei County has been
provisionally named, Chu lags behind his possible Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) rival Su Tseng-chang, in a poll conducted by the China Times.</P>
      <P>The survey carried out Monday after Chou announced his decision showed that Su
leads Chu 40 percent to 29 percent.</P>
      <P>Su's support rate remained almost unchanged compared to a similar survey by The
China Times in February when he received 41 percent of the vote, while Chu's
support rate declined by 7 percentage points, probably because of the public's
sympathy for Chou.</P>
      <P>However, Chu would defeat three other DPP leaders -- Tsai Ing-wen, Yu Shyi-kun
and Frank Hsieh -- in a two-way race, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Although Chou's decision was made with the presumption that Su will be the DPP's
nominee in the race, the former premier kept his cards close to his vest Monday.</P>
      <P>One of Su's aides said Su would not rule out any possibility for the time being.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers were split over how the party should respond to Chou's decision.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Sing-nan said Su should take up the challenge because whichever
party wins three of the five seats up for grabs in the year-end special
municipality elections will gain an advantage in the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Legislator Gao Jyh-peng said the move was a trap set for Su
by the KMT, and he urged Su not to play into the KMT's hands by running in
Xinbei City. (Feb. 23, 2010) The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen dismissed Chou's decision as a KMT campaign trick
designed to boost its underdog candidates in the Feb. 27 legislative by-
elections.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable that Chou became a lame duck one year before the end of his
term. It hurt Chou, Chu and the voters of Taipei County." Tsai said. (Feb. 23,
2010) United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chou has only himself to blame for his low approval rating, especially after he
tarnished his image irrevocably in 2007 when he led a group of officials to
track a tiger that had reportedly eaten goats in a county town.</P>
      <P>The tiger turned out to be a stray dog, turning Chou into a laughingstock.</P>
      <P>However, he will be remembered as an unselfish statesman who put his party's
benefit ahead of his own because of his decision not to seek re-election.</P>
      <P>His decision, however, does not ensure Chu's election in Xinbei City, as the KMT
administration's overall approval rating is still flagging.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, local elected officials in Taipei County who will lose their jobs
after the county is converted into a municipality might vote for the opposition
party out of anger, and by the same token, Chou's followers might not support
Chu in an election. (Feb. 23, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan may be included as a stop on the Ladies Professional Golf Association
(LPGA) tour next year if sponsors can be found to help finance a tournament that
may carry a US$4 million price tag.</P>
      <P>Eily Ho, manager of the Peitou Kuohua Golf County Club in Taipei, said she
discussed the possibility of holding an LPGA tournament in Taiwan with LPGA
officials  on the sideline of the 2010 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando, Florida
early this month.</P>
      <P>"They responded positively," she said.</P>
      <P>Ho has targeted Oct. 25, 2011, during the LPGA Tour's yearly Asian swing in the
fall, as the date for the tournament in Taiwan. She hopes to offer a purse as
high as US$2 million, US$700,000 more than the US$1.3 million in prize money put
up at the Honda PTT LPGA Thailand, which concluded Feb. 21 in Pattaya.</P>
      <P>In addition to the prize money, another US$2 million is needed to finance the
cost of holding the tournament, said Ho, who has begun to look actively for
sponsors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-born LPGA star Yani Tseng,  who urged President Ma Ying-jeou last year to
have the government sponsor an LPGA tournament in Taiwan, told the Central News
Agency in Pattaya Tuesday that she looked forward to a tour event being played
in her home country.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Honda PTT LPGA Thailand had brought together more than 30 of the
top female golfers from around the world, Tseng said she was sure a tour stop in
Taiwan would attract even more top players  and  spectators  and  enhance  the
island's  profile significantly.</P>
      <P>The LPGA Tour has been hit hard by the global economic downturn, with many
sponsors  dropping  their support  of women's golf. Thirty-three events were
scheduled last year (though only 30 were played), compared to 26 tournaments
scheduled for 2010.</P>
      <P>That has left many open dates for those interested in holding LPGA tournaments,
but it has proven to be a tough sell in today's difficult economic environment.</P>

      <P>China raised its deposit reserve requirement ratio prior to the Chinese New Year
holiday for the second time this year. The international community saw it as an
attempt to cushion inflationary pressures due to the influx of hot money, which
flowed into the country in anticipation of the appreciation of the Chinese yuan.</P>
      <P>With Goldman  Sachs predicting  yuan appreciation  and the possibility that the
Obama administration could force China to appreciate its currency, the speed and
scale of hot money flowing into China will only accelerate, affecting its
economic stability and straining already tense U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>If the tensions deepen, it will affect the nascent global economic recovery, and
Taiwan will not come out unscathed.</P>
      <P>Is yuan appreciation unavoidable? We believe the answer is positive.</P>
      <P>The appreciation of the yuan will lead to China losing its edge in labor-
intensive industries, but it will also force China to embark on upgrading its
industrial base.</P>
      <P>In that case, there will no longer be a vertical division of labor between
Taiwan and China. Instead, the two will be pitted against each other as direct
competitors.</P>
      <P>And that means the yuan appreciation will not only be China's problem but a
threat to Taiwan's economic future as well. Facing such a threat, how is
possible not to prepare seriously to counter it?</P>

      <P>Su, who served as premier under former President Chen Shui-bian, said in the
eastern county of Hualien that he will not "dance to the tune" of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) , which he accused of having schemed to upgrade or merge
several cities into new municipalities and to force Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-
wei to forsake his bid to enter the Xinbei City mayoral race.</P>
      <P>"All these schemes targeted me, " he claimed during a campaign rally in Hualien
to drum up support for DPP candidate Hsiao Bi-khim in the legislative by-
election there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, three DPP councilors of Taipei County urged Su Tuesday to announce
his bid for the Xinbei City mayoral election as soon as possible to generate a
"coattails effect" for the DPP, as the popular politician's endorsement could
boost the DPP's chances in the race.</P>
      <P>In related news, KMT Legislator Wu Ching-chih said that same day that the ruling
party should immediately name Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu as the KMT's nominee
for the Xinbei City mayoral race, an election widely seen as a bellwether of the
KMT's chances in the 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Noting that according to a China Times poll, Su would beat Chu by 11 percentage
points in a Xinbei City mayoral election, Wu said Chu should quit his post now
and begin his campaign drive to broaden his support base before it is too late.</P>

      <P>Legislative by-elections will be held in the four counties of Hsinchu, Taoyuan,
Chiayi and Hualien Feb. 27.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) presently has 74 seats in the legislature, compared
with the 30 seats held by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>In the face of this huge imbalance in the legislature in his favor, why is
President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman, making such all-out efforts
to stump for KMT candidates?</P>
      <P>His extreme uneasiness can be traced to his keen desire to have more of his
people in the legislature to rubberstamp his "China-tilt" policy.</P>
      <P>We know that policy toward China is the most sensitive issue in Taiwan, and one
that requires an internal consensus prior to earning public trust. But whether
it has been signing agreements with China, amending laws or administrative
orders, the Ma administration has conducted all of them in closed-door meetings
and has refused to countenance even the minimum of legislative supervision.</P>
      <P>It should be clear now why Ma is putting aside his duties as the nation's
president and is so busy stumping for his men prior to the elections. (Feb. 23,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that Taiwan's gross domestic product for 2010
will rise to 4.9 percent, higher than the government's bureau of statistics'
estimate.</P>
      <P>In his policy address to the Legislative Yuan, Wu highlighted the government's
plans to achieve economic development.</P>
      <P>Citing the latest forecast by Global Insight, Wu said Taiwan economic recovery
will be steady and economic growth of 4.9 percent will be achieved this year,
which will be higher than the projected average 2.9 percent globally. Taiwan
will also surpass the economic growth rate of the United States, Japan, the
European Union, Hong Kong, and South Korea this year, he predicted.</P>
      <P>He said his Cabinet's economic goals for 2010 include lifting Taiwan's ranking
in the World Business Environment Survey 10 notches higher than its 46th place
in 2009.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet also aims to improve the country's business and investment
environment and has set a private investment target of NT$1 trillion (US$31.22
billion) this year, he said.</P>
      <P>He further expressed hopes that the production value of the country's six main
emerging sectors -- biotech, green energy, tourism, health care, quality
agriculture and cultural innovation -- will increase from the projected NT$2.1
trillion for this year to NT$2.8  trillion  in 2012 and will provide  152,000
new job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the government's  efforts to sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China, Wu predicted that the pact will help boost Taiwan's
GDP by 1.65 percent to 1.72 percent and produce 257,000 to 263,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>The ECFA will "help people do business, and boost Taiwan's competitiveness," the
premier said.</P>
      <P>Other government initiatives will include building housing units for low-income
and less-privilege families and providing low-interest loans for the young
people to lease or purchase homes, he said.</P>
      <P>On the issue of global warming, Wu promised that all governmental institutions
and public schools around the country will adopt measures to save energy and
reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned plans to formulate criteria for the development of low-carbon
cities and to promote low-carbon sightseeing tours in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A total of 2,425 FamilyMart convenience stores across the country started
offering high speed rail ticketing services Tuesday, enabling passengers to buy
or pick up tickets outside train stations in mere minutes.</P>
      <P>As of 9: 45 a.m., 345 orders for tickets had been placed at Taiwan FamilyMart
Co. convenience stores countrywide, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC)
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The convenience store's ticketing system hopes to cash in on the ticket buying
habits of high speed rail passengers. According to THSRC research, 70 percent of
its customers buy tickets earlier on the same day that they travel.</P>
      <P>Using the FamilyMart service network, passengers will be able to book tickets
for trains departing from one hour to 15 days after the purchase is made for an
extra service charge of NT$10 per ticket, THSRC said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the company explained, the public can also book high speed rail
tickets on the Internet or by telephone in advance and then pick them up at
FamilyMart convenience stores.</P>
      <P>FamilyMart has invested some NT$50 million (US$1.56 million) in the ticketing
system, and the tickets passengers get at its stores will have upgraded anti-
forgery safety measures and QR code numbers. A QR code is a two-dimensional bar
code.</P>
      <P>More than 4,000 7-Eleven convenience stores are also expected to offer the high
speed rail ticketing system in May after the negotiations between the two
companies come to a conclusion, THSRC added.</P>
      <P>According to a THSRC spokesman, the company is planning to launch stored value
cards in the form of ticket books and monthly passes with discounts in the
months ahead.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei is a typical example of how a politician could be
hurt by attempts to play to the gallery.</P>
      <P>Few people can explain why Chou is so unpopular in various surveys. He is known
to have impeccable integrity and to be diligent in his work, although his
performance may not be very excellent. Chen Hsin-ching, speaker of the Taipei
County Council, lauded Chou as the most hard-working Taipei magistrate in
memory.</P>
      <P>But Chou made a fool of himself in 2007 when he led a 32-member posse in an
attempt to track a tiger that was reportedly mauling goats on farms in Linkou,
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The purported tiger turned out to be a stray dog, and Chou, who tried to milk
publicity from the incident, became a laughingstock.</P>
      <P>His political rivals dubbed him "The Rear" because he often brought up the rear
in public opinion surveys. Thisis a nickname he can hardly shed now, although he
has not been assessed objectively in the polls since that incident.</P>
      <P>Voters are not always rational -- they sometimes support election candidates
suspected of corruption but they cannot stand ridiculous public figures.</P>
      <P>Chou could have used drastic means to fight the unfair treatment he usually gets
in opinion polls, but he chose to step aside in favor of his Kuomintang (KMT)
colleague with a grace rarely seen in modern politics.</P>
      <P>His decision has defused a KMT crisis and served to refurish Chou's political
image. This could spur a political rebirth for him.</P>
      <P>Politicians who like to play to the gallery would do well to keep in mind the
lesson that Chou learned the hard way. (Feb. 23, 2010)</P>

      <P>Speaking at a gathering of local shippers, Yeh said the volume of goods loaded

tons in 2008 owing to the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>In order to reverse the decline, the vice minister said his ministry will

Ministry to pave the way for the establishment of a harbor company to operate
the country's four international harbors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A large amount of dried day lily from China is entering Taiwan illegally by
being passed off as a product of Vietnam, hurting local farmers' interests,
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers charged Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers suggested that the large volume of the banned imports has violated
President Ma Ying-jeou's promise to safeguard the rights and livelihoods of
local farmers at a time when Taiwan is in talks with China over a proposed pact
to expand trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently bans the import of 830 Chinese agricultural products, including
dried day lily, and the president has vowed that the restrictions would be
maintained even if a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement with
China is signed.</P>
      <P>But banned Chinese agricultural products have found their way into Taiwan either
through smuggling or being represented as the product of a third country.</P>
      <P>Citing customs statistics, DPP Legislator Pan Men-an said Tuesday that 73,830
kilograms of dried day lily, purportedly from Vietnam, were imported into Taiwan
in 2009, a 27 percent rise from the 58,108 kilograms that entered Taiwan's
market in 2008.</P>
      <P>Last month alone, another 39,984 kilograms of dried day lily were imported into
Taiwan to satisfy higher demand during the Lunar New Year holiday, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The shipments have invariably been accompanied by Vietnamese certificates of
origin, but Pan said Vietnam does not produce a lot of day lily, and he
contended that fake certificates of origin were used to get around the ban on
importing the agricultural product from China.</P>
      <P>"A certificate of origin can be bought at the price of less than US$350," he
said.</P>
      <P>One customs official familiar with the case told the Central News Agency,
however, that the certificate of origin is not the only document checked when
screening incoming shipments.</P>
      <P>Importers' transaction and transportation documents are also checked to ensure
the origin of the imported goods.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized
to speak on the record, said Vietnamese customs officials are also working with
Taiwan to prevent their country from being blamed unfairly for helping other
countries engage in illegal imports.</P>
      <P>But the DPP lawmakers are convinced the day lily invading Taiwan comes from
China.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lai Kun-cheng said a percentage of the imported dried day lily
had been found to contain excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide, posing a threat
to human health.</P>
      <P>Lee Wang-ting, a day lily farmer from Taitung County in eastern Taiwan, said
that the low price of the Chinese day lily has had a serious impact on the
livelihoods of local farmers.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese day lily is being sold at the wholesale price of about NT$500 per
kilo, while the price of Chinese day lily is less than NT$170 per kilo, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee also pointed out that dried Chinese day lily often looks whiter than the
Taiwanese product because it has been bleached.</P>

      <P>Regardless of its nature or size, any business deemed to be engaged in
industrial innovation and job creation can be eligible to receive incentives
provided by a bill that aims to upgrade industrial innovation, Premier Wu Den-
yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Replying to questions from ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lu Shiow-yen at a
legislative meeting, Wu said the bill is not designed to benefit only big
multinationals, and that local small- and medium-sized businesses that meet the
two conditions, irrespective of their size or the sector in which they operate,
can apply for the incentives suggested in the bill.</P>
      <P>As the Executive Yuan listed the industrial innovation bill as the top priority
that needs to be swiftly cleared by the Legislative Yuan in the new session that
opened that day, the move provoked strong  suspicion  that  the bill was
customized  for foreign conglomerates, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that clauses in the bill stipulating that only the world's 500 biggest
enterprises that have set up operations in Taiwan can be subject to a 15 percent
corporation income tax break have been scrapped, the premier said that "in the
future, any new provisions added to the bill must not be discriminatory and must
not benefit only alien firms. "</P>
      <P>The disputed  clauses,  deemed as benefiting  only foreign enterprises, had
stirred up widespread discontent among leading local business groups.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Guo threatened in mid-February that he would move
his company's headquarters out of Taiwan if the Legislative Yuan were to grant
the 15 percent tax break only to "foreign" enterprises.</P>
      <P>"Why does the government treat us as worthless, while treating foreign companies
like treasure?" asked an angry Guo.</P>
      <P>Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said large enterprises in Taiwan have been defamed and
warned the government that they would be forced to leave Taiwan if the bill were
to pass the legislature.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that five or six foreign governments have provided incentives to
Acer in the hope of attracting the computer firm to set up operations hubs in
their countries, Wang urged the government not to "sacrifice large business
groups' interests to court small companies."</P>
      <P>In the same legislative meeting, Wu also answered Lu's questions concerning a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>The premier said the Executive Yuan will do its utmost to push for the sealing
of the trade pact that will allow some Taiwanese products to enter the Chinese
market tariff-free.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan cannot afford to wait any longer in the face of the formation of the
ASEAN plus one trade bloc," he said.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan fails to sign the ECFA with China in time, local businesses will be
increasingly impacted and quickly hollowed out, " he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that Taiwan will not forsake plans to purchase
the more advanced F-16 C/D fighter jets as well as diesel-electric submarines
from the United States, amid a U.S. government report which suggested the
island's current fleet was too old and weak.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Wu pointed out that the recent US$6.4 billion
package of arms that Washington announced in late January it wants to sell to
Taiwan does not include the advanced F-16 C/D fighter planes and diesel-electric
submarines long sought by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's current fleet of older F-16 A/B fighter jets and submarines are several
years old. The arms package instead consists of 60 UH-60M Black Hawk
helicopters, two Osprey Class mine hunting ships, 12 ATM-84L and RTM-84L Harpoon
Block II Telemetry missiles, 114 Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles
and communications equipment.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of the advanced  F-16 planes and the submarines from the
list, Wu said, the United States has never shut the door to future sales of F-16
C/D fighters and submarines to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The two sides are still talking over this matter, " the premier told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that military capabilities across the Taiwan Strait have tilted in
favor of China for many years. Developing "lean and mean, small, but excellent"
weaponry to beef up Taiwan's self-defense preparedness remains Taiwan's basic
military policy, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense on Tuesday refuted a report by
the U.S. government's Defense Intelligence Agency that said many of the island's
400 combat aircrafts would not be able to help Taiwan withstand an attack from
rival China.</P>
      <P>"In recent years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has increased the
quantity and sophistication of its ballistic and cruise missiles and fighter
aircraft opposite Taiwan, which has diminished Taiwan's ability to deny PRC
efforts to attain air superiority in a conflict," the U.S. agency's report said.</P>
      <P>The one-off report, ordered by the U.S. Congress, says upgrades are needed for
Taiwan as China gets stronger.</P>
      <P>Discounting the report's description of the Republic of China Air Force's
fighter planes as not capable of withstanding an attack from China, Han Keng-
sheng, deputy Air Force chief of staff, said the description was untrue.</P>
      <P>"Despite being old, our fighter planes are operationally capable of meeting
minimum combat needs," Han said.</P>
      <P>However, the defense ministry acknowledged it is an undeniable truth that China
has become increasingly strong militarily compared to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both Wu and the defense ministry made the remarks Tuesday in response to reports
by foreign wire service agencies from Taipei the day before about the U.S.
report.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Half a century ago, Taiwan's economy shone, maintaining an annual growth rate of
9 percent for three consecutive decades. During this period of rapid economic
growth, it also achieved a more equitable distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>"Made in Taiwan" products flooded Western countries and helped contribute to
Taiwan's boom.</P>
      <P>But the glory faded about 20 years ago due to drastic changes in the domestic
political and economic environment, laws and tax systems, as well as the
catching up of several neighboring countries that emulated Taiwan's success
model.</P>
      <P>The closed-door policies advocated by former presidents Lee Teng-hui and Chen
Shui-bian also meant that Taiwan missed a great opportunity to use China as a
conduit for export processing.</P>
      <P>But as wages in China have increased, along with a shortfall in workers and
surges in taxes and land prices, a window of opportunity has opened, giving
Taiwan a chance to retrieve its past glory.</P>
      <P>The government should turn idle land surrounding Taichung and Taipei harbors
into special trade zones with the incentives of low taxes, high efficiency and

comprised of the mid- and up-stream industries will be formed. In this way, the

      <P>The balance of payments of the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in
2009 registered a record surplus of US$54.13 billion, reflecting an increase in
the bank's reserve assets, according to statistics released by the bank Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The bank reported that for 2009, the bank's current account showed a surplus of
US$42.57 billion, up 69.46 percent from that of the previous year, while its
financial account had a net inflow of US$13.98 billion, the first net inflow

      <P>Boosted by a global economic recovery, business growth and job openings in the
country's three major high-tech parks will be conspicuous this year, the
Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The NSC reported that the three facilities -- the Hsinchu Science and Industrial
Park in Hsinchu County, the Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan County and
the Central Taiwan Science Park in Taichung city and county -- recorded a
combined turnover of NT$1.58 trillion (US$49.56 billion) in 2009, a 13.9 percent
slide from the previous year, as a result of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Despite the deep recession last year, the three parks posted a combined turnover
of NT$951.8 billion in the second half of the year on the back of an initial
economic recovery. The figure was 16.2 percent up compared to the year-earlier
level, the NSC said.</P>
      <P>According to the NSC, the parks are expected to provide as many as 18,000 jobs
this year.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park Administration said the northern Taiwan
hi-tech park is to sponsor a job fair March 13 with 4,000 jobs on offer.
Administration officials estimated that the park will offer some 5,000 jobs for
the whole of 2010.</P>
      <P>A total of 132,161 workers were employed in the Hsinchu park last year, up by
1.2 percent from the 2008 level, according to the administration.</P>
      <P>The park mainly hosts companies in the semiconductor  and optoelectronic
sectors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Southern Taiwan Science Park Administration said between 6,000
and 10,000 jobs could be on offer this year in the park, thanks to business
expansion among the companies operating there. Leading enterprises such as Chi
Mei, TSMC and UMC will be the major drivers of the job creation, it added.</P>
      <P>In 2009, a total of 48,626 workers were employed in the park's mostly
biotechnology and medical equipment companies, marking a small increase of 1
percent compared to the 2008 figure.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park Administration said for its part that there will
be 2,000-3,000 jobs available in the park this year. Last year, 19,845 employees
worked there, down from the 20,736 employed in 2008, it said.  The hi-tech park

      <P>Taiwan FamilyMart Chairman Pan Jin-tin attributed the growth to the chain's

      <P>Children's Day and Women's Day were separate national holidays in Taiwan until

decided that Women and Children's Day would no longer be a national holiday.</P>

      <P>Regardless of its nature or size, any business deemed to be engaged in
industrial innovation and job creation can be eligible to receive incentives
provided by a bill that aims to upgrade industrial innovation, Premier Wu Den-
yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Replying to questions from ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lu Shiow-yen at a
legislative meeting, Wu said the bill is not designed to benefit only big
multinationals, and that local small- and medium-sized businesses that meet the
two conditions, irrespective of their size or the sector in which they operate,
can apply for the incentives suggested in the bill.</P>
      <P>As the Executive Yuan listed the industrial innovation bill as the top priority
that needs to be swiftly cleared by the Legislative Yuan in the new session that
opened that day, the move provoked strong  suspicion  that  the bill was
customized  for foreign conglomerates, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that clauses in the bill stipulating that only the world's 500 biggest
enterprises that have set up operations in Taiwan can be subject to a 15 percent
corporation income tax break have been scrapped, the premier said that "in the
future, any new provisions added to the bill must not be discriminatory and must
not benefit only alien firms. "</P>
      <P>The disputed  clauses,  deemed as benefiting  only foreign enterprises, had
stirred up widespread discontent among leading local business groups.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Guo threatened in mid-February that he would move
his company's headquarters out of Taiwan if the Legislative Yuan were to grant
the 15 percent tax break only to "foreign" enterprises.</P>
      <P>"Why does the government treat us as worthless, while treating foreign companies
like treasure?" asked an angry Guo.</P>
      <P>Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said large enterprises in Taiwan have been defamed and
warned the government that they would be forced to leave Taiwan if the bill were
to pass the legislature.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that five or six foreign governments have provided incentives to
Acer in the hope of attracting the computer firm to set up operations hubs in
their countries, Wang urged the government not to "sacrifice large business
groups' interests to court small companies."</P>
      <P>In the same legislative meeting, Wu also answered Lu's questions concerning a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>The premier said the Executive Yuan will do its utmost to push for the sealing
of the trade pact that will allow some Taiwanese products to enter the Chinese
market tariff-free.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan cannot afford to wait any longer in the face of the formation of the
ASEAN plus one trade bloc," he said.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan fails to sign the ECFA with China in time, local businesses will be
increasingly impacted and quickly hollowed out, " he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that Taiwan will not forsake plans to purchase
the more advanced F-16 C/D fighter jets as well as diesel-electric submarines
from the United States, amid a U.S. government report which suggested the
island's current fleet was too old and weak.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Wu pointed out that the recent US$6.4 billion
package of arms that Washington announced in late January it wants to sell to
Taiwan does not include the advanced F-16 C/D fighter planes and diesel-electric
submarines long sought by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's current fleet of older F-16 A/B fighter jets and submarines are several
years old. The arms package instead consists of 60 UH-60M Black Hawk
helicopters, two Osprey Class mine hunting ships, 12 ATM-84L and RTM-84L Harpoon
Block II Telemetry missiles, 114 Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) missiles
and communications equipment.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of the advanced  F-16 planes and the submarines from the
list, Wu said, the United States has never shut the door to future sales of F-16
C/D fighters and submarines to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The two sides are still talking over this matter, " the premier told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that military capabilities across the Taiwan Strait have tilted in
favor of China for many years. Developing "lean and mean, small, but excellent"
weaponry to beef up Taiwan's self-defense preparedness remains Taiwan's basic
military policy, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense on Tuesday refuted a report by
the U.S. government's Defense Intelligence Agency that said many of the island's
400 combat aircrafts would not be able to help Taiwan withstand an attack from
rival China.</P>
      <P>"In recent years, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has increased the
quantity and sophistication of its ballistic and cruise missiles and fighter
aircraft opposite Taiwan, which has diminished Taiwan's ability to deny PRC
efforts to attain air superiority in a conflict," the U.S. agency's report said.</P>
      <P>The one-off report, ordered by the U.S. Congress, says upgrades are needed for
Taiwan as China gets stronger.</P>
      <P>Discounting the report's description of the Republic of China Air Force's
fighter planes as not capable of withstanding an attack from China, Han Keng-
sheng, deputy Air Force chief of staff, said the description was untrue.</P>
      <P>"Despite being old, our fighter planes are operationally capable of meeting
minimum combat needs," Han said.</P>
      <P>However, the defense ministry acknowledged it is an undeniable truth that China
has become increasingly strong militarily compared to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both Wu and the defense ministry made the remarks Tuesday in response to reports
by foreign wire service agencies from Taipei the day before about the U.S.
report.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Half a century ago, Taiwan's economy shone, maintaining an annual growth rate of
9 percent for three consecutive decades. During this period of rapid economic
growth, it also achieved a more equitable distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>"Made in Taiwan" products flooded Western countries and helped contribute to
Taiwan's boom.</P>
      <P>But the glory faded about 20 years ago due to drastic changes in the domestic
political and economic environment, laws and tax systems, as well as the
catching up of several neighboring countries that emulated Taiwan's success
model.</P>
      <P>The closed-door policies advocated by former presidents Lee Teng-hui and Chen
Shui-bian also meant that Taiwan missed a great opportunity to use China as a
conduit for export processing.</P>
      <P>But as wages in China have increased, along with a shortfall in workers and
surges in taxes and land prices, a window of opportunity has opened, giving
Taiwan a chance to retrieve its past glory.</P>
      <P>The government should turn idle land surrounding Taichung and Taipei harbors
into special trade zones with the incentives of low taxes, high efficiency and
plentiful foreign labor. This will persuade Taiwanese export processing
manufacturers who have scattered overseas to return home.</P>
      <P>If tens of thousands of down-stream manufacturers were to flock in, bringing
funds, equipment and orders, and make good use of the products of Taiwan's mid-
and up-stream industries, the lifeline of Taiwan's export industry would be

      <P>Taiwan FamilyMart Co. -- the second-largest convenience store chain in Taiwan
after 7-Eleven -- announced Tuesday that its revenue in 2009 totaled NT$39.2
billion (US$1.23 billion) , up 3.62 percent over the 2008 figure despite the
global economic crunch.</P>
      <P>Taiwan FamilyMart Chairman Pan Jin-tin attributed the growth to the chain's
efforts to market new products and its ambition to break into the service area,
such as offering ticket sales for cultural activities, Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corporation tickets and courier services for small packages.</P>
      <P>Pan also announced that his company is planning to open over 100 new branches in
Shanghai this year to cash in on the tremendous potential for consumption in
China's largest city.</P>
      <P>With backing from Tingyi Holding Corp., which controls a more than 50 percent
stake in Taiwan FamilyMart Co., the FamilyMart convenience store network at
present runs over 360 shops in Shanghai, well ahead of 7-Eleven, which has only
18 shops in the city.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Construction of man-made lake in southern Taiwan to start in 2011</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Construction on Taiwan's first large man-made lake will get underway next year
on the border of Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties in southern Taiwan to help
alleviate the area's water shortages, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We have completed planning for the first phase of construction of the man-made
Jiyang Lake, and if all goes well, construction will start early next year, "
said Joses Y.H. Wu, deputy director of the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>With a maximum storage capacity of 27.6 million cubic meters of water, the lake
will be able to supply up to 140,000 cubic tons of water per day, equal to the
daily consumption of 420,000 people, to the greater Kaohsiung area when it is
completed in 2015, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The lake will cover 310 hectares of land at the confluence of the Cishan and
Laonong rivers that straddles Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, 70 percent of the water needed in the Greater Kaohsiung area is
currently drawn from the Gaoping River. Without a reservoir to store water, the
region has often faced water shortages.</P>
      <P>"Such headaches will be largely eased after the completion of Jiyang Lake," Wu
promised optimistically.</P>
      <P>The Jiyang Lake project is included in a draft special statute on dredging out
Tsengwen, Nanhua and Wushantou reservoirs in the Tainan-Chiayi area that was
approved by the Executive Yuan before the Lunar New Year holiday, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The statute will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for screening in the near
future.</P>
      <P>The Jiyang Lake project passed an environmental assessment seven years ago, but
it has been stalled because of conflicting interests involving gravel supplies.</P>
      <P>With gravel prices dropping to NT$520 per cubic meter from a high of NT$620
after Typhoon Morakot hit southern Taiwan last August, the biggest obstacle to
construction of the country's first large man-made lake has been removed, Wu
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Dealing with financial reshuffle carefully</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/24/10  11:08:43
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since the inauguration of the Ma administration, the Cabinet's two vice premiers
have been selected for their financial expertise.</P>
      <P>Now that Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu is set to represent the ruling party to
run in the Xinbei City mayoral election at year's end, we believe the selection
of his replacement to preside over financial and economic affairs in the Cabinet
should be dealt with carefully.</P>
      <P>The person Premier Wu Den-yih will select as his deputy after a reshuffle has
been a hot topic recently. And whether Wu likes it or not, the public will see
his Cabinet as the Cabinet taking the government into the 2012 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Wu is a seasoned politician and he is sensitive to the public's will, but this
could also be a weakness.</P>
      <P>He knows that from now until the 2012 presidential election, every policy that
his administration makes will affect the public and hence the election's
outcome.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, it is easy to understand why hikes in national health
insurance premium rates or the ending of income tax-exemption for military
personnel and teachers have been halted or at least put on hold under his
leadership.</P>
      <P>But we believe a Cabinet that is oversensitive to public opinion will be unable
to attract truly talented people. If Wu does not show any mettle for reform, he
will not be able to draw the caliber of person the Cabinet needs.</P>
      <P>An administrative team has to take into consideration governing as well as
elections. But the two are not contradictory. In fact, they are complementary.
If it can provide good governance, it will be the best boost for future
elections. (Feb. 24, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- National library opens manga reading section</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/24/10  11:34:38
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Central Library opened a new reading section for comic books (also
known as manga) , a landmark measure justifying manga's status in the publishing
sector and its value for readers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over 10,000 volumes form the collection, but only people over the age of 18 are
allowed to enter the section. The comic books cannot be checked out.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of local newspaper coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The section not only features popular comics circulating at manga stores, but
also old comics from China, collections of works by famous French artist Jean
Giraud -- known for his pseudonym Moebius -- and "Mafalda" by illustrator
Joaquin Salvador Lavado (pen name Quino) from Argentina.</P>
      <P>The national library should be the place that stores the most comic books in
Taiwan, in line with regulations requiring publishers to offer copies of their
new books for the library to keep.</P>
      <P>However, under the old restriction barring the national library from putting
comic books on open shelves, the library gave away the comics it collected to
local libraries until recent years.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the rule that bans young people under 18 years old from using the
comic book reading section, library official Yen Wen-ying explained that the
national library plays a different role from other local and school libraries.
It is entrusted with tasks to "collect, manage and keep nationwide books, " as
well as to promote academic research, she noted.</P>
      <P>Once books show signs of damage,  they are taken out of circulation, Yen said,
and the same regulation is applied to comic books.</P>
      <P>The restriction, however, drew protests of teenage manga fans. Li Tzi-yang, a
high school student, suggested the national library open another section for
under-18-year-old manga readers.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The National Central Library will put 10,000 volumes of comic books on its
shelves, but more than 90 percent are Japanese or translations of Japanese
works.</P>
      <P>"If you read comics in Taiwan, you would have the impression that Taiwan is
Japan's dependency, " renowned Taiwanese manga artist Liu Hsin-chin complained.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese manga has been deeply influenced by Japan, Liu said. To develop the
manga industry in Taiwan, the government should create an environment for local
manga artists to create without having to worry about their livelihoods, he
stated. (Feb. 24, 2010)</P>

      <P>The impact on Asian countries, especially Taiwan, will be great if the United
States and China clash. The Obama administration reportedly may try to pressure
China into appreciating its currency to divert attention from the U.S.'
government budget and trade deficits.</P>
      <P>The U.S. is said to be playing the 3T cards -- trade, Tibet, and Taiwan --
against China, while China is anxious to ingratiate itself with Taiwanese. Under
the circumstances, it seems favorable for Taiwan to gain from both sides, but
that may not necessarily happen.</P>
      <P>It will depend on the Ma administration making good use of the situation. It is
fortunate that he has reiterated recently that he wants to sign a trade pact --
the economic cooperation framework agreement -- with China as soon as possible
this year.</P>
      <P>In terms of internal affairs, the Cabinet under Premier Wu Den-yih has made the
livelihood of the people the focus of his Cabinet, and he has achieved speedy
results in resolving public grievances.</P>
      <P>But in addition to small services, the public will be hoping for the government
to establish a more sustainable financial and economic system.</P>
      <P>If the public makes short-term gains, but does not see a fairer or more
reasonable tax system or see the government miss the opportunity to plug big
financial holes, it will end up paying the price in the future.</P>
      <P>We expect the government to shoulder its responsibility and not become an
obstacle for the sustainable development of the nation's economy. (Feb. 24,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ma Ying-jeou administration, far from giving up the thought of signing a
controversial trade pact with China, pushed for it even more aggressively by
singing a duet with China during the Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao, while visiting Taiwanese businessmen in Zhangzhou,
Fujian Province on Lunar New Year's Eve, said China is not mincing words in
signing an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with Taiwan and that
the pact will not only benefit China and will also not hurt Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said later during a gathering with Taiwanese businessmen operating in China
that the signing of the agreement is absolutely vital for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the majority of the Taiwanese public oppose the pact, why is Ma sticking
to his guns against the will of the people?</P>
      <P>The reason is that Ma advocates ultimate unification with China and that the
signing of an ECFA will make Taiwan rely on China completely and subject to its
annexation.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  because of the low approval  rating of the Ma administration, it is
uncertain whether Ma will win a re-election bid.</P>
      <P>If Ma loses in the 2012 presidential election and a native party comes to power,
then the trade pact will certainly not succeed, and the dream of unification
will be shattered. This is why the Ma administration and China have such a sense
of urgency over signing it soon, no matter what.</P>
      <P>Although he is still the president, his plummeting approval ratings show that Ma
has lost his legitimacy to decide the future of the nation's people.</P>
      <P>As this paper has said repeatedly, the ECFA is not a tonic but a drug that will
have only a short-term euphoric effect. Ma, who is insisting on signing the pact
in disregard of the interests of the 23 million people of Taiwan, does not
deserve to be the nation's president. (Feb. 24, 2010)</P>

the administration to decide on the F-16C/D sale project as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Asked about the dispute over U.S. beef exports to Taiwan, Lu said the U.S. is
more concerned that Taiwan has failed to keep its promises than about the export
benefits.</P>
      <P>In this regard, she suggested an end to calls by various civic groups for the
public to reject U.S. beef, which she said has harmed Taiwan-U.S. ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>New Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Johnny Chiang said he will push
for the injection of more public and private resources into cultural and
creative industries because the sector has the potential to create another
economic miracle.</P>
      <P>Speaking after taking over the helm of the GIO, Chiang said Taiwan's cultural
and creative industries are full of promise and vitality, as evidenced by the
box office success of the youth gang film "Monga" and award-winning screening of
Taiwan's "Au Revoir Taipei" at the just-concluded Berlin International Film
Festival.</P>
      <P>"The cultural and creative industries indeed offer a good opportunity for Taiwan
to rise to excellence and may also allow Taiwan to create yet another economic
miracle, " Chiang said, referring to the export processing industry that fueled
Taiwan's first economic takeoff in the 1970-1980s.</P>
      <P>Chiang was responding to remarks made at the changeover ceremony by his
predecessor Su Jun-pin, who said he dreamed of helping Taiwan's television,
filmmaking and pop music industries find their optimal niches in the Chinese-
speaking world.</P>
      <P>Praising Chiang as a cool-headed, resourceful and methodical person, Su said he
believes the GIO will operate steadily and smoothly under Chiang's stewardship.</P>
      <P>In response, Chiang said he felt honored to be recruited into Premier Wu Den-
yih's Cabinet to serve the country.</P>
      <P>"I am taking office with solemnity and will work to the best of my ability to
fulfill my mission, " said the 38-year-old Chiang, previously an associate
professor in Soochow University's Department of Political Science.</P>
      <P>On the development of creative and cultural industries, Chiang promised to
infuse more resources into the sector by integrating public  and  private
sector  strength  to  upgrade  Taiwan's competitiveness and influence.</P>
      <P>Su, who took the GIO post Jan. 1, 2009, will be transferred to serve as the
ruling Kuomintang's spokesman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Economic recovery at science parks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The three major high-tech parks in Taiwan -- the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu
City, the Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan County and the Central Taiwan
Science Park in Taichung city and county -- have shown signs of economic
recovery since the second half of 2009 and more jobs are expected this year,
while the number of employees  on unpaid  leave has dropped  to less than 1,000,
approximately 0.4 percent of the total workforce.</P>
      <P>The combined turnover of the three industrial parks in 2009 totaled NT$1.58
trillion, far short of the forecast of NT$2 trillion and a 13.9 percent slide
from the previous year.</P>
      <P>However, boosted by a global economic recovery, the combined turnover in the
second half of the year amounted to NT$951.8 billion, a 16.2 percent growth
compared with the same period of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times: The National Science Council predicted Tuesday that combined
turnover the three major high-tech parks might be back to the level of 2007 and
reach NT$1.9 trillion in 2010, after an annual slide of 13.9 percent in 2009.</P>
      <P>The administrative offices of the three science parks pointed out that most
manufacturers faced serious setbacks in the first half of last year in the wake
of the global financial crisis. Fortunately, businesses have gradually picked up
since the beginning of the second half of the year, and growth has been seen
since September.</P>
      <P>While biotechnology remained the only branch that continued to grow in the past
year, manufacturers of IC, opto-electronics, computer  peripherals,  precision
machinery  and communications equipment also registered negative revenue growth
from minus 10 percent to minus 20 percent.</P>
      <P>In the second half of 2009, combined turnover of the three industrial parks
amounted to NT$951.8 billion, up 16.2 percent over the same period of last year,
while the amount of new investments, mostly in IC designs and manufacturing,
were also double the amount of the same period of 2008. New investments in the
Central Taiwan Science Park are mostly in opto-electronics manufacturing, and
the cluster effect is also seen in the south with more and more biotechnology
and medical equipment companies having moved in.</P>
      <P>Radio Taiwan International: To ease the burden on manufacturers, the
administrations of the three major high-tech industrial parks in Taiwan reduced
the annual management fees by half in 2009 as the global financial crisis had
impacted the economy.</P>
      <P>The discount allowed companies, which had to put their employees on unpaid
leave, to further reduce their operational costs. At its peak last February, the
number of employees on unpaid leave in the three parks exceeded 130,000, a
figure that had been reduced to under 1,000 at the end of the year, according to
Jou Jing- yang, vice minister of the National Science Council (NSC).</P>
      <P>Jou added that although businesses in the science parks showed signs of recovery
in the second half of last year, the NSC decided to continue the discount in
2010 by charging only 75 percent of the normal management fees, in order to help
the manufacturers achieve an earlier recovery. (Feb. 24, 2010)</P>
      <P>China Times: The combined turnover of the three major high-tech industrial parks
registered a record low in five years at NT$1.58 trillion, comparable to the
level of 2005.</P>
      <P>According to Jou, as businesses in the industrial parks have been gradually
picking up since the second half of last year, it is expected  that combined
turnover  will reach NT$1.9 trillion, comparable to the level of 2007 at NT$1.98
trillion.</P>
      <P>He added that with the economy gradually coming out of recession, there are an
estimated 4,000 jobs on offer in the Hsinchu Science Park, between 2,000 and
3,000 in the central park and up to 10,000 in the south. (Feb. 24, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan Tobacco &amp; Liquor Corp. (TTL) executive  has dismissed concerns of
an opposition  Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker that TTL's plan to produce
Taiwan Beer in China could hurt it and Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Wei-cher said Wednesday that he wanted to see the state-run
company expand into overseas markets, but he was worried that its plan to
contract a Chinese manufacturer to produce its beer in China would result in the
leaking of the formula for Taiwan Beer and related production know-how.</P>
      <P>"The beer produced in China could even make its way back into Taiwan, " Huang
said, fearful that the plan would undermine the state-run company's NT$26
billion in annual sales of the popular beer.</P>
      <P>But TTL Senior Vice President Hang-liu Yu said the move was typical of how beer
companies move into new markets -- first by exporting, then working with a local
producer and then setting up their own plant.</P>
      <P>The company began exporting Taiwan Beer to China last July, earning it NT$100
million in revenues to date.  But contract manufacturing in China is necessary,
Yu said, because the beer and the bottles are heavy and make the product less
competitive when exported to China's market.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed that Taiwan Beer produced in China would not be exported back to
Taiwan. He said the formula used to produce the beer there will be different
from that used in Taiwan, and the beer bottles will carry special markings to
indicate their origin.</P>
      <P>"The flavor will not be completely identical, but will mainly cater to the taste
of consumers there," he added.</P>
      <P>Yu also denied that the production of Taiwan Beer in China will affect the
interests of TTL employees in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite Yu's comments, Chen Hsueh-hsiang, deputy director general of the
National Treasury Agency under the Ministry of Finance, which supervises the
operations of TTL, said the agency will ask the company to address Huang's
misgivings.</P>
      <P>"The MOF will respect TTL's business strategy but will also supervise and
monitor related projects," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Time to scrap military personnel tax exemption</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/24/10  16:11:49
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bill to scrap the income tax exemption for military personnel and teachers
failed to clear the legislature again due to a so-called lack of "complementary
measures."</P>
      <P>The proposal to end the tax exemption has been discussed since 1985, but it has
been blocked every time due to the pressure of vested interests and election
considerations.</P>
      <P>The income tax exemption for military personnel and teachers can be traced to a
specific era when their salaries were relatively low, but that phenomenon no
longer exists in the wake of several rounds of salary hikes.</P>
      <P>A poll has found that up to three quarters of the public are in favor of ending
this preferential treatment. Reckless tax cuts, the erosion of the tax base and
the unfair tax system have long constituted public grievances against the
government.</P>
      <P>The end of the income tax exemption for military personnel and teachers would be
a major step toward eliminating preferential treatment based on vocation or
status.</P>
      <P>But this would be only the beginning of establishing a fair tax system. Imposing
capital gains taxes on stock and real estate income should also be addressed. We
expect the Ma administration to show resolve in reforming the tax system. (Feb.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin's presentation on his city's development has attracted
the attention of the participants in the 2010 World Design Cities Summit taking
place in the South Korean capital of Seoul Feb. 23-24.</P>
      <P>Hau delivered the presentation, titled "Taipei: A City of Innovation and
Creativity, " in fluent English Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With the aid of photographs, Hau introduced Taiwan's capital as a safe and
convenient living environment, as well as open to different cultures, according
to Taipei city government officials accompanying Hau at the summit.</P>
      <P>The presentation caught the eye of a Korean movie producer who told Hau that he
feels Taipei is more friendly toward film makers than Seoul, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Hau, who is among various city representatives from countries including
Thailand, China, Holland and Turkey, was the only person to mention the film
industry in his presentation at the two-day conference -- an international event
initiated by the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design in 2005
to promote the idea of urban design.</P>
      <P>Every two years, a city is appointed "World Design Capital, " a designation that
provides an opportunity for cities to feature their accomplishments in
innovative design and to highlight their success in urban revitalization
strategies.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Hau and the other participants in the conference's Mayor's Round
Table session signed a declaration in which they promised to improve the living
environments of their cities through design.</P>
      <P>Hau explained that the declaration is aimed at ensuring all the cities involved
will cooperate with and learn from each other, as well as encourage them to
apply design ideas and theories on city management and administration.</P>
      <P>More than 500 Korean and international design industrial experts attended the
2010 summit.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei city government, Hau's participation is expected  to
help the city in its efforts to host the 2011 International Design Alliance
Congress in October next year, which is expected to draw the participation of
some 3,000 design professionals from 60 countries.</P>

      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Wednesday that Children's Day on April 4
will be reinstated as a national holiday in 2011, if a related provision is
approved by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said related government agencies reached a consensus on the issue last
November after holding several meetings over the previous months.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently observes Women and Children's Day on April 4, but it is not a
national holiday.</P>
      <P>Jiang said it was decided at the November meeting to separate Women's Day from
Children's Day, because reinstating Women's Day as a national holiday requires
more discussion, taking into consideration its potential impact on the nation's
economy.</P>
      <P>Children's Day and Women's Day were separate national holidays in Taiwan until
1993, when the government decided to combine the two holidays and to have a
single Women and Children's Day April 4.</P>
      <P>In 1998, when two-day weekends became the norm in Taiwan, the government decided
that Women and Children's Day would no longer be a national holiday.</P>
      <P>As to whether to have an extra holiday if Children's Day were to fall on a
Saturday or Sunday, the minister said the overall number of holidays in a year
should be taken into consideration in deciding on a make-up holiday.</P>
      <P>Many legislators and outside observers have suggested that the total number of
days off in a year, including two-day weekends, not exceed 116 days, based on
the practices of most developed countries.</P>
      <P>There are a total of 112 days off on Taiwan's calendar in 2010.</P>

      <P>Taking advantage of a labor shortage in China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) is planning to hold up to eight briefing sessions in China this year to
try to persuade Taiwanese businesses there to return and invest in Taiwan, an
economic affairs official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sessions will mainly take place in the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl
River Delta areas, where many Taiwanese businesses are clustered, according to
Yu Chi-zen, deputy director-general of the Department of Investment Services.</P>
      <P>Special attention will be given to those engaged in conventional industries in
Dongguan and Shenzhen, which are most likely to be affected by the labor
shortage, Yu said.</P>
      <P>He said the MOEA will update the businesses  on Taiwan's investment environment
and the various preferential programs that are available.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also assist these businesses in making use of Taiwan's R&amp;D
resources and encourage them to inject funds into technology R&amp;D, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to evaluate impact of allowing medical experts to work in China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday that it will closely monitor
whether medical manpower in Taiwan will be affected by the decision to allow
health personnel to practice in China.</P>
      <P>Shih Chung-liang, director-general of DOH's Bureau of Medical Affairs, noted
that qualified Taiwanese pharmacists and nurses will be soon permitted to
practice in China without a license.</P>
      <P>The DOH will have to evaluate whether this new measure will have an adverse
impact on Taiwan's supply of such personnel, he said.</P>
      <P>At present, medical doctors and dentists are allowed to practice in China, once
they obtain a certificate of good standing issued by the DOH to prove that they
have not violated any healthcare laws, Shih said.</P>
      <P>To date, about 100 people have applied for the certificates, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, with a population of 23 million, has 40,000 doctors and 120,000 nurses,
while China has only 40,000 doctors and 50,000 nurses to serve its population of
over 1.3 billion.</P>
      <P>China therefore hopes to recruit medical personnel from Taiwan, but Taiwanese
medical experts generally work to a high professional standard and are much
better paid than their counterparts in China, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In light  of this situation,  very  few Taiwanese  health professionals would
consider working in China, which means that the new policy is unlikely to have
much of an impact on the health sector in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Every five years, Taiwan's medical sector conducts a study on the demand for
medical human resources in the following decade, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that an exodus of medical professionals to China could severely
affect Taiwan's medical labor market, but gave the assurance  that the DOH will
continue to closely monitor the situation.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, China may also ask Taiwan to open its healthcare sector to
Chinese medical personnel.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the Solomon Islands was the only one
of Taiwan's six diplomatic allies in the South Pacific region which he had
visited, expressing hope of going there again.</P>
      <P>Ma indicated his wish in a meeting with outgoing Solomon Islands Ambassador to
Taiwan Beraki Jino at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Jino, who has served in Taiwan for six years, has been appointed to serve as the
Solomon Island's high commissioner to Australia.</P>
      <P>A new ambassador to Taiwan has not been announced by the Solomon Islands
government yet.</P>
      <P>Recalling his visit to the country 13 years ago, Ma said he was deeply impressed
by the Solomon Islands' scenic landscape and its history of having been a
battlefield during World War II.</P>
      <P>Ma has yet to visit any of Taiwan's allies in the South Pacific since becoming
president in 2008. His predecessor former President Chen Shui-bian had paid
numerous visits to the countries, in his efforts to maintain diplomatic allies
for Taiwan to counter China's efforts to woo them.</P>
      <P>Ma has adopted a different approach of not competing with Beijing for diplomatic
allies, but simply trying to strengthen relations with various countries,
regardless of whether they have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ma is planning to visit
South Pacific allies sometime between March and April to attend a Taiwan-South
Pacific leaders' summit.</P>
      <P>In the meeting with Jino Wednesday, Ma thanked Jino for his efforts to promote
friendship between the two countries.</P>

    <DATELINE>02/24/10  18:06:22
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei's announcement of his decision not to throw his
hat into the ring in the race for the Xinbei City mayoral post epitomizes the
superiority of democracy.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan were still under an authoritarian party-state system as it was during
the martial law era, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) could have arbitrarily insisted
on fielding Chou in the year-end election, even though it was fully aware of
Chou's consistently poor approval ratings.</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan has evolved into a democracy, however, the KMT dare not follow
this path; otherwise, it could lose the race to the opposition party. Even if
the KMT has to pay a price for not fielding Chou, it dare not defy public
opinion.</P>
      <P>In a democratic political system, a politician suspected of corruption tends to
stand little chance of winning re-election. Multiparty competition and regular
elections of public officials will indeed help weed out corrupt and incompetent
officials.</P>
      <P>Public monitoring and supervision forces politicians to honor their promises
even if they were made spuriously. Chou's withdrawal has once again proved the
strength and merit of democracy. (Feb. 24, 2010)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the fight against swine flu,
officially known as influenza A (H1N1), has been successful, so much so that the
Central Epidemic Command Center was disbanded a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The president noted that around 25 percent of the nation has been immunized,
with the inoculation rate reaching as high as 75 percent among those aged under
18, so that the disease has been brought firmly under control.</P>
      <P>"The war against the disease has been successful," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The nationwide immunization program kicked into gear last Nov. 1, with health
care personnel and people affected by Typhoon Morakot among the first to receive
the shots.</P>
      <P>Ma cited as another tangible result of his administration the reconstruction
work in the wake of Morakot.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that 800 households rendered homeless by the typhoon moved into
permanent shelters before the Lunar New Year, while those who remain in
temporary accommodation in military barracks have had their living units
converted into a more homely style with greater privacy.</P>
      <P>The president estimated that "the settlement of 2,000 households should be
possible" by the first anniversary of the disastrous typhoon that took place
Aug. 7-9, 2009, bringing the heaviest rain in half a century that caused serious
mudslides and flooding in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the board directors and supervisors of the Taiwan Chamber of
Commerce as well as the heads of local chambers of commerce from 20 cities and
counties, the president said "the biggest problem now is unemployment."</P>
      <P>He noted that the unemployment rate was 5.68 percent in January and that the
number of medium- and long-term unemployed has continued to increase.</P>
      <P>The top priority is to cut unemployment, Ma said, adding that the government has
worked out strategies and measures that will be unveiled soon.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's economic recovery, Ma said he was elated to see tallies released
earlier in the week by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics.</P>
      <P>The economic growth in the fourth quarter of last year reached 9.22 percent, the
highest in nearly a decade. Even though this was because the basis for
comparison was low, he said it is nevertheless still a positive development.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS also adjusted economic growth for this year upward from 4.39 percent
to 4.72 percent, Ma went on, adding that the Executive Yuan has set the target
at 4.8 percent.</P>
      <P>If the development continues, per capita income could exceed US$18,000 this
year, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated the missions of economic recovery this year as job creation,
innovation promotion, energy conservation and carbon emission cuts, as well as
involving Taiwan in regional integration.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has opted to send a young Davis Cup team to face Australia in the first
round of Asia-Oceania Zone Group I play next month in Melbourne, Australia after
its top veteran players decided not to play.</P>
      <P>Representing  Taiwan  in the world's  premier  team tennis competition against
Australia will be Yang Tsung-hua, Yi Chu-huan, Huang Liang-chi and Lee Hsin-han,
all 22-years-old or younger, the Chinese Taipei Tennis Association (CTTA)
announced recently.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top players Lu Yen-hsun and Wang Yeu-tzuoo decided to pass on the
tournament so that younger players could have an opportunity to gain valuable
experience in major international competitions, according to a statement
released by the association.</P>
      <P>The pair believed that the exposure would benefit the development of these young
talents as well as Taiwanese tennis in the long run, the CTTA said.</P>
      <P>Lu currently ranks 103rd on the ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) Tour
while Wang was ranked as high as 85th in 2006 before sustaining various injuries
that have kept him out of competitive tennis for much of the past two years.</P>
      <P>Wang hopes to resume tournament play in the coming weeks after doctors cleared
him to play following wrist surgery last year.</P>
      <P>Lu and Wang could still join the team in later rounds, whether it means gaining
promotion to the World Group or avoiding relegation to Asia Oceania Group II,
said CTTA Secretary-General Liu Chung-hsing.</P>
      <P>The absence of Lu and Wang is somewhat unfortunate since Australia will be
without veteran stalwart Lleyton Hewitt and could be vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The Australian team will consist of Peter Luczak, ranked 75th in the world, 17
-year-old phenom Bernard Tomic, Davis Cup veteran Carsten Bell and doubles
specialist Paul Hanley.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tennis association has high hopes for its new faces, led by 19-year-old
Yang Tsung-hua. Yang is currently ranked 330th in the world, and had the top
singles/doubles combined ranking for juniors in 2008.</P>
      <P>Yang will be hoping to avenge a loss to Tomic in the boys' singles final of the
2008 Australian Open.</P>
      <P>Huang Liang-chi was ranked No. 3 in the ITF Junior ranking at one point while Yi
and Lee won the men's doubles gold in the World University Games last year.</P>
      <P>It will be only the third time that Taiwan's Davis Cup team will not have either
Lu or Wang since the country won promotion in 2004 to Asia-Oceania Group I, just
one step away from the top level World Group.</P>
      <P>At the time, most tennis observers believed that with two players of their
caliber, Taiwan would have plenty of opportunities to finish in the top two of
the eight-team Group I and get a shot at a playoff to reach the World Group.</P>
      <P>But injuries,  conflicts with the CTTA,  and disappointing performances have
derailed those hopes, and without Lu or Wang this year, the six-year streak of
not reaching the World Group playoffs is likely to continue.</P>
      <P>In the other matchups of the Asia-Oceania Zone, Japan meets the Philippines,
China takes on Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan will play South Korea.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan beats Australia, it will play the winner of the Japan-Philippines
clash in a battle for promotion, but if it falls, it will have to play the loser
of the Japan-Philippines match in a relegation battle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No Chinese imports into Taiwan via Vietnam: envoy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Vietnamese trade representative to Taipei rebutted allegations Wednesday that
Chinese agricultural products have been imported into Taiwan via Vietnam and
demanded supporting evidence.</P>
      <P>Ho Quoc Phi, deputy head of the Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei
(VECO), told CNA that the allegations have formed a major barrier to the import
of Vietnamese goods into Taiwan, even though he has already clarified the
situation to Taiwan's top agricultural authority.</P>
      <P>He admitted that there were cases of smuggled Chinese farm produce being brought
into Taiwan through Vietnam, including tea, cigarettes and garlic, in 1991, but
pointed out that "those involved in those acts could not get Vietnamese
certificates of origin."</P>
      <P>His remarks came after lawmakers recently leveled the accusation and said that a
Vietnamese certificate of origin can be bought for less than US$350.</P>
      <P>Ho urged the lawmakers to provide a copy of the counterfeit document to his
office, so that its authenticity can be checked.</P>
      <P>He also expressed doubt that any Vietnamese official would issue counterfeit
certificates of origin, as they would face serious punishment.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese government began cracking down on this kind of corruption from
the end of 1994 and there have been no such recorded cases since 1995, he said.</P>
      <P>Ho also noted that labor costs in China are relatively high at present and said
it would not make economic sense to ship goods from China to Taiwan through
Vietnam.</P>
      <P>"We are willing to help investigate whether the allegations are true. If they
are true, we will shoulder all the investigation costs. If they turn out to be
spurious, those who made the allegations should pay the bill," Ho said.</P>
      <P>He said the Vietnamese authorities have been cooperating with Taiwanese customs
officials to investigate suspicious Vietnamese imports into Taiwan.</P>

      <P>According to Wu, the public should increase their participation in land
conservation efforts, while the central and local governments should also step
up their cooperation and form closer partnerships.</P>
      <P>In the future, land conservation will be the responsibility of a ministry  of
environmental  resources  that is expected to be established in 2012, Wu said.
This will help improve the present situation in which land conservation-related
affairs are scattered among several different agencies, he added.</P>

      <P>A workshop will be held Thursday to study and share forestry management
experience and development in Canada and Taiwan, with the goal of maintaining a
sustainable and livable environment, organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "Sustainable Forestry Management Workshop", organized by the Canadian  Trade
Office  in Taipei (CTOT)  and Forest Products Association of Canada, will be a
one-day event to discuss sustainable forest management in Canada and study the
development of a forest product industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"With 10 percent of the world's forests, Canada accepts the reality that its
forest management has global implications, " CTOT Executive Director Scott
Fraser said. "Every year, Canada regenerates close to 700,000 hectares of forest
-- more than all other countries combined."</P>
      <P>Fraser said he hopes the workshop will provide both countries with an
opportunity to share that experience.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently one of Canada's biggest trading partners and imports about
C$60 million (US$56.8 million) worth of lumber from Canada every year. Taiwan,
once a lumber exporter, has 72 percent forest coverage, according to the CTOT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Dual-head system needs strong leadership</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/24/10  19:59:16
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The replacement of President Ma Ying-jeou's top national security aide has shed
light on deformities  in our dual-head central government system as prescribed
in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The real cause behind Su Chi's resignation as National Security Council  (NSC)
secretary-general  was closely related  to two controversial incidents -- which
agency had the authority to decide whether Taiwan should accept foreign aid in
the wake of Typhoon Morakot and which agency was empowered to decide whether
Taiwan should open its market to U.S. ground beef and bovine offal.</P>
      <P>The disputes could stem from our crippled dual-head political system.</P>
      <P>The system is patterned after the French system, which actually has only one top
government head. When both the presidency and the parliament are controlled by
the same political party, the president is the real government head. When the
presidency and the parliament are controlled by different parties, the president
has to name the head of the majority party in the parliament as the prime
minister, who is the real government head.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution, however, fails to provide a viable or workable mechanism for
implementing such a system. It only defines that the president is authorized  to
deal with defense,  diplomacy and cross-strait affairs, while the agencies
responsible for such affairs are all under the jurisdiction of the Executive
Yuan.</P>
      <P>As secretary-general of the NSC under the Presidential Office, Su Chi thought
the U.S. beef was the president's responsibility. However, it was the Department
of Health under the Executive Yuan that faced the public complaints and protests
and in the end, the ruling Kuomintang-controlled legislature passed an amendment
to annul the U.S. beef trade deal struck by the president.</P>
      <P>The incident was an incredible mess in Taiwan's political history. Given such a
crippled dual leadership system, Ma should show mettle and courage, and should
resolve to ensure the smooth operation of our government. (Feb. 24, 2010)</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would deem it a victory if the
party wins two seats in the four legislative by-elections that will take place
Saturday to fill the seats left vacant in Taoyuan, Hualien, Hsinchu and Chiayi
counties, a DPP spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DPP expects to secure the seat in Chiayi County, a DPP stronghold in
southern Taiwan, but given that the races in the other three counties are uphill
battles, winning two of the four seats up for grabs in the by-elections would be
considered a victory for the party, according to DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang.</P>
      <P>Lin said that DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen gave a directive Wednesday at a party
meeting that all DPP members should go all-out to campaign for candidates in the
four by-elections.</P>
      <P>The aim is to score wins in the constituencies in order to provide checks and
balances against the ruling party Kuomintang, Lin quoted Tsai as saying.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Tsai told party members to stick to their guns to sincerely
solicit voters' support and properly respond to any possible use of negative
election tactics in the run-up to the by-elections.</P>
      <P>DPP candidates in the by-elections are former Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen in
Chiayi, Huang Jen-shu in Taoyuan County, former DPP lawmaker Peng Shao-chin in
Taoyuan, and another former DPP lawmaker Hsiao Bi-khim in Hualien.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has 25 counties and cities. Currently the ruling party's members hold the
top elected positions in 17 of them, while the DPP controls eight of them.</P>
      <P>The seats in the four counties which will hold the by-elections were made vacant
because local lawmakers  were elected county magistrates Dec. 5, 2009.</P>
      <P>The elections Saturday and the elections for the heads of five of the biggest
municipalities in Taiwan in December are widely seen as a gauge of the
popularity of the ruling party KMT, which also controls the legislature.</P>

came just 24 days after Wu assumed the position.</P>
      <P>Wu, a former a vice president of 1111 Job Bank, was recruited by King to join
the KMT management and officially took office Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>However, the tabloid Next magazine reported Wednesday that in 2006 Wu made

actions that the magazine said amounted to sexual harassment.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday civic groups and charities in Taiwan will
sponsor 8,000 to 10,000 Haitian orphans and children from low-income families.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Lunar New Year party held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in
honor of foreign diplomats and representatives stationed in Taipei, Ma said
Taiwan has finalized an aid package to help its Caribbean ally get back on its
feet after a devastating magnitude-7 earthquake in January.</P>
      <P>In addition to the child sponsorship program, Ma said, the aid package will
include a Taiwan healthcare center in Haiti to train medical and healthcare
staff, 1,200 permanent houses that will be able to accommodate 6,000 displaced
families, and vocational training centers for 3,500 job seekers.</P>
      <P>Ma, who made a stopover in the Dominican Republic Jan. 28 on his way home from
Honduras to show his concern for earthquake-battered Haiti,  said Taiwan will be
a responsible stakeholder in the international community under his leadership.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China will be a peacemaker, not a troublemaker, a humanitarian
aid provider, not an apathetic bystander, Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, his administration's top foreign policy goal is to
make Taiwan an internationally respected country.</P>
      <P>On external relations, Ma said his government's efforts to improve relations
with China will also contribute to Taiwan's relations with other major countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that China will show more goodwill and less
obstructionist tendencies with regard to Taiwan's bid to join international
governmental and non-governmental organizations.</P>
      <P>"If China can do this, the people of Taiwan will be more willing to support my
administration's efforts to deepen cross-strait engagements, which in turn will
lead to a benign cycle," Ma added.</P>
      <P>In an effort to make Taiwan a hub for Asia-Pacific trade, Ma said, his
administration is working to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement
with China to smooth the way for similar free trade agreements with its other
major trade partners.</P>
      <P>"All these efforts are aimed at protecting us from being marginalized in this
era of globalization and regional economic integration," Ma added.</P>
      <P>Stressing Taiwan's efforts to develop soft power, Ma said his government plans

      <P>Taiwanese Rotarians from all seven districts are joining Rotary International's
anti-polio efforts by beaming the words "End Polio" from Taiwan's landmark
skyscraper Taipei 101 from now until Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>Michael Liu, spokesman for Taipei Financial Center Corp. which manages the
skyscraper, said Wednesday that the company is pleased to take part in the
global social welfare campaign because it will help enhance the image of both
Taipei 101 and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Rotarians from District 3520 in Taiwan, although the global
organization Rotary International  has been promoting a polio-free world since
1985, the crippling disease is still endemic in four countries -- Pakistan,
Afghanistan, India and Nigeria. This means further efforts are needed to
eradicate polio, they said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to wipe out polio worldwide, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has so far
donated US$355 million to the Rotary Foundation through the Mellinda and Bill
Gates Foundation, the local Rotarians added.</P>
      <P>The  Global  Polio  Eradication  Initiative,  the  largest internationally
coordinated public health project, was spearheaded and is being carried out by
Rotary International, the World Health Organization (WHO) , the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund).</P>
      <P>To mark the 105th anniversary of Rotary International, the seven district
governors have established a cross district public service platform to push the
"10 Great Projects to Make Taiwan Better, " with the aim of forming 540 Rotary
Clubs in Taiwan and recruiting 18,500 new members.</P>
      <P>In addition to lighting the "End Polio" signs on Taipei 101, Taiwanese Rotarians
said, they also plan to erect 600 billboards around the country to promote the
spirit of public service.</P>

conservation efforts, while the central and local governments should also step
up their cooperation and form closer partnerships.</P>
      <P>In the future, land conservation will be the responsibility of a ministry  of
environmental  resources  that is expected to be established in 2012, Wu said.
This will help improve the present situation in which land conservation-related
affairs are scattered among several different agencies, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Canada-Taiwan forestry management workshop to be held Thursday</HEADLINE>

      <P>A workshop will be held Thursday to study and share forestry management
experience and development in Canada and Taiwan, with the goal of maintaining a
sustainable and livable environment, organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "Sustainable Forestry Management Workshop", organized by the Canadian  Trade
Office  in Taipei (CTOT)  and Forest Products Association of Canada, will be a
one-day event to discuss sustainable forest management in Canada and study the
development of a forest product industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"With 10 percent of the world's forests, Canada accepts the reality that its
forest management has global implications, " CTOT Executive Director Scott
Fraser said. "Every year, Canada regenerates close to 700,000 hectares of forest
-- more than all other countries combined."</P>
      <P>Fraser said he hopes the workshop will provide both countries with an
opportunity to share that experience.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently one of Canada's biggest trading partners and imports about
C$60 million (US$56.8 million) worth of lumber from Canada every year. Taiwan,
once a lumber exporter, has 72 percent forest coverage, according to the CTOT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Dual-head system needs strong leadership</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/24/10  19:59:16
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The replacement of President Ma Ying-jeou's top national security aide has shed
light on deformities  in our dual-head central government system as prescribed
in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The real cause behind Su Chi's resignation as National Security Council  (NSC)
secretary-general  was closely related  to two controversial incidents -- which
agency had the authority to decide whether Taiwan should accept foreign aid in
the wake of Typhoon Morakot and which agency was empowered to decide whether
Taiwan should open its market to U.S. ground beef and bovine offal.</P>
      <P>The disputes could stem from our crippled dual-head political system.</P>
      <P>The system is patterned after the French system, which actually has only one top
government head. When both the presidency and the parliament are controlled by
the same political party, the president is the real government head. When the
presidency and the parliament are controlled by different parties, the president
has to name the head of the majority party in the parliament as the prime
minister, who is the real government head.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution, however, fails to provide a viable or workable mechanism for
implementing such a system. It only defines that the president is authorized  to
deal with defense,  diplomacy and cross-strait affairs, while the agencies
responsible for such affairs are all under the jurisdiction of the Executive
Yuan.</P>
      <P>As secretary-general of the NSC under the Presidential Office, Su Chi thought
the U.S. beef was the president's responsibility. However, it was the Department
of Health under the Executive Yuan that faced the public complaints and protests
and in the end, the ruling Kuomintang-controlled legislature passed an amendment
to annul the U.S. beef trade deal struck by the president.</P>
      <P>The incident was an incredible mess in Taiwan's political history. Given such a
crippled dual leadership system, Ma should show mettle and courage, and should
resolve to ensure the smooth operation of our government. (Feb. 24, 2010)</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would deem it a victory if the
party wins two seats in the four legislative by-elections that will take place
Saturday to fill the seats left vacant in Taoyuan, Hualien, Hsinchu and Chiayi
counties, a DPP spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DPP expects to secure the seat in Chiayi County, a DPP stronghold in
southern Taiwan, but given that the races in the other three counties are uphill
battles, winning two of the four seats up for grabs in the by-elections would be
considered a victory for the party, according to DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang.</P>
      <P>Lin said that DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen gave a directive Wednesday at a party
meeting that all DPP members should go all-out to campaign for candidates in the
four by-elections.</P>
      <P>The aim is to score wins in the constituencies in order to provide checks and
balances against the ruling party Kuomintang, Lin quoted Tsai as saying.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Tsai told party members to stick to their guns to sincerely
solicit voters' support and properly respond to any possible use of negative
election tactics in the run-up to the by-elections.</P>
      <P>DPP candidates in the by-elections are former Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen in
Chiayi, Huang Jen-shu in Taoyuan County, former DPP lawmaker Peng Shao-chin in
Taoyuan, and another former DPP lawmaker Hsiao Bi-khim in Hualien.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has 25 counties and cities. Currently the ruling party's members hold the
top elected positions in 17 of them, while the DPP controls eight of them.</P>
      <P>The seats in the four counties which will hold the by-elections were made vacant
because local lawmakers  were elected county magistrates Dec. 5, 2009.</P>
      <P>The elections Saturday and the elections for the heads of five of the biggest
municipalities in Taiwan in December are widely seen as a gauge of the
popularity of the ruling party KMT, which also controls the legislature.</P>

came just 24 days after Wu assumed the position.</P>
      <P>Wu, a former a vice president of 1111 Job Bank, was recruited by King to join
the KMT management and officially took office Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>However, the tabloid Next magazine reported Wednesday that in 2006 Wu made

actions that the magazine said amounted to sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>Wu did not deny he had called the woman but argued that the calls did not
constitute sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>Wu made headlines in January when he acknowledged that he had once had an affair

      <P>Asked Wednesday if Wu's appointment to the KMT position was ill advised, King
said he could not comment because Wu had not had a chance to display his

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday civic groups and charities in Taiwan will
sponsor 8,000 to 10,000 Haitian orphans and children from low-income families.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Lunar New Year party held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in
honor of foreign diplomats and representatives stationed in Taipei, Ma said
Taiwan has finalized an aid package to help its Caribbean ally get back on its
feet after a devastating magnitude-7 earthquake in January.</P>
      <P>In addition to the child sponsorship program, Ma said, the aid package will
include a Taiwan healthcare center in Haiti to train medical and healthcare
staff, 1,200 permanent houses that will be able to accommodate 6,000 displaced
families, and vocational training centers for 3,500 job seekers.</P>
      <P>Ma, who made a stopover in the Dominican Republic Jan. 28 on his way home from
Honduras to show his concern for earthquake-battered Haiti,  said Taiwan will be
a responsible stakeholder in the international community under his leadership.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China will be a peacemaker, not a troublemaker, a humanitarian
aid provider, not an apathetic bystander, Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, his administration's top foreign policy goal is to
make Taiwan an internationally respected country.</P>
      <P>On external relations, Ma said his government's efforts to improve relations
with China will also contribute to Taiwan's relations with other major countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that China will show more goodwill and less
obstructionist tendencies with regard to Taiwan's bid to join international
governmental and non-governmental organizations.</P>
      <P>"If China can do this, the people of Taiwan will be more willing to support my
administration's efforts to deepen cross-strait engagements, which in turn will
lead to a benign cycle," Ma added.</P>
      <P>In an effort to make Taiwan a hub for Asia-Pacific trade, Ma said, his
administration is working to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement
with China to smooth the way for similar free trade agreements with its other
major trade partners.</P>
      <P>"All these efforts are aimed at protecting us from being marginalized in this
era of globalization and regional economic integration," Ma added.</P>
      <P>Stressing Taiwan's efforts to develop soft power, Ma said his government plans
to offer more Taiwan scholarships to attract young foreign students.</P>
      <P>The dinner party at Taipei Grand Hotel featured dishes and delicacies made with
local ingredients such as Hsinchu rice noodle, Puli winter mushrooms, Penghu
seafood and Yilan duck.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese Rotarians from all seven districts are joining Rotary International's
anti-polio efforts by beaming the words "End Polio" from Taiwan's landmark
skyscraper Taipei 101 from now until Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>Michael Liu, spokesman for Taipei Financial Center Corp. which manages the
skyscraper, said Wednesday that the company is pleased to take part in the
global social welfare campaign because it will help enhance the image of both
Taipei 101 and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Rotarians from District 3520 in Taiwan, although the global
organization Rotary International  has been promoting a polio-free world since
1985, the crippling disease is still endemic in four countries -- Pakistan,
Afghanistan, India and Nigeria. This means further efforts are needed to
eradicate polio, they said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to wipe out polio worldwide, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has so far
donated US$355 million to the Rotary Foundation through the Mellinda and Bill
Gates Foundation, the local Rotarians added.</P>
      <P>The  Global  Polio  Eradication  Initiative,  the  largest internationally
coordinated public health project, was spearheaded and is being carried out by
Rotary International, the World Health Organization (WHO) , the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and UNICEF (the United Nations Children's Fund).</P>
      <P>To mark the 105th anniversary of Rotary International, the seven district
governors have established a cross district public service platform to push the
"10 Great Projects to Make Taiwan Better, " with the aim of forming 540 Rotary
Clubs in Taiwan and recruiting 18,500 new members.</P>
      <P>In addition to lighting the "End Polio" signs on Taipei 101, Taiwanese Rotarians
said, they also plan to erect 600 billboards around the country to promote the
spirit of public service.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wei-lin Yang was working as a flight attendant with Taiwan's flagship carrier
China Airlines 20 years ago when she decided to dedicate herself to problems far
more momentous than keeping airline passengers happy.</P>
      <P>Confronting the despair experienced in Cambodia following a lengthy period of
war and killing, Yang decided to actively improve the lives of the country's
refugees, and her vision has remained firm to this day despite facing personal
danger, cultural obstacles, funding shortages, and a long illness.</P>
      <P>Her efforts were recently recognized by Reader's Digest, which named her as one
of six nominees for the Asian of Year Award 2010.</P>
      <P>Though she did not win the top prize, her Field Relief Agency of Taiwan (FRA)
has consistently been a winner among the 70,000 Cambodian children she's helped
over the years.</P>
      <P>Ironically, it was through her job with China Airlines that Yang found her
life's devotion.</P>
      <P>Yang had already worked as a volunteer with Taiwan's 119 rescue hotline before
graduating from college, and her compassion for the underprivileged became
"globalized" after joining the airline in 1983.</P>
      <P>One of her regular stops was Bangkok, and she could not look on dispassionately
when Cambodian refugees from the Thai-Cambodian border gathered in the city in
the mid-to-late 1980s -- the legacy of a decade-long civil war in the western
part of the country following the murderous Khmer Rouge's rule between 1975 and
1979.</P>
      <P>She quit the airline in 1989 to join a refugee service center at the Thai border
run by the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees.</P>
      <P>Working for five years at the center, where she came face to face with death,
injuries, horror and extreme despair on a daily basis, Yang became convinced
that the temporary centers were not the long-term solutions to the Cambodian
refugees' problems.</P>
      <P>Crystallizing her conviction was something she saw in her first year on the
Thai-Cambodian border. A fatherless girl, whose mother had also just died, was
begging in a local market, carrying her six-day-old baby brother in a swaddling
cloth on her chest.</P>
      <P>The girl left after receiving some money for food, but Yang said that the image
of the infant's wide-open mouth and dying face lingered in her mind for a long
time and convinced her that money alone would also not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>Betting on education, Yang eventually established the FRA in 1995 to help
Cambodian people in poor and heavily mined areas get a better chance in life.</P>
      <P>Over the next four years, Yang helped establish 15 makeshift schools, sponsored
some 700 orphans, and managed to recruit 27 volunteer teachers from Taiwan to
work in the schools.</P>
      <P>But those four years also taxed her health and her sanity, posing the most
formidable challenges she had ever faced in a philanthropic environment --
employee infighting, unfit Taiwanese volunteers, and funding shortages.</P>
      <P>And some of the very orphans she was trying to help were skeptical of the
group's intentions, fearing they would be sold or re-sold to human traffickers.</P>
      <P>Yang was also undone by a series of mishaps -- a car accident she was lucky to
survive; a serious burn to her hand sustained when she put out a fire in a
frying pan when an aide was cooking in the wild; and a near-encounter with
bandits, who were tracking her vehicle, hoping to get their hands on her relief
supplies.</P>
      <P>The encounter was averted when some acquaintances came to her rescue at the last
minute, but that experience, and her mounting problems, left her so mentally and
physically exhausted that she fell ill for six months in late 1999.</P>
      <P>During that time, FRA operations in Cambodia came to a virtual halt, but her
illness gave her valuable time to reflect on her campaign, and she concluded
that more than compassion and enthusiasm was needed to deal with the orphans or
refugees' problems and the conflicts within her organization.</P>
      <P>Realizing that she needed to change her management strategy and raise more
money, Yang returned to her base in Poipet -- a Cambodian town on the country's
northwestern border with Thailand -- and restarted FRA operations.</P>
      <P>She actually lowered the wage she paid to local employees from US$200 to US$100
per month, a shock that made them less prone to infighting and more diligent.</P>
      <P>She also screened Taiwanese staff and volunteers more strictly, declining the
help of those who could not withstand hardships or challenges.</P>
      <P>And those orphans or refugees who were skeptical of the FRA's intentions were
allowed to leave FRA shelters if they chose to.</P>
      <P>The result is that over the past 15 years, Yang has helped over 70,000 children
in Cambodia, taking in orphans and those afflicted with AIDS while providing
financial support to others.</P>
      <P>Vocational training centers have been built to help adults -- many of whom are
survivors of land-mine explosions -- learn skills and make a living for
themselves.</P>
      <P>She has also trained Mandarin- and Cambodian-language teachers to teach at the
schools she established and to travel to rural areas in 10 provinces around the
war-battered country to help the needy.</P>
      <P>"This is a labor-intensive job, and one's work is never done, " admitted Yang, a
Kaohsiung City native who is also a writer for the United Daily News and author
of two books. "I've probably been defeated by difficulties, but I never gave
up."</P>
      <P>Funding and donations remain a concern, but in early 2008, Yang caught a break.
She told a Liberty Times reporter that she needed 3,500 stationery kits to be
distributed to Cambodian children, many of whom had never seen a tube of glue or
a pencil sharpener in their lives.</P>
      <P>The story was posted online, and to Yang's surprise, stationery supplies flooded
her Taipei office from all corners of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The FRA packaged the scissors, staplers, erasers, pencils, sharpeners and white-
out received into kits,  which were then transported to Cambodia in three
40-foot containers. The kits have been distributed over the past two years on
weekends to 66,000 children, many of whom live in villages that are inaccessible
by car.</P>
      <P>"All the work is worth it when you see the amazement and happiness on the
children's face when they open the kits, " she explained.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Yang's organization has moved beyond its core education
programs. It has helped drill wells in areas where tap water was just a dream,
after making sure the underground water was safe to drink, she said.</P>
      <P>When the underground water in a village in Ratanakiri province in northeast
Cambodia was found to have an excessive amount of arsenic, the FRA bought 625
6,000-liter water containers made of gravel and cement locally to distribute to
local families to collect rainwater.</P>
      <P>In another village in the province, Yang and the FRA workers took action when
they found a hospital with only one operating table and no beds for women to
rest on after giving birth, buying two medical beds for the facility.</P>
      <P>"We don't turn our back on problems. We look for them, " said Yang, whose goal
for 2010 is to build a hospital in the province if she can raise NT$5 million.</P>
      <P>The hospital will be a "land-mine  hospital" because many residents in the area
were victims of land-mine explosions who need constant medical attention, said
Yang, who has twice been given the medal of national honor by Cambodia's
government.</P>
      <P>The 50-year-old Good Samaritan said her longer-term goal is to hand down her
skills and vision and plant more altruistic "seeds."</P>
      <P>Yang actually began preparing for the goal two years ago when she began studying
for a doctorate at National Dong Hwa University -- her ticket to teaching at the
university level where she hopes to cultivate the Yangs of the future and
broaden her impact on the underprivileged in Cambodia and Asia.</P>

      <P>The premiere of the film "Plus or Minus Two Degrees Celsius, " which is the
Taiwan version of "An Inconvenient Truth, " has raised hopes among many local
people  that the problem  of Taiwan's deteriorating environment would finally be
addressed.</P>
      <P>Global warning is a worldwide issue. A U.N. panel had warned that the survival
of the human race could be at risk if global temperatures rise by 2 degrees
Celsius.</P>
      <P>The question is how should Taiwan deal with this problem?</P>
      <P>Climate experts have forecast that the Arctic could be free of summer ice by
2020 to 2037, which would raise sea levels worldwide by six meters.</P>
      <P>In such a senario, Taiwan would be among the first victims. Areas on the island
that are currently less than 100 meters above sea level could be immersed.</P>
      <P>Last year, Typhoon Morakot brought 3,000 mm of rain to Alishan. If half of that
should fall in the Shimen Reservoir area, the reservoir would break and flood
Taipei County and Taipei City with 300 million tons of water, scholars have
said. The Taipei 101 tower would be the only landmark above the water in the
Taipei basin, if that should happen, according to the scholars.</P>
      <P>Because of Taiwan's special geographical figures, it is likely to suffer heavier
erosion damage than other Asian states from torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot will not be the last storm to hit Taiwan. The island should
brace itself for more powerful typhoons carrying heavier rains and for more
drastic weather patterns alternating between torrential rain and drought and
between very hot and very cold temperatures.</P>
      <P>The U.N. panel has called for all countries in the world, including Taiwan, to
work toward defusing the climate crisis. We support the idea of everyone writing
a letter to the president, urging him to take action to save the island, the
country and our children. (Feb. 25, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Pre-election payment of senior citizen stipend</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/25/10  12:18:34
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The financially  strapped Hsinchu County government decided Wednesday to
distribute the senior citizen stipend for January before the legislative by-
election this weekend and to include wealthy elderly residents.</P>
      <P>But the county government said that with effect from February, senior citizens
from rich families will not be eligible to receive the benefit.</P>
      <P>The controversial decision has drawn a range of reactions. Some critics have
said that the distribution of the stipend before the election is a vote-buying
gambit that would favor the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) candidate, while some KMT
supporters have expressed worry that the decision to stop the payment to wealthy
senior residents with effect from February may draw backlash against the KMT in
the by-election.</P>
      <P>With only two days to go before the legislative by-elections in four counties,
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is urging prosecutors to take
precautionary action against possible election bribery.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times: Since taking office last year, Hsinchu Magistrate Chiu Ching-chun,
who vacated the legislative seat in the county, has repeatedly complained about
the county's financial woes.</P>
      <P>Under heavy pressure to help the KMT legislative candidate Cheng Yung-tang win
the seat, Chiu announced Wednesday that the county government has earmarked
NT$130 million for distribution to the county's over-65 residents, as the
January stipend, in the next two days.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the central government's instructions, the county government
had originally decided to exclude senior citizens from rich families from the
NT$6,000 monthly stipend with effect from January, but Chiu said this will not
be implemented until February.</P>
      <P>Because of local governments' limited financial resources, the payment of senior
citizen stipends tend to be delayed for months.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu County government spokesman Chang Chien-chia rebutted the accusation
that the decision to pay the January stipend before the election was a form of
election bribery. He stressed that the delay in payment until now stemmed mainly
from the county's financial problems.</P>
      <P>He also explained that the decision to stop the payment to rich senior citizens
from February was in line with a Control Yuan directive.</P>
      <P>"The watchdog body has repeatedly asked us to do so in the first few months of
the year," he added.</P>
      <P>Exclusion of rich citizens from the stipend will save the county more than NT$1
billion a year. (Feb. 25, 2010)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: The Hsinchu County government began to distribute asenior citizen
stipend of NT$5,000 per month in 1994. The amount was later raised to NT$6,000.
Over the past 16 years, the county has spent NT$25.7 billion on the program.</P>
      <P>Of the northern county's annual social welfare budget of about NT$3 billion, the
senior citizen stipend accounts for NT$2.6 billion.</P>
      <P>A county government official said Wednesday that once rich senior citizens are
excluded from the stipend, the annual budget for the program will decrease to
just over NT$700 million.</P>
      <P>The official further said the decision has nothing to do with the upcoming by-
election. The exclusion of wealthy citizens will take effect in February mainly
because the county government needs time to finalize bureaucratic procedures for
the systematic changes, the official said. (Feb. 25, 2010)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's new top national security adviser said Thursday that
his priority is safeguarding the country and its people and protecting national
dignity.</P>
      <P>Hu, who assumed the post of secretary-general of the National Security Council
(NSC) two days ago, said during a meeting with Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng that he will make every effort to assist President Ma in formulating
and executing national security policies.</P>
      <P>"I usually keep a low profile at home but, as far as national security affairs
are concerned, I will take a firm stand and even lift my voice abroad to defend
our national dignity and sovereignty," Hu said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wang described Hu, a former Taiwan representative to German and
Singapore, as a rare diplomatic talent who is also well versed in national
security affairs.</P>
      <P>There  is no doubt that Hu,  also a former  deputy  NSC secretary-general and a
former deputy director of the National Security Bureau, will make an able NSC
chief and will serve as one of President Ma's right hand men, Wang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Don't count on spokesmen to lift government image</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/25/10  14:33:01
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an effort to refurbish the government's image, President Ma, in rare move,
has replaced the spokesmen for the Presidential Office, Executive Yuan and the
Kuomintang all in one go.</P>
      <P>However, we have to point out that the president is looking in the wrong
direction. What he should be doing is replacing those Cabinet members who are
hardly worth their salt.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet's failure to live up to public expectations is one of the reasons
behind Ma's falling approval rating.</P>
      <P>According to one opinion poll, nearly 40 percent of the Cabinet members are
familiar to only about 10 percent of the public. It is incredible that so few
people knew the members of the two-year old Cabinet. This is something the
president should be concerned about.</P>
      <P>Another problem is that Ma tends to select the members of his administration
mainly from among his former staff at Taipei City Hall and researchers at
Kuomintang think tanks.</P>
      <P>An administrative team assembled in this way would be obviously incapable of
dealing with the rapidly changing political situation. Ma should expand his
horizons in the selection of his ruling team.</P>
      <P>For example, former Hsinchu Mayor Lin Jung-tzer was offered the lightweight post
of minister without portfolio in the Cabinet, despite the fact that he had the
highest approval rating among local government chiefs during his terms as mayor.</P>
      <P>Has Ma ever thought of drawing on Lin's experience to boost his own approval
rating?</P>
      <P>It will be naive of Ma to think that he could lift his approval rating by
replacing his administration's main spokesmen instead of its Cabinet members.

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration is going all out to clinch atrade pact
with China despite the fact that it will put Taiwan's sovereignty, safety and
economy at risk.</P>
      <P>In order to let the people have the final say on this issue, Taiwan Solidarity
Union Chairman Huang Kun-huei said he will push again for a referendum on the
proposed pact, as the first attempt by the Democratic Progressive Party was
quashed by Ma's administration.</P>
      <P>Ma has said that the trade agreement with China will neither undermine Taiwan's
sovereignty nor alter its status and therefore should not be put to a
referendum.</P>
      <P>However, he said on another occasion that the pact will be an agreement between
Taiwan and the Chinese mainland, which is a negation of Taiwan's sovereignty as
it implies that China comprises a mainland and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma has claimed that such a trade agreement with China will facilitate
negotiations by Taiwan for similar pacts with other countries.</P>
      <P>But a Chinese trade official rebutted that any states which intend to follow
China's lead in sealing trade pacts with Taiwan should first seek Beijing's
approval.</P>
      <P>As we have pointed out many times, such a pact will speed up the relocation of
local factories to China and strip more people of their jobs. If we allow
President Ma to get his way, Taiwan will undoubtedly be downgraded into another
Hong Kong, against the will of the people.</P>
      <P>A referendum will be an effective way to scuttle Ma's plot, and it cannot be
delayed until the next presidential election, as the Ma administration has
already begun negotiations with China on the trade agreement.(Feb. 25, 2010)</P>

    <DATELINE>02/25/10  15:58:26
(by Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>High school seniors had lower mathematics scores in their general scholastic
tests this year than in previous years. In the tests, which were held islandwide
Jan. 29-30, more than 2,000 students scored zero in mathematics, according to
the results released Wednesday by the College Entrance Examination Center.</P>
      <P>Of the five subject areas -- Chinese, English, mathematics, natural science and
social science -- English was found to be the weakest among the 140,000
examinees, as 15,523 students scored zero in the Chinese-English and English-
Chinese translation section.</P>
      <P>The results of the scholastic tests are used by high school graduates to apply
for admission to universities and colleges. This year, 112 students achieved a
perfect score of 75 in the examination, which comprised 15 levels in five
categories.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times: Following the announcement that 2,106 students had scored zero in
the mathematics test, even teachers of some cram schools have suggested that the
mathematics test method this year was especially challenging. Last year, the
number of students who failed to achieve a score in mathematics was 1, 093.</P>
      <P>The College Entrance Examination Center announced Wednesday that this year 2,059
students had achieved a full score of 15 in mathematics, as compared to 1,745
the previous year.</P>
      <P>An analysis by the examination center showed that more than half of the 140,000
students who took the tests failed to attain the average of 5 points in
mathematics.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times: Traditionally, students with a perfect score of 75 points in the
exam are most likely to be recruited by medical schools, law schools, and
popular departments such as information technology and electrical engineering at
prestigious schools.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo Wei-cheng, who achieved a full score of 75 in the tests this year,
said Wednesday that his first choice will be the Department of Atmospheric
Sciences at National Taiwan University because he wants to become a "doctor to
save the earth."</P>
      <P>Kuo took many people by surprise, not only because of his choice of major, but
also because he is from an average public school in rural Taitung County, rather
than a school in the major cities of Taipei, Taichung, Tainan or Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Among the 112 students who achieved full score, 17 are from Jianguo High School
in Taipei, 11 from First Girls High School in Taipei, 11 from First Boys High
School in Tainan, nine from Taichung First Boys' High School, and seven from
Taichung Girls' High School. Most of these students are interested in attending
medical school.</P>
      <P>The entrance threshold for the medical schools at National Taiwan University
(NTU), National Yang Ming University (NYMU) and National Cheng Kung University
(NCKU) is 74 points.</P>
      <P>United Daily News: The College Entrance Examination Center sent out the
individual reports of the high school graduate scholastic ability tests to
students Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As students prepare to apply for admission to universities and colleges, some
teachers at local cram schools have noted that the country's most sought after
medical school -- NTU's -- requires a full score of 75; NTU department of
electrical engineering requires 73 points; NTU department of law, 74 points; and
the law schools of private universities, including Fu Jen University, Soochow
University and Tamkang University, at least 50 points.</P>
      <P>Some private universities are offering scholarships of up to NT$2 million over
four years to attract top students.</P>

      <P>Two Taiwanese nationals have been detained in a Tanzanian prison since last
March after a Taiwanese vessel was arrested for poaching in Tanzania waters, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) confirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>FV Tawariq-4, an Omani-registered fishing boat with a Taiwanese owner and a crew
composed of 15 Chinese, five Vietnamese, two Taiwanese, eight Filipinos, five
Indonesians and three Kenyans, was detained March 8, 2009 and the crew have been
held in two prisons ever since, according to a report from maritime watchdog
Ecoterra International.</P>
      <P>Samuel Chen, director-general of the MOFA's Department of African Affairs,
confirmed the case and the detention, which had not been reported previously,
but said the ship owner did not seek help from the ministry until last October.</P>
      <P>The Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA)  also confirmed the
detention of the eight Filipinos.</P>
      <P>The ministry  first learned  of the case after  receiving information from the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) office based in Nairobi,
Kenya late last year, MOFA's Department of African Affairs section chief Huang
Chih-yang said.</P>
      <P>Upon learning the news, the MOFA requested representatives of the TAITRA office
in Nairobi to visit the detained fishermen and provide necessary assistance and
relief, MOFA spokesman James Chang said.</P>
      <P>"After the visit, we are sure that there are no safety or health concerns for
the crewmen, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>Overseas Taiwanese in Tanzania also helped arrange the visit and communication,
Huang went on, adding that the case is now in the Tanzanian judicial procedure,
with the next trial expected to take place in March. He said the department will
monitor the progress of the case closely.</P>
      <P>The Omani company to which the vessel is registered has been trying to deal with
the case, Yang went on, and the fishing company and the owner are expected to be
fined subject to Tanzanian laws.</P>
      <P>The detained Taiwanese are believed to be a crewman and the vessel's owner, who
went to Tanzania to help with the case but was also detained due to
identification and license troubles, he said.</P>
      <P>Ecoterra has reported that one of three Kenyan crew of Tawariq-4 died under
mysterious circumstances in a Tanzanian prison and that the crewmen, who have
appeared in a Tanzanian court three times, have complained that none of their
embassies have been following the case.</P>

      <P>The labor shortage in China and rising wages for factory workers after the Lunar

competition, but rising wages have slashed its competitive edge. Worst of all,
the labor shortage is exacerbating the situation and might be pushing China's
export- and cheap labor- driven economy into a dead end. As China is the
lifeline for Taiwan's dwindling economy, this cannot be ignored by the Taiwanese
authorities.</P>
      <P>However, opportunity often comes with crisis. At a time when many Taiwanese
businessmen in China are being driven to the wall, Taiwan can serve as a
shelter. As long as Taiwan's authorities remove barriers in taxation and labor
supply for them, a large number of Taiwanese companies should be willing to
return home.</P>
      <P>Although chances are slim that the Ministry of Finance and the Council of Labor
Affairs will give way on either of these two issues, there is another option --
developing offshore exclusive zones in plots adjacent to Taipei Port and
Kaohsiung Port, where a universal 17.5 percent tax rate could be implemented and
where foreign laborers could be allowed to work based on the Singapore model. In
the initial stage, only foreign companies would be permitted to open business
headquarters or R&amp;D and financial centers there.</P>
      <P>As long as hundreds of foreign enterprises establish themselves there,
investment and local demand for construction and services would take off,
offsetting the losses in Taiwanese exports to China.</P>
      <P>The idea could be immediately  put into practice  if the administration of
President Ma Ying-jeou were to give the go-ahead. Taipei County Magistrate Chou
Hsi-wei, who has announced that he will not seek election in year-end
municipality elections, could achieve a great deal in this regard in the last 10
months of his tenure. (Feb. 25, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA denies plan to adopt multiple minimum wages</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) denied Thursday media speculation that it
might adopt a multiple minimum wage system that allows wage differences by
category.</P>
      <P>CLA Deputy Minister Pan Shih-wei said his council "has absolutely no intention
of doing such a thing."</P>
      <P>Although some experts have recommended that such a system be implemented, the
CLA has assessed the feasibility but "has never accepted it," Pan said.</P>
      <P>According to a report published Thursday in the Liberty Times, there is a
proposal to set different minimum wages for workers in the northern, central,
southern and eastern regions.</P>
      <P>Also, "sub-minimum wages" might be set for marginal workers such as teenagers
and women, the report claimed.</P>
      <P>Sun Pi-hsia, head of the CLA's Department of Labor Standards, noted that
multiple minimum wages are usually implemented  in countries with vast
territories  or wide urban-rural  divides, situations that obviously do not
apply to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The CLA has assessed the proposal many times, and on each occasion, it has
concluded that such a system is "unfeasible, " Sun said.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether government representatives will withdraw from the
minimum wage review committee, Sun said government representatives will not be
completely absent from the committee, although their ratio on the committee will
be reduced.</P>
      <P>Also that day, legislators expressed strong opposition to the proposal of
multiple minimum wages.</P>
      <P>Yang Li-huan,  a deputy  whip of the ruling  Kuomintang's legislative caucus,
pointed out that differentiating minimum wages by region would simply result in
the migration of workers from low- to high-wage regions.</P>
      <P>Hou Tsai-feng, another caucus deputy whip, said any such proposal would be
"ridiculous" and "inconceivable, " because it would divide the country's
citizens into different classes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislators Chai Trong-rong,
Huang Wei-cher and Huang Sue-ying said multiple minimum wages would be in
violation of the principle of "equal pay for equal work."</P>
      <P>It would be discriminatory to set lower minimum wages for women and disabled
workers, Huang Sue-ying noted.</P>

      <P>A total of 112 students achieved perfect scores in the General Scholastic
Ability Test, according to the College Entrance Examination Center that
administers the test.</P>
      <P>Seventeen of the students with perfect scores were from Jianguo High School in
Taipei, which was the highest number from any one school. One of the Jianguo
students sports red hair, while another has a goatee beard. In the eyes of
parents and the conservative school faculty, they were both mavericks.</P>
      <P>However, their achievement has debunked the myth that students whose appearance
is unconventional are no good.</P>
      <P>School faculties tend to adhere to tradition and prefer to see students wearing
uniforms and crew cuts.</P>
      <P>Such faculties are usually hostile to non-conformists and often brand them as
bad students. In recent decades, many students have been disciplined for showing
individualistic tendencies, and as a result their interest in studying has
dampened.</P>
      <P>In the 1970s, when the late U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was asked to comment
on the hippie subculture that embraced long hair and flouted convention, he said
people should look at what is under the scalp, not what is on the scalp.</P>
      <P>Instead of forcing students to adhere to tradition, faculties should give them
due respect and help them to develop their individualism.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Taiwanese business operators in China will benefit from an
appreciation of the Chinese currency, as a stronger yuan will lead China to buy
more, which in turn would boost Taiwan's exports, economists of a local think-
tank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Miao,  director of the Taiwan Institute  of Economic Research's
Macroeconomic Forecasting Center, said a stronger Chinese yuan will spur other
countries to adjust commodity prices and will have a positive impact on foreign
trade in Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Sun Ming-te,  deputy director of the center,  agreed that appreciation of the
yuan will be good news for Taiwan and its business operators in China because
Taiwan's exports will rise as result of China's stronger purchasing power.</P>
      <P>Quoting the latest world trade statistics, Sun said China posted a mild 20
percent growth in export trade in January, but its imports jumped by a whopping
80 percent during the same month. China remained Japan's major export market in
January, he noted.</P>
      <P>China's central bank has raised its savings reserve requirement rates twice
recently, which is an indication of Beijing's growing worry over possible
property and stock market bubbles, he said.</P>
      <P>Beijing is now caught in a dilemma of whether to strengthen the yuan, he added.
A stronger yuan will help boost China's foreign trade, imports in particular,
but could also spur an influx of hot money that could fuel property and stock
market bubbles, he added.</P>

      <P>Visiting Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin on Thursday invited his Seoul counterpart Oh
Se-hoon to attend a massive world design conference to be held in Taiwan's
capital city next year.</P>
      <P>Hau, who arrived in the South Korean capital Monday to take part in the 2010
World Design Cities Summit, paid a courtesy call on Oh, who readily accepted the
invitation to join the conference.</P>
      <P>Taipei has won the bid to host the 2011 International Design Alliance (IDA)
World Congress. This means that the world's oldest and most authoritative
international design event will be held for the first in Taiwan and in Asia.</P>
      <P>Hau said that when Oh arrives in Taipei for the event next year, they will take
a cycling tour along the scenic Danshui River to view the beauty of Taipei.</P>
      <P>During Thursday's meeting, the two mayors exchanged views on a range of topics
related to urban development, including Seoul's success in cleaning up two
rivers that flow through the Korean capital-- Han River and Cheonggyecheon -- as
well as Taipei's experience in the Danshui River cleanup.</P>
      <P>They also shared experiences in dealing with traffic congestion issues and other

      <P>Hau thanked Oh for inviting him to attend the design cities summit, saying that
it provided him with an opportunity to reach out to top leaders of 32

      <P>"The event has helped lay a basis for inter-city exchanges and cooperation and
has allowed urban planners and administrators in various countries to share

      <P>"We also appreciate Taipei City's active participation in our annual cultural

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to tallies recently published by the Directorate General of Budget and
Statistics, Taiwan will record a 4.72 percent economic growth rate for 2010 and
its January jobless rate dropped to 5.68 percent. Although the government top
brass is upbeat about an improved economy, unemployment remains serious in
Taiwan and the government must not underestimate the issue.</P>
      <P>The authorities should remember that the pattern of Taiwan's foreign trade is
changing fast. While Taiwan is receiving more foreign orders amid the global
economic recovery, this does not mean it will help enhance production or produce
more jobs, as more and more local companies are engaged in the so-called
"triangle trade, " in which they take orders in Taiwan from the U.S. or Europe
but produce the goods overseas.</P>
      <P>This "triangle trade" has contributed markedly to Taiwan's GDP in recent years,
but has helped very little in creating jobs, causing grave concern among the
public. We are highly skeptical of how much momentum can be injected into
Taiwan's manufacturing sector and how much benefit the local job market will see
amid the global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>In the face of a volatile world economy, a noticeable influx of speculative
capital and snowballing debt in Europe and the U.S., Taiwan must consolidate at
every step when seeking to adjust its economy for both the short and long terms.
At a time when the Legislative  Yuan is screening an industrial innovation
bill, lawmakers of both the ruling and opposition camps should take the
drastically changing economic structure facing Taiwan into serious
consideration. (Feb. 25, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two crewmen of Taiwanese vessel die during Somali hijacking: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two crewmen -- an Indonesian and a Chinese national -- of a Taiwanese fishing
vessel hijacked by Somali pirates that was later used to attack the U.S.
container ship Maersk Alabama, have died, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA also said it had not received any information from the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) which reportedly wants the original crew of the
Win Far 161 for questioning in connection with the piracy attack against Maersk
Alabama.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton longliner Win Far 161 and its crew of 30 were released Feb. 11 by
Somali pirates who hijacked the vessel near an island in the Seychelles in the
Indian Ocean April 6, 2009. Two days later, the vessel was reported to have been
used by Somali pirates as a mother ship in the April 8 attack against the U.S.
ship.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the MOFA said all the crew were safe and denied a report
from the maritime watchdog Ecoterra International saying that three men -- two
Indonesians and one Chinese crewman -- had died of malnutrition and disease.</P>
      <P>The Win Far 161 is expected to return to Taiwan in mid-March, said Samuel Chen,
director-general of MOFA's Department of African Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to Ecoterra International, the 10-month Win Far 161 ordeal was the
longest-running case of Somali piracy.</P>
      <P>"During the 10 months the vessel was held in Somalia, information received by
the ministry was vague and conflicting due to a lack of electronic
communication, " Department of African Affairs section chief Huang Chih-yang
said.</P>
      <P>The ministry had trouble sending staff to Somalia due to safety concerns and had
to rely heavily on the ship owner for information. The ship's owner did the
negotiation for ransom and did not allow the ministry to interfere, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Chen rebutted reports that the hostages' respective authorities did not provide
assistance to the crewmen and said the rescue was a coordinated international
effort that involved many international organizations.</P>
      <P>The ministry is aware of the report that the Win Far 161 was used to attack the
Maersk Alabama right after it was seized, Huang went on, adding that global
positioning system information shows the Taiwanese vessel was close to the U.S.
ship at the time.</P>
      <P>"It could have been used, but there is no way for us to confirm that at present,
" Huang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that he has approved the disbanding of the
Central Epidemic Command Center pandemic, but he added that the center will
resume operations if a third wave of H1N1 cases occurs.</P>
      <P>After receiving a briefing by the Department of Health (DOH), Wu said that he
agreed with the department's decision to disband the center two days ago because
it has accomplished its mission of disease prevention and control and has
reduced the negative impact of H1N1 on the nation to the lowest level.</P>
      <P>However, Wu cautioned that the disbandment of the center does not mean the H1N1
pandemic is over or that epidemic prevention work has been suspended.</P>
      <P>He said the government will continue its efforts in monitoring the epidemic
situation,  providing vaccination and health care services, stockpiling anti-flu
medications and promoting the concept of health.</P>
      <P>The government will also help and provide health care for patients who
experienced side effects after receiving the H1N1 vaccine, the premier added.</P>
      <P>According to DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang, H1N1 flu cases have waned
significantly worldwide, except for South East Asia and South America.</P>
      <P>Yaung said although the World Health Organization has advised that it was too
early to conclude that the pandemic was in a post-peak period, the flu
infections in many developed countries have waned because of the countries'
well-established monitoring systems and vaccination programs for epidemic
control.</P>
      <P>The total number of confirmed H1N1 deaths in Taiwan was 41, while the number of
Americans who died from H1N1 was about 11,000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's death rate from H1N1 per million people is the third lowest in the
world, while its H1N1 inoculation rate is the fourth highest in the world, Yaung
noted.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet has decided in principle to scrap a controversial proposal to grant
an extra-low 15 percent corporate income tax rate to multinational companies
that set up their headquarters in Taiwan, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs
Hwang Jung-chiou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hwang explained that the preferential tax rate, covered in Article 30 of the
proposed industrial innovation statute, is aimed at encouraging foreign
companies -- primarily those among the world's 500 largest -- to set up their
headquarters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, after consultations with the foreign business community, it was pointed
out to the ministry that foreign investors would be unlikely to move their
headquarters to Taiwan just because of a low tax rate, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he continued, only four Taiwan businesses would be eligible for the
lower tax rate if the policy were adopted, which is considered unfair to local
businesses.</P>
      <P>The controversial article, deemed as benefiting only foreign businesses, had
drawn strong protests from local business leaders, including Hon Hai Group
Chairman Terry Guo, who threatened to move Hon Hai's headquarters out of Taiwan
if the plan went ahead.</P>
      <P>In light of the controversy, Premier Wu Den-yih told legislators recently that
the Cabinet had decided to remove the article from the bill.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, the bill would provide tax breaks as incentives  to
encourage businesses to engage in research and development.</P>
      <P>Besides the manufacturing sector, there might also be tax breaks targeting the
service sector, he added.</P>

      <P>More industries in Taiwan expressed optimism over the economic outlook in the
next six months, according to a monthly business climate survey released by the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey of the manufacturing and service sectors,
43.8 percent of the businesses which responded to the survey in January
expressed optimism about the outlook in the next six months, up from 42.3
percent in December.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 47 percent of the respondents held a reserved outlook for the same
period, a drop from 47.7 percent in the previous month, while only 9.1 percent
thought it will get worse, down from 9.9 percent in December, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>Chen Miao, director of the TIER's Macroeconomic Forecasting Center, said that as
January and the next six months are the low-season for sales of consumer
electronics, some manufacturing companies expressed reservations on the outlook
in the next six months.</P>
      <P>However, anticipating that sales could be boosted with strong demand from
emerging markets and the gradual recovery in the global economy, the
manufacturing sector as a whole predicted Taiwan's economy in the next six
months would grow slightly, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The January business climate index in the manufacturing sector stood at 117.97,
up by 0.4 points from the figure in December, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>The same index for the service sector registered 125.31, down by 0.50 points
from the previous month, according to the TIER, which attributed the decline to
a fall in profits in securities firms because of steep drops in the local stock
market in January.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he expects that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will present
better-than-expected data concerning sales in the wholesale, retail and catering
sectors. The ministry was scheduled to release relevant figures later Thursday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan received US$30.37 billion worth of export orders in January, a new
monthly high that marked the largest annual growth rate of 71.81 percent, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chi-shih, director-general of the MOEA's Department of Statistics, said
China (including Hong Kong) was the leading source of orders for Taiwan-based
companies last month. The value of orders placed by Chinese businesses in
January hit US$8.595 billion, setting the second-highest annual growth rate of
134.99 percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>Orders  from China were mainly for electronics,  precision machinery (large- and
middle- sized panels), basic metal, engineering and chemical products, while
orders from the United States and Europe were mostly for telecommunications and
information industry goods.</P>
      <P>The value of orders received from Japan and from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN)  last month were also new single-month highs, reaching
US$3.512 billion and US$2.946 billion, respectively, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that Taiwan enterprises will see a drop in order value
in February as a result of a labor shortage since the Lunar New Year in China's
manufacturing hubs in coastal regions.</P>
      <P>The MOEA also reported that Taiwan's industrial production index in January
stood at 112.12, a record high increase of 69.7 percent on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>A steady economic recovery around the world and rising demand from China and the
United States, as well as a lower base in 2009 after the global economic
downturn, are behind the astounding expansion, according to the MOEA.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi promised Thursday to help with the production of a documentary
on Hung Yi-feng, better known as "the king of Formosan song" who died of
pancreatic cancer a day earlier at the age of 82.</P>
      <P>During a visit to Hung in hospital in January, Wu announced for the first time
that the Government Information Office will come up with a plan to preserve
musical works representative of Taiwan's culture, life and art.</P>
      <P>He also said at that time that the government will appropriate NT$4 million
(US$125,000) to help finance the production of a documentary on Hung's legendary
life and musical career.</P>
      <P>The premier reaffirmed the promise Thursday when he paid his respects to Hung at
a memorial hall at Taipei Medical University Hospital.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Ma Ying-jeou also paid his respects to Hung and
expressed his condolences to Hung's bereaved family.</P>
      <P>Ma told Hung's three sons, all of whom are prominent figures in the local music
scene, that he admired Hung's musical achievements and outstanding contributions
to Taiwan's musical and cultural development.</P>
      <P>Hung, who was blessed with a deep, resonant voice and was a prolific
songwriter,  is familiar to middle-aged  and elderly Taiwanese-language music
fans. Oldies such as "Memories of an Old Love" and "The One I'm Missing" are
still very popular among patrons of local KTVs.</P>
      <P>Chiu Kun-liang, a professor at National Taipei University of the Arts who grew
up listening to Hung's songs, said Hung awoke many local people to their
Taiwanese identity.</P>
      <P>"He was unfortunate to have been born in Taiwan... If he were to have lived in
another country, he would have long been recognized as a national treasure,"
Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Chuang Yung-ming, a Taiwan history researcher, said Hung's contribution to
Taiwanese-language songs lies in his inheritance of Taiwanese people's
independent  creative spirit during Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>"A group of talented Taiwanese song artists composed many lyrical Taiwanese-
language songs between 1932 and 1940. However, their development came to an
abrupt halt after Japan launched a campaign to turn `Taiwanese people into loyal
subjects of the Japanese emperor,'" Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Hung managed to succeed the Oriental five note scale musical style popular in
the 1930s and incorporated special features of Japanese enka and jazz music that
made their way to Taiwan in the 1950s, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>"As a result, he created a unique blend or hybrid style that reflects the
complexity of Taiwanese history," Chuang explained.</P>
      <P>Hung was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer Dec. 7 last year, according
to his family.</P>
      <P>He was hospitalized Dec. 26 after he fell into a coma following a bout of
pneumonia, and was transferred to a hospice ward Feb. 11.</P>
      <P>A Christian memorial service will be held for him March 13.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau announced Thursday at a Cabinet meeting that it plans to draw
up 100 tour routes around Taiwan with the aim of attracting 4.8 million tourists
from around the world this year, and 5 million in 2011.</P>
      <P>The plan, titled "Travel Taiwan, Touch 100" has been devised to promote tourism
and mark next year's 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China,
after the "Tour Taiwan 2008-2009" campaign project achieved 7 percent growth in
visitor arrivals, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 100 travel routes, other activities included in the  program
include  lantern  festivals,  lantern  design competitions, cycling events, a
Taiwanese fine food fair and a Taiwanese hot springs and delicacies carnival,
designed to enable tourists to experience Taiwan's natural beauty and the
richness of its culture.</P>
      <P>The project  will promote  the 100 routes  by integrating delicacies, different
means of transport and shopping spots into the itineraries for each. The routes
will be divided into 10 groups with 10 different themes, according to the
bureau.</P>
      <P>In April, the bureau will invite tourism and travel business operators to
exchange views on rolling out special deals and tourism packages to mark next
year's centennial.</P>
      <P>After hearing the briefing,  Premier  Wu Den-yih expressed admiration for the
plan and instructed the relevant agencies to work together to enhance Taiwan's
image, including improving sanitation and environmental protection, upgrading
service quality at airports and renewing traffic signs.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to hold a new round of negotiations in Taiwan in
March on increasing the number of direct cross-Taiwan Strait flights to meet the
increasing market demand,  Civil Aeronautics Administration  Director-General
Lee Long-wen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Direct flights between Taiwan and China were inaugurated last August, with the
number of the flights set at 270 per week.</P>
      <P>Lee said the talks will address additional flights being made available on
routes with heavy demand, and that proposed direct flight services between
Taipei SongShan Airport and Hungqiao Airport in Shanghai will also be discussed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also bring up the "fifth freedom" -- an issue aggressively sought by
Taiwanese airlines -- in the talks, in spite of the fact that China has been
reluctant to touch upon it.</P>
      <P>The "fifth freedom" would allow airlines of each side to extend flight services
to destinations beyond Taiwan and China to a third country.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan will also use the occasion to complain to the Chinese side that
the number of Chinese flights during the Lunar New Year holiday increased by
three times those of Taiwanese flights, and that many of the Taiwanese flights
were poorly timed, with late-night departures.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved a package of amendments Thursday in its weekly
meeting that pave the way for foreign investors to open hospitals in Taiwan,
although it remained unclear whether Chinese investors will be eligible for the
new measures.</P>
      <P>In line with the amended  provisions,  which provide  tax incentives, investors
in international medical services can establish hospitals in an exclusive
biomedical park in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu County in the form of a
corporation. They can also issue shares.</P>
      <P>"This will help lay a foundation  for Taiwan  to develop international medical
services and medical tourism" said Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung
Chih-liang.</P>
      <P>The DOH has agreed to allow foreign investors or joint ventures to set up the
hospitals based on the BOT (build-operate-transfer) model on a 7.85-hectare plot
within the planned 38-hectare biomedical park in Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>Shih Chung-liang, director of the Bureau of Medical Affairs under the DOH, said
that a briefing session on the issue will be held March 5 and that relevant
projections are slated to kick off in June. It is estimated that foreign capital
ranging between NT$2 billion and NT$3 billion (US$94 million) will be attracted
to Taiwan as a result of the plan, he added.</P>
      <P>"Whether Chinese investors will be included in the opening measures will be
decided in the near future," Shih went on.</P>
      <P>"The DOH does not restrict international investors from setting up medical
facilities in appointed zones, nor does it limit the number of such facilities,
" he pointed out, saying that "Kinmen Island would also be an acceptable
location."</P>
      <P>According to Shih, such international hospitals will not waste Taiwan's medical
resources, as they are profit-making establishments that target only top
clientele who must pay all their own expenses.</P>
      <P>The law amendments must be approved by the Legislative Yuan before they can be
implemented.</P>
      <P>Lee Yuan-teh,  an emeritus  professor  at National  Taiwan University's College
of Medicine, however, expressed concern about turning medical services into a
business deal to make money, although he added that Taiwan's medical level is on
par with international standards and can compete with Singapore, Hong Kong and
Dubai.</P>
      <P>"It is not good to weigh patients as profit-making items, " he said. "A balance
must be maintained in saving lives and seeking monetary gain," he added.</P>
      <P>Hung Tzu-jen, general manager of the Shin Kong Medical Club, said conditions are
not yet ripe for Taiwan to develop international medical services.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, his club has tried hard to lure foreign visitors into having
physical checkups, but foreign customers only account for 2.5 percent of the
total -- lower than the minimum threshold of 5 percent for a facility to offer
international medical services.</P>

      <P>More industries in Taiwan expressed optimism over the economic outlook in the
next six months, according to a monthly business climate survey released by the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey of the manufacturing and service sectors,
43.8 percent of the businesses which responded to the survey in January
expressed optimism about the outlook in the next six months, up from 42.3
percent in December.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 47 percent of the respondents held a reserved outlook for the same
period, a drop from 47.7 percent in the previous month, while only 9.1 percent
thought it will get worse, down from 9.9 percent in December, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>Chen Miao, director of the TIER's Macroeconomic Forecasting Center, said that as
January and the next six months are the low-season for sales of consumer
electronics, some manufacturing companies expressed reservations on the outlook
in the next six months.</P>
      <P>However, anticipating that sales could be boosted with strong demand from
emerging markets and the gradual recovery in the global economy, the
manufacturing sector as a whole predicted Taiwan's economy in the next six
months would grow slightly, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The January business climate index in the manufacturing sector stood at 117.97,
up by 0.4 points from the figure in December, the survey shows.</P>
      <P>The same index for the service sector registered 125.31, down by 0.50 points
from the previous month, according to the TIER, which attributed the decline to
a fall in profits in securities firms because of steep drops in the local stock
market in January.</P>
      <P>Chen also said he expects that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will present
better-than-expected data concerning sales in the wholesale, retail and catering
sectors. The ministry was scheduled to release relevant figures later Thursday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan received US$30.37 billion worth of export orders in January, a new
monthly high that marked the largest annual growth rate of 71.81 percent, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chi-shih, director-general of the MOEA's Department of Statistics, said
China (including Hong Kong) was the leading source of orders for Taiwan-based
companies last month. The value of orders placed by Chinese businesses in
January hit US$8.595 billion, setting the second-highest annual growth rate of
134.99 percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>Orders  from China were mainly for electronics,  precision machinery (large- and
middle- sized panels), basic metal, engineering and chemical products, while
orders from the United States and Europe were mostly for telecommunications and
information industry goods.</P>
      <P>The value of orders received from Japan and from the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN)  last month were also new single-month highs, reaching
US$3.512 billion and US$2.946 billion, respectively, according to Huang.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that Taiwan enterprises will see a drop in order value
in February as a result of a labor shortage since the Lunar New Year in China's
manufacturing hubs in coastal regions.</P>
      <P>The MOEA also reported that Taiwan's industrial production index in January
stood at 112.12, a record high increase of 69.7 percent on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>A steady economic recovery around the world and rising demand from China and the
United States, as well as a lower base in 2009 after the global economic
downturn, are behind the astounding expansion, according to the MOEA.</P>

      <P>In the international arena, Taiwan and China have very different statuses, and

Taiwan's general situation and the country has to face up to it, whether it is
the blue or the green camp that is in power.</P>
      <P>Everyone hopes to live in an environment that is peaceful, safe, prosperous and
dignified. Political parties must fall in line and seek to fulfill this basic
wish of the people instead of using national interest as a tool in malicious
partisan struggle.</P>
      <P>China is the root cause of Taiwan's diplomatic deadlock. To break the deadlock,

      <P>A magnitude-5.7 earthquake struck off the southeast coast of Taiwan Friday, the
Central Weather Bureau's Seismology Center said.</P>
      <P>There were no immediate reports of property damage or human casualties.</P>
      <P>The earthquake struck at 9: 07 a.m., with the epicenter located 131.7 kilometers
southeast of the bureau's seismology monitoring station in the eastern city of
Hualien at a depth of 31.1 km beneath the seabed, seismologists said.</P>
      <P>The strongest intensity on land was recorded in Changpin township in the
neighboring Taitung County, where the quake registered at Intensity 3. Intensity
in other parts of Taiwan ranged between 2 and 1.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is often hit by earthquakes as it lies near the the junction of two
tectonic plates. A 7.3-magnitude quake killed around 2,400 people in Taiwan

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There has been some controversy over a lawmaker's proposal to grant a
concessionary 15 percent corporate income tax rate to multinational companies
that set up headquarters in Taiwan, even though the plan has been scrapped in
the interest of parity.</P>
      <P>The question that is often raised is why should big companies be eligible for
preferential tax treatment while small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
which have always contributed to the development of Taiwan's economy, are left
out.</P>
      <P>Data shows that preferential tax rates, allowed under Article 30 of the proposed
industrial innovation statute, would benefit only four Taiwan businesses.
However,  the government's decision to withdraw  the special tax rate plan
spurred threats by large enterprises to move their headquarters out of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that these threats have not only hurt the feelings of the
Taiwan people who helped build those businesses, but have also tarnished the big
companies' image with regard to corporate social responsibility.</P>
      <P>We all know that big companies can decide a society's fate, but because  of
interdependency,  the concept of corporate  social responsibility is too
important to be ignored.</P>

      <P>Following the successes of "Cape No. 7, " "Monga" and "No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti, "
another Taiwanese film, "Au Revoir Taipei, " was recently awarded the Network
for The Promotion of Asian Cinema Prize at the Berlin International Film
Festival 2010. This highlights the fact that "city marketing" can not only
inject life into the film market, but also help Taiwan develop people-to-people
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the situation, major cities in the northern, central and southern
parts of Taiwan have shown strong interest in being used as locations for film
and television shoots. In turn, this can help create a friendly environment for
the film and television industry.</P>
      <P>We believe this development  is worthy of attention.  The government and private
sector should join forces and use the soft power of cultural creativity to turn
Taiwan into a new type of attraction for foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>Indeed, film shoots and screenings are a fast track to marketing a city or
country. However, not many cities in Taiwan have so far made any great effort in
this regard.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, film and television shoots are not the only way to market a city.
Literary works can also be used to achieve the same purpose. Some cities in
Taiwan have thus invited foreign writers to make their bases there, which is a
practice worth promoting. (Feb. 26, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's decision not to introduce a concessionary tax rate for
multinational companies with operations headquarters in Taiwan has come under
fire from local key players, with some threatening to move out of the country.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) rushed to put out the fire, saying that
a new bill, currently under review by the Legislative Yuan, will give tax
credits of up to 30 percent to companies  contributing  to talent nurturing  and
research and development (R&amp;D).</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has decided in principle to scrap a controversial proposal to grant
a concessionary 15 percent corporate income tax rate to multinational  companies
that set up their operations headquarters in Taiwan, Deputy Minister of Economic
Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The proposal, part of a draft statute on promoting industrial innovation, was
sponsored by a group of ruling Kuomintang legislators led by Ting Shou-chung. It
states that multinational companies with corporate headquarters in Taiwan and
which meet certain other requirements could be entitled to a flat business
income tax rate of 15 percent -- 10 percentage points lower than the currently
adopted rate.</P>
      <P>J. T. Wang, chairman of Acer Computer, the second largest PC manufacturer in the
world by market share, expressed worry over the issue late Thursday. He warned
that the corporate income tax incentives should not be removed from the draft
statute. "It is a chess piece that could tip the scales in Taiwan's high-tech
industrial development," he said.</P>
      <P>The government should go ahead with the 15-percent tax break program, Wang
suggested, arguing that while the measure would mean a loss of NT$500 million a
year in tax revenues, the government could scoop some NT$50 billion a year if
Fortune Global 500 businesses set up operations centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MOEA  officials  said  Thursday  that  Taiwan's  high-tech manufacturing sector
had enjoyed unprecedented tax breaks under the Statute for Industrial Upgrading
that expired at the end of 2009. The tax concessions totaled nearly NT$590
billion (US$18.44 billion) between 2004 and 2008, according to MOEA tallies.
(Feb. 26, 2010)</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Acer Chairman J. T. Wang, who doubles as chairman of the Taipei Computer
Association, held a heated debate on the issue with Woody Duh, director-general
of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau, on a TV talk show Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang said the 15-percent corporate income tax incentive proposal, to be known as
Article 30, would a "magic number" that could lure the world's 500 largest
companies to set up operations centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang urged the Legislative Yuan to retain the proposal, saying that it could be
one of the most crucial pieces of legislation in Taiwan in the next 10 years.</P>
      <P>Duh, meanwhile, admitted that the government's withdrawal of the plan has
stirred widespread discontent among leading local business groups. He said the
MOEA should not allow one article to hamper passage of the draft statute on
promoting industrial innovation.</P>
      <P>Duh told Wang that the MOEA will reassess industry needs and come up with
appropriate measures. (Feb. 26, 2010)</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Deputy Economics Minister Hwang Jung-chiou said Thursday that the Cabinet has
decided to scrap Article 30 in light of the controversy over the proposed tax
concessions. Very few Fortune Global 500 companies would be interested in moving
their headquarters to Taiwan to take advantage of a low tax rate, he said,
adding that only four Taiwanese high-tech giants, including the Hon Hai Group,
would benefit from the plan. (Feb. 26, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With one day to go before the legislative by-elections in four counties, both
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) are pulling out all the stops to win the four seats up for grabs.</P>
      <P>The followings are excerpts of local leading newspapers' coverage of the
elections: The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The DPP has called on voters in Hualien, Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Chiayi to punish
the arrogant ruling KMT by supporting the DPP legislative candidates.</P>
      <P>"Voting against that party will cut them down to size and force them to humbly
heed the voice of the grassroots people," a DPP leader said.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Lin You-chang said his party's candidate in Chiayi is the front
runner, but the others are engaged in a neck-and-neck races in the three other
constituencies.</P>
      <P>"Any victory in these three areas will be a historical record." he said.</P>
      <P>KMT leaders have been putting almost all of their efforts into helping the
party's candidates in Hualien and Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>In Hualien, which is considered a KMT stronghold, the KMT's Wang Ting-sheng is
facing a strong challenge from independent candidate Shih Sheng-lang who has the
support of Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan, the KMT candidate Apollo Chen was criticized by his rivals as an
outsider because he was a two-term legislator elected in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Chen's DPP rival Huang Ren-chu was under investigation for allegedly trying to
buy support by wining and dining voters.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General  Su Chia-chuan  cried  foul over the prosecutors'
investigation, claiming that they had turned a blind eye to the fact that Chen's
campaign manager Ye Bu-liang had also thrown a party for voters on Chen's
behalf. (Feb. 26, 2010) China Times:</P>
      <P>The issue of carpetbag politicians  is a hot one in the legislative by-election
campaign.</P>
      <P>In Hualien, the KMT candidate Wang Ting-sheng painted his DPP contestant Hsiao
Bi-khim as a carpetbagger who descended on the eastern Taiwan county to try to
gain a legislative seat rather than to do anything for the county.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsiao said that what matters most is whether a candidate can serve
his or her constituents, not where he or she comes from.</P>
      <P>However, Wang's argument was used by DPP candidate Huang Ren-chu against KMT
candidate Apollo Chen in Taoyuan, and again by KMT candidate Cheng Yung-tang
against DPP candidate Peng Shaw-jiin in Hsinchu. (Feb. 26, 2010) United Daily

the eve of the election.</P>
      <P>A party official said that KMT candidates face uphill battles in Chiayi and
Hsinchu, and are in tight races in Hualien and Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>"In order to win at least two seats in the by-elections, the party has to
encourage its supporters to turn out to vote, " the official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Individual Taiwanese investors will soon be able to invest in "red chip" stocks
listed in Hong Kong and Macau, through their accounts at local securities
brokerage companies, as the ban will be removed in the coming few days.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) approved Thursday a draft regulation
that will allow domestic securities brokerage firms to trade "red chip" shares,
such as China Mobile and Lenovo.</P>
      <P>Red chips are shares in Chinese companies that are incorporated outside China
and listed in Hong Kong and Macau. At present, local individual investors have
to open accounts in Hong Kong and Macau in order to trade "red chip" shares.</P>
      <P>The new measure marks a step forward in the government's liberalization policy
on trading of shares in Chinese companies, and follows a raising of the ceilings
on investments by mutual fund operators in red chips, H shares and Chinese
stocks more than a year ago.</P>
      <P>"The new measure will take effect after the FSC finalizes administrative
formalities, " Wu Guei-mao, chief secretary of the FSC's Securities and Futures
Bureau, said, adding that local stock investors will no longer need to open
accounts in Hong Kong or Macau to trade 130 "red chip" stocks in the future.</P>
      <P>However, trading in H shares -- stocks of 156 China-based companies listed in
Hong Kong and Macau bourses -- will remain off-limits, he said.</P>
      <P>"We will adopt a gradual liberalization of investment in Chinese securities," Wu
added.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the new liberalization measure will have limited impact on
the local bourse because there are already many channels for both local
individual and institutional investors to invest in shares listed in Hong Kong
and Macau.</P>
      <P>"The 'red chip' trade liberalization is more symbolic than substantial and it
mainly symbolizes closer financial exchanges across the Taiwan Strait," a market
analyst said.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government statistics show that although the unemployment rate in Taiwan is
dropping, there are problems related to the unemployed population.</P>
      <P>First, the number of people who have been jobless for more than one year has
increased from one in every 7.2 unemployed persons to one in every 5.5.</P>
      <P>Second, there has also been an increase in the number of unemployed people
between the ages of 45 and 64, with statistics showing that one in every 4.4
jobless persons are in that age group.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that although the number of people who lost their jobs
because of business closure or downsizing has declined over the past few months,
nearly four-fifths of them have not been able to find another job so far.</P>
      <P>The figures indicate that it is still difficult for unemployed middle-aged
people to find a job, despite their experience.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, while the population census shows an increase of 36,000  people
from November  last year,  there has been no proportionate rise in the number of
people joining the job market.</P>
      <P>The population  increase  may be one of the factors that contributed to the
lower unemployment figures. However, there is also a worrying trend of more and
more people seeming not to want to work.</P>
      <P>The government  needs to take urgent  action  to fix the unemployment problems
in the short term, and in the long run it should initiate policies to increase
exports, because once Taiwan's exports recover fully, investment, consumption
and employment will grow. (Feb. 26, 2010)</P>

same precedence as Chinese history, or be separated from Chinese history.</P>
      <P>The fact is, Taiwan has never been part of China. The Kuomintang regime is using
political means to distort historical truth. The alien regime that is dominating
Taiwan does not have sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Now,  students  in Taiwan are facing the crisis of being brainwashed. This is a
most vicious conspiracy by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou to link
Taiwan to China. Far-sighted people must take effective action to stop the Ma
administration from erasing the Taiwan consciousness of the Taiwanese people.

    <TEXT>
      <P>A bill on industrial innovation and a proposal on minimum wage reform have been
strongly challenged by the private sector.</P>
      <P>The industrial innovation bill is well-intentioned, but an article designed to
provide an extra-low 15 percent corporate income tax rate for international
businesses with headquarters in Taiwan has whipped up waves of controversy. This
forced the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to make repeated changes to the
article. The latest decision by the MOEA is to remove the article altogether.</P>
      <P>Why did the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou not fully seek public
opinion or draw on the examples of other countries before putting forward the
bill?</P>
      <P>The administration has encountered opposition on all sides because it failed to
adhere to the policy-making process of a democracy.</P>
      <P>Likewise, the proposal for Taiwan to adopt a multiple minimum wage system has
come under attack by both the blue and the green camps.</P>
      <P>These two incidents have demonstrated the importance of public discussion in the
process of making public policy. The ruling party cannot do whatever it pleases
simply because it holds an absolute majority in the Legislative Yuan. (Feb. 26,

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet firm on withdrawal of tax incentive proposal: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih confirmed Friday that the Cabinet has decided not to
introduce a controversial proposal to grant an extra-low 15 percent corporate
income tax incentive to multinational companies that set up their operations
headquarters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said the proposal, known as Article 30 of a draft statute to foster
industrial innovation, is seen by society as unfair to local businesses and an
extension of the Statute for Industrial Upgrading (SIU) that expired at the end
of 2009.</P>
      <P>The SIU offered tax breaks, totaling nearly NT$590 billion (US$18.44 billion),
to Taiwan's high-tech conglomerates between 2004 and 2008, according to the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that the government's latest decision on the tax issue is
based on upholding fairness. Regardless of the size or nature of a business,
once it is engaged in industrial innovation and job creation it should be
eligible for incentives, under the industrial innovation bill, he added.</P>
      <P>Article 30 was withdrawn to avoid favoring only a few industrial conglomerates,
Wu contended.</P>
      <P>The draft bill will be implemented only after it is passed by the Legislative
Yuan, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Friday that the new
bill will offer the same tax incentives to all companies from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Shih said he does not think the withdrawal of Article 30 will have a huge impact
on the development of Taiwan's high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>Dispelling rumors that some key players such as the Hon Hai Group will move out
of the country because of the decision, Shih said that for as long as he can
recall, Hon Hai founder Terry Gou's stance has been similar to the government's
policy.</P>
      <P>Any stimulus initiative aimed at spurring investment should offer the same
incentives to all companies from home and abroad, Shih added.</P>

      <P>Global financial services provider Morgan Stanley has put on hold a plan to open
a bank in Taiwan because of resistance from the government, which is focusing on
controlling risk in the wake of the global financial crisis, according to a
local newspaper.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission, Taiwan's top financial regulator, has
ruled out the possibility of allowing Morgan Stanley to operate a bank in
Taiwan, Taiwan's Chinese-language United Daily News quoted an anonymous
commission official as saying Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's rules, qualified foreign banks must have global capital or
global assets that rank among the world's top 500 and meet certain financial
standards, the official said.</P>
      <P>However, Morgan Stanley, which set up a branch in Taiwan in 1982, transformed
itself from an investment bank to a bank holding company only last year, the
official noted, leaving it short of the requirements.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen whether Morgan Stanley will meet the threshold for entry
in the future, the official added.</P>
      <P>The report said Morgan Stanley had yet to file a formal application for the plan
but learned about the financial regulator's sentiment after trying recently to
gauge how it would respond to the idea.</P>
      <P>According to the report, risk control has become the Financial Supervisory
Commission's main focus following the global financial meltdown, with the
commission not wanting commercial banks to engage in high-risk or highly complex
financial products.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that Taiwan people's hospitality and
considerateness give the island a tourism advantage.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of a passerby who, in response to a request for directions,
accompanied a Chinese writer to a bus station from which the writer was able to
travel to Yangmingshan to view the flowers there.</P>
      <P>Another example featured a shoe-store clerk in Kenting, Pingtung County, who
applied a band-aid to the blisters on the foot of a Chinese graduate student,
the president said.</P>
      <P>The student had gone to the store to buy a new pair of shoes because the ones he
had been wearing had hurt his feet, Ma said, adding that the Chinese student was
deeply touched by the clerk's gesture.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese  hospitality  and  considerateness  are important resources that will
help promote the island's tourism." Ma said at a ceremony to mark March 1
Tourism Day.</P>
      <P>Reiterating the government's goal of NT$500 billion (US$15.58 billion) in
tourism revenues this year, the president said his administration wants to see
not only an increase in the number of visitors but also better quality tours.</P>
      <P>First time tourists who have a pleasant experience will want to return a second
time for more in-depth sightseeing, and a third time for long-term vacation, the
president said.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, Ma said 4.4 million tourists visited Taiwan last
year, representing an annual growth of 14.3 percent, despite the global
financial crisis, the outbreak of influenza H1N1 and the destruction caused by
Typhoon Morakot.</P>
      <P>These tourists brought some NT$400 billion worth of business to Taiwan and
contributed to growth in the transport, eatery and travel sectors, which pushed
tourism into the ranks of the top six industries in the country, the president
said.</P>
      <P>In order to increase tourism output value by another NT$100 billion this year,
Ma said, his administration will funnel NT$30 billion into the industry, in
addition to the NT$25 billion to be invested by the private sector to build and
refurbish hotels.</P>

      <P>The 2010 production value of Taiwan's textile sector is projected at NT$430
billion (US$13.44 billion) , a year-on-year increase of 17.6 percent, the
Industry and Technology Intelligence Services (ITIS) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's textile industry is expected to rebound this year from a slump in 2009
when output shrank by 15.7 percent year-on-year, the ITIS said. The integration
of various sections of the industry and higher production and research and
development levels will contribute to better performance of the sector this
year, according to the ITIS.</P>
      <P>The ITIS analysis, which was based on a report by the non-profit Taiwan Textile
Research Institute, noted that Taiwan's textile industry sector, battered by the
global economic crunch, posted an overall production value of NT$365.67 billion
in 2009, down 15.7 percent from the 2008 level.</P>
      <P>However, with global economies picking up again, Taiwan's textile industry's
output will gain momentum this year if manufacturers seek to develop higher
value-added products such as bamboo charcoal fabrics made with the use of
nanotechnology, the ITIS forecast.</P>
      <P>It suggested that the local textile industry also try to create new business
niches by developing advanced fabrics and textiles that can be used in energy

      <P>Taiwan will face serious economic danger unless it concludes a controversial
economic cooperation framework agreement with China, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Friday.</P>
      <P>"Not signing it would bring immediate and unlimited danger. We would be
finished, " said Wu at the Legislative Yuan in response to a lawmaker's question
on what the administration would do if Taiwan fails to clinch the trade pact
with China.</P>
      <P>"The government will spare no effort to push for its success."</P>
      <P>He told the legislature that if the pact were not signed, it would be difficult
to imagine the suffering the country would endure as more and more members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) join in a regional trade bloc
from which Taiwan is excluded.</P>
      <P>When South Korea joins the bloc in the future, for instance, Taiwanese goods
will have trouble competing against Korean goods in China, as Korean products
will be exempted from 9 percent import duties while Taiwan-made goods will be
subject to the tariffs, the premier said.</P>
      <P>"No business can survive (under those circumstances)," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The premier argued that the pact would help Taiwan's businesses sell their goods
abroad and enhance the country's competitiveness in general, as it would exempt
locally made products from tariffs, safeguard the investment of local companies
in China, and protect their intellectual property.</P>
      <P>The premier also reiterated the government's promise that the pact would not
open Taiwan's market to more Chinese agricultural products or allow Chinese
laborers to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang allayed lawmakers'
concerns that in exchange for letting Taiwan sign trade pacts with ASEAN
countries, China could ask ASEAN states to require that Taiwanese goods carry
"Made in Taiwan (China) " or "Made in Chinese Taipei" origin labels.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has sold its products abroad using the 'Made in Taiwan, ' label. This
practice won't be changed." Shih said.</P>
      <P>Wu's administration is negotiating the trade pact with China in hopes of
clinching it later this year. Critics of the pact argue that it will tie Taiwan
more closely to China and undermine the country's sovereignty.</P>

      <P>New regulations that will allow Taiwan's chip makers and LCD panel makers to
invest in China formally took effect Friday, and several companies are expected
to file investment applications beginning March 1.</P>
      <P>Under the new laws, approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Feb.
23, Taiwan's flat panel sector will be permitted to build up to three 6th
generation and above TFT-LCD production lines in China.</P>
      <P>Local companies will only be allowed, however, to run factories that are at
least one generation behind their most advanced plants in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That means AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , the world's third-largest LCD maker, can
apply to build a 7.5-generation facility, while Chi Mei Optoelectronics can only
apply to set up a 6.5-generation plant.</P>
      <P>AUO said Friday that it would soon submit an application to set up a
7.5-generation plant in eastern or southeastern China to maintain its
competitiveness against Korean rivals in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>The South Korean government approved in late December the plans of Samsung
Electronics and LG Display, the world's two biggest panel makers, LCD
manufacturers, to set up a 7.5-generation and an 8th-generation panel plant in
China, respectively.</P>
      <P>AUO refused, however, to confirm media reports that it would collaborate with a
Chinese panel maker to set up the facility in Kunshan in China's Jiangsu
province.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said the ministry has formed a review panel headed by MOEA Deputy
Minister Huang Chung-chiou to assess and handle applications, which are expected
to be received beginning March 1.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the new regulations  also allow Taiwanese chip manufacturers to
invest in China, but they will not be allowed to build new fabs there.</P>
      <P>Instead, they will be limited to acquiring a full or partial stake in Chinese
chip makers whose foundries are at least two generations behind the investing
company's most advanced factory in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under those rules, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) will be allowed
to invest in 90-nanometer fabs in China because it has begun making chips in
Taiwan using 45nm process technology.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) has started 65nm production in Taiwan and
will therefore will be allowed to invest in chip companies using 0.13 micron
process technology in China.</P>
      <P>Previously existing investment regulations stipulated that only three chip fabs
could be built by Taiwanese chipmakers in China, under which TSMC, ProMOS
Technologies and Powerchip Semiconductor all gained approval to build 8-inch
wafer plants there using less advanced processes.</P>
      <P>But Powerchip has yet to act, and if it does not invest by August when its
permit expires,  the MOEA said it will allow other manufacturers to apply for
the slot.</P>
      <P>Powerchip was recently reported as showing renewed interest in its China fab
project, with Xuzhou in Jiangsu province mentioned as a potential site.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will also provide a legal basis for TSMC's acquisition of a
10-percent stake in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) and
UMC's acquisition of a controlling stake in Chinese wafer foundry He Jian
Technology (Suzhou) Co.</P>

      <P>Hotai Motor Co., the Taiwanese distributor of Japanese car maker Toyota Motor
Corp., is aiming to raise its market share in Taiwan to 40 percent this year as
its sales have been little affected by Toyota's worldwide recalls.</P>
      <P>Hotai Motor's market share in Taiwan rose from 35 percent in 2008 to 38 percent
last year, an equivalent of 111,000 vehicles, the company's president Daniel
Chang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>It was the seventh consecutive year that Hotai was Taiwan's best car-selling
company, posting sales of NT$72.48 billion (US$2.3 billion), according to Chang.</P>
      <P>The company plans to sell 104,100 vehicles in what is expected to be a weaker
market this year, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Hotai has revised upward its forecast for Taiwan's market in 2010 from 230,000
vehicles to 260,000, but that will still fall behind the 290,000 vehicles sold
in the country in 2009, when excise taxes were lowered to stimulate a car market
depressed by the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Toyota may be in big trouble after having to recall 8.5 million vehicles, but
Chang said Taiwan has not been seriously affected because the defective
accelerator pedal at the center of the controversy is not used in Toyota cars
marketed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hotai has also rebooted the computer software in more than 600 2010 Prius
hybrids that were subject to the recall, representing a completion rate of close
to 99 percent, Chang noted.</P>

      <P>Civil groups suggested Friday that the Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI) make public details of bank loans that have reached NT$130 billion
(US$4.1 billion) before taking action to raise the national insurance premium.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) , which supervises the BNHI's operations, has
asked the Executive Yuan to raise health insurance premium rates to save the
insurance system from financial collapse as deficits mount.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih, however, has instructed the DOH to suspend the premium
adjustment plan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Wu-chi,  an executive member of the Taiwan Hospital Association, said in a
meeting of the National Health Insurance Audit Commission Friday that the BNHI
is obliged to explain to the public why the insurance system is suffering
massive deficits and has huge loan obligations before asking for higher premium
rates.</P>
      <P>BNHI Director-General Cheng Shou-hsia responded that the bank loans were needed
to cover shortfalls from three sources -- back premiums owed by local
governments, including Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, a growing divergence between
revenues and expenditures, and the timing of government premium payments.</P>
      <P>Cheng promised to provide detailed information of the loans if requested by the
audit commission.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, the shortfalls have resulted primarily from a growing
disparity between premium revenues, which grew at an average  of 4.34 percent a
year between 1996 and 2008,  and expenditures, which grew 5.34 percent a year
over the same period.</P>
      <P>This imbalance has forced the bureau to not only exhaust its reserve fund but
also accumulate deficits surpassing NT$45 billion.</P>

      <P>The National Property Administration (NPA) defended its sales of small plots of
public land Friday after a land parcel in Taipei City fetched a near record
price in an open tender a day earlier and fueled worries of a possible property
bubble.</P>
      <P>"It would be a waste of resources if we failed to auction off small-size public
plots for private use when the market has strong demand," the bureau said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Stressing that selling small plots of land through a market mechanism  is a
normal strategy to spur and sustain economic development, the statement said the
bureau has consistently followed the principle of selling only public plots of
less than 500 pings, or 1,650 square meters.</P>
      <P>In a public auction Thursday, a 121-ping piece of public land on Jianguo S. Road
in Taipei City was sold for NT$731 million (US$22.84 million) . The unit price
of NT$6.03 million per ping was the second highest unit price for residential
land ever recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The sale followed the auction of two other plots in the city in January, which
also were sold for high prices. The deals have fed criticism that the NPA is
fanning property speculation and driving housing prices in urban areas,
particularly Taipei City and Taipei County, to levels that are unaffordable for
most local families.</P>
      <P>The bureau rejected the allegations, arguing that public land sales accounted
for only a negligible share of the domestic real estate market.</P>
      <P>Citing 2009 sales, the NPA said the 13.85 hectares of public land it auctioned
off last year for NT$10.8 billion accounted for only 0.04 percent of all the
land sold in Taiwan and 0.68 percent of the total transaction value.</P>
      <P>"Given such marginal numbers, public land sales were unlikely to affect normal
property market prices," the statement contended.</P>
      <P>Noting that the few public lots that fetched record-setting prices were all
located in Taipei City, the statement said the phenomenon mainly reflected the
decreasing amount of prime land available in a city that is the leading
indicator of economic development in the country.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that national health insurance (NHI) rates will
not be raised on March 1 and that any rate adjustment will be accompanied by
complementary measures.</P>
      <P>Wu said that before the passage of amendments launching a second-generation
health insurance system, insurance premium rates will only be adjusted after the
feasibility of proposed measures is carefully studied.</P>
      <P>The second-generation  health insurance scheme refers to a proposal that would
calculate premiums based on total household income, including both earned and
unearned income, rather than on salary, as is the case at present.</P>
      <P>Wu said that any premium adjustment will be made based on the principle of
fairness and after the waste and abuse of medical resources has been improved.</P>
      <P>He added the government will also ensure that any rate adjustment will not place
an extra financial burden on low- and middle-income individuals, and it could
even provide added subsidies to low-income insurees.</P>
      <P>In the future, Wu said, health insurance premiums will be designed to make high-
income earners pay more and low-income earners pay less.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health has been pushing for a premium rate hike to cover the
National Health Insurance system's growing deficit, caused primarily by a
growing disparity between expenditures and premium revenues.</P>
      <P>The Taipei and Kaohsiung city governments also owe the system more than NT$50
billion in back payments for contributions to premiums of individuals working in
those cities.</P>

      <P>Attorney Wellington Koo on Friday filed a class action suit against the
Kuomintang on behalf of 33 victims and 75 relatives of victims of the 228
Incident, an anti-government uprising on Feb. 28, 1947 that was violently
suppressed by the military.</P>
      <P>Koo and dozens of relatives of 228 victims gathered in front of the Taipei
District Court, where the suit was filed, demanding that the Kuomintang stand
trial and that Taiwan be given justice.</P>
      <P>The attorney said that although the government has made Feb. 28 a national
holiday in memory of the victims of the tragic incident and paid compensation to
families of the victims, the truth has not been fully revealed and some
murderers have yet to be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Because the incident occurred at a time when party rule prevailed over the
government, the Kuomintang, which held power at the time, should be held
responsible, Koo argued.</P>
      <P>He is demanding  that the KMT pay NT$2 billion  for the construction and future
operations of a National Taiwan 228 Memorial Museum at the 228 Peace Park in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident remained a taboo subject in Taiwan until the early 1990s, when
the Executive Yuan commissioned a study to find out what really happened.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Executive Yuan designated Feb. 28 a national holiday and since then
commemorative activities have been held around the island every year.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 28 this year, President Ma Ying-jeou will lead central government
officials in attending commemorative activities in Tainan in southern Taiwan,
including memorial services, exhibitions, and concerts.</P>
      <P>Since the Lantern Festival, the 15th day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, falls on
Feb. 28 this year, some local governments held memorial services to mark the
occasion in advance.</P>
      <P>In Chiayi and Tainan, local government officials and the public laid wreaths in
front of memorial monuments on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih suggested during the memorial service that
Feb. 28 should be designated Taiwanese Youth Day as a tribute to the young
victims of the 228 Incident and a reminder to young people of their
responsibilities to society.</P>

Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Friday.</P>

said Songshan Airport had been a domestic airport for many years until recently,
creating inconveniences for passengers on international flights.</P>
      <P>The airport needs to be expanded after the airport's management concluded
agreements to open international routes that will connect the city airport  to
Tokyo's  Haneda Airport,  Seoul's  Gimpo International Airport and Shanghai's

      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a "yellow-red" light in January for the third
consecutive month, an indication that the economy's recovery from last year's
global economic downturn is on a steady track, according to the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Hung Jui-pin,  director  of the CEPD's  Economic  Research Department, said
Friday that the composite score remained at 37 points, only one point short of
turning the light red, which would indicate overheating.</P>
      <P>January's leading indicators index, which forecasts economic activity over the
next three to six months, rose by 1.9 percent from December 2009 to 107.6, while
the annualized six-month rate of change of the index edged up by 0.6 percentage
points to 21.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Six of the seven components that form the leading indicators were up from a
month earlier, including average monthly overtime in the manufacturing and
service sectors, the book-to-bill ratio of North American semiconductor
equipment firms, export orders, and producers' inventory.</P>
      <P>Also higher were the stock price index and variation rate of money supply M1B,
but building permits were down.</P>
      <P>In the same month, the index of coincident indicators, which tracks the current
pace of economic activity, posed a monthly drop of 0.2 percent from a month
earlier.</P>
      <P>Four of the seven components that form the indicators showed rises, including
industrial production, real customs-cleared exports, real machinery and
electrical equipment imports and nonagricultural employment.</P>
      <P>The CEPD adopts a five-color gauge for the country's economic performance: red
reflects the economy is overheated, yellow-red signals a heating economy, green
shows stable economic growth, yellow-blue indicates an economic slowdown, and
blue indicates a recession.</P>
      <P>Hung said the indicators showed the financial, manufacturing and trade sectors
have turned for the better and consumption has become more active but that there
is still room for improvement in employment.</P>
      <P>However, he expects the global economic recovery to continue over the next six
months,  which could  give a boost to Taiwan's export-oriented economy.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsu-chia, a professor in National Chengchi University's Department of
Economics, said the "yellow-red" light indicated that Taiwan's economy has
improved considerably compared with a year earlier, but more effort is needed
for the economy to recover to its level before the financial crisis.</P>

      <P>Heavyweights of the ruling Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party gathered in Jhongli Friday evening, making a last minute push for their
respective candidates in Saturday's legislative by-election in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Legislative by-elections will be held Saturday in Taoyuan, Hualien, Hsinchu and
Chiayi counties, but the contest in Taoyuan, with four candidates who all have
strong backing, is considered the most challenging for both parties.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which failed to win any of the three legislative seats in legislative
by-elections held in early January, is expecting to recover public support in
Saturday's by-elections, while the DPP, boosted  by its sweep  last  month,  is
contending  for more representation in Taiwan's legislature.</P>
      <P>At present, the ruling KMT holds 74 seats, the DPP 30 seats, and independents
five seats in the 113-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, in his capacity as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang,
had a busy schedule Friday, traveling from Hualien in eastern Taiwan to the
northern counties of Hsinchu and Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>KMT candidates Wang Ting-sheng in Hualien, Cheng Yung-tang in Hsinchu, and Chen
Hsueh-sheng in Taoyuan are all facing fierce competition from DPP and
independent candidates.</P>
      <P>Many of the independents are KMT mavericks who have decided to run despite
facing party discipline.</P>
      <P>In Hualien County, Wang is fighting a two-front battle against DPP candidate
Hsiao Bi-khim and independent Shih Sheng-lang, who has close connections with
Hualien County Magistrate Fu Kun-chi.</P>
      <P>Fu is a former KMT member who had a big win over the KMT's candidate in the
magistrate election last December.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said Saturday that as long as KMT supporters show up at
the polls and cast their ballots for Wang on Saturday, there is good chance for
the KMT candidate to win the legislative seat for Hualien.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, campaigning for DPP candidate Peng Shao-chin in Hsinchu Saturday
afternoon, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said that although KMT-leaning voters
were the majority in three of the four constituencies in past elections, the DPP
is expecting a reversal this time.</P>
      <P>A total of 233,116 voters in Taoyuan County's third electoral district, 358,854
in Hsinchu County, 221,816 in Chiayi County's second electoral district, and

      <P>"Not signing it would bring immediate and unlimited danger. We would be
finished, " said Wu at the Legislative Yuan in response to a lawmaker's question
on what the administration would do if Taiwan fails to clinch the trade pact
with China.</P>
      <P>"The government will spare no effort to push for its success."</P>
      <P>He told the legislature that if the pact were not signed, it would be difficult
to imagine the suffering the country would endure as more and more members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) join in a regional trade bloc
from which Taiwan is excluded.</P>
      <P>When South Korea joins the bloc in the future, for instance, Taiwanese goods
will have trouble competing against Korean goods in China, as Korean products
will be exempted from 9 percent import duties while Taiwan-made goods will be
subject to the tariffs, the premier said.</P>
      <P>"No business can survive (under those circumstances)," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The premier argued that the pact would help Taiwan's businesses sell their goods
abroad and enhance the country's competitiveness in general, as it would exempt
locally made products from tariffs, safeguard the investment of local companies
in China, and protect their intellectual property.</P>
      <P>The premier also reiterated the government's promise that the pact would not
open Taiwan's market to more Chinese agricultural products or allow Chinese
laborers to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Economics Minister Shih Yen-shiang allayed lawmakers'
concerns that in exchange for letting Taiwan sign trade pacts with ASEAN
countries, China could ask ASEAN states to require that Taiwanese goods carry
"Made in Taiwan (China) " or "Made in Chinese Taipei" origin labels.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has sold its products abroad using the 'Made in Taiwan, ' label. This
practice won't be changed." Shih said.</P>
      <P>Wu's administration is negotiating the trade pact with China in hopes of
clinching it later this year. Critics of the pact argue that it will tie Taiwan
more closely to China and undermine the country's sovereignty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chip, panel makers ready to apply to invest in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)

      <P>New regulations that will allow Taiwan's chip makers and LCD panel makers to
invest in China formally took effect Friday, and several companies are expected
to file investment applications beginning March 1.</P>
      <P>Under the new laws, approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Feb.
23, Taiwan's flat panel sector will be permitted to build up to three 6th
generation and above TFT-LCD production lines in China.</P>
      <P>Local companies will only be allowed, however, to run factories that are at
least one generation behind their most advanced plants in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>That means AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , the world's third-largest LCD maker, can
apply to build a 7.5-generation facility, while Chi Mei Optoelectronics can only
apply to set up a 6.5-generation plant.</P>
      <P>AUO said Friday that it would soon submit an application to set up a
7.5-generation plant in eastern or southeastern China to maintain its
competitiveness against Korean rivals in the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>The South Korean government approved in late December the plans of Samsung
Electronics and LG Display, the world's two biggest panel makers, LCD
manufacturers, to set up a 7.5-generation and an 8th-generation panel plant in
China, respectively.</P>
      <P>AUO refused, however, to confirm media reports that it would collaborate with a
Chinese panel maker to set up the facility in Kunshan in China's Jiangsu
province.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said the ministry has formed a review panel headed by MOEA Deputy
Minister Huang Chung-chiou to assess and handle applications, which are expected
to be received beginning March 1.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the new regulations  also allow Taiwanese chip manufacturers to
invest in China, but they will not be allowed to build new fabs there.</P>
      <P>Instead, they will be limited to acquiring a full or partial stake in Chinese
chip makers whose foundries are at least two generations behind the investing
company's most advanced factory in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under those rules, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) will be allowed
to invest in 90-nanometer fabs in China because it has begun making chips in
Taiwan using 45nm process technology.</P>
      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) has started 65nm production in Taiwan and
will therefore will be allowed to invest in chip companies using 0.13 micron
process technology in China.</P>
      <P>Previously existing investment regulations stipulated that only three chip fabs
could be built by Taiwanese chipmakers in China, under which TSMC, ProMOS
Technologies and Powerchip Semiconductor all gained approval to build 8-inch
wafer plants there using less advanced processes.</P>
      <P>But Powerchip has yet to act, and if it does not invest by August when its
permit expires,  the MOEA said it will allow other manufacturers to apply for
the slot.</P>
      <P>Powerchip was recently reported as showing renewed interest in its China fab
project, with Xuzhou in Jiangsu province mentioned as a potential site.</P>
      <P>The new regulations will also provide a legal basis for TSMC's acquisition of a
10-percent stake in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) and
UMC's acquisition of a controlling stake in Chinese wafer foundry He Jian
Technology (Suzhou) Co.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hotai Motor Co., the Taiwanese distributor of Japanese car maker Toyota Motor
Corp., is aiming to raise its market share in Taiwan to 40 percent this year as
its sales have been little affected by Toyota's worldwide recalls.</P>
      <P>Hotai Motor's market share in Taiwan rose from 35 percent in 2008 to 38 percent
last year, an equivalent of 111,000 vehicles, the company's president Daniel
Chang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>It was the seventh consecutive year that Hotai was Taiwan's best car-selling
company, posting sales of NT$72.48 billion (US$2.3 billion), according to Chang.</P>
      <P>The company plans to sell 104,100 vehicles in what is expected to be a weaker
market this year, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Hotai has revised upward its forecast for Taiwan's market in 2010 from 230,000
vehicles to 260,000, but that will still fall behind the 290,000 vehicles sold
in the country in 2009, when excise taxes were lowered to stimulate a car market
depressed by the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Toyota may be in big trouble after having to recall 8.5 million vehicles, but
Chang said Taiwan has not been seriously affected because the defective
accelerator pedal at the center of the controversy is not used in Toyota cars
marketed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hotai has also rebooted the computer software in more than 600 2010 Prius
hybrids that were subject to the recall, representing a completion rate of close
to 99 percent, Chang noted.</P>

      <P>Civil groups suggested Friday that the Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI) make public details of bank loans that have reached NT$130 billion
(US$4.1 billion) before taking action to raise the national insurance premium.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) , which supervises the BNHI's operations, has
asked the Executive Yuan to raise health insurance premium rates to save the
insurance system from financial collapse as deficits mount.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih, however, has instructed the DOH to suspend the premium
adjustment plan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Wu-chi,  an executive member of the Taiwan Hospital Association, said in a
meeting of the National Health Insurance Audit Commission Friday that the BNHI
is obliged to explain to the public why the insurance system is suffering
massive deficits and has huge loan obligations before asking for higher premium
rates.</P>
      <P>BNHI Director-General Cheng Shou-hsia responded that the bank loans were needed
to cover shortfalls from three sources -- back premiums owed by local
governments, including Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, a growing divergence between
revenues and expenditures, and the timing of government premium payments.</P>
      <P>Cheng promised to provide detailed information of the loans if requested by the
audit commission.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, the shortfalls have resulted primarily from a growing
disparity between premium revenues, which grew at an average  of 4.34 percent a
year between 1996 and 2008,  and expenditures, which grew 5.34 percent a year
over the same period.</P>
      <P>This imbalance has forced the bureau to not only exhaust its reserve fund but
also accumulate deficits surpassing NT$45 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Property agency defends public land sales</HEADLINE>

      <P>The National Property Administration (NPA) defended its sales of small plots of
public land Friday after a land parcel in Taipei City fetched a near record
price in an open tender a day earlier and fueled worries of a possible property
bubble.</P>
      <P>"It would be a waste of resources if we failed to auction off small-size public
plots for private use when the market has strong demand," the bureau said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Stressing that selling small plots of land through a market mechanism  is a
normal strategy to spur and sustain economic development, the statement said the
bureau has consistently followed the principle of selling only public plots of
less than 500 pings, or 1,650 square meters.</P>
      <P>In a public auction Thursday, a 121-ping piece of public land on Jianguo S. Road
in Taipei City was sold for NT$731 million (US$22.84 million) . The unit price
of NT$6.03 million per ping was the second highest unit price for residential
land ever recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The sale followed the auction of two other plots in the city in January, which
also were sold for high prices. The deals have fed criticism that the NPA is
fanning property speculation and driving housing prices in urban areas,
particularly Taipei City and Taipei County, to levels that are unaffordable for
most local families.</P>
      <P>The bureau rejected the allegations, arguing that public land sales accounted
for only a negligible share of the domestic real estate market.</P>
      <P>Citing 2009 sales, the NPA said the 13.85 hectares of public land it auctioned
off last year for NT$10.8 billion accounted for only 0.04 percent of all the
land sold in Taiwan and 0.68 percent of the total transaction value.</P>
      <P>"Given such marginal numbers, public land sales were unlikely to affect normal
property market prices," the statement contended.</P>
      <P>Noting that the few public lots that fetched record-setting prices were all
located in Taipei City, the statement said the phenomenon mainly reflected the
decreasing amount of prime land available in a city that is the leading
indicator of economic development in the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that national health insurance (NHI) rates will
not be raised on March 1 and that any rate adjustment will be accompanied by
complementary measures.</P>
      <P>Wu said that before the passage of amendments launching a second-generation
health insurance system, insurance premium rates will only be adjusted after the
feasibility of proposed measures is carefully studied.</P>
      <P>The second-generation  health insurance scheme refers to a proposal that would
calculate premiums based on total household income, including both earned and
unearned income, rather than on salary, as is the case at present.</P>
      <P>Wu said that any premium adjustment will be made based on the principle of
fairness and after the waste and abuse of medical resources has been improved.</P>
      <P>He added the government will also ensure that any rate adjustment will not place
an extra financial burden on low- and middle-income individuals, and it could
even provide added subsidies to low-income insurees.</P>
      <P>In the future, Wu said, health insurance premiums will be designed to make high-
income earners pay more and low-income earners pay less.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health has been pushing for a premium rate hike to cover the
National Health Insurance system's growing deficit, caused primarily by a
growing disparity between expenditures and premium revenues.</P>
      <P>The Taipei and Kaohsiung city governments also owe the system more than NT$50
billion in back payments for contributions to premiums of individuals working in
those cities.</P>

      <P>Attorney Wellington Koo on Friday filed a class action suit against the
Kuomintang on behalf of 33 victims and 75 relatives of victims of the 228
Incident, an anti-government uprising on Feb. 28, 1947 that was violently
suppressed by the military.</P>
      <P>Koo and dozens of relatives of 228 victims gathered in front of the Taipei
District Court, where the suit was filed, demanding that the Kuomintang stand
trial and that Taiwan be given justice.</P>
      <P>The attorney said that although the government has made Feb. 28 a national
holiday in memory of the victims of the tragic incident and paid compensation to
families of the victims, the truth has not been fully revealed and some
murderers have yet to be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Because the incident occurred at a time when party rule prevailed over the
government, the Kuomintang, which held power at the time, should be held
responsible, Koo argued.</P>
      <P>He is demanding  that the KMT pay NT$2 billion  for the construction and future
operations of a National Taiwan 228 Memorial Museum at the 228 Peace Park in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident remained a taboo subject in Taiwan until the early 1990s, when
the Executive Yuan commissioned a study to find out what really happened.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Executive Yuan designated Feb. 28 a national holiday and since then
commemorative activities have been held around the island every year.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 28 this year, President Ma Ying-jeou will lead central government
officials in attending commemorative activities in Tainan in southern Taiwan,
including memorial services, exhibitions, and concerts.</P>
      <P>Since the Lantern Festival, the 15th day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, falls on
Feb. 28 this year, some local governments held memorial services to mark the
occasion in advance.</P>
      <P>In Chiayi and Tainan, local government officials and the public laid wreaths in
front of memorial monuments on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih suggested during the memorial service that
Feb. 28 should be designated Taiwanese Youth Day as a tribute to the young
victims of the 228 Incident and a reminder to young people of their
responsibilities to society.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a "yellow-red" light in January for the third
consecutive month, an indication that the economy's recovery from last year's
global economic downturn is on a steady track, according to the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Hung Jui-pin,  director  of the CEPD's  Economic  Research Department, said
Friday that the composite score remained at 37 points, only one point short of
turning the light red, which would indicate overheating.</P>
      <P>January's leading indicators index, which forecasts economic activity over the
next three to six months, rose by 1.9 percent from December 2009 to 107.6, while
the annualized six-month rate of change of the index edged up by 0.6 percentage
points to 21.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Six of the seven components that form the leading indicators were up from a
month earlier, including average monthly overtime in the manufacturing and
service sectors, the book-to-bill ratio of North American semiconductor
equipment firms, export orders, and producers' inventory.</P>
      <P>Also higher were the stock price index and variation rate of money supply M1B,
but building permits were down.</P>
      <P>In the same month, the index of coincident indicators, which tracks the current
pace of economic activity, posed a monthly drop of 0.2 percent from a month
earlier.</P>
      <P>Four of the seven components that form the indicators showed rises, including
industrial production, real customs-cleared exports, real machinery and
electrical equipment imports and nonagricultural employment.</P>
      <P>The CEPD adopts a five-color gauge for the country's economic performance: red
reflects the economy is overheated, yellow-red signals a heating economy, green
shows stable economic growth, yellow-blue indicates an economic slowdown, and
blue indicates a recession.</P>
      <P>Hung said the indicators showed the financial, manufacturing and trade sectors
have turned for the better and consumption has become more active but that there
is still room for improvement in employment.</P>
      <P>However, he expects the global economic recovery to continue over the next six
months,  which could  give a boost to Taiwan's export-oriented economy.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsu-chia, a professor in National Chengchi University's Department of
Economics, said the "yellow-red" light indicated that Taiwan's economy has
improved considerably compared with a year earlier, but more effort is needed
for the economy to recover to its level before the financial crisis.</P>

      <P>Heavyweights of the ruling Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party gathered in Jhongli Friday evening, making a last minute push for their
respective candidates in Saturday's legislative by-election in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Legislative by-elections will be held Saturday in Taoyuan, Hualien, Hsinchu and
Chiayi counties, but the contest in Taoyuan, with four candidates who all have
strong backing, is considered the most challenging for both parties.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which failed to win any of the three legislative seats in legislative
by-elections held in early January, is expecting to recover public support in
Saturday's by-elections, while the DPP, boosted  by its sweep  last  month,  is
contending  for more representation in Taiwan's legislature.</P>
      <P>At present, the ruling KMT holds 74 seats, the DPP 30 seats, and independents
five seats in the 113-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, in his capacity as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang,
had a busy schedule Friday, traveling from Hualien in eastern Taiwan to the
northern counties of Hsinchu and Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>KMT candidates Wang Ting-sheng in Hualien, Cheng Yung-tang in Hsinchu, and Chen
Hsueh-sheng in Taoyuan are all facing fierce competition from DPP and
independent candidates.</P>
      <P>Many of the independents are KMT mavericks who have decided to run despite
facing party discipline.</P>
      <P>In Hualien County, Wang is fighting a two-front battle against DPP candidate
Hsiao Bi-khim and independent Shih Sheng-lang, who has close connections with
Hualien County Magistrate Fu Kun-chi.</P>
      <P>Fu is a former KMT member who had a big win over the KMT's candidate in the
magistrate election last December.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said Saturday that as long as KMT supporters show up at
the polls and cast their ballots for Wang on Saturday, there is good chance for
the KMT candidate to win the legislative seat for Hualien.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>, the year-end mayoral elections in the southern municipalities of Tainan and
Kaohsiung will be a piece of cake. On the contrary, the Kuomintang (KMT) has so
far failed to find suitable candidates to run in the races.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Taiwan's politics has developed a trend in which the south
is dominated by the green camp, while the north is controlled by the blue camp.
The KMT itself is to blame for the situation. In power in Taiwan for many years,
the KMT has often tended to "value the north above the south." How can the KMT
reverse its downfall in the south?</P>
      <P>The policy of the central government is a priority. Targeting the disaster-prone
southern regions, the central government must work out precautionary measures.
It also needs to present plans to bridge the north-south development divide.</P>
      <P>With communication failures being a common problem within the administration of
President Ma Ying-jeou, how to communicate with voters in southern Taiwan is
another major issue.</P>
      <P>Certainly, a lack of talent in the south is the most crucial issue. The KMT
should nurture new talent and recruit capable individuals to return to their
hometowns to run for public office, so as to rebuild the party's foundation in
the south.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ceremonies, Hollywood movie remember 228 Incident after 63 years</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
02/27/10  15:00:35
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A series of ceremonies, exhibitions and concerts are being held across Taiwan
and a Hollywood movie is being screened in the U.S. over the weekend to
commemorate the 228 Incident, an anti-government uprising on Feb. 28, 1947 that
was violently suppressed by the military and government at the time.</P>
      <P>The incident, in which the beating of a Taiwanese woman selling unlicensed
cigarettes by then-ruling Kuomintang (KMT) police led to rioting that spread
across the island and was brutally crushed by KMT troops sent over from China.</P>
      <P>It marked the start of the KMT's infamous "White Terror" purge of "dissidents, "
which is considered one of the darkest periods in modern Taiwan history. People
suspected of being anti-government were jailed and many of them died or
disappeared, with no explanations given to their families.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, President Ma Ying-jeou will attend an annual ceremony, with a theme
of "remember the past, embrace the future, " organized by the government in
southern Tainan city, while local groups will also organize various events in
Taiwan's major cities.</P>
      <P>In the United States, a film about the assassination of a Taiwanese-American in
the United States in 1983, during Taiwan's martial law period, is being screened
this weekend across America. The film "Formosa Betrayed, " a political thriller,
takes its title from abook published in 1965 by former U.S. Consul George Kerr,
who documented his observation of the incident.</P>
      <P>It is produced by second-generation Taiwanese-American Will Tiao and directed by
Adam Kane.</P>
      <P>Discussion about the 228 Incident is no longer a taboo, which had been the case
during the 38 years (1949-1987) of martial law in Taiwan, although it is
sometimes seen as a tool for political mobilization and a topic that could
destabilize ethnic harmony between longtime Taiwanese residents and people who
immigrated to the island from China in the late 1940s.</P>
      <P>President Ma as well as former presidents Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian have
all offered government apologies over that period of history in official
settings.</P>
      <P>More than a dozen memorial monuments to commemorate the victims of the 228
Incident have been erected around the island. One of them, the Taipei 228
Memorial Museum, was established in the 228 Memorial Park, which was renamed by
then-Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian in 1996.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Executive Yuan or Cabinet designated Feb. 28 a national holiday in 1997
and completed a full investigation report of the incident in 2003.</P>
      <P>"Only when we can face historical truths squarely, without any cover-ups, will
we strike the right attitude," President Ma said last November in a ceremony to
mark the integration of the planned memorial hall and the Taipei 228 Memorial
Museum.</P>
      <P>However, there are still controversies surrounding the incident.</P>
      <P>Death counts in the incidents ranged from less than 1,000 to "somewhere between
18,000-28,000, " as stated in the Executive Yuan's report. Some victims and
families of victims disagree on the amount of compensation offered from the
government as well as whether Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was the person
responsible for ordering the brutal killings.</P>
      <P>Almost 63 years after the incident, a class action suit was filed Friday against
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) by 33 victims and 75 relatives of victims, who
demanded that the KMT pay NT$2 billion for the construction and future
operations of a National Taiwan 228 Memorial Museum. The group also demanded the
KMT - the ruling party at the time - apologize.</P>
      <P>Wellington Koo, an attorney representing the 228 Incident victims in the case,
said that although the government has made Feb. 28 a national holiday and paid
compensation to families, the truth has not been fully revealed and some
murderers have yet to be prosecuted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President calls for support for Taiwanese film by rejecting piracy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called for people who have watched pirated versions of
Taiwan's latest box office hit "Monga" to watch the film again at movie theaters
as a way to support locally produced films.</P>
      <P>Ma made the call in his latest weekly online administration journal. "Rejecting
piracy is supporting locally produced films, " he wrote.</P>
      <P>He noted that a pirated version of Taiwanese film "Cape No.7" -- one of Taiwan's
best-selling films -- hit the market three months after its release in June
2008, and that the same piracy attacked "Monga" less than four weeks after its
release.</P>
      <P>This rampant copyright infringement not only strikes a blow to the creativity
and confidence of local film makers but also hinders the Taiwanese film industry
from making progress, he said.</P>
      <P>The greatest harm is unauthorized downloading from the Internet, which causes
incalculable damage, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Innovation" is the way for Taiwan to grow stronger and what it fears the most
is the practice of intellectual property theft, he added, noting that he has
instructed the Executive Yuan to reinforce measures to crack down on piracy.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that "Monga, " a film set in Taipei's old Wanhua district
and featuring brotherhood, justice and love among gangsters, has lost some NT$80
million (US$2.5 million) as a result of piracy.</P>
      <P>It grossed NT$18 million at the box office on its first day in local cinemas
Feb. 5, marking the highest box office sales ever on premiere night in Taiwan,
beating out the Hollywood blockbuster Avatar, which debuted Dec. 17.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: No more bribes in by-elections</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/27/10  15:27:13
(Feb. 27, 2010) (By Fanny Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative by-elections will be held Saturday in Taoyuan, Hualien, Hsinchu and
Chiayi counties. People should not ignore the fact that some of the by-elections
have been held recently because the legislative seats were made vacant following
the invalidation of their election wins involving bribery scandals.</P>
      <P>However,  rumors still swirled  about alleged  bribing  in by-elections.
Authorities should keep investigating election bribery and encourage people to
report suspected bribery cases and give cash rewards for information or tip
offs.</P>
      <P>In fact, the reason for the ruling Kuomintang losing three legislative seats in
legislative by-elections held in early January, was the KMT voters' lack of
interest in voting, instead of any increase of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's voters.</P>
      <P>The KMT voters did not want to vote partly because they did not get the money
they expected,  and also because of the under performance of President Ma's
government.</P>
      <P>Without money or strong local connections, the party can hardly win voters'
support. Those candidates who lack local connections and are just designated by
the party, are usually accused of not caring much about local interests.</P>
      <P>The KMT and DPP have been accusing each other nominating candidates who lack
understanding of local affairs. However, that approach in election campaigns may
no longer have much impact on voters.</P>
      <P>The key to winning the election will be how to ask their voters to vote.
Traditionally, the DPP voters are much more passionate than the KMT's, and that
is the DPP's advantage. And the KMT seems better on managing local factions and
interest groups.</P>
      <P>However, if a party decides to send another candidate who lacks local background
to run by-elections, the party's other candidates with long-term local
connections may get angry.</P>
      <P>On this front, the KMT has a bigger problem than the DPP. The KMT might even
lose by-elections again if they fail to maneuver their election strategies
properly.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of victims of the 228 Incident and their families filed a lawsuit
against the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Friday demanding that the party pay NT$2
billion for the construction and operation of the National Taiwan 228 Memorial
Museum. This appeal, which points directly to the core of the historic tragedy,
deserves the attention of society.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident of 1947 resulted in the highest casualties for a single
incident in Taiwanese history and is also the one that has had the most profound
impact. It is unacceptable that after 63 years have passed, the truth has yet to
be revealed and that justice has in no way been upheld. The exact number of
deaths remains unclear and there has not been a single main KMT persecutor who
has admitted his guilt and apologized.</P>
      <P>With transitional justice yet to be achieved, the truth of the 228 Incident is
considered taboo, and many people still lack sufficient understanding of
Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>The latest example of this is President Ma Ying-jeou's honoring of historian
Huang Chang-chien early this month for his efforts in uncovering the truth of
the 228 Incident. Huang claims that only 673 people were killed in the massacre,
that the incident was properly managed by Kaohsiung Garrison Commander Peng
Meng-chi, and even that the crackdown was actually instigated by U.S. diplomat
George Kerr. Such shockingly arbitrary conclusions, which run contrary to those
reached by other historians, have won Ma's favor and this highlights Ma's
unapologetic attitude toward the incident.</P>
      <P>More vicious still, on every anniversary of the 228 Incident or in election
campaigns, Ma has made the best of his political showmanship and has displayed
various insincere gestures, including apologizing to the families of the
victims.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese people should spike the guns of the KMT so that it can no longer
cheat them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Controversial public land sales</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>A 121-ping  (one ping equals  3.3 square  meters)
02/27/10  15:35:06
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>plot of public land in Taipei City was sold for NT$731 million (US$22.74
million) in a public auction Thursday. The unit price of NT$6.03 million per
ping is the second-highest unit price for residential land ever recorded in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the public is complaining about unaffordable housing prices, whether the
National Property Administration's (NPA's) decision to sell public land at this
time is fueling surging real estate prices or contributing to the property
bubble has become a focus of concern.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-teh said the sale of the public land accounts for only
a fraction of all land sold in Taiwan and urged the public to be rational and to
respect the market mechanism.</P>
      <P>The NPA defended its decision too, saying that if it does not sell land to meet
the needs of the private sector, it would be a "waste."</P>
      <P>The release of public land through market mechanism helps spur economic
development, it continued.</P>
      <P>It said the use of national land is based on the principle of "public land for
public use" and that it gives priority for the use of the central and local
governments.</P>
      <P>The NPA said it also follows the policy of "selling small pieces of land but
keeping the large ones, " and has sold only public plots of less than 500 pings.</P>
      <P>It also said public sales account for a negligible share of the domestic real
estate market.</P>
      <P>Citing 2009 sales, the NPA said the 13.85 hectares of public land it auctioned
off last year for NT$10.8 billion accounted for only 0.04 percent of all the
land sold in Taiwan and 0.68 percent of the total transaction value of NT$1.58
trillion.</P>
      <P>It explained that in the sales, the few that fetched exorbitant prices were
invariably located in Taipei City, which is mainly because Taipei City is an
index area of economic development and the available land is now decreasing.
(Feb. 27, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Real estate businesses think the government should suspend the sale of public
land for the time being to dampen the overheated housing market and help the
sound development of the property market.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsin-ming, president of the Pacific Assets Management Co., said that
obtaining land in urban areas has become more difficult in recent years and that
public land has become a shortcut for developers.</P>
      <P>Some bidders often scramble to buy small pieces of land near public land and
await their chances to get windfall profits.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that once public land in one area fetches a good price, other
construction projects and even second-hand houses in the area will ride on the
coattails and see price surges.</P>
      <P>Tamkang University professor Chuang Meng-han said public land sold by the NPA
has continued to set record prices, which will whip up panic among the public
that if they do not act quickly to buy a house, they will never be able to
afford one.</P>
      <P>The public land sold by the NPA over the past two years has mostly fallen into
the hands of the conglomerates, and the prices have continued to set records, he
said.</P>
      <P>If the government wants to return to the fundamentals of housing prices, he
suggested that it suspend sales of public land to cool the market.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan  Chairman  Wang Yao-hsin  said it is "outrageous" to see one
ping of land being sold for over NT$6 million.</P>
      <P>Wang took the NPA's approach to task, saying that the bidding for land in Taipei
City has lost all rationality.</P>
      <P>The NPA should not stimulate land price hikes through its public land sales. He
also said land priced at over NT$6 million per ping is beyond the risk
management of a bank and that his bank will never undertake such financing.

      <P>An annual two-day fireworks festival -- the Yenshui Beehive Fireworks Festival
-- opened in the town of the same name in southern Taiwan's Tainan County
Saturday morning and will culminate in a finale on Sunday night.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, a palanquin carrying a statue of the legendary hero Kuanyu (dating
back to the early 3rd century) and over 100 martial arts troupes began a parade
to ward off evil spirits.</P>
      <P>The Yenshui Beehive Fireworks Festival originated from the folk custom in the
region of the late 19th Century when villagers suffering from serious cholera
epidemics sought protection.</P>
      <P>They held religious services, asking help from Kuanyu, a heroic figure in
Chinese history who was made a saint in folk belief. They also tried to scare
away evil spirits which they believe had brought them the disease by setting off
masses of firecrackers.</P>
      <P>While explosions of firecrackers still highlight the festivities nowadays, as
well as the light and sound of fireworks shooting off everywhere as the
palanquin travels through the streets,  the highlight of the festival falls on
the night of the Lantern Festival, Sunday this year, when piles of fireworks in
the shapes of huge teapots, chariots, and golden ingots are lit.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the annual event attracted thousands of visitors from home and
abroad to the small township and has become a tourism promotion feature.</P>
      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-jhih invited foreign guests from 17 countries to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over the past several months there have been many negative media reports about
the Control Yuan, such as controversial leadership or remarks by the Control
Yuan president, controversial handling of a corrective  proposal  causing  a
company  to make a newspaper announcement against it, improper handling of
political cases, and the issuing of too many administrative instructions.</P>
      <P>If the Control Yuan does not review its problems or make improvements, its
legitimacy and authority will be undermined in the long run.</P>
      <P>The public expectations for Control Yuan President Wang Chien- shien were very
high when he first took office in 2008. However, his behavior -- such as getting
personally involved in investigations, participating in the examination
committees of cases of impeachment and imposing restrictions on voluntary
investigation cases -- have caused internal controversy and a split within the
Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>There have also been other controversies, such as the Control Yuan applying  a
new law retroactively  and correcting  local governments by saying they misused
their administrative ruling authority, that have affected the public interest.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan has also used distorted figures as evidence in corrective
proposals that have jeopardized a legitimate company's interests and reputation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the impeachments of Taitung Magistrate Kuang Li-chen and State
Public Prosecutor-General Chen Tsung-ming were passed under media pressure after
a second review. This indicates that the reasons for impeachments might not be
sufficient and that the procedures were rather unconvincing.</P>
      <P>We hope the Control Yuan president can assist the yuan to establish sound
conditions for carrying out investigations and be more cautious when making
comments.</P>
      <P>In order to protect the rights of the people and the Control Yuan's reputation,
we also expect the Control Yuan members to exercise their rights and powers with
extreme caution, as well as to collect complete and accurate evidence during
investigations.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This year, a central government ceremony to mark the anniversary of the 228
Incident will take place in Tainan City, with the theme of "remembering the
past, embracing the future."</P>
      <P>However, Tainan City is not known as a main scene of the 228 Incident. The main
heritage site related to the incident in the city is a park where lawyer Tang
Teh-chang was executed. Instead, it is better known as the capital of the
Koxinga Dynasty founded by Ming loyalist Cheng Cheng-kung in the 17th century.</P>
      <P>For many years, Tainan City has been labeled as a stronghold of the green camp
led by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , and this year's 228
commemorative ceremony will probably be manipulated by local politicians in a
"green" direction.</P>
      <P>The merger of Tainan City with Tainan County and Kaohsiung City with Kaohsiung
County next year means that southern Taiwan will almost be completely
"greenified." If the DPP continues to indulge the people with the memory of the
228 Incident, we have no idea how it will meet the challenges of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, not to mention releasing Taiwan from the spell of blue-green
confrontation.</P>
      <P>Tainan City should transcend the anti-Ching experience of the Koxinga era and
transcend the political shadow of the Tang Teh-chang period.</P>
      <P>If the DPP can unlock complete memories of history and face up to the realistic
panorama of cross-strait ties and globalization, it will naturally find out how
to "remember the past and greet the future."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Saturday
that its summer camps for children of Taiwanese businessmen in China have become
ever more popular over the years and he urged more support for the program.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General  Kao Wen-cheng  also said the government has only
limited resources and that the program will need more public support to allow
more children  of the Taiwanese businessmen to come to Taiwan to learn about the
country.</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 800,000 Taiwanese businessmen or officials working for
Taiwanese businesses operating in China.</P>
      <P>At present, there are four schools in China dedicated to educating the children
of Taiwanese businessmen in China -- in Donggong, Shenzhen, Shanghai and
Kunshan, with another currently in the planning stages in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The SEF,  in cooperation  with the Wei-Chuan Cultural and Educational
Foundation, first held the summer camps in July 2004.</P>
      <P>In the first year, more than 100 children attended the camps.</P>
      <P>Since then, the SEF has held the camps every year to explore the beauty of
Taiwan, with courses ranging from learning traditional Chinese,  phonetic
pronunciation,  appreciating traditional folk culture such as hand puppetry and
getting a taste of Taiwan's infrastructure and economic development.</P>
      <P>The SEF will arrange for more of these children to attend summer camp in Taiwan
this year, an SEF official said. The official said that 480, including 330
students from elementary schools and 150 from junior and senior high schools,
will attend the camps to help them learn more about their native land.</P>
      <P>"The activity has been warmly welcomed by Taiwanese businessmen operating in
China, " Kao said.</P>
      <P>Kao said the camps have become more popular over the years due to support from
the Mainland Affairs Council -- the nation's top China policy-making body -- and
the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>However, he said that even with the number of students increasing to 480 this
year, it is still a far cry from meeting demand, noting that the number of
students enrolled at the Taiwanese Businessmen's Dongguan School in Guangdong
Province alone is nearly 1,800.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Last week's decision by the Fed to raise its discount rate by a quarter of a
point jittered global stock markets. In late last year and at the beginning of
this year, all major international research institutes expected that the U.S.
was not going to change its easy monetary policy this year. However, in less
than two months, the Fed not only raised its discount rate but also implied a
possible rate hike in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>The U.S. interest rate move not only affects the monetary policies of many other
countries but also affects the global flow of funds and the trend of the U.S.
dollar.</P>
      <P>Since January, the euro and the sterling lost ground against the U.S. currency
by 5 percent and 6 percent, respectively. This reflected not just the crisis in
Greece and Spain but also somewhat revealed the future trend of the greenback.</P>
      <P>With the U.S. dollar likely to move higher this year, the Chinese yuan -- if
pegged to the U.S. currency -- will also move up against a basket of foreign
currencies. However, some media have reported that China may scrap the yuan-
dollar peg.</P>
      <P>If this happens, the Chinese yuan might not follow the U.S. dollar in
appreciation and the Chinese government might therefore be criticized by the
U.S. and European countries.</P>
      <P>However, if the Chinese government decides to let the yuan advance further
against the greenback, that might bring more funds into China and create more
bubbles, as well as cause greater impact on its export-oriented manufacturing
industries, which have been struggling with labor shortage problems.</P>
      <P>The appreciation of the Chinese yuan -- like the U.S. rate hike -- looks
inevitable, but we do not know when that will happen.</P>
      <P>China might be faced with similar conditions that Taiwan and Japan experienced
in their bubble economies -- such as pressure from the U.S., more trade
disputes, a continuing labor shortage, rising wages, overheated stock and
housing prices, and possible moves in its exchange rates. (Feb. 27, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won three out of four seats up
for grabs in Saturday's legislative by-elections but tasted its sweetest victory
in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Analysts said Taoyuan County has been traditionally dominated by the ruling
Kuomintang-led pan-blue camp, with the blue majority even more pronounced in the
county's Chungli City.</P>
      <P>In previous elections, the pan-blue camp could be assured of easy victory as
long as it could remain united.</P>
      <P>But DPP candidate Huang Jen-shu, a first-time runner for the legislative seat,
beat Chen Hsueh-sheng, a former KMT legislator, by a slim margin of just 2,763
votes to make his mark in the legislative by-election.</P>
      <P>When choosing its candidate in the Taoyuan County primary, the KMT had to
persuade Chungli Mayor Yeh Pu-liang, who was leading in opinion polls, to drop
out of the election because of his involvement in a government procurement
scandal.</P>
      <P>It then nominated Chen, who ranked third in the public opinion polls.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT was unable to dissuade two other KMT members -- Wu Yu-tung and
Lin Hsiang-mei -- to bow out of the race and the two insisted on running,
effectively splitting the KMT vote and spelling disaster for Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen had to face attacks from both inside and outside the KMT right from the
beginning of the campaign.</P>
      <P>He failed in his re-election bid in the 2004 legislative election and failed
again to get the KMT's nomination in the Kaohsiung mayoral election of 2006. He
was invited to serve as top cultural official by Vice Premier Eric Liluan Chu,
then Taoyuan magistrate, in 2007.</P>
      <P>Although Chen stayed in Taoyuan for three years, he engaged himself mostly in
cultural affairs and his connections with the locals could not match those of
the other candidates.</P>
      <P>He also had to fight his rival's publicity campaign which made hay of his
position as an "outsider, " leaving him to fight a hard battle to the very last
minute.</P>
      <P>Huang has served as a four-term county councilor. Although he has no brilliant
academic or career record and cannot speak eloquently, he has served at the
grassroots level for over 20 years and has good credibility.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Supporters send new signal to KMT in by-election defeats: scholars</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Supporters of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) sent a new signal of discontent to the
party Saturday, when the KMT managed to win only one of four legislative by-
elections, scholars said later that day.</P>
      <P>The ruling party suffered a fresh setback after losing in Taoyuan County,
Hsinchu County and Chiayi County, with its only victory coming in Hualien
County. The by-elections were held because local lawmakers that previously held
the seats were elected to serve as county magistrates.</P>
      <P>The KMT's supporters sent a clear message by not turning up at polling stations,
said Lin Huo-wang, a professor at National Taiwan University who also serves as
senior advisor to President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>"It (the defeat) tells President Ma, who doubles as KMT chairman, that he should
stop trying to woo voters from the opposition Pan-green camp. A political party
will not be able to hold its core support if it drifts further away from its
ideals, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>The low turnout rate and crushing election results are evidence that the party's
supporters staged a "silent protest" by not voting, said Lo Chih-cheng, a
political scientist at Soochow University.</P>
      <P>The KMT lost three other legislative by-elections last month and also did not
fare well in any of the five elections that have taken place since Ma assumed
office in May 2008. The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , on
the other hand, has gained more ground thanks to the elections, boosting its
number of seats in the 113-member Legislative Yuan from 30 to 33.</P>
      <P>At a post-election press conference, KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung
conceded defeat for the party but pledged continued reforms, saying that
introspection is vital for the party if it wants to win back support in future
elections.</P>
      <P>The candidate nominations were the key reason behind the defeat, according to
legislator-turned-television pundit Jaw Shao-kong, who noted that the KMT
neither placed local politicians at the top of the nomination lists nor went
with the momentum during the nomination process.</P>
      <P>"You have to go with the flow rather than trying to create the specific momentum
of your desire, " he pointed out, adding that the KMT needs to find a way to
"stop bleeding."</P>
      <P>The KMT's nomination strategy presented mixed messages, Lo said, because it went
with a candidate like Wang Ting-sheng, a university professor who narrowly beat
the DPP's Hsiao Bi-khim in Hualien, but compromised with local factions and
nominated Cheng Yung-tang in Hsinchu, where he ended up losing.</P>
      <P>He noted that the KMT has been having trouble "turning the game around" and said
the momentum could cause a ripple effect that will negatively  impact its
prospects  in five special municipality elections at the end of the year that
are considered even more important than the two recent legislative by-elections.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that more white-collar workers and middle-class people are
supporting the opposition. And bear in mind that there are more voters like this
in the five special municipalities, " he said.</P>
      <P>There is no such place as a "stronghold" nowadays in Taiwanese elections, Jaw
said,  because voters are no longer fooled by politicians and political parties.</P>

      <P>A tsunami triggered by a massive earthquake that struck Chile early Saturday is
not expected to have a major impact on Taiwan, located on the other side of the
Pacific Ocean, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii removed Taiwan from a
Tsunami advisory list earlier in the day, said Kuo Kai-wen, director of the
CWB's Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>A PTWC tsunami advisory has been in effect for coastal areas in Pacific Rim
countries after a magnitude 8.8 earthquake hit central Chile in the early hours
of Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the tsunami warning center, the tsunami reached Hawaii at 6:11 a.m.
Sunday, Taiwan time, but the waves averaged only 52 cm high, far smaller than
previously forecast by the center, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The earthquake-triggered tsunami was forecast to have subsided further by the
time it reached Guam, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>"It will have diminished even further by the time it reaches Taiwan's eastern
coast at 2:21 p.m., " Kuo forecast, adding that the CWB will not issue a tsunami
warning for the Taiwan area.</P>
      <P>However, Kuo nevertheless warned the public to stay away from beaches along
Taiwan's eastern coast Sunday and the following day, just in case.</P>
      <P>As of press time, at least 80 people had been killed by the earthquake in Chile,
and the death toll was reported to be still climbing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Weight gain bid pays off as Taiwan wins world tug-of-war title</HEADLINE>

      <P>A tug-of-war team from the Taipei Jingmei Girls High School won the 2010 World
Indoor Championship in Italy Saturday, thanks to the success of the athletes'
strenuous efforts to train and bulk up over the past several months.</P>
      <P>The Jingmei team beat teams from China, Japan and Switzerland in three rounds of
competition  to capture  the 540 kg category championship.</P>
      <P>The team secured a landslide  in the first phase of the round-robin competition
and defeated the Swiss squad in the second stage of the contest to enter the
finals with a score of 2:0.</P>
      <P>In the best-of-three finals, Jingmei lost its first match to a formidable
Chinese team, but managed to win the following two matches to clinch the title.</P>
      <P>Jingmei school principal Lin Li-hua said Sunday that she takes pride in the
team's firm determination, can-do spirit and sporting prowess.</P>
      <P>"The whole team endured hardships and overcame many difficulties to qualify for
the competition and eventually emerge as the winner, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>As the Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council (SAC) would only subsidize teams for
the 540 kg competition, the 12 team members had been piling on the pounds to
gain weight over the past few months, in addition to doing intense physical
training.</P>
      <P>The team managed to increase weight by a combined total of 60 kg to qualify for
the competition, Lin said, adding that one member even gained 20 kg to reach 93
kg.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the school's parents association and teachers donated more than
NT$500,000 (US$15,625) to help finance the travel costs for the team. According
to government regulations, the SAC could only finance travel for eight members
of the team.</P>
      <P>Lin said the squad will undergo a five-day weight-loss program immediately after
their return Monday in order to qualify for a 500-kg competition in the Asian
Cup Tug-of-War Championship scheduled to open March 7. Each athlete will have to
lose an average of 5 kilograms so that the aggregate team weight will not exceed
500 kg., Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei municipal  Jingmei school has won the national tug-of-war
championship for six consecutive years.</P>
      <P>The 2010 World Indoor Championship, organized by the Tug-of-War International
Federation, took place in the Italian city of Cesenatico Feb. 25-28. The Jingmei
team also won the championship in an open game held on the opening day of the
event.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Another KMT setback in legislative by-elections</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
02/28/10  15:41:24
(Feb. 28, 2010)
(Feb. 28, 2010)

    <TEXT>
      <P>suffered yet another setback Saturday as it failed to take three out of four
legislative seats up for grabs in Saturday's by-elections.</P>
      <P>With the latest defeat coming hard on the heels of the party's disastrous
performance in last December's local government chief elections and all three
seats at stake in Jan. 9 legislative by-elections, some KMT members have
expressed concern that a domino effect could hurt the party in year-end mayoral
elections for five special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took three seats in the
legislative by-elections in Chiayi, Hsinchu and Taoyuan counties -- the latter
two of which used to be traditional KMT strongholds. The KMT only took the
Hualien County seat.</P>
      <P>All four-by elections were held to fill seats made vacant when former
Legislators Chang Hwa-kuan from Chiayi, John Wu from Taoyuan, Chiu Ching-chun
from Hsinchu and Fu Kun-chi from Hualien were elected county magistrates in
their respective constituencies in the December elections last year.</P>
      <P>Following its latest victory, the DPP will see its seats in the 113- seat
legislature grow to 33, compared to 75 for the KMT and five for independents.</P>
      <P>The DPP scored the biggest victory in Chiayi, with DPP former Magistrate Chen
Ming-wen crushing the KMT's Lin Teh-jui by 57,451 to 27,138 votes, a record high
for the DPP in the county.</P>
      <P>In Hsinchu, DPP candidate Perng Shaw-jiin obtained 71,625 votes, compared to the
KMT's Cheng Yung-tang's 56,342.</P>
      <P>In Taoyuan, DPP hopeful Huang Jen-ju cashed in on a KMT split by garnering a
slim majority of 45,363 votes over the 42,600 ballots obtained by his KMT
contender, Apollo Chen.</P>
      <P>The KMT candidates lost in the three counties largely due to internal divisions
resulting from candidate nominations and low voter turnout, according to
election observers. (Feb. 28, 2010)</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The results mark another failure for the KMT after it suffered a series of
setbacks in major government elections since it came to power in 2008 and a
fresh blow for KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung since he assumed his post
last December.</P>
      <P>After the by-elections, President Ma Ying-jeou, in his capacity as KMT chairman,
offered an apology in a press release over the defeat, but stressed the
importance of continuing with party reforms in the hope of winning back support
in future elections.</P>
      <P>At a post-election press conference, King did not concede defeat for the party
but apologized  to supporters  for the party's disappointing performance and
pledged continued reforms.</P>
      <P>King said the party would heed the warning of the low voter turnout but would
stand by the party's nomination strategy and strengthen integration of local
political forces, which both critics and supporters have blamed for its recent
losses.</P>
      <P>A new survey released Saturday just after the by-elections conducted by United
Daily News put Ma's approval rating at a record low of 29 percent since he took
office, down from 33 percent following  the party's dismal showing in local
elections last December.</P>
      <P>Some 65 percent of the respondents said the KMT lost the by-elections, compared
with only 3 percent who said the DPP was the loser.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the survey gave DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing- wen an approval
rating of 46 percent, up from 43 percent last December.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Su Chia-chyuan said Saturday during a post-election press
conference that the results are a demonstration of voters' trust in the
opposition party.</P>
      <P>Su said the results show that the KMT government's administrative direction, its
China-leaning policy and its policies that are hollowing out the national
coffers run counter to the people's will and desire.</P>
      <P>The three more seats will help the DPP continue to monitor the government's
economic policies and Ma's fiscal policies, Su added.</P>
      <P>The DPP secretary-general also said that Tsai was pleased with the results but
warned that the upcoming year-end mayoral polls in five special municipalities
will be the real test for the party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>suffered yet another humiliating defeat in Saturday's legislative by-elections,
winning only one out of four seats up for grabs.</P>
      <P>Some said a low voter turnout rate was the main reason for the KMT's defeat, but
the crux of the KMT's problems is more than that.</P>
      <P>The KMT lost three other legislative by-elections in January and Saturday's
defeat marked the KMT's fifth election setback since President Ma Ying-jeou
assumed office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Over the past more than one year, the administration of Ma -- who won a
landslide victory in the 2008 presidential race with a record high number of
7.65 million ballots -- has failed to deliver feedback to the electorate,
whether on policy or on rationale.</P>
      <P>The Ma administration has not only failed to provide the people with prospects
of a bright future, but also has been unable to win their hearts.</P>
      <P>Dropping turnouts underscores rising estrangement between the KMT and its
supporters. The KMT's string of setbacks also reflects the constituents'
disappointment.</P>
      <P>If the KMT cannot stop bleeding really soon, the approval ratings of Ma, who
doubles as KMT chairman, will continue to plummet, putting the nation's
political operations in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>Saturday's setback points to the truth that the KMT no longer has loyal
supporters, unlike the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which has
had its morale boosted after winning a string of victories in legislative by-
elections and other local elections.</P>
      <P>Ma's personal charisma is no longer a cure-all, and unless the party comes up
with policies that can really bring about change, the KMT will have little
chance of winning in the far more crucial five special municipality elections at
the end of the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Problematic industrial innovation statute</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>02/28/10  16:34:36
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government  has submitted a new version of the draft industrial innovation
statute in which the controversial Article 30 of the statute that would offer
extra-low 15 percent corporate income tax rate to international businesses, was
scrapped.</P>
      <P>The government is right to do this in response to mainstream public opinion. But
the fate of the article, which is widely regarded as unfair, is still uncertain,
since several big conglomerates are still lobbying for its enactment.</P>
      <P>With too much attention  put on the article,  some other unreasonable parts of
the bill are being ignored and might cause a lot of negative impact once they
are passed into law.</P>
      <P>For example, ASUSTeK Computer Inc. might be disqualified for the tax incentive
as a result of its ongoing move to separate its affiliates from the mother
company, even though it has made far greater contributions to the country than
many smaller businesses who might be entitled to the low tax treatment through
mergers.</P>
      <P>The move by large businesses to aggressively lobby for the passage of the low
tax treatment article is unjustifiable, as their contributions to the country
are not necessarily greater that those of their small- and medium-sized
counterparts.</P>
      <P>In seeking favorable treatment, the leading companies have also complained that
the tax burden is too heavy in Taiwan and that the lack of tax accords between
Taiwan and foreign countries also makes it difficult for them to sharpen their
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In fact, however, the small- and medium-sized businesses are facing the same
difficulties, and what the government should do is help all businesses
streamline operations and seek to strike tax cooperation pacts with foreign
countries rather than simply granting tax privileges to big companies.</P>
      <P>The government should consider enacting the statute only after taking into
account all the complicated factors involved and fully communicating with the
public. (Feb. 28, 2010)</P>

      <P>A five-in-one vaccine will be available free-of-charge for infants and children
from March 1, replacing the traditional three-in-one vaccine, the deputy head of
the Centers of Disease Control (CDC) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>From Monday, the free five-in-one vaccine which will give protection against
diphtheria,  tetanus,  pertussis,  polio and haemophilus influenza type B (Hib)
, will be included in regular vaccination  coverage  among children,  replacing
the existing three-in-one shots that cover only diphtheria, tetanus and
pertussis, according to CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yih.</P>
      <P>Under the new vaccination program, infants should receive a shot of five-in-one
vaccine at two months, four months, six months and 18 months, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In the past, parents had to pay between NT$800 and NT$1,200 per shot.</P>
      <P>If parents are worried that a single dose of five-in-one vaccine are not enough
to immunize their children who have not received a shot against Hib, they can
consult with a doctor to determine whether they should pay for a booster shot
out of their own pockets, Shih added.</P>

      <P>Beijing's insistence that bilateral trade relations across the Taiwan Strait
should be normalized before the two sides sign an economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) will be a major challenge to Taiwan's negotiators with China,
an economics official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Negotiators  in the second round of official  cross-strait negotiations on the
ECFA are expected to exchange "early harvest" lists for each side, naming items
that could be first to benefit from the agreement, but Beijing's trade
normalization requirement will put Taiwan's political wisdom and trade stance to
the test, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Since the 1st round of ECFA talks took place in Beijing Jan. 26, with
negotiators from the two sides exchanging views on matters of principle,
Taiwan's officials have known, however, that the "bottom line stances" of each
side -- China's requirement of an overall trade normalization and Taiwan's hope
of not opening its agricultural market further to Chinese imports -- remain
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Since it was admitted into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002, Taiwan
has gradually opened its domestic market to agricultural and industrial
products from China,  although imports of 865 agricultural products and 1,377
industrial items from China are still banned, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will unavoidably face pressure of lifting its ban on industrial products
from China, given the prerequisite that the ECFA should cover over 80 percent of
actual trade across the Taiwan Strait and that imports of the 865 agricultural
products will remain banned, the official forecast.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, chief of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under Taiwan's Ministry of
Economic Affairs, and Tang Wei, director of the Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Department under China's Ministry of Commerce, who chaired the first
round of ECFA talks in Beijing, will also chair the second round, which will
probably take place in Taipei in the second week of March.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's International Cooperation and Development Fund (Taiwan ICDF) is
cooperating with the U.S. charity Mercy Corps in hiring Haitian earthquake
survivors to clean up debris and rebuild their homes, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The employment replaces relief" program is designed to create jobs to allow
Haitian people displaced by the magnitude-7 earthquake that struck the Caribbean
ally Jan. 12 to rebuild their homes and livelihoods with self-help, the official
said.</P>
      <P>The program has been in practice since Feb. 1, with Mercy Corps responsible for
execution in four quake refugee settlement centers in the Haitian capital of
Port-au-Prince, the official said, adding that the project will last for six
months in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>Under the program, Mercy Corps employs quake victims to clean up the wreckage
and carry out temporary construction work, with each worker receiving US$5
(about NT$160) per day.</P>
      <P>"`The job replaces relief' program is different  from the conventional `give and
take' method of aid disbursement, " the official explained, adding that the
program will enable quake survivors  to receive  regular  incomes  in the  post-
disaster rehabilitation and reconstruction process and get back on their feet as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"We believe this style of assistance will allow aid recipients to maintain
dignity through self-help and regain peace of mind through stable jobs," the
official added.</P>
      <P>An estimated 1,400 Haitian earthquake survivors are expected to benefit from the
project, the official went on, adding that the project will cost over
US$116,000, with the money coming from the Humanitarian Cooperation Fund jointly
set up by the Taiwan ICDF and Mercy Corps.</P>
      <P>Since the catastrophic earthquake struck Haiti, the Taiwan ICDF has launched
many  emergency  aid programs  and post-disaster reconstruction projects in
cooperation with domestic and foreign charities and private groups in hopes of
helping the survivors rebuild their lives soon, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan ICDF is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' international aid arm.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
said Sunday that the latest defeat in the legislative by-elections the previous
day comes as a "severe warning" for the party.</P>
      <P>The KMT took only one of the four seats up for grabs in the by- elections held
in the counties of Chiayi, Hsinchu, Taoyuan and Hualien, with the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party winning the other three, including the
constituencies of Hsinchu and Taoyuan, which had previously been considered KMT
strongholds.</P>
      <P>The KMT has suffered four election defeats since Ma won a landslide victory in
the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma said while responding to press queries after presiding over a ceremony in the
southern Taiwanese city to mark the Feb. 28 Incident of 1947 that the defeat
highlights that the KMT has not done enough to win public support, and he
offered an apology to party supporters.</P>
      <P>"It is my firm belief that we should insist on reforms in order to win stronger
support. Only by doing so can we complete party integration and forge party
unity to win future elections," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Most local political analysts were of the opinion that with its latest defeat,
the KMT will face an uphill battle in the more crucial mayoral elections for the
five special municipalities to be held at the end of the year.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao will deliver a government work report at the opening
of the annual session of China's National People's Congress (NPC) March 5 to
outline the country's major policy guidelines and work agenda for the year.</P>
      <P>Economic structural adjustments will be China's priority tasks, as its economic
scale has grown to be on par with Japan's. A major overhaul and upgrading is
badly needed for China to sustain its spectacular growth recorded in the past
decade.</P>
      <P>As a result, economic exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait will
gain momentum and grow even faster and closer after the NPC annual session, as
there is much Taiwan can assist China in its economic restructuring.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Taiwan can help with China's high-tech industry development.
China has relied heavily on foreign provision of core technology in high-tech
production, but with its higher level of industrial know-how, Taiwan can
cooperate with China in developing new technologies or operating systems and
create new styles of high-tech industries with "cross-strait characteristics."</P>
      <P>On China's current endeavor to expand its domestic demand and private
consumption, Taiwanese companies,  while gearing up to penetrate the vast
Chinese market, can assist in upgrading the quality and functions of various
consumer products.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies can also help with the introduction of a modernized
marketing and distribution mechanism in China to enhance operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  Taiwan can assist in bridging regional gaps in development in
different parts of China. Taiwan-owned companies in coastal Chinese provinces
are presently troubled by serious labor shortages, indicating that investment in
coastal regions has become saturated. Taiwanese investors remain divided on
whether they should relocate to China's hinterland.</P>
      <P>If governments  on both sides of the strait can reach a cooperation deal, more
Taiwanese companies will be willing to relocate to inland Chinese provinces to
help with their development.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the NPC session is expected to pass decisions that will allow
for greater room for cross-strait cooperation.</P>
      <P>We hope both sides will speed up negotiation and signing of a proposed economic
cooperation  framework  agreement to lay the groundwork for tariff concessions,
market access and intellectual property  rights protection  that will help
facilitate  closer cross-strait cooperation. (Feb. 28, 2010)</P>

      <P>Addressing a ceremony held in Tainan City in southern Taiwan Sunday to
commemorate the 228 Incident of 1947, President Ma Ying-jeou said he hopes the
anti-government uprising and its aftermath will serve to help Taiwan to forge
ahead.</P>
      <P>Ma offered an apology to the victims of the 228 Incident, in which an anti-
government uprising was brutally suppressed by the military on behalf of the
Kuomintang (KMT) government, which held power at the time.</P>
      <P>He said the incident, which occurred 63 years ago when the then-KMT government
was corrupt and inept, wrought extreme pain on the people, with many losing
their lives or freedom.</P>
      <P>The president recalled that he heard about the 228 Incident as a high school
student but did not quite understand it. It was not until he went to the United
States for advanced studies and read historical archives that he gained a
clearer picture.</P>
      <P>Twenty-nine years ago, when he returned to Taiwan to work at the Presidential
Office, the first thing he discussed with his superiors on the first day of his
work was that the incident should be handled properly, Ma said.</P>
      <P>When he served as minister of justice, he went on, he helped enact a 228 victim
compensation statute and made the acquaintance of some of the victims' families.</P>
      <P>He admitted that no remorse or apology from the government can change the facts
or erase the torment of the victims and their families, but what is more
important is finding ways to prevent similar tragedies from occurring again and
making sure that the younger generations are given better education in democracy
and human rights.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the commemorative ceremony, Premier Wu Den-yih said that
although the government has established the 228 Memorial Foundation to
facilitate compensation for the families of the victims, urgent measures are
still required to uncover the truth and to clear the victims' names.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident remained a taboo subject in Taiwan until the early 1990s, when
the Executive Yuan commissioned a study to find out what really happened.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Executive Yuan designated Feb. 28 a national holiday and since
then, commemorative activities have been held around the island every year.</P>

      <P>A Toyota collided with a pillar in front of a convenience store in central
Taiwan Saturday as the driver was parking the car, local reports said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the driver, a 36-year-old woman, she was putting the car into
parking gear when her four-year-old Toyota Wish lurched forward and hit the
store in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>"The car had stopped. But when I was shifting gears, it lurched forward on its
own and the brakes did not work," she said.</P>
      <P>No casualties were reported, but the driver's mother, who was sitting in the
front passenger seat when the incident occurred was taken to a hospital
complaining of chest pains, the reports said.</P>
      <P>A Toyota technician who rushed to the scene to check the problem said there
would be an investigation into the case, which came after Toyota recalled some

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will expand a "Bridge-building Project "
by holding more cross-Taiwan Strait conferences this year with the aim of
bolstering industrial exchanges and cooperation between Taiwan and China, an
MOEA official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>For example, the MOEA hopes to reach an agreement with China on the
establishment  of  a  standard  e-book  format  for  the Chinese-language market
in the hope that substantive conclusions can be achieved when a cross-strait
conference on digital content is held in Taipei in August, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>After consulting with the Taiwan Affairs Office of China's State Council, the
MOEA will hold 17 meetings in Taiwan and China, including five more on the use
of cleaner production technologies in electronics  and  the  areas  of  digital
content  (including e-book/animation/games) ,  textiles and fibers,  biomedicine
and aviation maintenance, all of which will be held in Taipei, the official
added.</P>
      <P>The one on cleaner production has been added at the request of China, which has
an increasing demand for cleaner production services as there is an imminent
need there for recycling of electronic waste after the launch of a subsidy
program last year to boost electronic appliance sales in rural areas, according
to the official.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies, with their rich experience and strong technical abilities
in this area, can tap into the vast Chinese market through cross-strait
cooperation, the official went on.</P>
      <P>Another 11 cross-strait meetings will be held in China to build bridges  for
the  bicycle,  precision  machinery,  automobile, telecommunications,  green
energy, food,  wholesale and retail, e-commerce and logistics industries.</P>
      <P>Industries  on the two sides  have signed  50 cooperative memorandums of
understanding after holding 11 conferences in Taiwan last year, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>Some 4,200 industry representatives  from Taiwan and China attended the meetings
last year and 130 firms forged cooperative ties, according to MOEA statistics.</P>

      <P>Five female lawmakers performed the super popular Korean pop song "Nobody" at a
Lunar New Year gathering at the Legislative Yuan last week. Their imitation of
the singing and dancing of the South Korean pop group Wonder Girls might not
have been as vibrant and charming, but the performance brought joy and festivity
to the often rowdy legislature.</P>
      <P>"Nobody" is a Wonder Girls song released as a digital single in September 2008.
The song became popular in South Korea within hours, emerging as a top search
term and ranking No. 1 on digital music sites in that country.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, "Nobody" along with another Korean pop song "Sorry,  Sorry"
have transcended national borders and language barriers to become household
lyrics embraced by people of various different nationalities and generations in
many Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The two songs share several common features -- their melodies are beautiful and
the dances accompanying them are wonderful and sexy.</P>
      <P>They epitomize the Korean entertainment industry's ambitious business strategy
-- South Korean entertainers want to conquer the world market.</P>
      <P>Some popular Korean actors and actresses have already inspired a craze in Asia
for studying the Korean language through their performances in popular TV soap
operas.</P>
      <P>Now, a new generation of Korean pop singers are taking aim at the global music
scene. Their handlers have set their sights on the world market as evidenced in
the selection of pop group members and the composition of their songs.</P>
      <P>The music style is "Western" and the lyrics are in English. If you close your
eyes when listening to their signing, you might not be able to discern that the
signers are Koreans.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, they attach great importance to catering to the tastes of the
Chinese-speaking population. All young Korean pop group members are required to
study Chinese. They can communicate with Chinese fans in Mandarin and some of
them can sing Mandarin pop songs and even plan to release Chinese albums.</P>
      <P>Pop culture tends to carry strong features of "Glocalization" -- a blend of
globalization and localization -- that requires globalized thinking coupled with
localized action.</P>
      <P>The South Korean entertainment industry's ambitious strategy to tap into the
vast Chinese-language music market is worthy of attention. Just like their
success in the consumer electronics market, Korean pop music idols have also
reaped the rewards of their "glocalization" efforts. (Feb. 28, 2010)</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is conducting intensive soul-searching  over its
latest defeat in Saturday's legislative by- elections, party officials said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The ruling party suffered yet another setback -- its fourth since President Ma
Ying-jeou led the party to a comfortable victory in the 2008 presidential
election -- in the by-elections, winning only one of the four seats at stake,
while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took the other three.</P>
      <P>The KMT branches in the four constituencies -- the counties of Chiayi, Hsinchu,
Taoyuan and Hualien -- where the by-elections were held,  were asked by party
Secretary-General King Pu-tsung to immediately review the election results and
present reports to be discussed at the party's policy-making Central Standing
Committee weekly meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the latest setback will
serve as a lesson through which the party will work out a better nomination
mechanism for the more crucial mayoral elections for the five special
municipalities scheduled to take place at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>King said late the previous evening that his party will complete a new
nomination mechanism next week, by which it will recruit candidates for the
year-end elections by means of coordination among desired party members first.</P>
      <P>Should  coordination  fail to work in deciding  the party candidates, public
surveys will be adopted, King said.</P>
      <P>"By making the rules of the game clear as soon as possible, the party will be
able to better prepare for the upcoming elections, " the officials said.</P>
      <P>In related news, meanwhile, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen asked supporters Sunday
to give former Premier Su Tseng-chang more time to consider whether to run in
Taipei City in the December election.</P>
      <P>Su is widely considered the DPP's trump card in the year-end elections, whether
he runs in Taipei City or Xinbei City -- the name to be given to Taipei County
when it is upgraded to a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Tsai also refused to confirm or deny whether she will run in the municipality
elections or seek re-election as DPP head.</P>

      <P>The historic town of Lugang in the central county of Changhua is probably best-
known for its large number of temples.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-hsiung, curator of the Lugang township museum, who has conducted a
field study of temples in the town, said Sunday that the more-than 200 temples
dedicated to a wide variety of folk deities line the little town's streets and
alleys.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, 10 of the temples are dedicated to Matsu, the Chinese goddess
of the sea, and there are also 39 Wangye temples dedicated to various legendary
figures.</P>
      <P>All of the Lugang temples have their respective stories and devoted followers,
Lin said, adding that the large number of temples also reflects the town's
unique history.</P>
      <P>"Many of the icons worshipped in the local temples are centuries old and were
mostly brought to Taiwan by Chinese immigrants in the Qing Dynasty," he went on.</P>
      <P>Lugang translates as "deer harbor" and there was a time in the distant past,
presumably, when wild deer roamed the then-undeveloped plains around the town,
giving it its name, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Lugang was also one of Taiwan's three most important harbors during the Qing
Dynasty. In those days, it was one of the main ports through which early Chinese
immigrants entered Taiwan and trade was carried out between Taiwan and China's
Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Times have changed. Today there are no deer. But the evidence of Lugang's glory
days still remains, and visitors today find ample evidence of a lively history
and a thriving Taiwanese culture that is firmly rooted in the time-honored
traditions of early immigrants from Fujian.</P>
